      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, during the visit of President Daniel Ortega and a Nicaraguan delegation to this country, the possible establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries was raised; if any request was made to provide direct financial or technical aid to Nicaragua; if so, the Government's response to the <Col N="718" /> request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the EC has an official policy towards the present Nicaraguan Government; and, if so, if it is in line with the recently expressed support for that régime by the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>President Ortega was in Ireland on a working visit from 10 to 14 May.  The President had a meeting with me and was my guest at lunch on 11 May.  He was received by President Hillery on 12 May.</P>
      <P>During our meeting we discussed the political and economic situation in Nicaragua and in the central American region generally.  The President described Nicaragua's serious economic situation and the remedial measures his Government were taking.  The President referred to the positive role Ireland could play in the EC.  Direct bilateral financial or technical aid from Ireland was not requested.</P>
      <P>I expressed understanding for Nicaragua's and Central America's need for support and assistance.  I told President Ortega that while Ireland was not in a position to provide bilateral economic assistance to Nicaragua, we believed that the best way to assist the Central American States was through the EC and that we would continue to support proposals to that end within the European Community. I also told him that the Irish Government welcomed the progress that had been made towards internal reconciliation in Nicaragua and the positive steps towards peace in the region which the recent agreements constituted.  We also hoped that progress towards full democracy would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The well established policy towards Central America of the European Community is that the problems of the region can best be resolved through the efforts of the Central American countries themselves, supported by other countries with links to and interests in the region.  Those efforts, supported by the Community and its member states including Ireland, are <Col N="719" /> aimed at achieving lasting peace, genuine pluralist democracies, respect for international law, stability and social and economic progress in the region.  My discussions with President Ortega were in line with that approach.</P>
    <P>The possible establishment of formal diplomatic links between the two countries did not arise in the discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his positive response to President Ortega's visit.  Let me put it to him that in discussions with other representatives in this House President Ortega raised the question of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Nicaragua. Will the Taoiseach indicate what progress, if any, or what consideration, if any, has been given to establishing such relationships initially at least on a nonresidential basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, that issue was not raised by the President with me.  No particular action is contemplated at present in that regard.  Our problem with regard to all aspects of diplomatic representation is the scarcity of resources available, and we have to be very prudent and careful in undertaking any additional representational offices abroad, because unless we are in a position to fully service all such offices it is better not to establish them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I am calling Deputy Mary Flaherty who has a question tabled on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the issue of monitoring next year's elections raised with the Taoiseach?  In particular with regard to the anxiety that they be seen to be fair and free and that EC monitoring groups are involved?  Did he make any response to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that matter was <Col N="720" /> raised and there was a great deal of discussion about it.  President Ortega indicated that he and his Government were very anxious that there would be as many outside observers as possible.  He was anxious that there would be a delegation from the European Parliament and he invited us to send a deputation from here. He was at pains to point out that they would wish to have the observers present not just for the election itself but for the run up to the election.  He indicated that any observers who wished to come would be welcome from an early date.  As the Deputy knows, the elections are to be next February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if in his reply the Taoiseach has answered Question No. 5 which is to ask him what policy, if any, the EC has towards the Nicaraguan Government or regime and how that compares with our own attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, our attitude would be in line with the general approach of the EC.  The EC has a positive attitude.  It believes the Community has an obligation to help in the Central American situation.  It supports the agreement which has been entered into and is prepared to provide economic assistance.  Indeed, the Community view might be held to be that the key to the problem in the whole Central American region is economic progress and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Questions Nos. 1 and 4, I acknowledge the point made by the Taoiseach with regard to costs.  Would he not see the establishment of relationships on a nonresidential basis as one way round that problem?  Does he see any difficulties other than the question of cost preventing the establishment of these relationships? Would he not hold the view that establishing these relationships with Nicaragua would find a well of positive support in Ireland and would be an acknowledgement of the titanic struggle which the Nicaraguan people have had to bear in <Col N="721" /> the past ten years to maintain their independence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says about Nicaragua would apply to many other countries.  We are a small country with limited resources and we are circumscribed in what we can undertake in the area of establishing diplomatic relations.  At the moment we have only one embassy, one representational office, in the whole of South America. It is always difficult to decide between respective priorities.  There are a lot of countries, particularly small countries, in which we would like to have diplomatic representation but we have to be careful about opening the floodgates, as it were. If we maintain an attitude that we have not the resources to service many offices abroad and then break that in particular cases, it weakens our case.  We have to be reasonably circumspect in this regard. It is not that we would not wish to have diplomatic relations with this country or that; it is just that we have to curtail our activities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach's discussions with President Ortega include a detailed presentation by President Ortega as to how Nicaragua has complied with the conditions required of the peace process?  Is it not a fact that the Community, during the Irish Presidency, by including Nicaragua in their scheme of aid defined a clear Community policy towards Nicaragua and the Central American region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear Community policy towards Central America, a policy of general sympathy and support. We in Ireland fully support and participate in that policy.  The President in our discussions spoke at length about the general situation in Nicaragua and the developments there.  He dwelt particularly on the very serious economic difficulties, how they are responding to those difficulties and the action they are taking, particularly in regard to inflation. He also spoke at some length about the <Col N="722" /> progress they are making towards full democratic freedom in Nicaragua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree, notwithstanding the substantial steps which have been taken on the road to democratisation in Nicaragua, that there is still need for a great deal of progress?  Would he not also agree that it is a cause for concern that opposition to the present régime, whether it comes from the left, the centre or the right, frequently runs the risk of being labelled &ldquo;contra&rdquo; and being dealt with in a very harsh manner?  In view of this, would the Taoiseach agree that it would be essential that in any European Community programme for Nicaragua in particular &mdash; and this would have a general application in the Central American area &mdash; that the Community should have particular regard for conditions and objections they would set in relation to further progress towards democratisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They should check their facts.  It is pure propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the régimes should check their facts too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My discussions with the President and his replies were very open and frank in that regard.  I do not think the President would claim that democracy as we know it in this part of the world would reign supreme in Nicaragua at present, but he would also argue that they are making every effort to work towards it.  He would, I think, make the point that when a country is under threat it has to take actions to defend itself and its interests which might not be taken if a country were fully at peace with its neighbours and with the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking clarification from the Taoiseach on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not.  Countries have diplomatic relations with other countries, very often without due regard to the situation in those other countries or the régimes there.  We are not moralistic in our attitude but we must have our priorities and try to spread our scarce resources as beneficially as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has recently had any communication with the British Prime Minister regarding the setting up of a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland; if not, if he will take the initiative in bringing about such discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice and it would not be appropriate to say whether any such communication has or has not taken place.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on this matter was set out fully by me in my reply to questions on 9 March 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is well over a year ago.  Local elections tend to be highly political or nationalistic.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the results of last week's local elections show a tremendous movement of some voters for extreme parties and that now is the time to take the initiative to ensure that the goodwill <Col N="724" /> which has been expressed by a significant number of people in the North is built upon?  Today we are on the eve of the report on the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Surely this would be a time to express goodwill and for the Taoiseach to state that he is about to take the initiative to see that a power-sharing assembly is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that in regard to Northern Ireland the question of taking initiatives is always a matter of great sensitivity.  It is also very much a question of timing.  I am not sure that taking a particular initiative just now would be beneficial.  As the Deputy knows, my standing position is that I would welcome discussions and dialogue on as wide a basis as possible.  Perhaps that would be the first necessary preliminary to any initiatives.  There is not much point in taking initiatives unless there is some priority work done and unless one can be reasonably sure that there will be a positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that in the results of last week's elections there were signs of significant movement where the extremist vote on both sides is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree that the voting discloses that pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you welcome that pattern?</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's previous lengthy response on the question of devolution he took the view that he had no initiating role on Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Does the Taoiseach still hold that view as the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement moves towards completion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I would not put it as badly as the Deputy has.  I gave my view at some length on the whole issue of devolution, and I indicated that it is <Col N="725" /> primarily a matter for the British Government and the community in Northern Ireland.  That is more or less enshrined in the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I would not, and I do not think any of us should rule out any initiative or any action we could take from time to time that might appear to be helpful or beneficial in the situation.  It is very important to be able to decide at any time whether an initiative or an action or something that one would say would be detrimental or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach acknowledge that it is essential that talks take place between the democratic constitutional parties in Northern Ireland?  Would he take the opportunity he has today to indicate that he would welcome talks of that kind on the question of devolution as one of the options which must be seriously addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better at this stage if I confined myself to saying that I would welcome dialogue and discussion between all the representatives of the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland, whatever the subject matter might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the position he has set out on devolution and has expanded on here a little today is in fact that he has no position on the matter?  Will the Taoiseach not further agree that references to sensitivity and timing on every occasion this issue is discussed simply mean that he is looking for pure stasis on this and not for any movement?  Would he not agree also that a form of devolution of some kind is inevitably the next step in development in Northern Ireland, whatever the ultimate objective is?  Would the Taoiseach not finally agree, in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of the review of that agreement, and of the provisions of that agreement in relation to devolution, that he has a role, that he has a perfect right to have a role and that if everybody involved in the process keeps talking <Col N="726" /> about sensitivity and timing, as the Taoiseach does, nothing will ever change?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach had any indication from the moderate Unionists, that is the Official Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, that they would take part in talks if it were not feared that they would be undermined by the DUP?  Has the Taoiseach had any indication of that? Surely if we had that, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the detailed statement by the Tánaiste in the Dáil on 25 April, when he expressed the Government's deep concern at the profoundly disturbing implications of this affair and informed the House of the diplomatic contacts with the French and British Governments and the strong protest made to the South African Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that time, there have been a number of developments including the decision by the French Government to <Col N="727" /> expel three members of the South African Embassy in Paris, and the decision by the British Government to expel three members of the South African Embassy in London.</P>
    <P>The French authorities have charged four men with a number of offences in relation to this incident and we need to be conscious of this aspect in our comments here.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that in the intervening period an incident has occurred where a rocket believed to be sourced in South Africa was used in a sectarian attack in Northern Ireland and that arising out of that Séamus Mallon of the SDLP asked that further sanctions be instituted against South Africa?  I would like to ask the Minister of State if he shares the view that there is no active debate on change in South Africa, a subject which seems to have gone into the doldrums at EC level recently?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that that debate has been virtually dormant for up to 12 months and that arising out of this incident, which brings the problems of apartheid that much closer to home, there is a responsibility on us, unless we are to shrug our shoulders and say this sort of thing should just be accepted as a run of the mill affair, to raise or initiate discussion at EC level?

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the recent contacts which he has had with the UN or EC regarding the Namibian situation; and if he will press for the confinement of South African troops to base and the commencement of reduction and withdrawal in accordance with the Peace Plan, in view of the fact that the UN have announced that all SWAPO forces are in bases under UN supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have monitored developments in Namibia on a close and <Col N="729" /> continuing basis both through their contacts with the United Nations and partners among the Twelve.  Following the agreement reached in Cape Town at the end of April between South Africa, Angola and Cuba, the South African-led troops in Namibia returned to base on 13 May.  The United Nations Secretariat have been informed by the South African authorities that the agreed reduction of South African forces to 1,500 troops will be completed by 24 June next.  With the withdrawal of SWAPO forces to bases in Angola, it is hoped that tensions in the area will be reduced significantly thus enabling the independence process to continue smoothly and unhindered.  We remain firm in our commitment of unqualified support for the Secretary General, his special representative and the UNTAG force commander in their roles in bringing this about.</P>
    <P>The next phase of the independence process will see the intensification of the electoral campaign.  The initial arrangements for the electoral process are already under way.  The Administrator General published on 24 April 1989 a draft registration of voters proclamation. After an appropriate period for the receipt of comments and views the special representative and the Administrator General will establish a final text taking into account the views expressed.  The special represenatative must be satisfied that the final text is adequate to ensure free and fair elections and the United Nations is determined to ensure that this mandate is discharged in full.</P>
    <P>We will, of course, continue to monitor closely the implementation of the UN plan.  The Government have every confidence that the UN will implement the mandate given to the UN special representative in Resolution 435 of the Security Council to &ldquo;ensure the early independence of Namibia through free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations&rdquo;.  The Government will continue to support the UN in ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that unlike Nicaragua, there is not a campaign of disinformation against South Africa that is either CIA or Christian Democrat supported, in relation to the registration process, will the preparations include, for example an enfranchisement of 18 years and upwards as is consistent with usual UN procedures?  Have the investigations of the Department of Foreign Affairs to date elicited any assurance that the South African administration's interference in the process of preparation is one that is not a cause for concern? Will this House be represented at the monitoring process?</P>

      <P>The lights have gone out.  The implementation and supervision of the electoral process is a matter for the UN.  The special representative, assisted in particular by the civilian and police contingents of UNTAG, has a very strong mandate to supervise the conduct of the election.  Already the special representative is closely involved with the efforts to establish in a fair and impartial manner the register of electors and he has indicated his determination to see to it that the electoral process and campaign will respond to the criteria laid down in the UN plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the 1988 report of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD shows Ireland as joint second lowest with the US at 0.20 per cent of GNP for 1987.  Austria is the lowest at 0.17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware of the Comhlámh campaign. However, the very difficult budgetary situation which this Government have faced since they took office has required deep cuts in expenditure in <Col N="732" /> all areas and ODA could not have been exempted.  Deputies will be aware that the amount provided in the 1989 Estimates shows an increase of approximately £1 million over last year's figure.</P>
    <P>We are committed to progress towards the UN target as budgetary circumstances allow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the need to bring the nation's finances to order, will the Minister of State accept that it is possible to do so while establishing certain protected priorities?  Is the Minister aware that Denmark very successfully dealt with its budget deficit while managing to maintain, develop and move steadily toward honouring its full commitment to the UN target?  Does the Minister accept that the two are not mutually exclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is unable to accept that at the moment.  The Deputy and everybody in the House knows that our budgetary problems must take first priority.  It would be very hard to exempt ODA from something that is happening in every other Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the matters covered during his recent discussions in Dublin with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr. Mock; the Government's attitude to any possible application for membership of the EC by Austria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>While I understand that the Austrian government have taken a decision in principle to apply for membership of the European Community, no application has yet been made nor has the matter been discussed by the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>It is open to all democratic European countries which respect human rights to make application for membership of the European Community.  Austria clearly qualifies under these headings to make an application for membership.  After an application is made, set procedures have to be followed, involving an opinion by the Commission and the consent of parliament, before the Council gives a view. It would not be appropriate for the Government to express a view at this stage on possible future membership by Austria or any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the visit of the Austrian ViceChancellor and Foreign Minister, Dr. <Col N="734" /> Mock, to Ireland, the question of a possible Austrian application for membership of the European Community was discussed.  There was also an exchange of views on international affairs, in particular East-West relations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs also availed of the occasion to brief Dr. Mock on developments in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government's position regarding the policy of neutrality was restated by me in the Seanad on 12 April.  I refer Deputy Higgins to that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply and for the offer of a copy of his speech in the Seanad. However, my question referred not to an Austrian application but to consideration of an Austrian application.  Would the Minister not agree in view of the often stated position particularly from this side of the House that Ireland's position of neutrality has not been clearly articulated, that in the event of there being a new applicant, with a different approach towards neutrality, it might be useful, educationally and publicly for a clear policy statement to be published on the Irish position of positive neutrality, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate before an application has been lodged, for the Government to make any commitment one way or the other.  The Austrian Foreign Minister sought our Government's support for an application for EC membership.  We said that it was open to all democratic countries which respect human rights, and this quite obviously included Austria, to apply for membership. We assured him of our understanding and of our constructive approach in negotiations which would follow any Austrian application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

As he is well aware, a number of states, including ourselves, do not discuss all aspects of security, including defence or military matters.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if a submarine was recently intercepted in Irish waters without showing proper identification; if he will give details of the incident; the representations, if any, which have been made to the country concerned; the procedures which exist for monitoring the movement of submarines through Irish waters on the surface or underwater; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The incident to which I presume the Deputy refers took place on 14 April in Irish territorial waters of the north-west coast of Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of international law all vessels have a right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of another State provided that, in the case of submarines, they travel on the surface and fly their flags for identification.</P>
      <P>In the case in question on 14 April last, an Irish Naval vessel the <i>LE Aisling</i> in exercise of its normal surveillance activities observed a submarine travelling on the surface while in Irish territorial waters.  The submarine was not flying a flag.  The Irish patrol vessel approached the submarine and asked that a flag be hoisted.  The request was complied with. The vessel was a submarine of the United States Navy.</P>
      <P>The incident has been brought to the attention of the United States authorities who have been reminded of the obligation to fly a flag while in territorial waters.  In response, the United States authorities have assured the Government that this incident was exceptional and that it is normal practice for United States submarines to comply with this requirement of international law regarding innocent passage.</P>

He went on to say that his objective could be advanced through the achievement of progress in a number of areas, which would serve to marginalise the men of violence.  In reply to a further question about the presence of British troops in the North, the Tánaiste referred to their presence as a part of security and said this should be seen as a <i>pro tem</i> aspect at present.</P>

      <P>The bilateral aid programme comprises a number of different schemes under which projects are implemented in co-operation with other bodies e.g. the Governments of developing countries, non-governmental organisations (NGOS), multilateral organisations and Irish educational institutions.</P>
      <P>The NGO scheme operates on the basis of standard formal applications. This year to date 50 new applications for grants have been received of which 22 were approved.</P>
      <P>Annual programmes are also agreed with a number of multilateral organisations. For 1989 seven projects were agreed with the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank.  Of these five were in new areas and two were developments from previous projects. Likewise six were agreed with the International Trade Centre of which five were in new areas and one was from a previous area.  A new project study, Women in Development, was commenced in 1989 in co-operation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which follows up a previous study carried out in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> In relation to Government to Government co-operation, the largest element of the bilateral programme, suggestions are received from time to time from developing country Governments and various bodies and agencies for new projects. However, these need to be developed and discussed in detail with the developing country before a comprehensive project proposal can be prepared for funding approval.</P>
    <P>In 1989, one new project was submitted for formal approval and accepted. A further new project, approved at the end of last year, also commenced in 1989.</P>

      <P>The Turkish Government formally applied for membership of the European Community on 14 April 1987.  The Foreign Affairs Council, at its meeting on 27 April 1987, decided to refer the application to the Commission for its opinion in accordance with the terms of the EC Treaty.  The Commission is currently considering the matter.  In accordance with the Single European Act, the assent of the European Parliament is also required before the Council pronounces on the application.  It would not be appropriate for the Government to express an opinion about it at this stage.</P>

      <P>It is not for the Irish Government to comment on the possible accession of a country to the Community. The Turkish Government are fully aware of their international implications of reports of continuing human rights violations in their country.  They have taken steps to rebut some of the reports by Amnesty International.  However, we would like to encourage them to continue the improvements that have taken place in recent years.

Will the Government satisfy themselves in regard to human rights in Turkey before they support the application of that country for membership of the Community?  Will the Minister of State indicate the steps the Government have taken to satisfy themselves as to the progress in Turkey rather than accepting reports from officials of the Turkish Government?

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of <Col N="750" /> the continued growth in trade with South Africa, revealed in the recently published trade figures, the Government intend to take any measures to restrict trade with South Africa as long as apartheid remains in place; if, in particular, the Government will follow the example set by a number of international countries by imposing trade sanctions and in particular by banning imports of coal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of measures restricting trade with South Africa are already in force in Ireland and the other member states of the Twelve.  The Government's attitude to unilateral measures has been stated on several occasions and remains unchanged.  It continues to be the view of the Government that common action by the Twelve will always be more effective as a means of exerting pressure on South Africa to abolish apartheid than any unilateral ban Ireland might introduce. As well as this, a unilateral ban would be contrary to the common commercial policy of the EC.  Accordingly, there are no plans to take unilateral action to ban imports of coal from South Africa.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that, in accordance with Government policy, and the policies of former Governments, neither Government nor State agencies import coal supplies from that country.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that exports to South Africa from Ireland increased each year for the last four years to a point where they now amount to £58 million?  Is he aware also that, despite the restrictions introduced some years ago in regard to the importation of fruit and vegetables, they continue to arrive here through third countries?  Will the Minister of State indicate the type of investigations carried out by his Department about the way the restrictions are being circumvented and will he not agree that a step by Ireland as a neutral country to ban trade with South Africa could have a significant <Col N="751" /> impact on other members of the Community and, perhaps, get them to come down off the fence as far as South Africa is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's comments.  We made a symbolic gesture by banning fruit and vegetables. We were able to do that because prison labour was being used in agricultural production in South Africa.  In taking that step we hoped we would be able to influence our partners in the Community by our example.  However, that did not prove to be the case.  Our preference is for action to be taken by the Twelve.  I should like to tell the Deputy that I am aware that there has been a growth in exports to South Africa in recent years but I should like to reiterate that State agencies, in accordance with Government policy, do not promote trade with South Africa.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - HEDCO Funding.</Title>
    <P>23.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether HEDCO is at a severe disadvantage to other national third level development agencies as a result of the severe cutbacks it has suffered by the reduction and final elimination of its administrative grant and the total axing last year of its small projects allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that HEDCO is at a disadvantage relative to other national third level development agencies as a result of recent funding decisions.  For more general reasons it should still be well placed to compete for international development contracts.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, HEDCO has received an administration grant through the Department of Foreign Affairs since 1978.  In addition, it has received fees from our bilateral aid programme for the management of higher education projects in the Third World. In recent years it has won European Community development contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable that HEDCO, which is a promotional body acting on behalf of the universities and other third-level institutions which make up its membership, should have received assistance by way of an administration grant in its <Col N="753" /> early years but it would not be feasible to continue this type of funding from official sources on a permanent basis.  A review of HEDCO in 1985 recommended a change in the basis of funding.  This change, from outright administration grants to fees for project management, has been implemented gradually over the period since 1986 in order to allow HEDCO to adjust to the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>As the administration grant has been gradually phased out since 1986 the management fees paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs to HEDCO have increased &mdash; from £18,000 in 1986 to approximately £90,000 in 1989.  The so-called small projects scheme received £70,000 in 1987 but it had to be suspended in 1988 because of budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>The total funding, taking administration grants and management fees together, which HEDCO will receive from official sources in 1989 is an estimated £118,000.  This compares with total official funding of £135,000 in 1986. However, funding will be less in 1990 because the reductions which it has been necessary to make in our bilateral aid programme mean that there is not the same opportunity to earn managements fees from new projects.</P>
    <P>However, it is also open to HEDCO to compete for international development management contracts and it is, in my view, well placed to do so.  In this, it can draw on the long and distinguished tradition of Irish educators in Africa and elsewhere, the excellent quality of our third level institutions, and the high acceptability of Irish personnel in developing countries due to the absence of a colonial past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>May I let the Minister of State know that his view that HEDCO is not severly disadvantaged is certainly not shared by HEDCO, or indeed by most of the other agencies who work here or abroad who enjoy substantial State funding?  In replying the Minister referred to the review of HEDCO which had taken place in 1985.  Will he not admit to the House that, arising out of that <Col N="754" /> review, his Department gave two commitments to HEDCO &mdash; one, being that while there might be changes effected in their administration grant such would be done only after discussion, with full acknowledgment of their integral role in the bilateral aid programme and, second, that acknowledgement of the fact they were no longer to be funded by APSO, there would be a commitment to give them a small projects grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with a Member as nice as Deputy Flaherty.  However, of all the agencies under the aegis of my Department I have had more contact, discussion and consultation with HEDCO.  Therefore, for Deputy Flaherty to suggest that my Department reneged on their commitment is certainly bending the truth. Perhaps the Deputy would look at the agreement initiated in 1985 and talk to her colleague on her right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have conveyed their concern about the deaths of members of the Defence Forces while serving with the UN in the Middle East to a number of countries with interests and influence in the area, including the two mentioned by the Deputy in his question. Protests have been made by Ireland and by the United Nations to states whose actions or omissions demonstrably contribute to causing the death or injury of members of the Irish Defence Forces.  In a number of cases, including the most recent outrage resulting in the deaths of three Irish members of UNIFIL, responsibility has not yet been established. The investigation in that case is continuing.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will make a strong protest to the Government of any state shown to have links to the incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State comment on the suggestion made to me that as our Government protest was made directly to the Israeli Government it has now been suggested that that could have been done deliberately to create the impression that the Israelis were responsible and that those responsible could have connections with the two countries mentioned in my question, Syria and Iran?  Would the Minister of State like to comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will continue to make their position clear to the Israeli authorities, or indeed any other authorities who may be responsible for attacks on Irish UNIFIL troops, of the total unacceptability to us of their failure to comply with UN Security Council Resolutions which require them to withdraw from Southern Lebanon and of their continued support for the South Lebanese Army who were responsible for the death of Private McNeela and for the latest incident at Tibnin.  While waiting the outcome of the current United Nation's investigations, additional security measures are being taken to ensure the safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL.  As I have said, our Government will make strong <Col N="756" /> protests to any state whose actions or omissions demonstrably contribute to attacks on Irish troops.</P>

      <P>These amendments are being opposed because, if accepted, they would defeat part of the purpose of section 23, that is, the reform of the way in which the exchange rate is varied.  Since the passing of the Central Bank Act of 1971 we have joined the EMS.  The exchange rate must, on occasions, be capable of being varied quickly in this context &mdash; indeed, many times at weekends. This amendment would require both Houses to approve an exchange rate realignment before it could be effective. The question arises as to what happens when the House is not in session and there is a realignment of EMS currencies. In the modern financial world, the Minister must be able to vary the general exchange rate arrangements of the pound <Col N="816" /> quickly and flexibly.  The section as it stands provides for any change to be notified in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> so that there is no fear of the change being done in secret without the Dáil knowing of it.  There is nothing to prevent the matter being debated as a motion in either or both Houses should any Deputy or Senator wish to do so.  Indeed, the practice is to have such a debate when realignment takes place.</P>

      <P>I take it that a ministerial order can be issued without the House actually being in session.  This occurs frequently in connection with various Bills.  When there are long sessions, such as three and a half months, without the House being in session, it does create some difficulty.  We are totally opposed to these long vacations.  If the normal sessions of Parliament were held, there should not be any difficulty about this. The amendment we are proposing here would, we believe, conform to similar regulations issued by Ministers in various other Departments at different times. Perhaps our amendment No. 32 creates a difficulty but amendment No. 31 should not create any difficulty, In view of what the Minister has said, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 32 but do not think I would be justified in withdrawing amendment No. 31.  Under any other legislation, it would mean that the order would come into effect unless annulled by the House.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat that exchange rate realignments can occur at weekends.  This is not done by ministerial order.  It must be done by ministerial decision, subject to debate in the House afterwards.  Under the other amendment it would not even come into effect until a resolution approving the draft had been approved by the House.  This is just not practical in the modern world in which we live.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to give some more sensible reason for his rejection of amendment No. 31 that he has given, that it cannot be done when the House is not in session. I believe it can be done when the House is not in session.  It is done frequently under other legislation.  Perhaps it is a question of not giving the game away and that the Minister must do this in a certain way?  Under the normal legislative process, there should be no reason why the Minister could not do this by ministerial order.  I should like a better explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is in relation to the definition of the Irish pound with regard to the changes set out in section 43 of the Central Bank Act of 1971.  These, however, do not strictly accord with our obligations as a member of the European Monetary System or of the International Monetary Fund.  In the 1971 Act the value of the currency is set out in terms of gold.  This is now outdated.  The principal changes made under this heading are the dropping of the definition of a pound in terms of gold and the removal of the requirement that changes in the gold value must be made by order of the Government and laid before both Houses.  Section 43 of the Central Bank Act, 1971 is being repealed in the Schedule of the Bill.  Subsection (1) defines the unit of currency as the Irish pound. Section 43 of the 1971 Act provides for the issue of a pound in the form of a legal tender note.  The reference to a note is now deleted to facilitate the issue of a pound coin, which we are making arrangements to issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that there is an element of redesign in train.  Is it proposed to redesign the currency notes of larger denomination that are currently not available in modern form?  Would the Minister further indicate if it is proposed to retain the traditional design of the notes?  I fully accept that their size has got too bulky even for large businessmen's or farmers' pockets. The larger denomination notes are hard to handle but it strikes me that their design is more pleasant to the eye than some of the more recent excursions we have had from the Central Bank.  I would <Col N="820" /> ask the Minister to arrange if at all possible that there be a single coherent set of designs which keep to the traditional layout.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister as well to investigate the possibility of changing the weight of coins because the only coin that is sensibly weighted at present is the 20p coin, with the old half crown design of a horse, and this is reasonably easy to carry and use.  If we are to have a £1 coin or a £2 coin this should be borne in mind.  I find that I have huge pockets filled with colossal amounts of cupro-nickel.  The time has come for smaller and lighter coins.  Would the Minister agree that it now costs more than 2p to produce the 2p coin, in other words, that some coins cost more than their face value to produce?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it does cost more than 2p to produce a 2p coin.  I have responsibility for coinage design.  Some of the designs are being examined at present and the weight factor is one of the aspects being looked at.  The responsibility for notes rests with the Central Bank and I am not aware of any proposals to redesign notes.  However, I will certainly take up the points with them, the points the Deputy has raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The explanatory memorandum states that:</P>
      <P> Section 25 empowers the Minister by regulation to extend the requirements of Chapters I to IV to particular classes of financial business if necessary to protect the public, or to secure the orderly and proper regulation of financial markets. </P>
      <P>What were the circumstances or exigencies the Minister had in mind when he decided to introduce this catch-all provision? Is it simply a desire by the Minister to have residual powers which he could invoke at a later date or has he specific proposals he wants to put before the House by way of regulation rather than by way of primary legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to cater for future developments in the financial markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new section allows the Minister to make regulations, after consultation with other Ministers and the bank, to extend the bank's supervisory role where it is necessary to protect the public from loss or for the smooth running of the financial market.  The regulations can apply all or <Col N="824" /> part of the licensing and supervision standards applying to banks.  They can also apply, or not, as the case may be, Chapter 1 of this Bill &mdash; penalty provisions &mdash; Chapter 2 of the Bill &mdash; mainly the secrecy provisions of the bank and Chapter 4 &mdash; winding up provisions with any necessary adaptations or alterations.  The power should not be seen as giving the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to extend the Central Bank's role.  Rather it is an effort to ensure that if developments similar to the IFSC or options and futures exchanges arise in the future then the bank can become involved in supervising these new types of bodies without the need to enact new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is not the content of the section I am questioning &mdash; the Minister partly answered my question &mdash; but rather the procedure. If the Minister desires to put specific proposals before the House I would argue that the appropriate place to do so would be under the Central Bank Bill rather than taking on himself the power to subsequently regulate for eventualities which may already exist.  What I want to know is if the Minister has specific proposals to hand which he intends to implement, by regulation, subsequent to the passage of this Bill or is this section a catch-all section which enables him, rather than coming back into the House, to apply sections of the Bill to activities the general nature of which may be foreseen but the specifics of which are still unknown?</P>

We are being asked to accept, with very little information, that the Minister be given power by means of regulation to extend four chapters of this Bill to institutions and/or activities which are not within the remit of the Bill at present.  I <Col N="825" /> want to give notice that I will return to this on Report Stage and, after consideration, I may put down an amendment which would require the Minister to put the regulations before the House and ensure that a positive motion in the House would be required to pass the regulations rather than the negative approach, which is more normal with Bills, which allows 21 sitting days to elapse and, in the absence of a nullifying motion, the regulations become law.  I simply want to indicate that so that I will be procedurally on the right side of the line when it comes to Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33.</P>
      <P> In page 19, before section 26, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may, by regulations made after consultation with the Bank, require the holder of a licence to establish or join in establishing a scheme or schemes for the investigation of complaints against that holder or an associated company in relation to a prescribed matter of complaint.</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may make provision in relation to any one or more of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>  (a)  the establishment and administration of a scheme,</P>
      <P>(b)  the manner of appointment of an independent adjudicator to conduct investigations,</P>
      <P>(c)  the matters to be subject to investigation under the scheme,</P>
      <P>(d)  the grounds on which a complaint must be based,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  the powers of, and procedure <Col N="826" /> to be followed in the conduct of investigations by, the adjudicator,</P>
    <P>(f)  the circumstances in and the extent to which determinations are binding,</P>
    <P>(g)  the procedures for the making of complaints,</P>
    <P>(h)  the publication of the adjudicator's findings,</P>
    <P>(i)  the approval of the scheme by the Bank.  </P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to subsection (4), the reference of a complaint under a scheme established under this section shall not affect the rights of any person to have a dispute determined in any other manner provided by law.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where on a complaint under a scheme established under this section the parties concerned agree that a determination in accordance with the scheme shall be binding on them and the scheme provides for such an agreement, then the determination shall be binding on the parties.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section &lsquo;associated company&rsquo; means (where appropriate)&mdash;</P>
    <P>  (a) a holding company or a subsidiary company (within the meanings respectively given to them by section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963),</P>
    <P>(b)  a company which is a subsidiary of a body corporate, where the holder of the licence concerned is also a subsidiary of the body corporate, but neither is a subsidiary of the other.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>Section 92 of the Building Societies Bill empowers the Central Bank to require societies to join in a scheme for the investigation of complaints against building societies.  The bank suggested that a corresponding power should be included in the Central Bank Bill in relation to licensed banks.  The new section 26 provides accordingly.  The text is drawn largely from the Building Societies Bill.  It would be the intention to consult the <Col N="827" /> banks before regulations are made and to ensure that any scheme which came into effect was manageable and did not impose unnecessary administrative burdens on the banks.  Consultations would also be held with the Director of Consumer Affairs to avoid any conflict or dual responsibility of the banks to the Central Bank or under consumer legislation. I have written to the banking federation along these lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): In general terms this is acceptable.  In circumstances where we are moving a Building Societies Bill and a Central Bank Bill in tandem through the Houses of the Oireachtas, it looks as if there is some disharmony whereby a complaints procedure is required under one Bill and not under the other.  With the Building Societies Bill the concept of a building societies' ombudsman type of procedure is, I understand, what the Minister has in mind.  Could the Minister be more specific here?  This is quite a lengthy amendment which allows the Minister, by regulation, to set up any kind of a complaints procedure that he might conceive of or that his officials might suggest.  The remit being given under the regulations is also very wide and again I would ask the Minister to be more specific.</P>
      <P>This is a major amendment to the Bill. We are travelling into the dark and giving the Minister very wide latitude by means of regulations where, under normal Dáil procedures, we only have a veto.  I always worry about major powers being given to a Minister by means of regulation without the specifics being put on display on the floor of the House.  I would ask the Minister to be more specific first, on the parameters of this amendment as he sees it and, secondly, as to whether he has a precise proposal on the type of complaints procedure which he would envisage introducing under the regulatory powers of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The same power is being given in this case as was granted under the Building Societies Bill and it <Col N="828" /> will operate on the very same basis whereby the Central Bank will consult with the other banks in relation to setting up or joining a scheme for investigation or adjudication of complaints against a holder or an associated company of a holder.  It is important because some of the banking services such as Access, Visa and so on are provided by subsidiary companies of the banks.  For that reason it is important to consult the Director of Consumer Affairs also.  As the Deputy rightly said, it is parallel with the building societies legislation and we have been attempting to make it so.  The same powers will be given in both cases and the Central Bank will have the overall supervisory power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that effectively he is establishing a system of arbitration?  In some respects the powers he is giving seem to be deficient.  By Report Stage he should, in subsection (2), consider allowing himself, by regulation, to give to the adjudicator any power that is available to an arbitrator under the Arbitration Acts.  For instance, to require the production of records, to administer an oath in certain circumstances and matters like that which would be appropriate if a decision under subsection (4) of section 26 to be inserted is to be a binding decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the publication of the adjudicator's findings, is the Minister going to allow the adjudicators to be privileged?  They may find themselves in the position &mdash; as have a number of other bodies, including Oireachtas committees &mdash; that they cannot actually announce their views on matters they have dealt with on the basis that they do not appear to have privilege.  The same problem arises for witnesses who come before them.  I would like the Minister to consider first, giving adjudicators more of the powers that are given to arbitrators, which would be very simple &mdash; another sub-paragraph would give the Minister the right to confer on the adjudicator any such powers &mdash; and, secondly, giving some kind of legal immunity to an adjudicator who is about to make an adverse <Col N="829" /> criticism of somebody in his adjudication so that he should not be liable to be sued for it.  Similarly, somebody making a complaint to an adjudicator should be immune from suit in libel or in slander for things they wrote or said to the adjudicator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that we are setting up a type of arbitration system.  Subsection (2) specifies the items in particular which can be covered by the regulations and it is self-explanatory. Subsection (3) allows either party to have a dispute determined otherwise than in accordance with the scheme, that is by arbitration or by the courts.  Subsection (4) allows both parties to agree mutually to be bound by the decision of the scheme adjudicator.  Subsection (5) defines the associated company or holder of a licence to include a parent or subsidiary company because of the activities they carry on. Nowhere does it say that the adjudication results are to be privileged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister allows for the publication of a report and does not allow privilege for it, if it is adverse or critical of some person or intends to detract from their reputation, it leaves the person publishing the report open to a suit for defamation.  If a determination is to be binding on parties, what kind of determination are we talking about? Looking at subsection (2) (a), there seems to be no power to order any remedy.  I do not know how you could have a binding adjudication if somebody cannot be told to do something to somebody else, to change a course of behaviour, give some money, make restitution or whatever.  It seems vague if you have a binding determination but no power to order anybody to do anything.  What kind of determination has the Minister in mind?  Subsection (4) provides: &ldquo;Where on a complaint under a scheme established under this section the parties concerned agree that a determination in accordance with the scheme shall be binding on them...&rdquo;  That means they have to obey it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but where in subsection (2) (a) to (i) is there any power to tell them to do anything?  There is nothing.  The adjudicator does not look at it and make comments on it or whatever. He does not seem to have power to tell anybody to do anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): While the Minister is reflecting on that point I want to come back to another aspect. The amendment allows the Minister by regulation, after consultation with the Central Bank, to require the holder of a licence to establish or join in establishing a scheme or schemes for investigation of complaints against that holder or an associated company.  It is a scheme or schemes.  It is very unclear from the amendment whether the Minister has a precise proposal in mind.  For example, is he thinking of an Ombudsman-type procedure or a complaints procedure modelled on, say, the Garda Complaints Act which went through this House?  If the adjudication is to be binding and if an adjudication is involved, would it not be prudent of the Minister to allow forsome kind of appeal to the courts, or is the suggestion that the appeal to the courts would exist anyway?</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to have one complaints procedure institution, person or way of proceeding for the building societies and an alternative one for the banks, or will one procedure and adjudication system apply to all licence holders under the scheme?  The amendment the Minister is moving here, taken together with this section and the Building Societies Bill, would allow for a procedure for each and every licence holder in effect rather than one general complaints procedure for all the licence holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to have a set regulatory scheme backed up by a section rather than having it self-regulated. If you start off with banks agreeing <Col N="831" /> to be bound mutually, the two parties to it being bound mutually by it, the Central Bank will impose the agreement whatever the arbitration final decision is, and their action is backed up by legislation. Deputy Noonan is asking if there is a scheme or schemes.  It could be a scheme for a bank and a different scheme for a building society or whatever.  We are keeping it as simple and non-statutory as possible, self-regulation as much as possible and not getting into the throes of arbitration.  We are trying to align the two as closely as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

Effectively he is saying, &ldquo;Give me the power.  I have not made up my mind yet what I want and I will let you know by means of regulation at some indefinite time in the future what we have in mind&rdquo;.  That is not the way to legislate.</P>

This amendment has been brought in now which involves a complaints procedure for the bank or banks administered by the Minister and the Central Bank.  Without putting a tooth in it, I do not think the Minister has a notion what kind of complaints procedure he wants to bring in.

They are all getting into each other's business.  You do not want a position where you do not have parallel regulations to deal with a situation.  Building societies will be banks and banks will be building societies.  The whole purpose is to line them up parallel.  That has been done in the Building Societies Bill, and what we are doing here is lining it up parallel.  I will look at what the Deputy is talking about for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): This legislation and the building societies legislation has been promised for two years.  The commitment was that both would move in tandem through the Oireachtas and that because the intent was to make changes and at the same time establish a level playing pitch between the various institutions, provisions, especially of a regulatory or binding nature, in one piece of legislation would be mirrored in the other.  We had a complaints procedure in the Building Societies Bill but not in the Central Bank Bill.  Why has the Minister introduced this amendment at such a late stage?  He has said he wants a level playing pitch. Has his thought process proceeded and does he have a general picture of the type of complaints procedure he wants for the banks or is he simply taking power unto himself to do quietly what he is not doing publicly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly merit in the Minister's amendment but if everything is to be above-board, with nothing secretive about it, the Minister should give a commitment to come back on Report Stage <Col N="835" /> and move that regulations under this section will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will require a motion of affirmation before they become law, rather than the regulations being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the onus being on the Opposition, who do not control business in the House, to bring in a motion of veto.  The Taoiseach is the person who orders all business and if he does not want a veto motion to come in there is not much opportunity for the Opposition to introduce it.</P>

I am not a clairvoyant and I cannot anticipate the specific type of complaint that might arise.  I am doing no more than providing in general terms for regulations, in the same manner as practically all regulations are provided for.  I will not give a commitment to bring in such an affirmative amendment.  I will look at it on Report Stage and see if I can find any more detail about the type of possible complaints.  It would only be possible to anticipate one or two types.  I have no intention of trying to anticipate all types of complaint.

      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Bank may exempt a holder of a licence from the obligation to notify the Bank under this section in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any charge which has been individually negotiated bona fide with the holder by a customer, or by or on behalf of a group of customers, of the holder, or</P>
      <P>(b) a class of term or condition applying to a service provided by the holder, if the Bank is of the opinion that it is not necessary for it to be so notified in order to decide whether or not to issue a direction under subsection (3) in respect of the service.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 39 inserts a new subsection (7) and allows the bank to exempt certain charges from having to be notified under this section, where the charges in question are negotiated bona fide between the commercial bank and individual customers or groups of customers. These charges cover, for example, charges negotiated by individual corporate clients or by professional associations in respect of services supplied to their members.  In the case of freely negotiated <Col N="840" /> charges supervision by the Central Bank is not required.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (7) also permits the bank to relieve the banks from having to notify any terms or conditions on which the services are provided where the Central Bank considers that it does not need to be notified of these terms or conditions in order to decide whether to approve a particular charge.  What we have in mind here is that the Central Bank will require to know only the main terms and conditions on which a service is provided and not every subsidiary or related terms such as might be contained, for example, in a loan or mortgage agreement.  The Irish Bankers' Federation were concerned that the section as worded would place an unnecessary burden on banks in providing details of every term or condition of business, whether relevant or not, and of every change in such terms or conditions. I consider this point reasonable, and the new subsection (7) meets this concern.</P>

It effectly allows a ministerial appeal to be reviewed or a decision given by a Minister in relation to banking practices to be reviewed by this House if it is considered <Col N="844" /> necessary.

The Minister would then have to vary, confirm or discharge the directions, and if he varied or confirmed the directions, make an order accordingly and lay it before the Oireachtas.  I have to say this is an unusual procedure.  It requires the Minister to reconsider the decision of another party.  The procedure is also very bureaucratic in my view.  The Minister has no first-hand knowledge of bank charges.  Only the Central Bank is in a position to act as supervisor and to come to the appropriate decision.  Involving the Minister in the manner proposed would require the Department of Finance to make inquiries and get into areas in the supervision of bank charges and I would not agree that should be welcomed.  The proposed requirement that the Minister make an order for individual decisions on bank charges seems excessive.  We must trust the Central Bank in this area.  There is nothing to be gained from the Deputy's proposal.  It would not be wise to get the Minister and the Department of Finance into areas where they have no real expert knowledge.

      <P>(a)  to refrain from imposing or changing a charge, term or condition without the prior approval of the Bank,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to paragraph (b) which has the publication requirement but will the Minister say if he believes that it is correct that the Central Bank, <Col N="845" /> on a matter of policy &mdash; for instance, the amount of money that might be charged for a pass card or an access card or something like that &mdash; should determine these matters? This is fundamentally a matter of policy rather than a matter of high principle.</P>
    <P>There should be some appeal at a political level with regard to a decision of the Central Bank.  If a bank were to impose a charge of £20 per annum on pass cards, even though the Minister thought that undesirable as he was proposing to put excise duty on pass cards, it seems that the Central Bank can decide how to resolve that issue and in doing that will be making a political decision.  If it is a political decision, it should be capable of being appealed to a politician who is responsible to this House in respect of whatever determination he makes.</P>
    <P>This is not simply a matter of regulating what can and cannot happen.  It is telling banks that they cannot tier their charges in particular ways, it is telling them what they can and cannot charge for certain categories of services and it is doing that at the instance of the Central Bank, and on the face of it, doing so in a totally unaccountable way.  The Minister and his predecessor have been at pains to indicate that they would not interfere and that they were not responsible to this House for the activities of the Central Bank in relation to these matters.  There is a lot to be said for giving the Minister political responsibility for political decisions and for requiring him to justify those decisions to this House.  If a charge for a pass card is doubled, somebody should be obliged to account to this House for a decision of that kind.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (3) (a) allows the Central Bank to direct the holder of a licence to refrain from imposing a charge, term or condition without the prior approval of the Central Bank but as drafted it seems to suggest that the only requirement is that they can direct somebody not to impose or change a charge without their prior approval.  It does not seem to give them a right to refuse permission to do so in any circumstances.  It seems that the <Col N="846" /> Central Bank's veto is a sort of consultative veto in that they must be consulted on the matter.  If the Minister means that the Central Bank may in fact prohibit or veto any charge made by a licensed bank, I would ask him to consider whether in those circumstances it would be appropriate to give the Central Bank the right of appeal to the Minister who would be accountable to this House for the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is happening in practice, but it is being provided for now on a statutory basis.  The Central Bank in exercising their powers under this section must have regard to the promotion of fair competition.  What happens is that if a bank decides on a particular thing, they notify the Central Bank who are in a better position than I to judge whether the charges are fair, and if the Central Bank feel that the charges are not fair they must do something about it.  The Central Bank are the people with expertise in this area and not the Minister, and this is the way I propose to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Minister for accepting the three amendments and for introducing in his own form of words amendments I had put down.  They have improved the section substantially and have met some of the fears expressed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will comment briefly on other aspects of the section with a view to putting down amendments on Report Stage when I have reflected on the overall effect of the Minister's amendments.  There is a body of opinion which suggests that another subsection should be added to section 26 proposing that the provisions of the section should apply to building societies and any other institutions raising funds from the public by way of deposit or otherwise.  Will the Minister say if such <Col N="847" /> an amendment would be acceptable on Report Stage, or if he will introduce one himself? If such an amendment would not be acceptable I would like the Minister to tell me why not.</P>
    <P>The existing non-statutory controls which have been in place for a number of years are effective and I have no objection to the introduction of statutory controls, but they should be uniform between all the institutions.  If there is any doubt about the uniformity of their application, the Minister should take on board an amendment along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>An issue which has been raised by the Irish Bankers' Federation with the Minister's officials, and I presume with the Minister, is who will supervise the activities of other institutions taking money on deposit if such an amendment is not made to the Bill? How can we supervise the people either in the general area of banking or on the fringes of the banking world, who advertise for deposits but who would not necessarily be licence holders within the provisions of this Bill? We want fair competition between holders of licences and nonholders of licences.  The whole thrust of this section is to control licence holders, but it seems to leave others involved in taking money on deposit outside of the remit of the section.  I wonder is this wise.  Will the Minister comment?</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted the idea that interest rates were not charges, and were not intended to be, in the original text of the Bill, and has taken on board several other suggested amendments.  I would like also to hear the Minister's views on how he sees competition.  Does he envisage a situation where the Central Bank will operate the interest arrangements which have been in place since 1984? Does he envisage a situation where, when the playing pitch is level and other institutions are involved in a whole range of banking activities, and when we are moving away rapidly from a situation where the Associated Banks dominated the whole area of banking activity, there will be free competition at the level of <Col N="848" /> interest rates as well as at the level of service provided? Does he envisage the Central Bank, through the mechanisms of this Bill, establishing price control in so far as price control relates to interest rates? I would like the Minister to comment because it seems that if we level the playing pitch and allow many new people to get involved in what traditionally was banking activity, once the regulatory mechanism is in place, the freer the competition the better from the point of view of the consumer.  If there is to be real competition in banking it would have to be in the area of interest rates rather than anywhere else.  If the banks and the building societies are to be subject to a price control mechanism, arising out of the matrix of interest introduced in 1984, where would be the scope for competition?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to inform me how he would see price control, implicit in the Bill, operating? Would this power be vested totally in the Central Bank or would the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank, exercise control over interest rates?</P>

      <P>I hope I will cover all the points the Deputy has raised.  On the question of whether I should insert an amendment, I do not think there is any need for one as the matter is already covered by the Building Societies Bill but we can take another look at this question on Report Stage.  On the question of who would look after those on the fringe, the Registrar of Friendly Societies looks after the credit unions.  The State banks are, naturally, looked after by ourselves, the Department of Finance.  The Trustee Savings Bank legislation will be published this week.  Under that legislation they will be brought under the supervision of the Central Bank.  The credit unions will also be brought under the supervision of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I know they can charge less if they wish but on the face of it that suggests there can be competition at lower interest levels.  To enable the lending institutions to provide lower interest rates to low risk categories they have to be in a position to increase the maxima.  I do not think it is as simple as the Minister suggests.  I do not think they are free to compete as of now as they are tied to a very rigid band and the differentials are fairly specific.  I would like the Minister to look at the possibility of loosening them up.</P>

      <P>They do compete in certain lines of business.  I am not saying they compete across every line of business.  I am aware of cases where they do.  Perhaps this is because the risk is low.  They will compete in such cases.  I accept what the Deputy has said in that they do not compete right across the board, but there is an element of competition.  In recent times we have seen competition develop between the various lending institutions in the mortgage market.  At one time a person got two and a half times their salary when applying for a loan for a house.  With the banks and the building societies now competing with each other some are prepared to give a person three times his salary, other three and a half times.  Some are offering different kinds of market attractions in order to attract more customers.  Therefore, there is a fair bit of competition in that area of the market.</P>

Another group has suggested that there should be a requirement on licence holders to publish and advertise by way of leaflet, brochure or otherwise where they operate, the real range of interests and conditions they apply.  In other words there should be an information provision on all licence holders which would be very welcome to many consumers as some of the advertising is difficult to understand at times.  An institution took a full page advertisement publicising their deposit interest rate but it really applied to a two year period. When somebody looks at an advertisement of that kind they normally assume the rate to be a per annum basis. Of course that fact was mentioned in the small print but that is not enough.  Is the Minister aware of the concern expressed publicly and privately by the Consumers' Association of Ireland that the licence holder would be required to provide information to the consumer in an easily accessible way, that is providing the information without any intent to mislead or any possibility of the consumer being misled, especially in regard to the conditions of a loan and, in particular, the interest that would be charged on a loan of a certain category or on a deposit?</P>

      <P> In page 27, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Any person aggrieved by a revocation or proposed revocation may apply to the Court for an order reversing or prohibiting such revocation, as the case may be, on the grounds:</P>
      <P> (a)  that the revocation is not in conformity with the provisions of this section, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that the revocation is unreasonableness, (the proof of such unreasonableness shall be upon the applicant).'.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in relation to the right of the Central Bank to make a revocation of a licence.  The problem I have in relation to the revocation of a licence is that the grounds on which a person aggrieved by a revocation can act or do anything seem to be unsatisfactory.  It would be desirable that a person who was aggrieved by a revocation &mdash; or a proposed revocation &mdash; could apply to the High Court for an order reversing or prohibiting such revocation as the case may be, on the grounds either that the revocation was not in conformity with the provisions of the section, in other words, that there was something technically wrong, that it had not been conformed with properly or, secondly, that the revocation was unreasonable.  That, effectively, allows the holder of the licence to <Col N="856" /> have an appeal on the merits.  Appreciating that the Central Bank and the regulatory agency should not undertake the onus of proof because that would mean every revocation would degenerate into a long, protracted High Court proceeding, I have put in the safeguard that the proof of such unreasonableness should rest with the applicant.  If, on the other hand, that means an applicant could show to the satisfaction of the High Court that what was being done was unreasonable on the face of it, he would have the right to have the revocation reversed or prohibited before it occured. Revocation of a licence is a very far-reaching thing to do in relation to a licensed bank and to allow no appellate procedure against the determination by the Central Bank that there should be a revocation is to give the bank very draconian powers indeed.  On the other hand, to allow an open-ended right of appeal on every merit to every malefactor would probably be equally unreasonable. It seems to me that if somebody can establish to the court's satisfaction that the Bank is acting unreasonably that person should have a remedy made available to him or her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment could undermine the Central Bank as the supervisory authority and could be used to frustrate it where it was necessary to act with speed to protect depositors by revoking a bank's licence.  Section 32 deals with the Central Bank's powers to revoke a licence and the procedure to be followed by and large is based on the existing system in the 1971 Act.  It has stood the test of time and we have not encountered any problems in that regard. A principal tenet of the section is that the Central Bank should be able to revoke a licence on certain specific, clearly defined grounds.  The suggested amendment would allow an appeal to the court.  Since, in some of the cases specified as grounds for revocation, for example, conviction of an offence under this Act, it may be necessary for the Central Bank to act quickly to protect depositors, a specific provision to allow an appeal to the court <Col N="857" /> could be used to frustrate the Central Bank.  The section does allow for representations to the Minister and I feel that is a reasonable and sufficient safeguard for the licence holder.  My main concern is to enable the Central Bank to act swiftly to protect depositors.  I do not think that anything that might frustrate that would be in the interests of depositors. I should like to ask the Deputy to think again about his amendment in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>The intention in the amendment is to put an obligation on the Central Bank to act in the interests of depositors of the licence holder.  The intention of the section is that the Central Bank in carrying out a statutory function would be acting in the interests of everybody but I want a more precise direction from the House to it that its obligations would be, in the circumstances envisaged in section 34, to protect the interests of depositors of the licence holder.</P>

      <P>The same thought occurred to me.  The proviso I have put down is that no requirement shall be made under this subsection unless such requirement arises out of a concern by the Central Bank which relates directly to the interest of depositors or potential depositors of the licence holder in question. In other words, the power created in relation to records of the Central Bank should be one which is limited in its application and it should not be allowed to use this wide power as it pleases.  The power should be directed towards a particular end and limited to that end.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points being put forward in both amendments, but I am not sure if they add very much to the section.  The Central Bank's statutory function referred to in the section is, at base, the protection of depositors. However, to insert the particular words suggested might give grounds to a licence holder who does not want to supply information to require the Central Bank to justify the demand for it.  I do not think we should place such an obstacle in the way of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Both these amendments stem, I think, from concerns expressed by the Irish Bankers' Federation.  Their problem, however, related more to the powers of investigation in relation to associated companies rather than to a licence holder itself.  I think there should be no question but that a licence holder who is entrusted by the public with its deposits should have its books completely open to inspection by the Central Bank.  In the case of associated companies, my officials drew the Irish Bankers' Federation's attention to subsection 3 (c) on page 29, which limits the inspection of books and so on to cases where this is materially relevant to the proper appraisal of the affairs of the licence holder and the Irish Bankers' Federation seem happy with this.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="859" />  In page 28, line 27, to delete &ldquo;as he may consider necessary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as he may reasonably require&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The amendment seeks merely to put in an objective standard and the Irish Bankers' Federation take the view that the clause as at present drafted is too wide, that there should be an objective test as to the powers which would be available in the circumstances to the person requiring production of the books.  They suggest that it should be tied down to what he, objectively, reasonably requires rather than what he, subjectively, considers necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the section is to allow the Central Bank access to any documents it considers necessary in order to carry out investigations.  The requirement represents a restriction on that capacity.  We wish to give the Central Bank as much power as possible to investigate since the links in financial deals may be many and varied.  It must be allowed to trace these deals through all companies concerned.</P>
      <P>Again, the Irish Bankers' Federation felt that an individual inspector might demand unreasonable information.  Bank inspections are carried out in teams of staff under the guidance of a senior official of the Central Bank.  I think we can trust the rectitude and expertise of such officials and their teams in seeking out relevant information.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy not to press this amendment.  It would put a restriction on their capacity to carry out full investigations. They should have access to all information they require, especially in regard to complex financial dealings.  I am not inclined to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In this amendment I am seeking to put a time limit on the period for retention of records.  The Irish Bankers' Federation have suggested that a maximum retention period should be inserted and that a period of six years would appear appropriate. That seems reasonable to me.

      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment seeks to provide that books, accounts and records required by this section to be kept by licence holders should be kept only for six years.  The section as it stands leaves it open to the Central Bank to specify the length of time.  Six years is the norm and the Central Bank would accept that this is so. However, there may be cases where specific records are required to be kept longer than this and it would like the freedom to have the option, in exceptional circumstances, of so requiring.  The amendment is opposed but the Deputy can be assured that the Central Bank will not seek to impose onerous conditions on <Col N="861" /> the maintenance of clerical records.  For instance, it may not be necessary to keep records of board meetings and minutes any longer than the period specified but I do not think it is too onerous a task to keep them for the specified period.</P>

    <P>Section 34 amends section 17 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, by strengthening the provisions in relation to the keeping of books, documents and records by banks and their inspection by the Central Bank or an authorised officer of the Central Bank.  The Irish Bankers' Federation have requested that two particular safeguards be inserted into section 17 to preserve the property rights of banks over any books or records produced during an inspection and to protect privileged communications from legal advisers.  The particular provisions suggested by the IBF are the same as those in section 41 of the Building Societies Bill.  I see no objection to making a similar provision <Col N="862" /> in the Central Bank Bill and the two amendments I am putting forward are intended to achieve this effect.

    <P>Section 35 amends section 18 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, to allow the Central Bank to seek information from a wide range of financial institutions.  Among those listed are persons carrying on the business of issuing, holding or otherwise participating in any market in financial instruments to which Chapter VIII of the Bill refers, that is, financial futures and options exchanges.  The amendment I am now proposing broadens this category to participating in any market in financial instruments, and not only financial futures and options exchanges.  The Central Bank have asked for this extension <Col N="864" /> to cater for the development of newer and more sophisticated markets in financial instruments and the need for the Central Bank, as part of their general banking and monetary responsibilities, to monitor such developments.  I believe this is a reasonable request and it is important that we draft the Bill so as to give the Central Bank flexible powers to be able to adapt their supervision to the fast pace of financial change.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister, in relation to the power of appeal or the power to set aside a direction under subsection (3), the grounds on which it is expected that the court would act? It seems remarkable that the court could simply set aside a direction.  Will it set a direction aside on the basis that it was wrongly given or unnecessary?  Will the court be at liberty to decide it on any ground, or will it be on legal error or procedural non-conformity?  I am interested about that power because it amuses me that in some other areas the power of the court is restricted to a point of law.  The Minister said that it would undermine the authority of the Central Bank as a regulatory agency in some other areas, but in this area the court will be given a wide and unlimited power to set aside any direction it likes and to substitute its own opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the philosophy behind the Minister's objections to my amendments earlier <Col N="865" /> were that he should not be allowed interfere with the Central Bank's regulatory authority.  There are other provisions in this Bill which allow the courts to act only on a point of law, and yet here there is an open-ended power being given to the courts to set aside a direction on any grounds where it appears to the court that it ought to do so.  It is very rare to give a High Court a jurisdiction without any indication whether it is a procedural jurisdiction, a jurisdiction on merits or a jurisdiction which is to be exercised on the basis of expert evidence.  Will a High Court judge be able to bring in witnesses and decide on balance, having heard all the evidence from one side or the other, that the direction in question should be set aside?  This seems to be an extraordinarily wide provision.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Section 23 of the Consumer <Col N="866" /> Information Act, 1978, is hereby reenacted.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The point at issue here is that while we all agree there should be a regulatory authority and approve of the fact that the regulatory authority are now being given the statutory powers to regulate, I believe there should be only one regulator.  What I am trying to do in this amendment is to give the Central Bank the powers to supervise bank advertising.  Section 23 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, exempted the banks from certain provisions.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the amendment I have tabled is inadequate to convey my intent.  I wanted to put down a marker and give the Minister an opportunity to reply to the issue I raised previously, which is that if we are regulating by statute, let us have one regulator; let us vest all the power in the Central Bank and in the Minister for Finance rather than running around different Departments subsequently trying to ascertain who is the regulator of one given activity.</P>
    <P>I concede the amendment I have tabled is totally inadequate in terms of portraying my intent but I should like to hear the Minister's views on my intent.</P>

It is the policy of the Government to abolish the special exemptions of banks and the Oireachtas so accepted in enacting the 1988 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment is surprising since it is understood that his predecessors in Kildare Street also supported the repeal of the section 23 exemption.  The provisions of section 22 of the Central Bank Act 1971, referred to in this section, give the Central Bank a role in controlling banks' advertising from a prudential point of view, that is, to prohibit unacceptable advertising for deposits, etc.  This is a legitimate concern of the Central Bank and does not impinge of any functions which the Consumer <Col N="867" /> Information Act gives the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If the Deputy is afraid there will be an overlap or conflict of interests, I believe that can be taken care of by mutual co-operation between the bank and the director.</P>

      <P>This amendment inserts a new section in the Bill to amend section 23 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Section 23 of the 1971 Act permits the Central Bank to specify particular ratios to be observed by licensed banks between their assets and liabilities.  A doubt has arisen as to whether &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; in the section include &ldquo;contingent liabilities&rdquo;.  This amendment clarifies the position by inserting a new definition to this effect in section 23 (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of &ldquo;contingent liabilities&rdquo; in question cover guarantees by banks and certain types of new interest rate and exchange rate hedging instruments provided by banks &mdash; SWAPs, FRAs, etc. &mdash; where the liability of the banks is contingent on the occurrence of certain <Col N="869" /> events or changes in interest or exchange rates.  Since these items have become more and more a feature of banks' activities it is important that there be no doubt that the Central Bank's supervisory powers extend to those instruments in all cases.</P>

Generally speaking &mdash; if we might introduce clichés into the debate &mdash; justice should not merely be done but be seen to be done.  The practice of holding <i>in camera</i> hearings runs counter to that age-old principle.  I should like the Minister to expand on the intent of the section.</P>

      <P>I have listened to what the Deputy has said.  Because of the sensitive nature of such hearings before the court it is considered that the option should be available to the court to hear the proceedings in chambers so as to avoid any adverse publicity for the Central Bank which might prompt a run on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Article 34.1 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;, justice &ldquo;shall be administered in public&rdquo;. Thus, the presumption already exists that hearings must take place in public except where otherwise provided for by law.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary.  It is covered by the Constitution. Indeed, there was an interesting case heard by Mr. Justice Costello recently <i>vis-à-vis</i> a managing director's contract when he felt that damage might be done to the relevant company and decided to have a private hearing.  Whenever the courts envisage that it might create a run on the bank I have no doubt they would act accordingly.</P>

      <P> In page 37, subsection (1), line 32, after &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to the holder of the licence and&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of my amendment is to achieve the same result as that of Deputy Noonan's amendment by different wording.  If you look at section 43 (1) you will see that duties are imposed on the auditors of the holders of the licence to report certain matters, events or decisions to the Central Bank in writing and without delay. Primarily the duty of the auditor is to the shareholders of the company whose accounts he or she audits.  This is now proposing that the auditor also take on <Col N="872" /> board a duty to report to the Central Bank.  I have no objection to that but in order to maintain the relationship of trust between the bank, and the auditor and to adequately provide for the relationship which would have to exist between the Central Bank and the auditor, an element of tripartite responsibility should be introduced here.  The auditor, in addition to reporting to the Central Bank whatever decisions or facts he has uncovered or made under section 43 (1) (a) to (e), should also be obliged to report to the holder of the licence.</P>
    <P>The substance of my proposal would be that the sentence &ldquo;he shall report the matter to the Bank in writing without delay&rdquo; be amended to read: &ldquo;he shall report the matter to the holder of the licence and to the Bank without delay&rdquo;; in other words, creating this tripartite relationship and not acting as a policeman for the Central Bank secretly and perhaps in a manner which would cause distrust between the Central Bank, the licensed bank and the auditor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): My amendment, in general terms, has the same intent as that in the name of Deputy McDowell.  The obligations of auditors are being changed in a major way in the Bill.  I want to avoid a situation where an auditor who is under contract to a licence holder, would be put in a position of having to provide information to the Central Bank without the knowledge of the licence holder.  This would, in effect, upset the professional relationship between the auditor and the licence holder.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on this and, if possible, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to take account of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 concerns the circumstances in which an auditor is required to report to the Central Bank. Amendment No. 60 seeks to ensure that in those cases set out in this section the auditor will report not only to the Central Bank but also to his client.  I will be <Col N="873" /> opposing Deputy McDowell's amendment since I believe it is already covered in subsection (4).  Amendment No. 61 in the name of Deputy Noonan would require an auditor to report to the Central Bank <i>via</i> the licence holder.  The object of section 43, however, is to ensure that the auditor can report directly to the Central Bank and that in the special circumstances of subsection (5) the Central Bank may insist that the auditor does not involve the licence holder in providing the particular information required by that subsection.  That is not to say that the normal arrangements would be for the Central Bank to protect the auditor behind the back of the licence holder; that is not so.</P>
      <P>However, there are undoubtedly circumstances in which the Central Bank will require to deal with the auditor independently of the licence holders.  These are likely to be unusual cases, but cases which might entail the protection of the interests of depositors in the fullest meaning of that phrase.  This is where we diverge slightly from the normal relationship between client and auditor.  I would like to inform the Deputies that the same type of provision is already embodied in the Insurance Acts, and a similar provision was provided in the Building Societies Act.  I accept the point being made about upsetting the normal relationship, but this is to deal with certain circumstances where depositors' funds could be at risk and in my view is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is correct when he says that subsection (4) nearly covers my point, but I do not think it covers it completely because the obligation to send a copy is not as soon as may be and is not contemporaneous. What might happen is that the auditor may be effectively acting as an immediate spy for the Central Bank and then at his leisure he will inform his client.  There is a difference between the obligation to report immediately to the Central Bank and the obligation, without any time limit, to send a copy of the report to the licence holder.  I think it <Col N="874" /> would be better to provide that the immediacy provided for in subsection (1) &mdash; that it is to be done in writing and without delay &mdash; should also apply to the bank.  Then the relationship of trust, of which Deputy Noonan and I have spoken, would not be endangered.  If there is a requirement to report immediately to one institution and then at your leisure to send a copy to your client, it does undermine the relationship of trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the auditor who does not send his report to the Central Bank and to his client at the same time should not expect to hold his auditing job.  I would expect any auditor to send the report to both at the same time.  The amendment is unnecessary in the circumstances because I would expect that he would do that if he wants to keep his job and make sure he is still auditor of the company.  I would not expect him to delay sending the report for a month because it could not be in his own interests to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I wonder if the Minister would see any merit in an alternative to section 43, which would propose that the accountancy bodies would produce for their members an auditing guideline setting out in precise terms the reporting responsibilities now proposed for bank auditors and the circumstances in which such responsibilities would arise.  Auditing guidelines, I understand, are developed by the accountancy bodies to assist the auditor in the application of auditing standards and guidelines in particular sectors, industries and service organisations as well as the specific types of reporting engagements other than audits.</P>
      <P>Each of the accountancy bodies has its own investigative and disciplinary procedures to ensure that its professional standards are being complied with.  A guideline here could be discussed with the Central Bank prior to publication so that the supervisory authority were satisfied that compliance with the guidelines by the auditors would meet the Central Bank's objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> The legislation then could grant the Central Bank enabling powers to introduce detailed rules by regulation should they be dissatisfied with the guidelines produced by the accountancy profession. The guideline approach ensures that the reporting rules develop in accordance with Central Bank objective and provides on an ongoing basis a more flexible mechanism for revising the reporting requirements and supervisory objectives to take account of the rapid changes in the business and in the technology of banking.  A clear balance can be struck as between the cost and benefit to the banks and to their depositors of the reporting requirement with the Central Bank able at all times to impose statutory regulations where the guideline approach is deemed to be deficient.</P>
    <P>The accountancy bodies are obviously jealous of their privileges and like many professional groups, are anxious that as far as possible they would control their own standards.  If the Minister would consider the alternative approach which has been put to me, and which I am now putting to the Minister, a more favourable resolution to the issue in section 43 might arise.  If the Minister is not in a position to reply to this suggestion immediately, perhaps he would reflect on it between now and Report Stage.  When I hear the Minister's response I may put down an amendment on Report Stage along these lines, if he would favour such an approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a similar representation. The request is in relation to guidelines and seems reasonable enough. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Central Bank from coming to practical working arrangements with auditors or the professional bodies.  To include a subsection in the terms suggested by the representation &mdash; which is identical to the one I received &mdash; suggests that the Central Bank would in some way be able to vary the scope of the intent of section 43 to guidelines agreed with the auditing profession.  I think the Deputy would agree that as a general principle this does <Col N="876" /> not appear to be desirable.  It is up to the Oireachtas to enact the law, not the Central Bank.  It is unnecessary and inadvisable, therefore, to include this proposal in the Bill, although I would certainly approve of the Central Bank having a working arrangement with the various societies in relation to the guidelines to be followed.  I feel, on balance, that we should enact the law and let them decide the working arrangements and the guidelines to be followed.</P>

    <P>Section 51 sets out the level and basis of the calculation of the contribution by licence holders to the deposit protection account and the amount of the contribution is 0.2 per cent of the relevant Irish pound deposit with the holders, subject to a minimum contribution of <Col N="879" /> £20,000 for every holder.  The section also prohibits a licence holder from advertising if his deposits are protected unless the bank gives prior approval.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to prevent the Minister from altering by order the 0.2 per cent levy on deposits which would fund the deposit protection account.  This would not allow therefore for a change in the scheme at a future date when the circumstances might demand an increase or decrease in the contribution.  The aim of the flexibility being allowed to the Minister is to cater for changing circumstances. The orders made under section 68 (2) can be made only after a recommendation from the Central Bank. It is unlikely therefore that the Central Bank would make a recommendation without taking due and full account of the impact on banks and the banking system.  I believe that it is in the interests of the scheme to allow for some flexibility in the framework to cater for changing circumstances.  In those circumstances, I would ask the Deputy to reconsider his amendment.</P>

As the business of licence holders expands, the relevant deposits would also increase, so the amount which the Minister or the Central Bank may drawn down increases also.  Secondly, the Minister has the power subsequently in the Bill to reconstitute the fund in circumstances where that is necessary.  The power, in the first instance, to apply this to all appropriate deposits and, secondly, to reconstitute the fund in certain circumstances seems to make it unnecessary to have the Minister take the power upon himself to vary the rate of the imposition.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a minor matter proposed by the <Col N="881" /> Irish Bankers' Federation to exclude from the competition of depositors &ldquo;excluded depositors&rdquo; as defined in section 49 (i), which refers to moneys held in the bank by persons who are connected with the bank.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment suffers from one major drawback.  Some of the classes of excluded depositors would not be known until a liquidation would arise and could not, therefore, in practice be excluded from the levy.  For example, section 59 provides that certain persons who caused or profited from a licence holder's demise may be excluded from compensation.  Furthermore, even in respect of certain classes of named excluded depositors, under section 49 there is an appeal to the court to determine whether particular individuals should be excluded or not.</P>
      <P>With due respect, the Deputy's amendment causes practical difficulties and even in those cases where it is possible to identify certain classes of excluded depositors in advance, the time and expense of the banks in isolating the deposits in question may be out of all proportion to the benefit to be gained from a reduced deposit base for the levy.</P>

      <P>These amendments in my own name and that of Deputy Noonan have the same intent, that is that the amount that would be payable by a depositor would not only have a lower floor level but a ceiling level. I feel that the fund in question should not be one that is contributed to on a <i>pro rata</i> basis by the very large banks, irrespective of the size of their deposit base.  I think there is a strong case to be made for the proposition that they are less likely to fail than the smaller banks.  Since they are less likely to fail, they are, in effect, being asked to act as insurers for the smaller banks.  To use an insurance term, the moral risk is less in the case of a large bank than it is in the case of a small bank.</P>
      <P>Smaller banks traditionally resort to a more competitive strategy than the larger banks; they take the higher risks and they appear to be more likely candidates for recourse to the fund.  Having provided a fund which is sufficient to meet the likely requirements of the failure of a small bank, it should not be the case that the large banks should have to go further and be required to contribute on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to a risk which really is not theirs, as far as they are concerned.  In those circumstances I think there is a strong argument to be made for putting an upper limit on the size of the contribution that has to be made.</P>

      <P>Both amendments seek to place a maximum upper limit on the size of individual contributions to the deposit protection account.  For the reasons explained on Second Stage, I am not in favour of an upper limit.  I cannot see the difficulties of the banks with the <Col N="883" /> present requirements.  We are talking about a fund of £18.5 million, which is modest by any standards, especially when compared with total bank assets of £24 billion.  Furthermore, the funds in the deposit protection account belong to the banks and earn interest in the same way as other funds held with the bank.  The amounts in the deposit protection account will count as part of their primary liquidity ratio.  In the case of Deputy McDowell's suggestion, the account would be reduced by approximately £4 million, to about £14 million and if Deputy Noonan's amendment were accepted the account could be reduced to £6.5 million.  I think the size of the fund as proposed in the Bill is not excessive. The Central Bank have calculated it on the basis of the assets the banks hold with them.</P>
      <P>With a few exceptions, the bulk of small banks operating in the country are subsidiaries of major banks.  There are a few exceptions, but I do not think it is excessive.</P>

      <P>From history and experience it is more likely that a smaller bank would have recourse to the deposit protection account.  Therefore, to require the larger banks to subsidise the insurance to the depositors with the smaller banks is, in principle, only acceptable up to a certain point.  There should be a ceiling put on the contributions to the fund with a view to reinforcing the substance of the risk in the minds of the smaller banks, that it is they who, proportionate to their funds, will carry more of the risk because they are the more risky propositions.  That seems to me to be a legitimate policy consideration to put into a Bill, that in terms of insuring deposits, you take account of the actual likelihood of defalcation and it does not appear that depositors in the large banks need the protection as much as depositors in the small banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the Minister says about these funds being small and insignificant and that they earn interest, I have no doubt that they might earn more interest <Col N="884" /> if they were put elsewhere.  To the extent that they are kept in the fund, they are a subsidy to the banking system generally. The subsidy is that they provide a guarantee of deposit protection.  If there is a deposit protection subsidy to the smaller banks, it occurs to me that it is a subsidy from the bigger to the smaller players and I am not happy that that should be an unlimited subsidy.</P>
    <P>While I accept it is reckonable as part of their primary liquidity ratio, I still believe that it inevitably ends up with the bigger banks subsidising the smaller and riskier banks.  If we are talking in terms of competitive forces, this subsidy is an anti-competitive force because it undermines the principle of competition that those who are big and play safe have to subsidise those who are smaller and play riskier in the market.  I believe there should be an upper limit and I cannot see any justification for this cross subsidy without limitation especially when the reality is that the smaller banks are at more risk.  A capped fund is quite adequate to deal with any situation that would arise in the smaller banks.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The Minister has said that the deposits held in the deposit protection account would be treated as part of the primary liquidity fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is on deposit in the Central Bank and is reckonable as part of the primary liquidity fund.  Arising from that, is it not true to say that there would not be a requirement on any bank, no matter how large, in present circumstances, to deposit more than they have already deposited and is it not just a question of reclassifying funds that are already deposited with the Central Bank or are we talking of an additional tranche of money on deposit? It would appear from the Minister's reply <Col N="885" /> that there will be no new deposit made but that existing funds in the Central Bank will be reclassified and the issue is now the risk to the bank in the event of failure.  Obviously the primary liquidity fund is not at any risk, but money on deposit treated as part of the primary liquidity fund is at risk to other banks going broke and calling on the deposit protection fund.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this is the only risk and that Deputy McDowell's suggestion that the money could be put on deposit elsewhere does not arise from my interpretation of the Minister's remarks.  If that is the way the Minister envisages it working, I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>What happens if the fund is cleaned out and has to be replenished? If it is reconstituted it has to come in as a fresh fund, not from the existing ratios but the banks have to make it up again.  It is a subsidy from the larger banks to the smaller banks by way of insurance. I am not so sure that if there was a run on the fund, so to speak, it would not end up with the larger banks paying more than their fair share towards the riskier smaller banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has more or less answered the points I was going to raise.  It is tied up in the liquidity ratio already.  It is a recategorising of the funds.  Undoubtedly if the fund is dissipated or drawn down it then has to be replaced but at present that is the position.  The funds would not be available for on-lending to more beneficial areas.  It would be invidious for me to speculate as to whether the risk is greater for a small bank or a large bank to go under.  In most cases the quality of the management in the bank will decide that whether they take good or bad risks. Sometimes with a large bank it depends on what kind of business they decide to go into as to whether they will be successful or otherwise.  It is not right to point to smaller banks as against larger banks in that area.  Anyway the measure only applies to deposits up to £10,000. <Col N="886" /> Anybody who is going to invest £50,000 or £100,000 will know he is not protected by this measure and he will have to make his judgment as to where to place the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the example of two banks competing with each other to get deposits.  As a result of this measure both of them can tell the people that they are copperfastened up to £10,000, that their deposit is safe.  If the bank which offers the higher rate of interest &mdash; we are all talking about competition &mdash; and takes the greater risk of failure by doing so, can rely on the more conservative, larger bank which is more flatfooted in terms of its competition policy to act as a guarantor of its deposits, which is what this means, and if when the fund comes to be replenished the bigger banks have to pay for the smaller bank's riskier interest and competition strategies, it is wrong in principle to ask the larger players to subsidise their friskier competitors. The larger banks should not have an unlimited liability to contribute to a fund in these circumstances and the smaller banks should have it borne on them that they adopt a competitive strategy to bring in more money.  Experience shows that it is the smaller banks that run into problems. People tend to be concerned with the guarantee of deposit protection when they invest with a smaller bank much more so than when they invest with the Bank of Ireland or the AIB.  This deposit measure is of value to the smaller banks and the ones which are paring down their margins to the minimum and adopting the most competitive strategy.  It is anti-competitive to require this fund to be replenished <i>pro rata</i> by people who do not carry the same risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The smaller banks are under the supervision of the Central Bank which should make sure they do not engage in wild activity that might lead to their demise at the end of the day.  It is not true to say they can use the measure as a competitive advantage.  Advertising of deposits up to £10,000 is banned as a competitive instrument under section 51 <Col N="887" /> (9) (a) so they cannot use it in that regard. Large banks have certain advantages over small banks in many cases.  They have access to better credit guidelines in many areas.  I do not see this as a subsidy; it is a measure to protect depositors' money.</P>

      <img websrc="/graphics/D.0390.0888.1.gif" />
      <P>Section 55 (3) (b) sets out how the amount of compensation for a depositor is to be determined when there are insufficient funds in the licence holders' deposit protection account.  This deposit is vested in the liquidator by virtue of section 54.  Thus if all depositors combined are entitled to be compensated to the sum of £100,000 in total &mdash; represented by y in the formula &mdash; but the licence holder's deposit is only £50,000 &mdash; represented by x in the formula &mdash; each depositor will receive a proportion of his deposit based on the relationship of x over y, that is, in this case, 50 per cent.  To achieve this effect the proportion represented by x over y must be applied not only to reduce the eligible sums which the depositor has on deposit &mdash; A, B and C &mdash; but also to reduce the amount otherwise available from the proceeds of the liquidation &mdash; represented by D in the formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through an oversight the original formula did not apply the proportion x over y to D.  The revised formula does so and is mathematically correct in its desired <Col N="889" /> effect.

      <P>I do not think it a good idea that the moneys in deposit protection funds should be used for other purposes than to compensate eligible depositors in banks. Consequently I move that section 62 (1) (b) be deleted to ensure that the money would not be used for other purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share that view and I put down the fact that I was opposed to the section in its entirety rather than seeking to amend it.  The purpose of this section is to allow the bank at its discreation and to the extent that it deems proper from time to time to charge on the deposit protection account any other payment out of the general fund which, in the opinion of the Central Bank, was applied to protect the interest of persons or any class of persons maintaining deposits with one or more holder or former holders of licences, or to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the deposit protection <Col N="891" /> fund being potentially looted by the Central Bank for other purposes &mdash; one of them is to protect the interests of persons maintaining deposits.  That could be anything, it could be a fire brigade fund to reconstruct the finances of a bank which was a going concern.  We are back to the old system that would allow one bank to be reconstructed or recapitalised courtesy of the other banks and they have to make good any shortfall in this fund.  I am not keen on that.  I do not know why the deposit fund should be lootable &mdash; to use a horrible word &mdash; to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking. That is so general as to mean virtually anything.  If the Central Bank can apply the moneys for that purpose, they can effectively use it as a fund of last resort in circumstances which are not clearly defined in the Statute.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says the Central Bank is supposed from time to time to keep the Minister and the holder of the licences informed of the general principles which the Central Bank proposes to use in applying the funds in this way, but what about the Legislature?  When will the Central Bank tell the Dáil what they propose to use these moneys for, and in what circumstances they propose to use these moneys?  We are creating a fund and giving authority to the Central Bank to use the moneys out of that fund, then we are told the Central Bank will tell the various affected parties how they propose to use those funds from time to time.  I am not keen on that provision.  I think the Bill when enacted would be just as strong without it.  A little discipline and tightness would be imposed on the Bill if this loophole or recourse provision was taken out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 69 is to allow the Central Bank to use the deposit protection account in situations in which the stability of individual licence holders is threatened or where the banking system as a whole has been subjected, or might be subjected, to some financial shock or crisis.  Obviously, we are speaking here of very limited circumstances of <Col N="892" /> grave peril which would require immediate and concerted action.  Deputy Noonan's amendment essentially seeks to allow the fund to be used only in the case of threats to particular licence holders. I do not think we should limit ourselves in this manner.  There may well be circumstances in which action may be needed to promote &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;.  This phrase is used throughout the Central Bank Acts and is commonly understood to refer to situations which affect bank stability generally.  It would be most unwise, in my view, not to cover such situations.</P>
      <P>Deputies may consider that the powers being given to the bank in this section are too wide, and I am conscious of these concerns and that is why subsection (2) has been inserted.  This requires the Central Bank to formulate principles in advance for the manner in which the fund will be used under section 62.  These principles will have to be notified to licence holders and their views listened to.  The Minister, too, is required to be kept advised of these principles.  Subsection (2) is no mere rhetoric or window-dressing. It places an onus on the Central Bank to proceed in a judicious and open manner and ensure that the licence holders are part of the process.  I believe that may meet the concerns of the House.</P>
      <P>We will look again at subsection (1) (b) to see if we can improve the wording before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that paragraph (b) is pretty vague by any standards.  For instance, if the consent of the Minister was required to the establishment of the principles, or if the Minister was given a veto over the use of the money, he would have something.  Just keeping him informed of what they propose to do or how they propose to do it, does not seem to be sufficient.  This is the kind of thing for which there should be political responsibility in the last analysis. At least either the Minister's consent should be required in advance or he should be notified with the power of veto to say that they cannot use the money for <Col N="893" /> that purpose, or that he does not want it used for that purpose.  Because it is a circumstance in which the funds of one bank can be used to shore up a competitor, and it is not simply to protect depositors but to take a wider view of their solvency on some other front or some other unforeseen event, then under simple, ordinary competition rules they should be tied down as far as possible and this should not be a general fire brigade section.  I cannot see why the Minister would not require that his Department be informed and that he would have a right of veto, or at least a right to be consulted in advance of any applications.</P>

There is a phrase in the Building Societies Bill, &ldquo;the maintenance of the financial stability and well being of societies generally&rdquo;, and we will look at it before Report Stage and I hope I can satisfy the Deputy.  In certain circumstances, it may cost less if the fund becomes involved earlier, and it might be in the interests of others in the fund to do it that way.  I agree with what the Deputy is saying.  This is too wide and we will try to improve it.</P>

    <P>I have received representations from the Irish Bankers' Federation to the effect that this section seems to bring within the scope of acquiring transactions any acquisition of shares, however small, either by a person who already holds in excess of the prescribed 10 per cent or which would cause an existing holder to go over the prescribed percentage.  Their anxiety is that this would affect some existing institutional investors in the banks.  They are concerned that the reference in paragraph (b) of section 71 to an associated enterprise should be deleted. They believe that the section has enormous implications for institutions, including banks and associated companies, whose normal course of business includes taking equity stakes in companies.  In view of those representations I have tabled this amendment.  Deputy Noonan's amendment is along similar lines. Perhaps the Minister will indicate his <Col N="897" /> response to the bank's anxieties in this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:</P>
      <P> In page 53, subsection (2), to delete lines 34 to 42, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  where the proposed acquiring transaction is of such nature that the provisions of the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, would, but for subsection (4) hereof, have applied, he has consulted with</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) such other Minister of the <Col N="898" /> Government appearing to the Minister to be concerned</P>
    <P>and he shall refuse to give his consent where he considers that the exigencies of the common good so warrant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have received representations to the effect that subsection (2) (b) of section 73 should be deleted on the grounds that the public interest would appear to be more than adequately protected by the powers conferred on the Minister by other parts of the section.  The Minister can refuse to consent to any such transaction if he is satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of banking or that it would be contrary to the common good. The subsection is also viewed as undesirable on the basis that it requires the Minister for Finance to consult with other Ministers and that would be a duplication of effort which might cause unnecessary confusion.  The banks in question propose that if that could not be deleted, the subparagraph in question could be amended to read as follows:</P>
    <P> where the proposed acquiring transaction is of such a nature that the provisions of the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, would but for subsection (4) hereof, have applied, he has consulted with&mdash;</P>

    <P>It would be provided in subsection (4) that the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, would not apply to an acquiring transaction to which this section applies.  In view of those cogent points made by the Irish Bankers' Federation in relation to the avoidance of duplication and the fact that the Minister already has powers of a sufficient kind <Col N="899" /> available to him, I would ask him to heed the view that these provisions are not necessary in their present stringent form.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of these amendments is to seek to exclude any transactions covered in this chapter from the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  The substance of the amendments was, I believe, proposed by the Irish Bankers Federation, which feared that the banks would be required to comply with the provisions of two sets of legislation.  I appreciate its concerns but the fact is that the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 and the provisions of this Bill address the issue of bank take-overs and banks' participation in take-overs from two quite different perspectives. This Bill is concerned principally with prudential considerations; is the take-over safe?; should these people be let run a bank?, etc.  The Minister for Finance becomes involved when it is a question of effective control of banking in the State passing into new hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce's concern is the effect of take-overs on competition generally and the question of banks taking stakes in or building up conglomerates covering a wide range of commercial activities.  I recognise these legitimate interests and my colleague's anxiety to retain a say in this matter.  I held that view when in that Department.  The wording of section 73 (2) reflects and recognises the dual role. Indeed, this is the way in which, by and large, the present system operates.  Any bank wishing to acquire another firm first notifies and clears this with the Central Bank, after which formal notice is given under the mergers Acts.  This procedure will continue, except that the Minister for Finance will now be formally required to give consent in the cases to which section 73 refers.  In deciding whether to give my consent, I would, of course, consult the bank and the Minister for Industry and <Col N="900" /> Commerce.  Administrative procedures can and will be worked out to minimise the delay and paperwork involved.  The House can be assured on that point.</P>
    <P>When colleagues in Government sit around the table it is there for open discussion. I have to confess openly that as Minister for Industry and Commerce I held the view fairly strongly that the mergers and monopolies legislation approached the matter from a different direction.  There are different situations to be looked at, including the common good and all that area.  I would not concede those amendments.  I have a very strong view.  Maybe Deputies have different views.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last election the Progressive Democrats have taken the rare opportunities presented to us in Private Members' time to debate and promote issues of real importance for this country. In particular, we have introduced three important Bills, one on ministerial pensions which sought to end what remains a scandalous abuse, another, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill which tried to end the payment <Col N="902" /> of compensation to land speculators where they were refused planning permission and deal with the problem of unfinished housing estates, and our most recent Bill on competition policy which sought to radically reform the economy into one which favoured, encouraged and controlled competition.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are introducing another vital Bill.  The Health Ombudsman Bill, 1989, deals with the whole area of health policy here and seeks in particular to create the office of health ombudsman responsible to the Oireachatas and having a supervisory role in relation to the provision of hospital services to the public. The establishment of this office is essential if we are to ensure that ordinary people have their entitlements to immediate health care protected.</P>
    <P>Like the majority of Deputies in this House I have been inundated over recent months with requests from members of the public and the families of sick people to try to get patients into hospital.  By the Government's own account there are over 22,000 people on waiting lists for hospitals.  Many of these people have been waiting for over 18 months and are still no nearer a hospital bed.  People are getting desperate and are contacting anyone they feel can help them.  Who one knows and what pull one has is becoming more important than what is wrong with a person.</P>
    <P>This is just one symptom of a very sick health service but a very worrying one. Throughout the country there are examples of abuse of power, whether with the allocation of national lottery funds or the granting of planning permissions.  The common thread is that if one is in with the &ldquo;in crowd&rdquo; one will be looked after. This attitude is deplorable in any walk of life but when it enters the medical arena it is intolerable.  This Bill seeks to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to provide for the creation of a health ombudsman to investigate the provision of medical and surgical services in public hospitals.  We have deliberately modelled the Bill on the Ombudsman Act of 1980 but there are a number of important differences.  First, <Col N="903" /> the sole function of the health ombudsman is to investigate complaints by or on behalf of persons with either full or partial eligibility under the Health Acts or who have policies of insurance with the VHI or who are the holders of health insurance licences in relation to the provision of administration by a public hospital or health board.</P>
    <P>Second, the complaints must, in the main, demonstrate the procedures adopted by the health board are unfair or discriminatory or based on an improper method of devising a scheme of priority for the treatment of patients, or amount to a misdirection or waste of public moneys or are otherwise contrary to sound principles in hospital administration.</P>
    <P>Third, the health ombudsman is empowered to give mandatory directions to the hospital or health board concerned. These directions may be appealed to the Minister for Health on the sole ground that the hospital or health board does not have adequate resources to comply with such a direction.  We have allowed for appeals on this ground.  If he does, however, he must present a statement of his reasons in writing for doing so before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill, therefore, is to provide some independent arbitrator for patients using public hospitals and to provide a check against improper or wasteful decisions of the hospital or health board bureaucracies.  While the Bill has no financial implications in that hospitals or health boards may appeal against directions of the health ombudsman which they cannot meet out of their own resources, it will serve to highlight any deficiencies and undue waiting lists for the range of medical and surgical services available.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the establishment of the office of the health ombudsman and for his terms of office. Section 2 provides that he shall be independent in the performance of his duties.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) provides that the health ombudsman may investigate complaints which he considers warrant investigation. <Col N="904" /> Subsection (2) of this section specifies the grounds of complaint which might justify a preliminary investigation on the part of the health ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) provides that the complaint must be by or on behalf of a person with full or limited eligibility or with a VHI insurance policy and the complaint must relate to the provision and administration of medical and surgical services by a public hospital or health board. Sections 3 (4) and (5) are modelled on equivalent provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for a resolution of complaints procedure.  Section 4 (1) allows the health ombudsman to give mandatory directions to health boards and hospitals in relation to the provision of surgical and medical services.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (4) allows for an appeal to the Minister for Health on the sole ground of insufficiency of means or resources to comply with such a direction.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (6) provides that if an appeal is allowed, the Minister must cause a statement of reasons in writing to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is an interpretation section and the definition of hospital ensures that only public hospitals, in the sense of nonprofit making hospitals, are included within the remit of the Bill and, finally, section 6 provides for a short title and the commencement day.</P>
    <P>Important as it is, I am under no illusion that this Bill will solve the problems of our health services.  The fact is that these services are now in crisis.  Two years after crawling to power on the backs of promises about &ldquo;A better way&rdquo; and a reformed health service, this Government have totally reneged on these health services.  The Irish health services have been destroyed over the past two years by this Fianna Fáil Government.  Although one of their main promises on the hoardings that were all around this country during the last election campaign told us that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped, it is ironic that since this Government came to office their only policy in relation to our health services has been <Col N="905" /> one of cutbacks, cutbacks and more cutbacks. Three thousand acute hospital beds have been closed since Deputy O'Hanlon assumed office, with the result that there are now an estimated 22,380 people waiting to get into hospital for essential treatment.  Many medics have told me that some of their patients will die before they can get into hospital for much needed treatment.  In Dublin it is now virtually impossible to get into hospital unless one is certified as an emergency.  Family doctors are advising their patients to call an ambulance as that is the only way they can hope to be admitted to hospital.  The city hospitals are now almost totally taken over by patients admitted to the accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>One of the country's largest hospitals, St. James's in Dublin, reached the stage recently where patients requiring surgical and diagnostic procedures on a one day basis were sent home because all the beds allocated to those services were taken up by emergency cases admitted the previous night when the hospital was on call. Professor David McConnell, chairman of the board of the Adelaide Hospital, said that the public patient is being deprived of proper hospital care by the State, that waiting lists run up to 18 months for some people and that doctors know that usually they cannot admit patients unless they are seriously ill and that the postponement of elective care prolongs pain and discomfort, and sometimes dangerously exacerbates the underlying problem. The private patient, according to Dr. McConnell, can sometimes arrange for prompt treatment but the public patient must always wait.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the dreadful situation which arose recently in the Southern Health Board when money was so short that staff were told the board would have to defer payment of their salaries.  In the face of political and trade union fury, the Minister ran for cover and the money was provided to meet the pay cheques, while officials of the impoverished Department of Health flew to Cork to arrange for the demotion of the board's acting chief executive officer.  No solution has been <Col N="906" /> found even yet for the Southern Health Board's problems.</P>
    <P>Proposals to slash the number of beds at Tralee General Hospital at weekends were attacked earlier this month by Dr. Dick Shanahan, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, as being dangerous and unworkable.  He said that if they were implemented GPs could be left in the very frightening position of having patients with an acute illness on their hands and no hospital beds available to take them.</P>
    <P>Up to recently I thought this dire shortage of acute hospital beds existed throughout the country, but I was wrong. It does not exist in at least one hospital. A report by the North-Eastern Health Board has revealed that in Monaghan County Hospital the number of beds is in excess by 65 of what is required to serve the area.  It may be a coincidence that Monaghan County Hospital is in the Minister's constituency.  However, other areas of the country and other people have not been so fortunate.</P>
    <P>The national open heart surgery centre in the Mater Hospital in Dublin will only be allowed to carry out 700 operations this year because of a shortage of money. There are between 300 and 400 people on a waiting list and the number is growing daily.  People have to wait months to get into the Mater for vital open heart surgery. Recently a cardiologist told me that he does not inform a patient of the need for surgery until he knows he can get the person a bed, because of the danger to health of having to wait many months before getting into hospital for surgery. This is an appalling situation that no Government should tolerate, and it is one I am sure the people will give a clear opinion on, whenever they are given the chance.</P>

      <P>The people have not forgotten what the hoardings said.  They have not forgotten that they were promised a better way by this Fianna Fáil Government.  Week in and week out, when they sat in the Opposition benches, <Col N="907" /> Deputy O'Hanlon put forward motion after motion condemning what the Coalition Government were doing.  Many people have said to me, come back Coalition, all is forgiven.  They never realised how bad the situation could become.</P>
      <P>Doctors estimate that this year they will have to turn away 12 patients who require bone marrow transplants from the national bone marrow transplant centre in St. James' Hospital, Dublin. These patients will have the additional trauma of having to go abroad for their transplants at a cost of £25,000 for each transplant in Britain.  Even cancer patients are on a waiting list at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  At the moment there are 199 people awaiting beds in St. Luke's Hospital.  When I raised this matter in the House with the Minister in February, he told me that all these patients would have a hospital bed by the end of March. The Minister now says they might have a hospital bed before the end of June.  It is very distressing that people suffering from cancer, and those requiring open heart surgery and bone marrow transplants, should be treated in such an appalling way by this Government.</P>
      <P>In some hospitals, for example, Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, and Cherry Orchard Hospital, Dublin, parents have to fill in because of the shortage of nurses. Many parents have told me that they had to sleep overnight at the hospital in order to care for their children because there were not enough nurses to look after them.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response to the current chaos in the health services has been to try to dodge all responsibility.  We are sick and tired of hearing Deputy O'Hanlon tell us that he does not close down hospitals or hospital beds or cut back services.  The decisions to do this, the Minister assures us, are taken by the health boards or hospitals involved.  Dr. O'Hanlon conveniently ignores the fact that all the cutbacks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, conveniently ignores the fact that all the cutbacks are made on foot of the financial allocations which he makes to the hospitals and to the health boards.  It is not good enough for the Minister to cut allocations and then blame the health boards and the hospitals for cutting services.  Ministers cannot opt out in that fashion.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health's only response to the problems which are now threatening to sink the Irish health services has been to set up committee after committee to review and examine each situation which develops. At the last count the Minister had established 21 such committees.  Few reports of the deliberations of these committees have ever seen the light of day.  They are undoubtedly a convenient way of long fingering decisions and diverting public attention.  It is about time he who paid the piper decided to call the tune, and it is no longer good enough that this Minister and this Government simply pass on responsibility to others who are desperately trying to provide the people with some kind of health service.</P>
      <P>The kernal of the problems which now besets our health services is that there is no forward planning, no new policies developed to meet the changing situation and decisions are taken simply by default. The Minister does nothing, either because he does not know what to do or does not want to take decisions.  This may be politically opportune but it is not the type of Government needed here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 7,000 jobs have been slashed in our health services since the Minister took office.  The vast majority of them have been the jobs of front line health workers, such as nurses and doctors.  The impact of these people leaving the health services has been far more dramatic than if bureaucrats or administrators had left. An Bord Altranais informed me that 2,500 nurses in 1987 and 2,000 nurses in <Col N="909" /> 1988 applied for notification of registration in order to emigrate &mdash; this includes only nurses emigrating to the UK or the US.  They estimated that a further 500 to 700 nurses have emigrated to Baghdad, Saudi Arabia and countries like that for which they do not require registration, and therefore there are no accurate figures.  These are young Irish nurses who should be working at home.  They are needed here and they are entitled to find work in their own country.  It is a disgrace that these nurses are forced out of the country and that their skills and talents are being denied to sick people in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>One example of the Minister's failure to tackle the problems is that this country is desperately short of acute hospital beds, but there are five new hospitals &mdash; one in St. James's, the Mater in Dublin, one in Cavan, one in Castlebar and another in Mullingar.  All have been built at a huge cost to the taxpayer, at a cost of around £200 million, and they are lying idle.  The Mater has been completed for over two years, and St. James's and Cavan for over a year but despite that fact, it is costing thousands of pounds each week just to keep them closed.  The Minister makes no effort to open these hospitals and to ensure that their facilities are available for the Irish health services. It is a scandal that these new modern facilities are not in use.  I am calling on the Minister for Health again, as I did recently, to have these hospitals opened as a matter of urgency.  I have devoted a considerable part of my contribution to the hospital services.  Although there are problems throughout the health services it is at the hospital services level that the real difficulty exists.  Eighty per cent of the total budget spent on health services is spent directly on hospitals.  It is blatantly obvious that some action must now be taken to make these extremely costly services available to the public again.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that the present funding system for hospitals, which gives hospitals a block grant at the beginning of each year, regardless of the number of patients they treat, is no longer relevant and encourages hospitals not to <Col N="910" /> take public patients, who cost them money, but rather to switch beds to pay beds, if this is possible, in order to bring in more money.  A public patient has to wait months or years to get into hospital as a result.  Up to very recently a private patient could get in on demand. However, this will change as the VHI restrictions apply, particularly in the autumn of this year.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that all the people should have equality of access to essential hospital services and that the health of the poor is equally important as the health of the rich.  Rich and poor have equal rights to essential hospital care.  The present system of simply block granting the hospitals and health boards very much militates against any hope of equality of access.  The Minister hands out millions of pounds to hospitals and health boards each year with little regard either to their efficiency or the services they provide.  These hospitals are then left to manage their services as best they can.  Each time they admit a public patient it costs them money and each time they admit a private patient they make money.  It is obvious why these hospitals give preference, indeed are forced by their archaic funding system to give preference, to private patients.</P>
    <P>The time has now come for the development of new policies and for a fresh look at how our hospital services are funded.  The Government should examine a radical new method of funding of hospital services through a national insurance scheme.  Under such a scheme everybody in the State would be insured against the cost of essential hospital treatment. Their stay in hospital would be paid for by their insurance company.  The immediate effect of this would be the abolition of the distinctions between public and private patients.  There would be no such thing as a public patient. Everbody would be equal so far as access to acute hospital services is concerned. When admitted to hospital, instead of incurring costs through their admission, the hospital would gain an income from each patient admitted. <Col N="911" /> Hospitals would only receive income for treating patients with the result that instead of patients queueing to get into hospital as at present hospitals would be queueing to get patients.</P>
    <P>The funding of a national health insurance scheme would replace the existing health levy.  We envisage the premiums being paid by way of a levy taken from one's income.  The Government would pay the full insurance contribution of the lower income and part of the contribution of the middle income group while top earners, as of now, would fund their own health insurance.  This would cover basic hospital costs.  It would obviously be open to anybody who wished to and who could afford to to take out additional insurance to fund more luxurious accommodation.</P>
    <P>Under our proposal hospitals would become totally autonomous, no longer dependent on the Department of Health for their financing.  The Department of Health's role would be reduced to a licensing, standards and policy body.  A scheme on these lines, which works very well in many European countries, would go a long way towards ending many of our present difficulties, would guarantee equality of access, make hospitals competitive and eliminate a considerable amount of costly administration.  Such an insurance scheme would not be practical, however, if there was no competition for the VHI in the health insurance area. I support the opening up of the health insurance market to other companies who would be required to compete on the same basis as the VHI.  Competition is one of the most effective ways of keeping the cost of premiums down.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the hospitals service is just one aspect of the entire health services which are currently undergoing difficulties.  The Government's blundering since they assumed office has adversely affected almost every facet of the health service.  The decision to alter the free GP scheme for medical card holders, long the pride of joy of the health service, will lead to a two-tier health system at GP level also.  Up to now GPs <Col N="912" /> in the scheme were paid a fee each time they saw their patients.  From now on they will receive a payment each year whether they see them or not.  The Irish College of General Practitioners expressed reservations about the advisability of introducing this method of payment. A number of doctors have gone to the High Court to challenge the right of the Minister to introduce this scheme. The Minister has gone ahead with the scheme, which would appear to offer no advantage to patients and which he himself admits will cost £130 million to run this year, an additional £28 million on the 1987 cost of the GP scheme.</P>
    <P>Much of the pressure on our hospital facilities could be alleviated if general practitioners were encouraged to group together to provide a comprehensive medical service at community level. Many routine tests could be conducted in a doctor's surgery for about 20 per cent of the cost of doing so in a hospital.  The rate of surgery on a one day basis at 10 per cent of all surgery is very low by international standards, with the average being over 40 per cent.  Although efforts have been made in recent years to move in this direction, lack of nursing care at community level together with the shortage of theatres is a prohibitory factor. Investment in additional theatres and surgical appliances would prove very cost effective in the long run and we need to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>Consideration needs to be given also to the privatisation of hospital catering facilities.  A consultancy study undertaken on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, into catering arrangements in some hospitals highlighted huge waste and inefficiency in the hospitals investigated.  It showed that there were no proper stock taking or control mechanisms in place and that the food supply had not been put out to tender for many years in some cases.  It was found that most of the catering budgets were in excess of £300,000 for a 200 to 300 bed hospital in the large urban areas, such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. <Col N="913" /> One Dublin hospital has nine chefs, probably more than are to be found in the biggest hotel in the city.</P>
    <P>The difficulties I have outlined in the health service at present highlight very clearly the need for the public to have an independent watchdog who would fight for their rights and ensure that the services that are available are made available to the people who need them and not to people who have either money or are in the know.  Many colleagues in this House do not like having to contact the hospital or a health board in order to get some basic health care for patients but very often they are forced to do so because the families of sick people become so desperate and so dependent on Deputies and others in order to get much needed facilities.  Many problems have been brought to my attention in recent weeks. In one case a person, following an accident, was taken to Loughlinstown Hospital in Dublin where it was established that he had suffered a broken leg and needed to have a pin inserted but because no orthopaedic surgeon was available he was kept for one week in Loughlinstown Hospital and was only taken to the Meath Hospital when the family contacted some of the Deputies for the constituency.  They were successful in having the patient transferred and he had a pin inserted in his leg about ten days after the accident.</P>
    <P>Other people contacted me to say that, having been put through all the routine procedures on admission to hospital prior to an operation, they were then sent home.  In one case a woman was taken into a Dublin hospital, kept fasting for over 12 hours and had all of the procedures for her operation completed, but then at 4 p.m. the following afternoon she was told they could not perform the operation as they did not have the necessary staff and she was sent home in a dreadful state.  Others are not so lucky, their operations are cancelled before they even get to hospital.  Many of them become desperate and wonder if they will actually get into hospital.  There are also difficulties in relation to the admittance of women to maternity hospitals to have <Col N="914" /> gynaecological matters attended to. Many of my constituents have told me that they made huge efforts to have their children and all their family affairs taken care of for the week or two they were going to be in hospital but then had to undo all of this when they realised the hospital could not take them.</P>
    <P>Over Easter there were problems at the Adelaide Hospital in Dublin when operations had to be cancelled as no anaesthetist was available.  In some hospitals in the city people are sleeping on what are called extra beds which have to be brought into the wards.  Many wards have been closed down and extra beds have had to be put into the wards that are open as these are the only wards where they have staff.  The morale of doctors and nurses is at an all time low. It is very unusual for medics to contact politicians.  They do not like to get involved in what they believe to be political debate.  The situation is so serious that many leading medical people are contacting politicians, trying to outline the huge difficulties under which they operate.  They are frightened of the consequences for their patients and the health service which, for so long, was so good.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a health ombudsman, a person with legal or medical training, who could act quickly in the interests of the public, would ensure that if somebody was not getting treatment to which they were entitled he could give a direction and the person could be taken into hospital when he or she needed medical treatment.  That is essential if our medical service is to be fair, to command respect and if it is not to be operated on the basis of political or medical pull.  It is not good enough in any kind of decent society, regardless of our financial position, that any Government would seek to deprive sick people of much needed hospital services. There are difficulties in relation to funding for hip replacement and cataract operations and ear, nose and throat operations for children.  For the remainder of this year I suggest that the funds available through the national lottery are made available to clear the backlog and waiting <Col N="915" /> list for these three categories in particular. Funds are needed in those three areas if the queues are to be lessened.</P>
    <P>Very few people would argue against making available for the health services the £50 million which the Government now have to spend during the next few weeks on a political bonanza in an effort to buy votes in whatever elections we may have.  It would be a disgrace if that money was not made available to hospitals which are desperately in need of funds.  I call on the Minister and the Government to seriously consider for the remainder of this year &mdash; and perhaps into next &mdash; making that additional money available to the health services. I believe that those who so generously support the lottery would be very happy if they felt their money was going to a good cause like that, unlike some of the causes which the money has been spent on.</P>
    <P>A new funding system for our hospitals, which would put public and private patients on the same basis as far as the hospitals are concerned, would certainly help to end the distinction the hospitals make because of financial problems between taking a private and a public patient.  I firmly believe that if we were to be more imaginative and put some resources into the development of more theatres and so on many more operations could be carried out on a one-day basis.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly the elderly and psychiatric patients, could be better cared for in the community or by their families if some incentive were given to look after them.  In moving this Bill I appeal to the Government to accept the proposal to set up a health ombudsman. There may be differences as to the precise details of the Bill but they can be argued at a later stage.  It is extremely important to have an independent, public watchdog acting on behalf of sick people and their families and ensuring that the £1.2 billion which the State puts annually into our health services is spent wisely and fairly and that people do not have to go to the lengths they do at present by contacting <Col N="916" /> public representatives and others, begging for much needed hospital treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to question the real motivation behind the initiation of this Bill.  I have to see this hastily assembled and poorly constructed Bill as no more than a launching pad for yet another ill-conceived attack on the health services, their administration and management.  Given the timing of the Bill, it is perhaps no more than a cheap attempt to grab some headlines for the Deputy and her hard-pressed party. Nothing that Deputy Harney has said in introducing the Bill leads me to any other view.  It is sad that such serious matters as the health services and the right of redress of the citizen should become the subject matter for opportunism and political gamesmanship.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes the creation of a health ombudsman to investigate the provision of medical and surgical services in public hospitals.  This new official would have as his sole function the investigation of complaints in relation to the provision or administration of services by a public hospital or health board.</P>
      <P>The Bill purports to provide an independent arbiter for patients using public hospitals and to provide a check against improper or wasteful decisions of hospitals or health boards.  This new official would also appear to be given the function of highlighting deficiencies and undue waiting lists for medical and surgical services.  It is not at all clear how an ombudsman would discharge the function of monitoring waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of fundamental questions arise.  First of all, there does not appear to be any real need for legislation additional to that already enacted in order to provide a framework for the redress of individual grievances against health agencies.  The Ombudsman Act, 1980, provides a very wide framework for the functioning of the Ombudsman in the investigation of complaints.  In 1984, the health boards were brought within the remit of the Act.  It remains open to the Government under the Act to further <Col N="917" /> extend that remit to include, for example, bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, such as St. James's and Beaumont Hospitals.  If a review of the operation of the 1980 Act &mdash; and such a review may now be timely &mdash; were to suggest that there is a need to extend its scope, either in relation to health or otherwise, then the correct procedure would be to amend the original Act, rather than introduce separate sectional legislation.</P>
    <P>The enactment of separate legislation and the establishment of a separate office, as proposed by the Deputy, would involve yet further bureaucracy, in the worst sense of that word, and avoidable cost to the public purse.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum of this Bill baldly asserts that it has no financial complications.  Yet it ignores the costs which the running of a separate health ombudsman's office, with its retinue of investigators and officials, would incur. The Deputies should remember that the Bill explicitly disqualifies the present Ombudsman from holding the new office of Health Ombudsman in section 1 (3) which states:</P>
    <P> A person who for the time being holds the office of the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, shall while so holding the said office, be disqualified from holding the office of Health Ombudsman. </P>
    <P>It is not at all clear why such a separate office and official is required.  Is the Deputy casting aspersions on the manner in which the existing Ombudsman discharges his duties?  Is there any reason why the party of the hairshirt and reductions in public expenditure are now advocating another unnecessary set of officials and investigators, causing a further drain on the already hard-pressed public purse?  I presume the cost of this ombudsman would be borne by the Department of Health.  The experience in the United Kingdom has exhibited no need for such a separate office of health ombudsman.  In that jurisdiction those functions are adequately carried out within the structures of the existing office <Col N="918" /> of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the mould breaking party who make a virtue of small Government should be proposing such a measure. Perhaps we should not be surprised that there is confusion in the positions now being taken by the Progressive Democrats in an attempt to avoid humiliation at the hands of the electorate.</P>
    <P>This bill gives the proposed health ombudsman powers and functions far in excess of those normally associated with the office and it certainly goes way beyond the role assigned to the office in the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>The grounds for investigation of complaints set out in section 3 (i), (ii), (iii) and (vii) of the Bill virtually duplicate the existing provisions of the 1980 Ombudsman Act and would add nothing to the current legislative position.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has rejigged some of the provisions of the 1980 Act and now presented them in section 3 of the Bill. As some sort of improvement on the existing legislation subsection 2 (i) of this section is exactly the same as section 4 (2) (b) (iv) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, and allows the health ombudsman to investigate any action taken if it appears to him that it &ldquo;was based on erroneous or incomplete information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Similarly, subsection 2 (ii) duplicates section 4 (2) (b) (v) of the 1980 Act by allowing investigation of an action if it appeared to the health ombudsman to be &ldquo;unfairly discriminatory&rdquo;.  The 1980 Act uses the phrase &ldquo;improperly discriminatory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, subsection (2) (iii) of the Bill allows an investigation of an action if it appears that it &ldquo;was based on an undesirable administrative practice&rdquo; and this duplicates the provisions of the 1980 Act in section 4 (2) (b) (vi).  Subsection (2) (vii) of the Bill also virtually repeats the 1980 Act in its section 4 subsection (2) (b) (vii).  The former allows a complaint to be investigated if it appears to the Ombudsman to have been otherwise contrary to fair or sound administration.  The Bill in this subsection simply adds one phrase to that formula and states that <Col N="919" /> the action must appear to be otherwise contrary to fair or sound principles of hospital administration.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I have gone into some detail on these provisions to show you clearly how little it adds to our legislative position. Many of the provisions of this Bill already exist in law and as such they are unnecessary.  I do not think the time of this House should be wasted with the passage of legislation which merely reiterates the current position.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill also includes a provision that &ldquo;misdirection or misuse or waste of public moneys&rdquo; is also a ground for investigation.  This provision touches on issues which are more appropriate to a management audit concerned with administrative efficiency and accountability than an ombudsman providing redress for individual grievances.  We already have a well-developed audit function in the health services under the aegis of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Inspector of Audits.  Is the Deputy now proposing that we replicate and duplicate the functions which these offices currently carry out with yet another office which could not but incur a significant amount of additional expenditure?</P>
    <P>While it might be appropriate for an ombudsman to refer to examples of the waste of public moneys which he comes across in the pursuance of his normal investigations, it would be a total distortion of his functions if he were to make such reports the core of his work, to the detriment of those duties with which this House has given him.  It is of no use to an individual with a justifiable grievance that the Ombudsman is making a report on matters of waste in general.  The office of the Ombudsman was established to give individuals a means of redress for individual grievances and we should not allow the Deputy to attempt to side-track it away from that important role.</P>
    <P>In addition, subsections (v) and (vi) of section 3 provide grounds for investigation which stray into areas of clinical medical judgment.  They allow the health ombudsman to investigate a complaint if <Col N="920" /> it appears to him that the action of a hospital or health board...</P>
    <P> was based on a scheme of priority for the treatment of patients which was derived from improper or incorrect criteria, or</P>
    <P>failed to have regard to the special medical needs of the complainant. </P>
    <P>These provisions involve matters of medical judgement which were specifically excluded by the 1984 ministerial order so as not to involve administrative officials sitting in judgement on the clinical decisions of members of the medical profession. These subsections refer to improper or incorrect criteria of schemes of priority without stating who will determine which criteria are correct.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should be aware that there are serious problems attached to straying into this area of clinical medical judgment.  There could be dangers of a parallel jurisdiction between the office of the health ombudsman and the courts with respect to medical negligence.  A complainant could use the health ombudsman for a &ldquo;free&rdquo; investigation and then if his complaint is upheld, take the matter to court and use the health ombudsman's report in support of his claim.  If he lost, the credibility of the health ombudsman would be impaired: if he won, the health ombudsman could be said to have prejudiced the matter. Relations between the health ombudsman's office and the staff of the health services would be likely to seriously disimprove if its reports could be used in a legal action.  Such a disimprovement would, in turn, impair the effectiveness with which the office could discharge its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill contains an extraordinary provision.  Section 4 (1) states the following:</P>
    <P> The Health Ombudsman shall never have power to direct that a hospital or health board shall provide specified medical or surgical services to a named eligible person or person with limited eligibility where he is satisfied that the <Col N="921" /> complaint referred to in section 3 has been made out to his satisfaction. </P>
    <P>It proposes to give to the ombudsman, an unelected official who is not directly accountable to any Minister, power to direct hospitals and health boards to supply services to individuals.  As such, it runs counter to our whole tradition of parliamentary democracy.  The Bill suggests a role for the ombudsman which is quasi-judicial, making his task more akin to that of an appeals tribunal than an investigation into individual grievances. The essential task of an ombudsman is to investigate and bring to the attention of the agencies and, if necessary, the Houses of the Oireachtas actions which have adversely affected individuals.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman Act, 1980 clearly states what the appropriate powers of an ombudsman should be.  The Ombudsman, having investigated a complaint, may recommend to the Department of State concerned under section 6 that: (a) the matter in relation to which the action was taken be further considered; (b) that measures or specified measures be taken to remedy, mitigate or alter the adverse effect of the action, or (c) that the reasons for taking the action be given to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Ombudsman and his staff on the way they have discharged the duties given to them by the Oireachtas.  I was pleased to have supported the legislation that set up that office.  Deputies will be aware that in many cases the recommendation of the Ombudsman will be enough to persuade the relevant body that the action complained of be remedied. However, if the Ombudsman is not satisfied with the response of the Department or other body he may make a special report on the matter in the report which he lays before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These provisions of the 1980 Ombudsman Act outline the appropriate role of the Ombudsman's office.  It is not, and should not be, his task to make what amounts to management decisions, without any accountability for the implications of those decisions.  The Bill then <Col N="922" /> proposes a unique appeals arrangement, under which the Minister's powers are restricted in an unprecedented manner.</P>
    <P>The mandatory directions of the health ombudsman to the hospital or health board concerned may be appealed to the Minister for Health on the sole ground that the hospital or health board does not have adequate resources to comply with such a direction.  The Minister may allow the appeal on this ground, but if he does, he must forthwith cause a statement of his reasons in writing for doing so to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The proposed system of appeal is both cumbersome and unnecessarily bureaucratic, creating the possibility of ever more direct involvement of the Oireachtas in what are essentially executive functions of quite a minor order.</P>
    <P>The Bill displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the true nature and range of health services.  It focuses on the provision of medical and surgical services in public hospitals and ignores the difficulties which may arise for people in obtaining a whole range of other services, which are primary in nature and which address the day-to-day, less dramatic but crucially important health needs of the population.  In this perhaps more than in any other aspect of the Bill, Deputy Harney and her party reveal the real intention behind their proposal.  They are not interested in the low profile community based services that attract little attention either in their excellence or their shortcomings.  They want yet another opportunity, with perhaps further structured opportunities in the future, to concentrate attention on those areas of the health services which are experiencing transitional difficulty in adapting to rationalisation and to changes in demand.</P>
    <P>Let us imagine what the situation would be if the Deputy's Bill was accepted.  It would mean that someone who had a complaint, for example, with regard to the way she was treated at an out-patient clinic at Beaumont Hospital, would be able to have the health ombudsman investigate that complaint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> However, if another person had a complaint regarding the home help service she received, or regarding her public health nurse, or indeed in relation to her child's school health examination, she would have no such opportunity of obtaining redress.</P>
    <P>Once again, we are witnessing the problems which Deputy Harney's party have in matching their rhetoric and their behaviour.  It is not all that long ago since we witnessed their agonising and posturing when they had to face up to the implementation in relation to Barrington's Hospital of what they had advocated in one of their policy papers.  I quote from that document:</P>
    <P> During periods of fast growth certain services no longer relevant to modern needs are allowed to remain in place, while new services tend to overlap existing ones.  There is in this area a clear need to rationalise these services, to discontinue obsolete ones and to eradicate overlap.  These are best achieved through good management practices. </P>
    <P>There are, indeed, many other statements of the Progressive Democrats which I could instance but I do not propose to inflict them on the House.  How does the statement which I have just read compare with the Progressive Democrats' stance on the Barrington's Hospital issue?  Here we had the Government practising the good management which the Progressive Democrats called for: we were phasing out overlapping services and reducing the overall level of acute hospital bed provision.  We were doing precisely what the Progressive Democrats said should be done, yet what did they do?  They opposed it.  Of course, they had parochial, not national, reasons for doing so.  Indeed, this highlighted the hypocrisy of this party, which, unfortunately, was founded on hatred.</P>
    <P>Now we have the party of the free market, the advocates of small government, the fearless antagonists of bureaucracy proposing a piece of narrowly focused legislation which would be of <Col N="924" /> very little use to many people receiving health services; the establishment of another autonomous, expensive bureaucratic machine; and the extension of the detailed supervisory role of the Oireachtas because it happens to suit their perceived short-term political advantage.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this Bill and I believe the House will reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to once again analyse and debate the difficulties currently being experienced in the Irish health service.  I am glad that this measure has been brought to the floor of the House so that it can be fully debated as well as the need for some form of consumer accountability to be brought into the health service.  In principle, this is something we must welcome.</P>
      <P>It has been correctly said that the health boards are already under the ambit of the existing Ombudsman structure.  I believe very strongly that that office is useful in terms of the accountability of public services and should be extended to cover a number of areas.  Some semi-State companies are included in this area but some are not &mdash; for example, the ESB and CIE are not included while Telecom Éireann are.  There is a very strong case to be made for the inclusion of other services in view of the fact that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1979, exempts State companies from the remit of the Ombudsman.  I very much favour the allocation of more resources, a more thorough approach and an opening up of the Ombudsman's service.  This Bill acknowledges that while there are some aspects of the health services accountable to the Ombudsman, there are others which are not, most noticeably our hospital services.  For example, in the acute general care area most cases are not under the ambit of the health board but under the direct control, in terms of finance, of the Department of Health. There is no accountability whatsoever.  I favour a consumer led approach to the health services and accountability.  In principle, I support the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> It is a matter of debate whether it would be better to amend the Ombudsman Act, 1981, and to consider extending the powers in that Act but if we do we come across one important issue, that is &mdash; and I think the Minister of State correctly alluded to this &mdash; that one of the things which distinguishes the health services from any other public service is the role of clinicians.  As a politician I am not in a position, nor is an ombudsman as a layman, to say that patient X should not have been discharged or that patient Y should have had a different course of treatment.  We are not clinicians but we would have to address the issue of what would be the situation in relation to matters of clinical judgment which would have to be adjudicated on.  There would have to be a professional medical input into these judgments but the nature of our civil law is such that if people are dissatisfied with clinical decisions they have a right of redress through the civil court process.  I am not saying that is a very amenable or relevant process, but it exists.  I would venture to say that if a health ombudsman secondguessed a clinician's decision it might reflect so much of his judgment that he would have no choice but to take action against an ombudsman to fight it.</P>
    <P>I should like to focus on what I believe is the underlying basis of this Bill.  Deputy Harney correctly asserted the type of problems which have been addressed and which we all experience as TDs.  Initially, I should like to deal with one specific area where the existing Ombudsman has already made a clear recommendation, that is, the dental service.  The Ombudsman received complaints that medical card holders could not get an orthodontic service and some years ago he made a recommendation in favour of those patients that that service should be provided.</P>
    <P>A report, prepared under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden, clearly said that under section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards had a legal obligation to provide basic dental services to medical card holders, their <Col N="926" /> dependants and school children, and that the health boards were failing in their statutory duty to provide that dental service. In many instances the waiting lists were so long that they were suspended. One example is the South-Eastern Health Board area.  The situation is at its best in the Eastern Health Board area because people there have access to the Dublin Dental Hospital.  However, in some areas the waiting lists are so long they had to be suspended.  There is also the very tragic situation with regard to old age pensioners who had all their teeth removed.  I hear about one case a week in my clinic, and I am sure I am no exception.</P>
    <P>I understand that the committee on dental services to which I referred carried out a special study into the needs of the people in Roscommon.  There is no doubt that the situation is totally unacceptable. If the attitude being taken is that because people will not die of dental decay we should not have a dental service, that is a disgrace and totally unacceptable.  It is the poorest people who are being affected in this way.</P>
    <P>Much mention has been made tonight of waiting lists.  I have consistently said that this is the most serious problem in relation to the drop in standards in patient services.  I should like to emphasise the need for some measure which would bring accountability into the hospital services. I should like to refer to a letter I received today, a copy of which has been sent to the Minister.  I do not wish to mention any names but if we analyse this harrowing tale I am about to reveal it will come across very clearly that this is a desperate plea for someone to put some level of accountability and answerability into the system.  I should like to briefly go through the details of this case, because very often the individual case makes the point.  This letter from a person in County Limerick dated 19 May is addressed to the Minister and is on his desk.</P>
    <P>This case relates to a young boy born with a hare lip and cleft palate.  He was treated very well under the GMS at Doctor Steeven's Hospital from 1976, but then the hospital closed.  His medical <Col N="927" /> records and charts were left in that hospital.  When St. James's Hospital was opened and the facilities of Doctor Steeven's Hospital were transferred there, unfortunately, this young patient's medical records were not moved and, to this day, cannot be found.  To proceed with the history of this case, the basic request was that he would have an operation performed on his cleft palate.  He was given an appointment for June 1988 but nothing could be done because there was no medical chart available.  He was recalled two months later and seen by a consultant who was doing duty for a speech therapist.  It was then that an operation was recommended after intensive speech therapy.  He was called again some six months later.  The family waited two hours in an outpatients' clinic to ascertain what could be done to make arrangements for the operation.  Subsequently he was given an operation date two months later, 2 April 1989, and had to telephone to confirm the bed.  His parents were never to realise the chaos that was to follow.</P>
    <P>This family of seven children were from Limerick and had to get a lift to Dublin.  They phoned several times to confirm the appointment for the operation. In fact they spent up to £46 in telephone calls, not being in a position to drive to Dublin, having no car of their own.  They were left hanging on, telephone calls having been cut off and so on.  At the end of April they managed to get a bed, which was not confirmed until the last minute.  Eventually the child was rushed out of school and taken to Dublin, with train fares and so on being borrowed. The parents had to have an overnight stay in Dublin.  When all was ready for the operation the mother was told by the consultant that they did not have sufficient notes and details on the patient to carry it out.  This was almost a year after confirmation that an operation was necessary.  The patient was told to return in a fortnight for definite treatment.  The family were told the bed would not be <Col N="928" /> cancelled.  Foolishly they took the authorities at their word and a month later when they endeavoured to gain access to the hospital bed they were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The story goes on and on of a bizarre set of circumstances.  The upset caused to the patient's parents was quite remarkable. They are now asking how they could have been brought to Dublin and allowed to return home without any operation having been performed; why the patient's charts were not transferred; why much of the equipment at St. James's Hospital seemed to be out of order resulting in operations not being performed and why there are inadequate numbers of nurses.</P>
    <P>That is a very sad tale indeed of somebody who has been a victim of this Minister's performance in relation to health management under which there is no planning but simply chaos; when people do not know from one end of the day to the other what will happen; when appointments are not being kept; there is no synchronisation of information or notes on patients.  This has led not alone to much hardship for patients but appalling demoralisation of health workers, who must notify these patients saying: we are sorry but you must return home, there is no service available to you here.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is also right when he says that the problems are not restricted to the hospitals.  For example, would it be the case that an old age pensioner, perhaps being minded by a relative in the community, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, who is doubly incontinent and told by the health board: &ldquo;We are sorry but your incontinent pads have to be rationed&rdquo; be a matter on which a complaint could be lodged?  Surely such people have some rights of redress or complaint to somebody?</P>
    <P>There is a very important underlying factor in all of this, which is that people do not like to complain to the front line of health care workers for fear that they might not receive the best treatment in the future.  That is no reflection on health workers but is simply a matter of human nature.  What we really need is not merely a system of accountability or an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman, though <Col N="929" /> they go some way toward alleviating the type of personal hardship cases we all encounter.  I could cite many other horror stories of young children, very ill, <i>vis-à-vis</i> access to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  All of these people suffer a total sense of frustration.  We do not need a fire brigade type of solution to the problem.  Rather we need a planned response to deal with all of the problems of waiting lists nationwide.</P>
    <P>As it is likely this debate will not be concluded I can assure the House that by the time this matter would have been adjudicated on my party will have put forward very clear proposals as to how we will meet the immediate crisis in the health service, how we will ensure not only that people's immediate needs but that the secondary need to reorganise the health services are met.  The present structures cannot cope with the demands being made of them.  For the money expended in the health service we have not had the type of investment in technology to deal with patient administration systems that could sort out the log-jam of problems from which patients are suffering.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Harney correctly said, there have been vast inefficiencies in catering and other services that could be eliminated by implementing new technology and rationalising the services. Medical records are also very labour-intensive. I have been to the basements of many hospitals littered with thousands of files, all of which could be computerised. Why do we have to have eight to ten different finance and personal systems of administration?  Indeed, why do we have to have over 7,000 clerical and administrative personnel employed in the health services?  When we look at the voluntary early retirement statistics we see that the largest uptake within the health services over the last two years were front line nurses and para-medics &mdash; I elicited this information from a recent question I tabled to the Minister &mdash; while the lowest level of uptake was among the clerical and administrative personnel.</P>
    <P>What people are crying out for is not <Col N="930" /> only accountability, such as the provisions of this Bill would afford, but also a guarantee that the front line of health services are protected.  The policy of cash limits and embargoes on hospitals and health boards is a proven failure in so far as it has not led to a shake-out of efficiency.  Rather it has resulted in more inefficient practices.  For example, if one has a 200-bed hospital and decides to close 50 beds on account of cutbacks, that does not mean that the remaining 150 beds will be well or effectively run or ensure that the maximum care is provided for the people who would like to avail of the services provided under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There must be a root and branch reorganisation of the health services structures that have remained unchanged for 20 years.  Would any Member care to give me an example of one organisation of the complexity of the health services that has the same structures in place 20 years later?  We have a Department that have authority but no responsibility.  There are different components within the health service, fighting in public vision &mdash; for example, the Southern Health Board, Temple Street Hospital, the Meath Hospital with another element of the management of the health services, namely, the Department.  Why not have them all on the one team and cut out much of this nonsense?  These issues of restructuring and reorganising the health services cannot be avoided any longer.</P>
    <P>There is also the short-term consideration that better management could only result in utilisation of the advantages of the health service.  After all, it should be remembered that we are huge consumers of the health service.  For example, the number of bed nights provided in all our residential units, not only in acute general hospitals but also in psychiatric hospitals and so on, involves a huge purchasing power.  But people involved in different elements of the health service do not know what others are paying for everything from cotton wool to eggs; they do not have a clue. This is a matter of straightforward professionalism that needs to be sorted out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> I and many health managers and workers regret that the difficult financial circumstances in which we find ourselves have not resulted in all of these changes being effected.  Rather, it has led to the problems being passed down to the frontline health workers, resulting in the problems we have all encountered.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill I should like to refer to the pyschiatric services because, to some extent, they constitute a hidden service.  They are not something that attract media headlines.  There has been the stigmatised element of high walls and people being put away, either voluntarily or otherwise, for long periods.  I suppose that has been part of our history.  However, all of that is changing.  Something like 3,000 or 4,000 patients in psychiatric care have been moved out of hospitals into the community. If one examines the figures of day hospitals, night shelters and so on provided, one finds there are about 1,200 to cater for approximately 2,000 people. They are not all psycho-geriatric people who die, who are somewhere in the community. I very much question whether there are adequate facilities for them. what makes me doubly suspicious is the increase in suicide rates &mdash; now quite striking &mdash; which families do not like to investigate too thoroughly because of the very nature of their bereavement and so on.  Quite frankly we have a lot of deaths by misadventure which could have been suicides so, perhaps, we do not have the full recording of it.  I would like the bereaved families to have some authoritative independent structure to which they could go to assert their case, make their complaint and have it fully investigated &mdash; at present we do not have a formal structure of that nature where someone is dissatisfied &mdash; that might not be questioning a clinical decision but rather the effecitiveness of community nursing, the effectiveness of hostel care and so on.  That is an area I would like to see taken up specifically in relation to patient services.  In relation to the political job that needs to be done for health <Col N="932" /> we need to clearly establish what are patients' rights.  To some extent the Health Act, 1970, tried to do this.  It set out the different rights of medical card holders in terms of GMS service, dental service and so on.  But when the cutbacks have bitten deep what are actually patients' rights have been diluted and have become unclear.  If you are on a waiting list long enough not to be able to get access to care, unless by joining the VHI or being able to pay for the bed, then your rights are only theoretical; they are not there in practice.  That leads me to the point that there are many people who are suffering in a very quiet way.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the mental handicap patients who are residing in psychiatric hospitals.  It should be an absolute objective that the next Minister for Health would state very clearly &mdash; I would be prepared to give this commitment &mdash; that, within a year or whatever, all mental handicap patients would be taken out of psychiatric institutions and put into specialised services and that there would be a guarantee that no admission of such patients would take place into psychiatric hospitals because those institutions are totally unsuitable to their requirements. We have seen the development of specialist services for autism and autistic children and so on.  That should be the future direction.  If there were a number of recommendations from the Ombudsman it would highlight independently that it is wrong because mental handicap patients cannot speak for themselves. Who is going to speak up for them unless their relatives and politicians do so?  I believe that would be a means whereby people could get a consistent series of recommendations from an Ombudsman which would have some impact and some impetus in reforming public health policy.  I refer to the recent case and the prospects for haemophiliacs infected with the HIV virus.  Given the recent developments in the Dunne case, which I am intimately aware of in relation to the Holles Street litigation, whatever about the rights and wrongs of that case, one thing is certain, that the legal bill on both sides will be of the order of £750,000; <Col N="933" /> that is the cost of the existing High Court and Supreme Court case and the pending repeat High Court case and it can go on <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I understand the Dunne family have put their house up for sale just to meet the cost of the clinicians from England who are to give an opinion in the court; that does not touch any of the legal costs.  If an Ombudsman structure is put there or some independent complaints service it at least affords people the opportunity of processing their complaint without the fear of expensive litigation costs which are simply prohibitive to ordinary people.  The fact that many people have to rely solely on litigation shows an inadequacy and a failing in our present system.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of another group who cannot speak up for themselves. These are children at risk, children who have been the victims of sexual abuse and violence and who have had to be taken out of the family setting for their own safety and well-being.  People who are members of health boards will know that we have a patchwork quilt of services. There are some areas where there are imaginative health boards and health managements who have developed childcare services but if one is unfortunate to live in another part of the country where there is a very conservative attitude to children at risk, what right do those children have, what vehicle do they have to develop a service in their area? The best they can hope for is that some TD in their local constituency will pioneer services. If it is not a particularly fashionable issue or if it is raising difficult issues relating to battered wives or areas that are socially stigmatised, there are difficulties.  If people had the right of complaint, if people could see that their voice would be heard if they had a legitimate complaint and where recommendations could be made in their favour, I would support such a measure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House because I fear that we may not get the full time to debate this Bill.  As you know, the two-week procedure may not apply in this debate so I am anxious to facilitate other Members of the House.  In conclusion <Col N="934" /> I would like to say that in my view there is a crisis in the health service. There is a very serious disaffection in relation to the public's perception of patient services, particularly manifest in relation to waiting lists, the abolition of some components of the health service such as dental and optical care, the lack of planned development of services for the elderly, the handicapped, for childcare services and AIDS patients.  This Bill will not resolve all of those problems but it will, through new structures, focus on the problems and ensure that the Minister will not be able to say that Deputies or the public are scaremongering or that people are denigrating the quality of our health service.  These problems are real and practical and they exist.  Anything that would ensure that they were highlighted in an independent and fair way &mdash; they would not victimise staff in the health service because we have some excellent staff &mdash; is worth considering.  In principle I support what is being proposed here but I would put in the caveat that perhaps we could consider looking at amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in fact my intention to introduce clairvoyance into the Bill but I would like to cast a little cold water on it.  It is probably well known by Members of this House that I have been advocating <Col N="935" /> bringing into effect a full blown Ombudsman system into Ireland for a long time. As far back as the late seventies I wrote about the 20 years of debate on the creation of an Ombudsman office and about the time for action rather than the time for talk.  In 1980 we got an Ombudsman Act.  My personal belief at the time &mdash; it is expressed in writing and it is a matter of public record &mdash; that we were rather too timid and subsequently the Ombudsman role was extended to health boards in matters of administration.  I think this is the central issue.  Deputy Yates to an extent took the point I wished to make about recent events.</P>
      <P>The Dunne case, indeed, illustrates the need for an alternative system whereby complaints regarding the medical system or the medical services can actually be addressed.  I do not think this Bill &mdash; which is good popular stuff more with an eye on the events of 15 June than with an eye on creating a proper Ombudsman system &mdash; addresses the problems.  The Dunne's case does illustrate a major lacuna in Irish law.  The major lacuna is that the Ombudsman system which we have created here has a number of invidious exclusions and one which this Dáil, or the next Dáil, needs of necessity to address.  The most obvious shortcoming in the present legislative arrangements, so far as the health services are concerned, is the exclusion from the Ombudsman's remit of the concept of clinical judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for lay people to secondguess a medical practitioner, a clinician.  One of the arguments that can always be made is that it is very difficult to get two clinicians to agree precisely on the same issue.  The approach adopted in this Bill is entirely wrong-headed.  It is wrong-headed because it creates an additional set of institutions rather than seeks to improve the existing institution. An Oireachtas committee looked at the complaints system in the seventies and reported in 1977, on the day on which the Dáil dissolved for a general election. It is probably appropriate enough that we are discussing an Ombudsman institution <Col N="936" /> at this time.  It is interesting that a Government was going out of office and a Fianna Fáil Administration coming into office and perhaps history will repeat itself in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>A change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to suggest that Deputy Harney has simply in view an electoral advantage in introducing this Bill.  I am sure she is absolutely sincere in this, as in all matters.  However, the approach here is entirely wrong-headed. If you are going to improve the complaints system which is available with regard to the health services or any other area of public administration the way to do it is to look at the existing institution and add to its powers.  We have a problem and it is one which has caused me anxiety and about which many people have been critical.  We have a problem with the Ombudsman and with the resources that can be allocated to that office in difficult times.  If we are to fragment the Ombudsman service we will, first, of necessity, get less value for money from that service, but we will do one other thing &mdash; this is the major weakness in Deputy Harney's proposals &mdash; we will. create confusion. Many aspects of the health case could at one stage be a purely administrative matter and at another stage be a clinical matter.  There would be the problem of whether a person goes to one ombuds-person or another.  Unnecessary complications are introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of specialist ombudsmen is well covered in the literature, if the drafter of this Bill had cared to go to the Library and look into that literature.  As far back as the late sixties the whole idea of an ombudsman institution came into vogue in common law countries.  The ombudsman was seen as a widely applicable institution that, with the minimum of complication, could be applied to grievances in the public administration in the widest sense.  The debate that took place at that time, oddly enough, was initiated in the United Kingdom.  It was whether you could have a single ombudsman institution to deal with a wide variety <Col N="937" /> of public administrations.  As it turned out, the United Kingdom authorities took the view that you could not.  First, they introduced a Parliamentary Commission and a very truncated version of the ombudsman was what they introduced in that office.  They then introduced a Local Government Commissioner and subsequenty they introduced the Health Services Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Something like 80 states have adopted the ombudsman institution since 1964, when the New Zealanders first took up the Swedish example.  Of those 80 states, only the United Kingdom went the route that is proposed in this Bill.  I continuously wonder at us in this House. Why is it that if the United Kingdom does something we must copy it?  If the United Kingdom introduces an ombudsman, we have to copy that &mdash; although a debate had been ongoing here since Max Abrahamson produced a discussion paper on it as far back as 1960.  When the British produce a health service ombudsman we automatically think along that route.  We should break from this colonial thinking and strike out for ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that we should extend the ombudsman institution not just because of the Dunne case &mdash; a family I well know and with whom everybody in this House must have sympathy in the sacrifice being made there &mdash; a young family, a young couple selling their house and all that they have in order to vindicate one of the most basic rights, the right to complain and have a complaint heard.  It is clear when you look at that and other cases that we need to examine this issue.  However, the way that is proposed in this Bill, while good populist stuff, is not the correct way.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a couple of points arising from specific aspects of the Bill but before that I want to make a point about an omission on which Deputy Yates just touched.  There is one major weakness in this Bill and that is the way in which we handle people in closed institutions. The Ombudsman Act of 1980 excluded closed institutions and this Bill follows the same very bad route.  One <Col N="938" /> problem that still remains to be resolved in our ombudsman system is how you deal with people in closed institutions, whether we are talking about institutions for mental patients, or prisons, or whatever. There is no power of inspection in our Ombudsman Act, and there is no power of inspection here.  I merely use this point to illustrate that our ombudsman system is weak, could be bolstered up and elaborated on, but this is not the right way to do that.</P>
    <P>The absolute concept, in section 1 (3), that you should have a law creating a health ombudsman, creating an office which is capable of being filled at the same time by the public administration ombudsman, is wrong.  Duplication inevitably reduces two sets of administrations. Undoubtedly, it would create a degree of confusion in the mind of the public.  It unnecessarily draws on the limited resources.  The first weakness is the absolute illogicality there.</P>
    <P>A second weakness is the way in which the Bill actually deals with complaints. If we are going to create a whole new ombudsman structure specifically geared for the health services, one would expect a little innovative thinking, but there is none to be found in this Bill.  Section 3 is simply &mdash; if you pardon the phrase &mdash; a tarted up version of what appears in the Ombudsman Act of 1980.  There is no imagination, no extension in this.  One of the weaknesses about the way in which the 1980 Act defines a complaint is that it focuses unnecessarily on the administrative aspect purely on how the administrative thing is done.  If you are going to create a whole new ombudsman institution in the health services, you must surely have some new thinking.  It is not sufficient just to take the 1980 Ombudsman Act and tart it up ever so slightly.  If you are going to create an ombudsman institution that can look into the health administration, you must think in terms of health administration, but you must think beyond that.</P>
    <P>My understanding of this Bill is that the aim is to fill the lacuna created in the 1980 Act which excludes clinical judgment.  That is not expressly done <Col N="939" /> here.  I am amazed by another section of the Bill.  Section 3 (3) proposes that:</P>
    <P> The Health Ombudsman shall not, however, investigate a complaint referred to in subsection (1) of this section unless the complaint has been made by or on behalf of a person with full or limited eligibility to medical and surgical services or who is the holder of a policy of insurance with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. </P>
    <P>It is not inconceivable that a person who is not eligible for health services and does not have VHI cover could be injured in a road accident.  It is also not inconceivable that such a person could be treated in hospital in a way that would give rise to complaints, yet this Bill would specifically preclude that, because a private patient with no public health cover who finds himself or herself in a hospital would not be covered.  That strikes me as the most extraordinary discrimination and one that surely illustrates the paucity of thinking that went into the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we were, though I doubt we will have the opportunity to fully discuss the Bill, to go down this route, the provisions of section 3 (3) would have to be jettisoned. Likewise the provisions of section 3 (4) are similar to the Ombudsman Act, 1980.</P>

      <P>When this section was last discussed in the House I appealed to the Minister to include south west Offaly and parts of County Laois.  I expressed my disappointment that section 2 did not include the Slieve Bloom area.  I now appeal to the Minister to very strongly consider adding the following list of townlands and include them in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Slieve Bloom mountain range straddles Counties Laois and Offaly.  The excellent Slieve Bloom Association have been developing the region as a whole.

People of all political persuasions have united to make the Slieve Bloom Association a pioneer in the development of tourism in the region.  During the Minister's recent visit to Birr this matter was discussed and people in both counties are most anxious that the area will be included in this Bill.  I am sure the Minister has maps of the area, but I will provide a complete list of the townlands.  The villages and towns affected are: Clonaslee, Camross, Coolraine, Rosenallis, Mountrath, Borris-in-Ossory and Mountmellick.  I am particularly interested that the following list of townlands will be included: Stooagh, Garranabun, Glenconra, Carrowreagh, Rossnacreena, Rossnadough, Derrinduff, Derrycarrow, Garranbaun, Island, Gortnaglogh, Aghduff, Glenkill, Glenall, Srahanbo, Upperwoods, Glenamoon, Glendine, Cummer, Monelly, Johnsborough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that, a Cheann Comhairle, and that is why I am anxious to complete my list: Cardtown, Monasop, Glennaglass, Drimhill or Quarryfarm, Whitefield, Killinure, Drimmo, Rossalee, Paddock, Drim, Deerpark, Shanavur, Briscula, Cavansheath, Knocks, Sconce Upper, Derrycon, Mountainfarm, Gorteennameale, Castleconnor, Moher East, Moher West, Inchanisky, Bokagh, Brisha, Ballyfin Upper, Ballyfin Demesne, Deepark, Rossmore, Ballyhuppahane, Capard, Glenbarrow, Tinnahinch, Corbally, Lackan, Gorteen, Birchwood, Drummabehy, Ballynahown, Killinaparson, Garryhedder, Coolagh, Baunreagh, Bordowin, Monicknew, Cones, Glendineoregan, Barradoos, Glengeen Upper, Gorragh Upper, Ballynalug, Scarroon, Ross, Castlecuff Upper, Glenkeen, Ballymacrory, Clarahill, Kyle, Bunastick, Ballyfarrell, Brittas, Srahduff, Glebe, Ballykenneen Lower, Ballykenneen Upper and Rosenallis.  I will furnish a list to the Minister.  The above townlands are part of the Slieve Bloom park.  As the Minister is aware, the Offaly end is included but the Laois end is not.</P>
      <P>I will quote from a leading article in <i>The Midland Tribune</i> of 18 March last, headed &ldquo;Slieve Bloom Strategy&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" />  The importance of the Slieve Bloom wilderness in the context of tourism development, and the creation of an easily accessible national park in the centre of the country, would sometimes seem to be overlooked by &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I am concerned that this Bill will divide communities in the sense that different organisations will be responsible for tourism in this area.  Under the present arrangement, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company will be responsible for tourism in south-west Offaly, including the mountains as far as the Laois boundary, and Lakeland Tourism will be responsible for that part of the mountains located in County Laois.  It is a pity that two separate organisations will have responsibility for the mountain range.  It will mean a partitioning of the Slieve Bloom mountains.</P>
    <P>The Slieve Bloom Association have long since been pursuing a policy of development right across the Slieve Bloom range.  I visit this area regularly and I know the mountain range.  The people in that area have taken great pride in the development work that has taken place there.  Roads have been built through certain parts of the mountains, facilities have been provided for picnics and maps of the mountain have been provided for Irish and overseas visitors. There is a growing interest in the Slieve Bloom Mountains.  This is not a vast mountain range such as those in Kerry or elsewhere, and there is not the same type of beauty as in the Kerry Mountains or in Wicklow, but it has its own unique features which the Slieve Bloom Association have been developing.  By dividing this area the Minister is making a great mistake.  I will quote a further paragraph from this leading article in <i>The Midland Tribune.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote from another part of the same article and perhaps that will make the position clear to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</P>
      <P> The local people themselves almost twenty years ago came up with the idea of structuring Slieve Bloom Development on the basis of the five Slieve Bloom Villages &mdash; Kinnitty, Cadamstown, Clonaslee, Rosenallis and Camross &mdash; and their own Slieve Bloom Association has been acknowledged nationally as the pioneering group whose solution to the problem of intercounty development in the area is the correct approach. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying is that Kinnitty and Cadamstown will come under one area of responsibility and the other villages mentioned &mdash; Clonaslee, Rosenallis and Camross &mdash; will come under another.  I put this case fairly comprehensively to the Minister on the last occasion when I mentioned these areas that I would like <Col N="944" /> to see included, and I am doing to again tonight.  It would be a pity if the Slieve Bloom was divided into different regions. The unity of the whole area should be maintained.  SFADCo will have responsibility for that part of Offaly and I hope they will be given authority for the whole area.  I put that to the Minister in the most forcible manner possible and hope he will appreciate my feelings and those of the people in the Slieve Bloom area.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been before the House on Committee Stage previously and matters have dragged on a little.  Since then the House has passed the Second Stage of the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, under which the Minister has power to promote industry along the Shannon in areas designated in section 2 of this Bill.  I would like the Minister, in his reply, to say how the Shannon Free Airport Development Company will differ from the proposed corporation in their responsibilities for industrial and tourism promotion along the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright has queried SFADCo's tourism brief in the west and south-west Offaly area.  He has expressed concern about the division of Offaly between two agencies, namely, SFADCo and Bord Fáilte.  He inquired whether Bord Fáilte or SFADCo would be responsible for overseas promotion. He mentioned the Slieve Bloom area in particular, which falls within the remit of both agencies, and he was anxious to see the strategic approach towards tourism development in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright might be under the slight misapprehension that the Bill before the House provides for the extension of SFADCo's operational remit to the west and south-west Offaly area.  In fact, SFADCo assumed the tourism remit in this area on 1 January 1988 when the transfer from the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation to SFADCo took place.  Responsibility for tourism matters in the remainder of County Offaly, which would include Clonmacnoise, remains with the Midland Regional Tourism <Col N="945" /> Organisation who, like all other regional tourist organisations, operate in accordance with the policies and under the direction of Bord Fáilte.  I assure Deputy Enright particularly that there is very close contact between SFADCo and the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation to ensure a co-ordinated, strategic approach to tourism development and promotion in the County Offaly area generally and the Slieve Bloom mountains which he is most concerned about.</P>
    <P>He has also been anxious that there would be an extension of SFADCo's remit to include further areas of County Offaly.  Indeed, he went into considerable detail in informing us of the townlands he felt would particularly benefit by further extension.  I must say I got the impression he probably wished most of County Offaly would be included in the region.  I have to advise him that the Government do not consider it appropriate at present to extend that, not least because it would involve a departure from the boundaries laid down for the seven sub-regions for the purpose of preparing operational programmes in relation to the expanded EC Structural Funds.  One of the principal reasons for the legislation before the House, which brings north Kerry into the mid-west region, is to align it with the planning region for Structural Funds purposes, so I am afraid I must at this time disappoint Deputy Enright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in stating that this matter came in on 1 January 1988.  He will recollect the timing of the announcement as going back a while.  If I recollect properly, the announcement was made some time after Christmas 1987, with very little consultation with the local interested parties in regard to bringing in the different townlands I mentioned here across south Offaly and so on.  I believe that if there had been consultations at the time there would have been a very strong request &mdash; I would go so far as to say a definite demand &mdash; that the townlands that are included in the section would be put in, but that the townlands that are not <Col N="946" /> included which I have mentioned would also be included.</P>
      <P>Let me put it across to the Minister that there is a Slieve Bloom strategy in existence right across the whole mountain range and I am anxious that instead of having the range divided in two, with SFADCo responsible on one side of the range and Lakelands responsible on the other, it would be wiser and better to have all of them included.</P>
      <P>It is no use putting this matter to a vote here tonight, and it is no use having this Bill amended in the Seanad.  If it is amended in the Seanad with the scenario that appears to be developing across the country of late, and while the jury are out and we are waiting for them to return, it will be too late because the Dáil will have been dissolved.  Therefore, I am anxious now to get the Minister's agreement and approval so that this matter can go to the Seanad.  It is a pity the Minister is not accepting the proposals I put to him.  I think that in the long-term the fact that the Slieve Bloom range is being separated will be looked at with regret.  People plan for this area.  There are plans afoot for a long number of years to have a forest park across there.  The land is available. The whole area is ripe for development. Governments, present and past, have spent a considerable amount of funds signposting the areas.  The goodwill of the people is there.  I ask the Minister at this late stage, at the final hour, to accept the amendment I am putting to him.  If he does so he will be seen to be a man who has taken his courage into his hands.</P>

      <P>I regret it would contravene the Government's plan in relation to regional and structural development to extend the areas of Offaly referred to by Deputy Enright.  I am afraid at this stage it would be inappropriate to consider extending it to that area.  Deputy Carey was concerned about overlapping functions between the new corporation in the estuary Bill and SFADCo.  I assure him that adequate provisions are made in the Bill to avoid any overlapping in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House.  We have spent an inordinate amount of time on section 2. SFADCo in many ways could be a blueprint for the type of operation that should occur in future development.  One of our problems in dealing with the Bill has been the question of overlapping.  If SFADCo are taken as they stand we should perhaps have something along the lines of four or five more SFADCos in strategic locations, not least of which I would like to see one in the south-east, indeed in Waterford.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to develop further from this Bill, to give more autonomy to SFADCo, to look at the role of the IDA and the other organisations, at the problems of authority, of who is in control, the problem of overlapping and so on, then the passing of this Bill tonight can be in some way a light on where we are going in future.  I hope the Minister and this Government do not see this Bill as an end in itself but as part of an overall regional strategy as well as fundamentally changing the structure of the IDA in the future.  If that occurs as a result of the passing of this Bill I will be happy to see it passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listed the townlands I have in mind.  In regard to SFADCo's approach to industry, in the time I have dealt with them since I came into south Offaly I found them most efficient, and they produced many successful and satisfactory projects across our area.  In regard to this section, I ask the Minister to have discussions with the Manager and the Secretary of Laois County Council and the tourism and industrial officers of County Laois with regard to including that part of Laois at some future date.  If the Minister does not make an effort to unite the full Slieve <Col N="948" /> Bloom area then the strategy they have been developing will be damaged irreparably.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that a decision has been taken by the Government on this matter. Very likely it will arise again because I am certain the Minister will have continued representations to have the Slieve Bloom area treated as one region.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter seriously with a view to future changes. If that is done, the disappointment which will be felt by many people will be diluted.  The Minister will be going some of the way if he agrees to give this matter his attention.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise <Col N="949" /> this very important issue and the Minister for the Environment for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say on behalf of the many thousands of people in Dublin who avail of what I believe to be one of the best services among the vast range of services provided by the local authorities in the Dublin area.  I am happy to have the opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to the very serious problem which has arisen and is now stalking the library service, which, according to recent reports by the City and County Chief Librarian, Miss Deirdre Ellis King, will continue to deteriorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Perhaps the Minister in the discharge of his many duties in the House is not aware of the chaos in the library services in Dublin.  It is important to bring the matter to his notice and to ask for his urgent and immediate intervention.  I may well be speaking in the last hours, if not days, of the current Dáil but the Minister will be in office long after the dissolution of this House and I would ask him to take urgent action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government embargo on recruitment in the public service generally has meant that by reason of career breaks and retirement &mdash; natural wastage, as it is called in the public service &mdash; there exist 67 vacancies at library officer grade in the Dublin area alone, that is, 67 vacancies out of 286 posts, and there are 28 vacancies out of a total of 104 in other grades providing support services.  In the past two years 95 positions have been vacated and not filled by reason of the embargo.  That represents a depletion by 23 per cent of the officer level of library staff and 24 per cent overall.  Almost a quarter of all the staff have departed and <Col N="950" /> not been replaced.  How has this progressed?</P>
    <P>In 1986 to 31 December the level of loss was 8 per cent; in 1987 it was 16 per cent and in December 1988 it was 22 per cent.  It now stands at 24 per cent overall and because the embargo stands immutable, the indications are that the situation will inevitably become worse due to forms of natural wastage such as, for example, disaffection due to the low level of morale.</P>
    <P>What has this meant in practical terms? In the past six months on 255 separate occasions because there were not sufficient personnel to staff the counters in libraries throughout the city and county the service has been obliged to close. On 255 occasions members of the public attended at one or other of the libraries to find unplanned, unscheduled and unannounced a notice stating that for reasons beyond the control of the Chief Librarian or the staff it was impossible to open the library for a particular period that day.</P>
    <P>We have been advised at Dublin Corporation level by the Chief Librarian that the resources are there to recruit at least 20 additional staff.  Consequently the embargo is the first major problem.  The employment of 20 permanent staff would help to alleviate the problems; almost 100 are needed to replace those that are gone. It is not just a problem of embargo but a problem of additional finance.  Over the last three years the resources have not been increased at all significantly.  In 1986 the allocation available was £6.8 million; in 1987 it was £7.09 million and in 1988 it was decreased to £7.01 million.  Even though there are plans for Navan Road library to be commissioned and Charleville Mall library to be re-opened, resources are at a standstill.</P>
    <P>To try to cope with this problem the Chief Librarian has had to juggle staff about.  With the co-operation of the unions, particularly the Local Government and Public Services Union, who have been forced to launch a public campaign entitled &ldquo;Save Your Local Library&rdquo; to make the public aware of the situation, <Col N="951" /> the Chief Librarian has managed by juggling staff as much as possible.  This has resulted in two serious problems.  The first is that libraries must now close for a full month each year.  Ballyfermot, Coolock and Walkinstown libraries are to close for the month of June; Drumcondra, Inchicore, Pearse Street, Rathmines and the school libraries will close for the month of July; Ballymun, Kevin Street, the mobile libraries which go to the remote and unaccessible areas, Pembroke, Phibsboro, Ringsend and again the school libraries, will close for the month of August.  The mobile libraries, along with Raheny and Terenure libraries, will close for the month of September.</P>
    <P>It means that in working class areas like Ballyfermot, Walkinstown and Coolock, because of over-crowding, people who are obliged to go to their public libraries to study for examinations and people involved in community work will be affected.</P>
    <P>Libraries are not just places for the collection or reading of books.  In Coolock the library is used after hours by the adult literacy group, by creative writing groups and by community play groups. Often the library staff visit community groups, such as child play groups, in their community premises and bring with them books that are relevant to the children, explain to the children how the library works, give them books and collect and return them on an ongoing basis.  All of that stops on 1 June in Ballyfermot, Coolock and Walkinstown.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the Chief Librarian has been obliged to cut back by half the opening hours of some of the other libraries such as Terenure, Dolphin's Barn, Finglas, Pembroke and Donaghmede. They now must close two mornings and two evenings a week simply because there is not enough staff.  If the staff were available the Chief Librarian would have all the libraries open all of the time; that is her objective.  It is difficult to deal with the frustration of the Chief Librarian and her staff resulting from the position they are in.  There is no increase in the allocation of funds.  They are in a position <Col N="952" /> where their finances would allow for some additional recruitment, but there is an absolute embargo and they can recruit no new staff whatever.</P>
    <P>The VEC libraries in the Dublin area are manned and staffed by corporation and county council employees.  In a national report entitled &ldquo;A National Scandal&rdquo; published by the Union of Students in March this year it is indicated that Kevin Street, Bolton Street, the College of Marketing and Design and Rathmines, to name but a few, have the resources within their college budgets to recruit additional staff and would not have to rely on further allocation of resources from the Minister, but they are not allowed to recruit new staff.  It is recommended in the report that 92 staff are needed nationally, the majority in Dublin; currently there are 55 employed in this area and there is a need for 147.</P>
    <P>What prompted me more than anything to raise this question was a brief look at the problem that exists in my own constituency of Dublin North East. Coolock Library faces the prospect of closure for the month of June.  The staff will not be going on holidays but will be deployed in other libraries so that staff there can take their holidays; part of the time the Coolock staff will be afforded annual leave.  This library is one of the largest in the city.  It was spared having to close last year because of its significance and importance as a community facility, because so many community groups avail of these premises and its fine library facilities.  At a meeting last Monday morning group leaders, teachers, public health nurses and day care workers in the constituency indicated that they would not stand idly by and see the library close on 1 June because they consider it an essential service.  As a public representative I tried to convey the difficulties faced by the Chief Librarian. They simply argued that it must be taken to the highest level, that the Minister must be made aware of it.  It is on their behalf that I am asking the Minister this evening to look at the problem of this facility and to ensure that Coolock Library does not close for the month of June. I <Col N="953" /> would ask the Minister to meet with the representatives of the community who were so incensed by the facts presented to them at the meeting.  Here I must pay tribute to the position taken by Alderman Haughey, one of the representatives.  I hope I paraphrase correctly his views expressed at the meeting when he said clearly that the economies &mdash; I prefer to call them cutbacks &mdash; visited on the Corporation by Government in the last Estimates would seem to have gone too far in the case of library services and to be now working against the better good of the services and the community at large.  He supports the campaign, and the request that the Minister might meet with him, myself and the community leaders from Coolock to discuss this very urgent problem.</P>
    <P>Donaghmede, the library next to Coolock, at the heart of the constituency, is one of those libraries staffed by two shifts with the result that should one member of the staff be unable to attend at work through illness or for other personal reasons the city librarian has no alternative but to close the door.  One of the problems with the reduction in staff is that there is not the traditional pool of relief workers available to the chief Librarian.  In October in Dublin there will be a relief pool comprising one person, on present predictions.  The situation is impossible and is brought about by the embargo and because so many people have left on retirement or on career break.  I had understood that in the area of career breaks there was a discretion available at local authority level, if services were being threatened.  However, we were given advice at local authority level that there was no discretion available and that once a person applied he was entitled to be released from duties.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle was visited by members of The Workers' Party in a survey of the services over the last week.  There an old RIC barracks has been converted to library use.  At the moment its windows are boarded because there are no funds to provide for the installation of proper windows.  The only light is from an electric <Col N="954" /> bulb and the library is utterly inappropriate as a reading room.  Because of staff numbers there, on many occasions it has been forced to close.  The same position exists with regard to Howth. There is a major problem with regard to staff who feel embarrassed when having to deal with irate members, who are annoyed because the service is not there, when the library reopens.  The Howth library particularly is used by many elderly and retired people.  Something of the order of 60 per cent of its users are elderly or retired and they find it extremely frustrating when they arrive at the doors and find them closed.  There is no advance warning of closure because no one has devised a system to deal with that.  Many of these people have difficulty travelling to and from libraries.  The library in Raheny also faces full closure for the month of September.</P>
    <P>If the embargo is not lifted the position will deteriorate and some Dublin libraries will be entirely closed on a temporary basis with the staff being sent to the bigger libraries in the city where people will be advised to go.  It is sad to have to report this situation to the House and perhaps one could say it is a matter that could be dealt with at local level. However, the library service is crucially important.  The library service in Dublin is one of the best services delivered by the local authority.  The quality of our-libraries is second to none in the country. The Ilac Centre library is probably the finest public library in the country.  We have a willing and eager staff committed to the expansion and development of a comprehensive service, so it is very sad that we have to talk today about the possibility of the closure of libraries on a temporary basis.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan on how important is this matter of the public library service and on how the public libraries have over the years provided such a fine service of which we can all be proud.  Not only do they provide a source of recreation accessible to all members of the community but they put at the disposal of ordinary people a means of furthering their education and self-improvement. The library service also furthers appreciation of cultural matters and of our heritage and history.</P>
      <P>In many areas the public library provides an important focal point for the community both as a general amenity, and through the provision of facilities to local groups for meetings, lectures, the provision of local information services and other community-related &ldquo;outreach&rdquo; activities.  The library service has placed special emphasis on the needs of the young.  The old-fashioned image of rows of books in a silent room presided over by a stern-faced librarian is long gone. Many of our libraries can now boast the most modern facilities, presented in a pleasant and user-friendly environment.</P>

    <P>In recent years, despite financial constraints or economies in the service, there has been considerable development in the library service in the Dublin area.  In addition to the Ilac Centre and Dalkey, new libraries have opened at Ballyfermot, Ballyroan, Deansgrange, Balbriggan, Coolock, Finglas, Donaghamede, Swords, Blanchardstown and Castletymon during the past ten years or so, not to mention the Dublin <Col N="956" /> Youth Information Centre at Sackville Place operated by the Dublin Public Library Service.  A new mobile library was brought into service last year.  The library service in Dublin is now computerised, a very big advance which is not available to many other library services throughout the country.  When one allows for a more efficient method of operation and a better standard of service to the public, computerisation is more cost-effective.</P>
    <P>These developments have been brought about through sizeable investments of public funds by my Department and the local authorities.  My area of responsibility is the provision of capital funding for library development.  The total capital allocations from my Department for the facilities which I have referred to above amounted to over £4.6 million.  This does not include the annual subsidy paid to local authorities towards the cost of loan and leasing charges on library facilities which, in the case of the Dublin area, amounted to £440,000 in 1988 alone.</P>
    <P>Further development of the library service in parts of the Dublin area may be desirable.  However, I would point out that the share of annual national allocations for libraries going to the Dublin area averaged 25 per cent over the past ten years and has been as high as 43 per cent.  No doubt every local authority would like to have access to increased resources for development.  I only wish that the progress which has been made in Dublin was reflected equally throughout the country.  It is not.  Deputy McCartan, being the fair-minded man that he is, would agree that the people outside of the Dublin area are entitled to as good a service as that which exists in the Dublin area.  The state of development of the service is not even throughout the country, and it should be.  This fact was highlighted in the report of the Public Library Service Review Group published in February 1987.  Deputy McCartan will appreciate that the people in other parts of the country have as much right to knowledge through the public library service as those in Dublin, but it has not <Col N="957" /> been evenly distributed during the past few years.</P>
    <P>This is a problem I inherited on coming into office and it is one I would like and hope to address as resources permit. Despite unavoidable retrenchment in public expenditure I have kept State funding for libraries at a consistent level in recent years.  Almost £3 million is being allocated for libraries this year, the same as in 1988.  There are not too many services about which this can be said. Because of my special interest in libraries they have retained the same level of funding as last year.  I regard this as something to be considered carefully when we talk about making available scarce resources for other services.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on libraries in Ireland compares quite favourably with other countries.  Often it is stated otherwise, but the facts speak for themselves.  For example, library bookstock per head of population is higher than other countries, except Denmark and the Netherlands, and only Denmark and the United Kingdom have more libraries per head of the population.  Therefore, in one way we are well served and well serviced by the libraries and the books which reside in those libraries.</P>
    <P>While the State has an important role in the development of the library service, nevertheless, the onus is, of course, as Deputy McCartan rightly said, on the local authority to operate the service in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  Only the local authority itself in each case can make judgements in the light of local circumstances and determine priorities having regard to available resources and needs and demands generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effects of the embargo on recruitment I should explain that the Dublin local authorities are responsible for the staffing arrangements in the libraries.  This would extend to the provision of necessary finance, appointments, development of staff and so on. While I have certain functions in the personnel area, for example, in relation to qualifications, procedure for appointments, creation of offices and so on, the <Col N="958" /> main responsibility rests squarely on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The corporation and county council are of course subject to the recruitment embargo in the public service in common with other local authorities and public service bodies.  I am aware that there have been reductions in the level of staffing in the corporation and county council, including the library service.  It is, however, incumbent on the local authorities to ensure that their services are operated in the most efficient and effective way within the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>I understand that it has been the practice in recent years for certain libraries in Dublin to close temporarily during the summer months and for many years this was the normal practice during the holiday periods.  This arrangement is carried out on a planned rota basis.  The implementation of these arrangements is entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned.  I am satisfied that the authorities will have full regard to ensuring that resources are deployed in the most effective manner possible and that every possible step will be taken by them to ensure that the arrangements are carried out in such a way as to cause the minimum inconvenience to the public.</P>
    <P>I am a supporter of the public library service.  I have given evidence of this in one simple way, the way in which everybody in this House judges everything.  I have provided money over and above that which was available for other services and I have maintained the level of funding for the library service on a par with what was made available last year. I cannot say that I was able to do this in respect of every other service, but because of the importance attached to the library service and the opportunities it gives to people to improve themselves, I would like to think that I could maintain my attitude and provide as much funding as possible in the hope that I will be successful in providing the best service possible throughout the country in a balance way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The prison authorities are aware that incidents of drug abuse take place within the prisons from time to time and although there is no evidence to suggest that such abuse is widespread, it is obviously a matter for concern in respect of <Col N="761" /> which all appropriate and acceptable preventative measures must be taken.</P>
    <P>There are obvious difficulties in dealing with this matter.  On the one hand, the fact that drug quantities can be very small and easy to conceal suggests a need for strict surveillance and searching procedures. At the same time there is the need to preserve the right balance between the measures necessary to preserve the smuggling of drugs into prisons and the trafficking in drugs within prisons and the preservation of an acceptable humane regime.  Constant vigilance on the part of prison staff must be relied upon as one of the most effective methods of deterrence.  Among the measures which have been taken are the installation of a number of closed circuit television cameras and, in addition, visits to prisoners who are strongly suspected of having or using drugs are restricted to areas where the passing of drugs can be prevented.  Facilities provided for those addicted to drugs have been outlined by me on a number of occasions &mdash; they include medical, psychological, psychiatric, welfare, chaplaincy and educational services as well as visits and counselling by appropriate community-based groups.  The commitment and co-operation of the individual concerned, whether inside or outside prison, is of course of fundamental importance to the success of any programme designed to help in overcoming any drug problem.</P>

      <P>The introduction into this country of Colorado beetle on vegetables, vehicles or in any other way is prohibited under national and EC legislation. The authorities in the exporting country are obliged to ensure that consignments of vegetables are free of Colorado beetle and, during the active period of the beetle from April to October, they must make a specific examination of leafy vegetables.  Check inspections of imported vegetables are carried out by officers of my Department at wholesale and retail points of sale.  My Department also issues supplies of warning leaflets to the Automobile Association and to commercial ferry companies who pass them on to people taking vehicles abroad.</P>
      <P>The Colorado beetle occurs freely in continental Europe and as a consequence some risk of infestation in this country will always exist.  My Department will ensure that the phytosanitary regulations are fully enforced but there is also need for continued vigilance by importers and the public.</P>
      <P>Increased home production of vegetables is the most effective way to reduce the risk.  This objective is being pursued by An Bord Glas.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 85/3/EEC of 19 December 1984 [OJ No. L.2 of 3/1/1985] fixed a maximum gross vehicle weight of 40 tonnes for five and six axle articulated trucks and road trains circulating internationally. The limits became operative in EC member states &mdash; except Ireland and the UK &mdash; on 1 July 1986.  Ireland and the UK secured a derogation to retain a national limit of 38 tonnes because of the need to improve the roads infrastructure &mdash; notably bridges &mdash; to carry the heavier lorries.</P>
      <P>In January 1989 the EC Commission submitted a comprehensive report to the EC Council of Ministers on the duration of the derogations for Ireland and the U.K. The EC Commission proposed that the derogation should end by 31 December 1996.  Ireland accepted the terminal date proposed by the EC Commission &mdash; on the understanding that the cost of the strengthening/replacement of bridges would qualify for EC grant aid at the maximum rate.  The UK have not yet announced their view on the Commissioner's proposal.  The EC Council of Transport Ministers hope to decide the terminal date at their meeting in Luxembourg on 5 and 6 June 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to provide for a legal <Col N="785" /> prohibition on lorries in major urban centres. The transport objectives of the operational programme for roads include: the provision of an adequate inter-urban network of national roads linking major urban centres, ports and airports; the reduction of urban congestion by providing new river crossings, ring roads and relief roads; and the elimination of traffic bottlenecks by the by-passing of towns on national roads.  These measures are designed to minimise, as far as practicable, the need for lorries to go through urban centres en route to a destination on the national road network or to an important port.</P>

      <P>I have received a report from the Southern Health Board which states that ambulance control at Tralee General Hospital received a 999 call at 14.25 hours on 10 May last.  The caller stated that a boy had collapsed at St. Joseph's School, Tralee and the assistance of a doctor was requested.  On hearing the request for a doctor, the Board Telecom operator interrupted the call and connected the caller to a local doctor.</P>
      <P>At 14.38 hours another call was received at ambulance control from the same caller and an ambulance was requested.  The caller advised that a local doctor was with the patient.  The controller advised the caller that there was no ambulance immediately available.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The controller then phoned St. Joseph's School at 14.44 hours to check the position and was advised that the child had been taken to hospital in the <Col N="791" /> doctor's car.  The patient arrived at the hospital's accident and emergency department at 14.49 hours and, I understand, was dead on arrival.</P>
    <P>Given the known incidence and emergency ambulance call-outs in the Tralee area, over the last three years, it was an extremely rare occurrence that an emergency ambulance was not available in this instance.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health, regarding a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 who is awaiting a tonsillectomy at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin 1 and who has been on a waiting list since 15 January 1988, if he will outline the proposals, if any, he has to ensure that the two-and-a-half year waiting list will be reduced; and if he will make adequate funds available to the hospital in order that such operations are carried out without delay.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the clinical decision of the consultant concerned and the hospital authority.  Nonurgent (elective) cases may be put on a waiting list to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly. I would suggest to the Deputy that if the patient's condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, is considering measures to reduce its ENT waiting list and I am monitoring the situation closely.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether it is the case that the general hospitals in Dublin will not receive casualty cases for children under the age of 14 and instead insist on referring them to the children's hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Accident and emergency services for children under the age of 14 years in Dublin are provided in the three children's hospitals, i.e. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street, and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  In some cases very young children may be treated in the maternity hospitals.</P>
      <P>All of these hospitals are on call on a 24 hour, seven day week basis.  Should a child present at the accident and emergency department of an acute general hospital when it is &ldquo;on call&rdquo; they will be seen by a doctor who would assess the case.  It has been the normal procedure to transfer children to one of the three children's hospitals if it is decided that a children's hospital is the most appropriate location for the treatment of the child.</P>

    <P>(b)  It is my policy that mentally handicapped persons receive appropriate services as required.  To this end I have ensured, despite the overall financial constraints, that the allocations for the agencies providing such services have been protected in real terms and that these services are provided in a co-ordinated prioritised way.  The regional co-ordinating committee's representative of the Department, the health boards and the voluntary agencies are at present assessing the position particularly in relation to any unmet need. When the unmet need is comprehensively quantified I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
