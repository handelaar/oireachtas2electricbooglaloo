      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter that I have raised in this House twice already I have received overnight certain information which no longer causes me to seek to raise the matter on the Adjournment but I wish to raise it again on the Order of Business.  When is the Taoiseach going to allow this House to debate such an important matter?  The information given to the House yesterday to the effect that the Garda investigation has been terminated is not the case, but the information I have received is of such an order that I believe it is profoundly important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the House reconvened on Tuesday I raised on the Order of Business the matter which Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte raised yesterday and which Deputy Rabbitte raised again this morning.  In the light of the difficulties being experienced due to the lack of confidence in the planning process in Dublin, would the Taoiseach please arrange for a statement to be made by the Minister for the Environment on the current position regarding the investigation being conducted into an alleged bribery scandal in the planning process in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment indicated yesterday on the Order of Business that it was his intention to introduce, under the EC legislation of 1972, regulations to give effect to the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Studies.  Does motion No. 4 on list No. 1 of the Order Paper circulated on Tuesday do the job for him since it is based on an earlier draft provided by the Department of the Environment?  Does this motion in the name of the Parliamentary Labour Party suffice?  Since he has already acknowledged receipt of the same draft directive perhaps we might accelerate the business of the House by consensus. Could he accept the draft directive as written by the Labour Party on behalf of his Department if it would comply with our obligations to the Community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister did not fully understand my question.  Since we have taken a draft prepared by his Department in respect of motorways under exactly the same EC Directive which was published by the Department of the Environment and extended it to cover other aspects, can the Minister indicate, since his Department have already received the draft directive, if this complies with his drafting requirements? If so, will he allow it to proceed in the normal manner?</P>

    <Title>Larceny Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to make life harder for those who receive and deal in stolen property by replacing the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a more broadly based offence of handling stolen property.</P>
      <P>As well as receiving, the new offence will cover such dishonest activities as undertaking or assisting in the retention, removal, disposal or realisation of stolen property by another or for another's benefit. If a prosecution is to succeed at present for an offence of receiving, it is necessary to prove that the accused had actual knowledge that the property in question was stolen.  This presents serious difficulties for the gardaí and prosecuting authorities in bringing to justice people who deal dishonestly in stolen property. The new offence will require that the accused knew or believed that the property in question was stolen.  &ldquo;Believing&rdquo; in this context will include &ldquo;thinking that the property was probably stolen&rdquo;.  This change will make it more difficult for people who handle goods dishonestly to escape conviction.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains important new provisions regarding the possession of articles for use in larceny, burglary and related offences.  As well as covering such obvious items as jemmies and picklocks, the new provisions are widely enough expressed to include things like documents in connection with bogus charity collections, stolen credit cards or the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regard the Bill as providing an important new legal weapon to the Garda authorities in the fight <Col N="746" /> against crime.  It is aimed at those who sustain the crime industry by providing a market in illegally obtained property.  It can apply equally to the man who buys a video in a pub &ldquo;at the right price, no questions asked&rdquo; and to the shadowy wholesaler in stolen property, the &ldquo;fence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The handling or receiving of stolen property is profoundly threatening to our society; it fosters crime generally and larceny in particular.  I have no doubt that if the highly organised receiving gangs were broken up, much of the pillage which takes place in our homes, factories and industrial estates would be significantly reduced.  Obviously stolen goods have little value if no market can be found for them.  For this reason the Bill provides a sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment for handling.  This maximum is an appropriate reflection of the serious view that the Government and society take of what must be regarded as an insidious cancer.</P>
    <P>This Bill largely follows from the 1987 Law Reform Commission Report on Receiving Stolen Property, which recommended that the Larceny Act, 1916, should be amended in order to address serious difficulties being experienced in the prosecution of receiving offences. The Bill also broadly reflects the intentions of the 1985 Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill, which was entitled the Larceny (Amendment) Bill, 1985.  This Bill was opposed by the then Government. However, they recognised that problems existed with this area of the law and subsequently asked the Law Reform Commission to formulate proposals for the reform of the law relating to dishonesty.</P>
    <P>The commission decided as a first step to consider the law relating to receiving stolen property and, having examined the matter in some depth, issued their report at the end of 1987.  The commission's further proposals in relation to larceny, fraud and other offences in the Larceny Act, 1916, are awaited.  As I have indicated, the commission's recommendations are the principal source of the proposals contained in this Bill.  The <Col N="747" /> commission put the point succinctly when they say that:</P>
    <P>.... the existing law permits receivers of stolen property to escape conviction for unjustifiable reasons .... it also facilitates crimes of dishonesty over a wide area.</P>
    <P>The commission also remark that:</P>
    <P>.... present law on receiving is in many respects unnecessarily favourable to the accused, presents unreasonable obstacles to the prosecution and is seriously out of date.</P>
    <P>It is an old saying that &ldquo;if there were no receivers there would be no thieves&rdquo;. Whatever the absolute truth of that statement, the law enforcement authorities here have been concerned for some time that there appears to be a ready market for stolen property in this country, and that the availability of willing buyers has encouraged theft to a significant extent. It is also clear that the relevant provision in the Larceny Act, 1916, is ineffective in securing the conviction of some persons who, on any objective view, are dishonestly trading in stolen property.</P>
    <P>The core of the problem of establishing guilt in receiving cases relates to the <i>mens rea</i> or mental state of the accused which must be established.  Section 33 of the Larceny Act, 1916, which deals with the present offence of receiving, requires that the accused person should have received the stolen property &ldquo;knowing the same to have been stolen&rdquo;.  The requirement that the accused actually knew that the property was stolen excludes persons who, while not knowing for certain that the property is stolen, believe or strongly suspect it to be so. Neither thief nor receiver would, I am sure, be bothered, in the normal course of their transactions, to go into very great detail by way of discussion as to the provenance of the goods that one is selling to the other.  A belief or strong suspicion by the purchaser as to the illicit origin of the goods may, however, be evident from the circumstances in which the deal was struck.  However blameworthy, this <Col N="748" /> would not amount to the guilty knowledge at present required by the law to justify a conviction for the offence of receiving stolen property.</P>
    <P>In order to get over this problem, section 3 of the Bill provides that a person shall be guilty if he knew or believed that the property was stolen, and for the purposes of the section, belief is defined as including &ldquo;thinking that the property was probably stolen&rdquo;.  This new offence is more widely defined than the present offence of receiving.  The wider definition of the offence brings within its scope, in addition to receivers, those who undertake or assist in the retention, removal, disposal or realisation of stolen property by or for the benefit of another, or those who arrange to do any of those things. &ldquo;Stolen property&rdquo;, as defined by section 7 of the Bill, includes also property which has been obtained by false pretences, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion or blackmail.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) of the new section 33 of the Larceny Act, substituted by section 3 of the Bill, places an evidential burden on the accused in a handling case in certain circumstances.  It provides that where it is established that the accused handled stolen property in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that he knew or believed the property was stolen, it will be taken that he knew or believed that the property was stolen unless the court or jury, as the case may be, is satisfied, having regard to all the evidence before it, that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew or believed that the property he handled was, in fact, stolen.  Evidence which could cast a reasonable doubt as to the guilty knowledge of the accused could be placed before the court, either by the testimony of the accused himself or that of others on his behalf; or the reasonable doubt could indeed be inferred by the court or jury from the appearance and demeanour of the accused, or the case made by his legal representative, or even from the evidence given for the prosecution itself.</P>
    <P>One of the more unusual provisions in the Larceny Act, 1916, is that contained <Col N="749" /> in section 43 (1) which renders admissible in receiving cases in certain circumstances evidence as to the previous conduct of the accused.  This provision may be regarded as one of the exceptions to the general rule that evidence of an accused's previous misconduct or convictions may not be adduced during the course of a trial.  Evidence which may be admitted under this provision includes proof of convictions in the previous five years for any offence involving fraud or dishonesty and/or evidence that other stolen property had been found in the possession of the accused in the previous 12 months.  The Law Reform Commission have indicated their reservations about this provision as tending to admit evidence prejudicial to the rights of the accused when it was invoked.  Accordingly, the commission advocated its repeal.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with the commission that the provision, as it stands, may go too far, in that it might tend to prejudice the rights of the accused.  However, I feel that to repeal the provision outright might tip the scales of justice too far in the opposite direction. Since the offence requires knowledge or belief on the part of the accused that the property was stolen, it is surely relevant for that purpose that the accused has a recent history involving stolen property. I am satisfied that evidence of this type has been vital in the past in helping to establish the <i>mens rea</i> of the accused in cases where it might otherwise have been impossible to do so.  It has helped to bring guilty men to justice for over a century. The Government are, I believe, correct in moving to retain this provision, albeit in a considerably modified form and with new safeguards, in the interests of preventing crime and bringing big time criminals to justice.</P>
    <P>The safeguards I propose in regard to the new provisions are, firstly, that evidence of previous possession or previous convictions should be admissible only in cases where handling or receiving is the sole charge faced by the accused.  Secondly, it is proposed to narrow considerably the range of previous <Col N="750" /> convictions which may be cited in evidence to convictions for larceny and receiving or handling stolen property.  At present the Larceny Act permits any offence involving fraud or dishonesty to be cited in this type of case.  This could include, theoretically, submitting a false income tax return for instance.  Finally, it is proposed in the Bill that, in future, evidence as to previous possession or convictions in respect of the accused could only be adduced in the trial after it has been shown that he had, or arranged to have, the property the subject of the charge in his possession or that he arranged to undertake or assist in its retention, disposal or realisation.  Under the present section 43 the requirement that the prosecution must first prove that the accused was in possession of the property to which the charge relates applies only to the giving of evidence of his previous convictions but not to the giving of evidence that other stolen property had been found in his possession.</P>
    <P>In their report on receiving, the Law Reform Commission referred to the anomaly in the law in so far as receiving property stolen outside the State is concerned. This is that, according to two decisions of the Supreme Court, it is not an offence at present to receive here property stolen in England, Scotland or Wales even though it is an offence to receive here property stolen anywhere else, including Northern Ireland.  Section 7 of the Bill gets rid of this anomaly by applying the offence of handling to property stolen anywhere outside the State.</P>
    <P>Another of the difficulties in the application of the present law on receiving relates to the finding of alternative verdicts in cases where there was a doubt as to whether the accused was the receiver or the thief of the property in question.  At present a person accused only of receiving must be acquitted if the evidence shows that he was, in fact, the thief.  I think Deputies will find little difficulty in agreeing with the Law Reform Commission's recommendation to remove this anomaly, which is followed in section 8 of the Bill.  The particular <Col N="751" /> need for alternative verdicts arises because the external circumstances of stealing and handling can be very similar though they are quite separate offences.</P>
    <P>One of the questions raised by the commission's report on receiving stolen property related to the penalties provided under the Larceny Act for larceny and receiving offences.  The commission advocated that both crimes should attract the same maximum penalty of ten years. I do not feel that a sufficiently strong case has been made out which would justify. removing the higher maximum penalty of 14 years which has hitherto applied to receiving offences &mdash; as compared with the present general maximum penalty of five years and the proposed new standard maximum of ten years for larceny.  There are many instances in which the receiver of stolen property is, in fact, the instigator of theft &mdash; particularly where valuable or unusual items are stolen.  It is wrong in my view that the courts should not have power to punish the generals of crime more severely then the footsoldiers whom they get to do their dirty work. For this reason, as I have said, the Bill provides a maximum of 14 years for handling stolen property, as against ten for larceny and other related offences.</P>
    <P>The present law provides a wide variety of maximum prison sentences for different specific types of larceny and related offences.  These range from a maximum 18 months for stealing a dog to life imprisonment for stealing, say, a will.  The opportunity has been taken in this Bill to set at ten years the maximum sentence for all types of larcey specified in the 1916 Act, and also for the related crimes of blackmail, obtaining by false pretences, embezzlement and fraudulent conversion. A further innovation in the Bill is the power it gives a court, when passing sentence on conviction on indictment for handling, larceny or related offences, to impose a fine in addition to or in substitution for a term of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings into line with the proposed changes in the Larceny Act, 1916, various provisions in the Post Office Act, 1908, and the Defence Act, 1954, dealing <Col N="752" /> with receiving offences and larceny related offences.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the provision in the Bill, at section 2, in relation to the possession of articles for use in the course of or in connection with larceny, burglary, other types of dishonesty covered by the Larceny Act, and taking a vehicle without authority.  This provision largely follows a recommendation in the Law Reform Commission's 1985 report on vagrancy and related offences and updates the law considerably on the offences of possession of housebreaking implements, etc. which is at present provided for in the Vagrancy Act, 1984, and at section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1916. The present offences relate to a narrow and outdated range of housebreaking equipment: picklocks and crows, etc. and somewhat anomalously, in the case of the Larceny Act, confines the offence to persons found in possession by night only.  Members will be aware that the cloak of darkness is by no means an essential prerequisite for the criminal.  The new provision goes somewhat further than the Law Reform Commission's proposal in that it brings in within the scope of the offence possession of articles for carrying out, for instance, an act of fraud or blackmail. This would encompass, for instance, begging circulars from bogus charities or any of the other items that door-to-door conmen use in plying their unscrupulous trade.  The proposed penalty of a maximum of five years imprisonment and/or a fine is consistent with the present section 28 of the Larceny Act.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the Law Reform Commission's work on the subject areas in question.  They have surveyed the state of the present law, both in this jurisdiction and in many others, and have put forward reasoned proposals for legislative change.  The task of the Government in considering the issues dealt with in this Bill was made very much easier by the reports of the commission, and the House as a whole owes them a debt of gratitude in this regard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I regard this Bill as providing the law <Col N="753" /> enforcement agencies with a powerful weapon in the fight against crime, whether petty or organised.  There is a public perception that people who on any objective view are dealing dishonestly in stolen property are able to exploit the inadequacies of the present law so as to escape justice.  I am convinced that this Bill will redress that situation and will strengthen the hand of the prosecuting authorities in bringing such people to book.  I look forward to a constructive debate on this Stage, and the co-operation of the House in ensuring that the Bill becomes law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to welcome the Minister who is making his first speech to the House as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Larceny Bill in principle but I have major reservations about its likely effectiveness in bringing to justice receivers and handlers of stolen property. Furthermore, I can foresee constitutional difficulties in relation to some of its provisions. I am particularly concerned that the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission has not been adopted by the Government and no satisfactory explanation has been given by the Minister for Justice for deviating from the recommendations in that report. Overall, it is clear that the Bill is defective in many respects and will need to be substantially amended and, I believe, referred to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality.</P>
      <P>I took with a grain of salt the references by the Minister to the work of the Law Reform Commission.  It is marvellous work but the Minister, having complimented the commission on the work they did, has largely ignored their recommendations as to how this problem should be tackled.  The onus is on the Minister to justify the approach he has adopted in the publication of this Bill and he has not discharged that onus of proof in his speech to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go into the detail of the Bill I should like to say that there is virtually unanimous opinion that the law needs to <Col N="754" /> be reformed.  Receiving and handling the proceeds of crime is now a major industry. Last year alone the value of property stolen increased from £31 million to £34 million of which less than £3 million worth was recovered.  Further confirmation of the current crime wave is provided in the figures for offences against property in the recently published 1988 report on crime.  Such offences with violence, including burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery etc. increased to 35,679 and larcencies, forgeries and fraud offences of various kinds went up by over 3,000 to 51,291.  That gives an idea of the scope of the problem with which we are dealing.  In effect between the two categories of offences over 85,000 offences were recorded to the Garda.  Despite these appalling figures over 268 convictions were recorded for receiving stolen goods.  Obviously crime does pay in a big way nowadays.  The job of Government is to initiate the necessary changes to reverse that position.</P>
    <P>My own view is that no progress of any consequence will be made while the problem is handled in a piecemeal fashion.  A major campaign against crime is necessary.  Such a campaign must include changes in the operational structures and the management and training of the Garda Síochána.  Crime prevention must be given a new priority and there must be a particular emphasis on relieving gardaí from routine office administrative duties and other non-police work so that more members are available on the streets and in housing estates. Changes must be made in our prison system so that the revolving door syndrome is ended.  The Minister must ensure that minor offenders, such as those unable to pay fines, are not clogging up the available accommodation.  Hardened criminals must serve their full sentences. For them there should be no prospect of early release because of over-crowding.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is necessary to undertake urgently a whole programme involving a review and updating of our criminal code.  While the new Bill is one necessary piece of legislation it is merely a small <Col N="755" /> part of the comprehensive programme of law reform that is necessary.  It is an even smaller part of the overall campaign against crime which is so urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of the Bill involves the replacement of the existing charge of receiving by a new offence of handling stolen goods.  The Minister mentioned that under existing law nothing less than actual knowledge that goods are stolen is sufficient to found a conviction for receiving stolen goods.  A belief that the goods were stolen, falling short of such knowledge, will not suffice and, of course, mere suspicion that they were stolen or recklessness &mdash; that is an important word in the context of what I have to say later &mdash; as to the provenance of goods is not sufficient to found a conviction.  As a result many prosecutions have been unsuccessful and many more have not been brought at all.  That is clear from the figures I have quoted: there were only 268 convictions recorded for receiving last year out of a total of 85,000 offences for larceny and related crimes.  Clearly, our present law on receiving is unreasonably favourable to the accused.  It presents unreasonable obstacles to the prosecution and is seriously out of date. So far we have common case but from here on we have some problems.</P>
    <P>The main question to be addressed is whether the new approach outlined in the Bill will be effective.  All of us in this House want to see a Bill that is going to be effective in tackling the godfathers of crime.  My worry is that this Bill will not achieve that effect.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission examined 12 possible legislative strategies in considering the difficult question of the mental element in the offence of receiving or handling stolen property.  Quite rightly, the Minister in his speech indicated that the core of the problem of establishing guilt relates to the <i>mens rea</i>, the mental state.  If one looks at the various strategies examined by the Law Reform Commission, these ranged from liability based on receiving without regard to the belief of the accused as to <Col N="756" /> whether the goods were stolen right up the line to the need to prove that the accused was actually certain that the goods were stolen.  In the gradual process from complete disregard for the mental element the commission discussed possible approaches including reception, whether a reasonable person ought to suspect or ought to have been certain that the goods were stolen.  They discussed an approach involving suspicion and also an approach involving recklessness.  They also examined shifting the onus of proof. They looked at a graded solution where the severity of punishment would depend on the <i>mens rea</i> and they also looked at the question of imposing more onerous obligations on convicted receivers.  Ultimately, the commission concluded after, obviously, much thought, debate, consultation and deliberation that the test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were unlawfully obtained.  They recommended the definition of recklessness as provided for in the draft model penal code in the US.  Clearly the Minister has taken a radically different approach.  He seems to have adopted the UK approach of liability which is based on reception where the accused believed that the goods were stolen.  I do not know whether it is symptomatic of a tendency in this country, not just by this Government, to look at the situation abroad and to end up following the British model.  I am not saying that the British model in all cases is the one we should not follow but there is clear evidence in the Law Reform Commission report, in this instance, that it certainly is not the one we should be following.  I think it is worth quoting the Law Reform Commission's comment on this legislative approach.</P>
    <P>This solution was adopted in section 22 of the English Theft Act 1968, to unfortunate effect.  These difficulties have been attributed to the judicial interpretation of the section.</P>
    <P>Later on, the commission stated and again I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> There is however an inherent problem with using the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in this context, which the English courts were surely correct in sensing.  Belief admits of different degrees of commitment, ranging from certitude to suspicion. There is little advantage in a legislative definition which leaves the question of the accused's <i>mens rea</i> in such an imprecise state.</P>
    <P>There is a further quoted observation from the report which is relevant to this discussion.  It goes as follows:</P>
    <P>Sometimes you would think that the courts were trying to make a dog's breakfast of the law of handling stolen goods.  In one line of cases in Section 22 of the <i>Theft Act,</i> 1968 they have interpreted the words &ldquo;knowing or believing them to be stolen&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;knowing or knowing them to be stolen&rdquo;, so perpetuating the defect in the earlier law which the addition of the words `or believing' was designed to cure.</P>
    <P>My concern now that these dangers have been pointed out to us by the very intensive and marvellous work of the Law Reform Commission is that the Minister is making a dog's breakfast of this proposed solution.  He has not followed the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission which was that the test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen.  I have a real concern that the Minister may be presenting a rogues' charter which will keep the courts busy for years with judicial interpretation and which will do nothing to seal the legal loophole which now exists.</P>
    <P>When one compares the report of the commission with what appears in the Bill it is clear that the Minister has deviated from the recommendation of the commission which, clearly and unequivocally, stated that the same sentence should be provided for larceny and receiving.  The Minister has provided for a maximum of 14 years for handling and a lesser period of ten years for the person who stole the <Col N="758" /> goods.  The Minister in his speech seemed to indicate that he thought the approach adopted by him was a better way of getting at the general of crime.  Maybe he has a point, I will not quarrel with him. Obviously I would like to see the generals of crime brought to justice but it may be that those generals of crime may be engaged in the business of larceny.  It may be that, as provided for in this Bill, when they are hauled before the courts the correct conviction to be recorded against them is larceny rather than receiving or handling.  It seems the Minister has limited the weapons in the hands of the prosecution by limiting the penalty applicable to those who steal the goods in the first place.  Clearly, it runs counter to the view expressed by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>An even more serious point has emerged on the question of penalties.  The commission recommended that the court should be able to order compensation by the handler to the victim of the primary offence.  Again, this recommendation has been totally ignored by the Minister. Why?  Surely it is sensible, proper, just and right that we should have consideration for the victim of the crime? If the generals of crime &mdash; to use the Minister's expression &mdash; have the means to provide compensation for the victim of the crime we should provide a route by which such compensation can be provided. This was recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Similarly, proposals by the commission have been ignored in relation to providing that the offence would be committed in respect of goods unlawfully obtained as opposed to stolen.  There has been no explanation by the Minister as to why he ignored this recommendation.</P>
    <P>On the question of evidence the commission also looked at the problem of the admission of proof of business or administrative records which apparently causes so much difficulty in many prosecutions. They made a positive recommendation on changing that but this also has been ignored by the Minister who is taking a major risk in straying so radically <Col N="759" /> from the recommendations of the commission. Let us remember that these recommendations were worked out after very considerable consultation.  While the commission consist of a very senior judge, solicitors, barristers and so on they did not just produce their recommendations out of the air.  They produced a working document first and they then consulted judges, barristers, solicitors, academics, the Attorney General's Office, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Justice and the Garda.  It was arising from such consultations, following the issue of their working paper, that they produced this very valuable report of their conclusions, a summary of recommendations and the general framework of a Bill to provide for amendments of the law.  Whatever the Minister says about his respect for the views of the Law Reform Commission it is very clear that the Bill as it is framed at present largely ignores the recommendations.  There is a major onus on the Minister to justify his approach.  He certainly has not discharged that onus in the House this morning.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks my concerns about the constitutionality of this Bill.  Section 5 provides for the giving of evidence of previous convictions or previous possession of stolen property. As the Minister said, this section replaces section 43 of the 1916 Act.  The Minister has not followed the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.  They felt that the section should be repealed in its entirety because of misgivings about its constitutional validity. In the case of King <i>v.</i> the Attorney General where the Vagrancy Act was found to be unconstitutional, the judge made it clear that evidence of character or previous convictions should not be given at a criminal trial.  It was because of doubts raised by the King decision that the commission proposed the repeal of section 43 in its entirety.  The Minister seemingly is prepared to blunder in where the commission feared to tread and he <Col N="760" /> must justify that decision.  He has suggested that by limiting the situation it will be constitutional but I have major doubts on that score.  If the Minister persists in his present approach he will have to refer the legislation to the Supreme Court for a decision on constitutional validity.</P>
    <P>I am told by one of the country's leading criminal lawyers that this point is fundamental to our criminal jurisprudence and that in his experience &mdash; whatever the Minister said this morning about the use of the original section 43 as a weapon available to the prosecution &mdash; the original section was never availed of by the prosecution because of the fears that any conviction so obtained would, without question, be quashed and that view is borne out by the comment in the report of the commission.  Why then is the Minister proceeding with such a blatantly questionable provision?</P>
    <P>Similar constitutional doubts arise in relation to the shifting of the legal burden of proof on to the accused as provided in section 3.  The commission very specifically stated that they do not favour setting specific circumstances in which presumptions may be raised in the section constituting the offence.  This considered view is again based on the constitutional implications.  Again, the Minister has blundered in without regard to these constitutional implications.</P>
    <P>There are further less important defects which can be teased out on Committee Stage.  The Minister in his speech referred to the changes which he is introducing in section 2 in relation to the possession of articles for use in the course of or in connection with larceny, burglary and other types of dishonesty covered by the Larceny Act.  However, he has given no definition of &ldquo;articles&rdquo; which seems to create a legal lacuna.  Surely the very least that might have been expected would be some definition of &ldquo;articles&rdquo;.  He has eliminated the earlier definition and has not provided any definition in the new section.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in relation to section 7, I am advised that these provisions will lead to great difficulties in the same way as did the provisions of section 46 (1) of <Col N="761" /> the 1916 Act.  That matter will have to be teased out fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall picture, it is clear that there is broad agreement that the Larceny Act, 1916, in so far as its provisions are related to the crime of receiving, are clearly in need of replacement. The Minister has chosen to ignore virtually all of the advice available as to how this might best be done.  If the Minister proceeds with his present blunderbuss approach he may very well end up rendering a bad position even worse. The reference in the report of the Law Reform Commisssion to making a dog's breakfast of the job will clearly apply to the Minister.  I suggest very seriously to him that he should reconsider the whole matter at this stage, either withdraw and replace the Bill or, alternatively, indicate that it will be amended substantially on Committee Stage.  He will have the assurance of his House of full co-operation in getting a Bill through but only if such a Bill will be effective in doing the job for which its provisions are intended.  Particularly because of the major recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which have been ignored, I have the gravest doubts that the Bill, as at present drafted, will achieve that aim. Accordingly, I am indicating to the Minister my concern at the problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for new legislation and will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage.  However, I am putting down a clear marker that I have the gravest worries about many of its provisions, in that it is my contention that they will not be effective in bringing the godfathers of crime to justice and, in relation to two sections, I have serious doubts as to their constitutionality.</P>

      <P>This debate is very timely since it was only a couple of months ago that we received the report on crime from the Garda Commissioner. The contents of that report demand initiative on the part of the Government to deal with the very serious crime problems obtaining.  After a period of approximately four years in which reported offences detected showed a slight drop <Col N="762" /> each year the figures for 1988 showed an increase in crime level throughout the country.  It was interesting to hear the Minister say in the course of his remarks that in 1985 the then Fianna Fáil Opposition considered the position so serious they introduced a Private Members' Bill to deal with larceny.  That was done after a period of consistent increase in crime from 1979 to 1983 when the rate had escalated from approximately 65,000 to in excess of 95,000.  That was a responsible action on the part of the then Opposition. The Minister had a little dig at the then Government in the course of his introductory remarks today, saying that they had not accepted their Private Members' Bill.  It will be extraordinary when a Government accept a Private Members' Bill in this House.  Usually they vote them down, saying they will introduce one themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be clearly seen that the action taken by that Government at least had the effect of reducing the numbers of crimes committed for four successive years.  At that time the Attorney General, Mr. John Rogers, invited the Law Reform Commission to bring forward proposals for the heads of a Bill in this area.  The Minister has had that report for approximately 15 months and has now decided to act.  In 1985 the overall position was considered urgent by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister's predecessor had ample opportunity to take appropriate action during the term of office of the last Administration.  As Deputy J. O'Keeffe has said, there is no area more in need of urgent attention than this one. He was quite right in saying that crime does pay.  Indeed it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the report by the Garda Commissioner the Garda themselves, in their <i>Garda Review</i> dealt with that problem in an editorial underlining the problems they face dealing with crime at present.  They also emphasised that the value of crime to its godfathers is considerable. For example, goods to the value of £34 million were stolen last year, <Col N="763" /> that is those reported as having been stolen, which would not represent the true figure.  For example, many people do not bother reporting smaller amounts stolen for fear of having their insurance premiums increased.  Of those £34 million worth of goods stolen only £3 million were recovered and of the number of people who committed such crimes only one in four was caught or detected.  Is it any wonder that the Garda have expressed their anxiety about the overall problem and sought a response from the Minister and Government?</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well in his new portfolio.  I hope he will remain in office for some years to come and that we will have several constructive debates. Having proved himself a dynamic Minister in other Departments I expect him to take on the challenge of confronting this problem, particularly on behalf of citizens who, in certain areas, are beginning to doubt that there is the capacity to deal with or counteract crime.  If one is lucky enough to reside in, say, Mayo or west Cork, one will discover there are only four to six crimes committed per thousand of population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if one happens to live in the Dublin metropolitan area that figure escalates to 53 per thousand of population.  The Minister lives in that area and a large part of my constituency is in that area also and all of us have been aware for some years past of the deteriorating position.  Anybody now driving into this city without the luxury of car parking facilities will be very reluctant to park on the street.  Certainly any car owner is very foolish to leave goods visible in a car for even the shortest length of time.  Equally, if one owns a house in this city, or in areas such as, say, Bray or Greystones one knows one cannot go away on holiday unless one can leave somebody in occupation in one's absence.  Equally, there will be a loading <Col N="764" /> on one's insurance contents premium because one happens to live in this area. Indeed in certain parts of this city, when one dials 999, one discovers that the Garda just do not have the manpower or facilities to cope effectively with the demand on them.</P>
      <P>I heard of one incident about a fortnight ago when a burglar alarm rang in a house in the process of a burglary being committed.  This was in a house not far from where the Minister himself lives. A next door neighbour telephoned the Garda.  Even though the Garda station was sited only a mile away, one and a half hours later the gardaí arrived in a squad car and had to explain that they had received six 999 calls within a very short space of time and had had to deal with them in the order in which they had been received.  The gardaí informed the owner of the house that he was lucky the neighbour had telephoned because obviously the burglars had left the scene. They told the owner they would give him a note for his insurance company authorising him to be reimbursed for whatever he had lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than a response to larceny in the legislative area alone, we would have expected a more dynamic approach to the whole problem of crime.  We have not got that.  In the new Estimates for the Minister's Department the number of gardaí to be paid out of public funds will be 500 fewer than in 1988, when we were promised last year that there would be additions to the Garda force.  Not only that but the numbers of clerical staff have been reduced by 30 from 567 to 537.  The number of Garda Síochána were reduced from 11,248 to 10,749 in this year.  It is not enough to increase penalties and create new offences in dealing with crime.  That is only one leg of a twolegged stool and the stool will not stand on one leg.  We must also give the facilities to the Garda Síochána and increase their numbers to tackle this problem. When criminals have been caught there must be facilities so that we can put them away for the term decided by the court, with the usual reduction for good behaviour and so on.  As we all know, those <Col N="765" /> facilities are not there.  I do not blame the Minister who is new in the job, but at least he has been in Government now for over two years.  I hope to see a much wider and more vigorous approach from the new Minister.</P>
    <P>The gardaí in an editorial told the general public that failure to acknowledge the present level of violence and frequency of crimes is totally unacceptable to our people and is inexcusable and that any undue delay in confronting this serious challenge would be unforgiveable. What we have been given here today is one approach by the Minister to deal with this challenge and it is totally inadequate.  This Bill is a list of five or six amendments to the 1916 Larceny Act. When the previous Attorney General set the commission a task to bring forward proposals they did so with great speed and there was a great deal of input from as many sources as could be found who had a point of view to offer in this area. They produced recommendations and the general outline of a Bill so that in December 1987 the Minister was presented with a comprehensive set of proposals which introduced the new concept, or offence of handling, and dealt with several other areas.  The parliamentary draftsman could have taken those proposals and adapted the wording so that the Bill could pass through this House and the Minister could have also added to it.  Instead, we have this weak inadequate response, this list of amendments to a Bill which is in many ways outdated.</P>
    <P>The Bill, even with the changes proposed will be inadequate to meet the problems.  I do not understand why the Minister had to redraft the proposals. The proposals produced by the commission were more far-reaching than the Bill proposed here.  The Minister in his Bill seems to have forgotten some of the concepts proposed such as that relating to reckless behaviour in dealing with the receiving of goods.  That is not referred to at all.  The Minister has missed an opportunity here.</P>
    <P>I will comment on a few of the important sections in the Bill.  Section 2 of the <Col N="766" /> Bill deals with the possession of house-breaking implements and refers to &ldquo;somewhere other than in the place of abode&rdquo;.  If one has one of these instruments somewhere other than in the place of abode one can be convicted under the Bill.  This is too tight to make good legislation.  Many people would have instruments which could be used for larceny, though not necessarily for larceny, not only at home but while travelling. The section should be clarified and that concept should only be capable of being used where it has been proved in evidence that the accused has been involved in a crime.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill relates to the term &ldquo;to be in possession&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Report throws doubt on this term.  It can mean a lot of things.  If the Minister is using it he should give a wider definition of the term.  Are passengers in a car in possession of items in the boot, for instance?  The driver of a car could be said to be in possession of items in the boot but he may not know they are there. They could have been put there by anybody and in this Bill that will not be an excuse and a person can be convicted.  I came up here today with two friends in the car and they put bags in the boot.  I do not know what was in the bags although I have a good idea, but suppose there was some money from a robbery, under this Bill I can be convicted and put away. That section needs to be amended.</P>
    <P>Section 3 refers to the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; and it is not defined.  We all know that there are varying degrees of dishonesty, from dishonesty of the children at home to the big lies told in other areas, even in this House.  We should not put in that term without some sort of clear definition of it.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues have an advantage over me because they are legal eagles, but one of the most intriguing parts of this Bill relates to section 3 (c) where I found a very strange term indeed. It states that where a person believes property to be stolen property, including thinking that such property was probably stolen, he may be indicted and convicted. Something new is being introduced here <Col N="767" /> whereby if you think about something you can now be convicted.  We are all familiar with the phrase about &ldquo;something falling off the back of a lorry&rdquo; and know it is a euphemism.  If somebody gets a good bargian and thinks it might have fallen off the back of a lorry, that is now an offence under this Bill.  The Minister should look seriously at that area and define it more.  The ordinary people cannot think anymore but they are committing a crime.</P>
    <P>If I look at the articles for sale in tonight's <i>Evening Press or Evening Herald</i> and see a bargain such as &ldquo;Video for sale, brand new, owner going away&rdquo; and if I call to see it, think the place looks a bit suspicious and am told I am being offered the video at half price, am I committing a crime under this section if I buy it?  Will it now be the responsibility of the press, in accepting small ads, to get total assurance that if somebody buys something as a result of an advertisement in their paper, without knowing it was stolen, they will not be taken to court? That area should be looked at again by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (b) proposes to amend section 43 of the 1916 Act.  The Law Reform Commission suggested that this whole section should be repealed and not just amended.  They believe this section as it applies in that Act is probably unconstitutional. The Minister, having been given that advice by such eminent gentlemen as signed this report, is endeavouring to amend the section.  It is not very often used and it would not be any great loss if it was not there at all but it may render this whole Bill unconstitutional as the previous speaker has suggested?  The Minister should consider this matter between now and Committee Stage.  This section also states that seven days notice must be given in writing to the accused if the details of a prior conviction are to be adduced.  Can the Minister tell me if this seven days clause applies to the calling of witnesses on a deposition?  It would be useful to know that.</P>
    <P>The definition of handling, which is the real kernel of this Bill, should be widened <Col N="768" /> to include the godfathers or the bosses of crime at whose orders an amount of crime is carried out in this city.  These people never enter into the picture and this Bill falls down slightly by not having some clear reference to them.  They should be included specifically in a Bill such as this. One of the great faults of the Bill as I see it is that it deals only with physical handling and therefore it is a little outdated. There are many sophisticated ways of doing business but unfortunately the same sophisticated ways can be used to commit crimes.  This Bill has not taken into account the modern techniques being introduced into the whole area of crime.  The crime of stealing information and the disposal of that information should be included in the Bill.  The Minister has missed an opportunity here.  If one illegally listens to a commercial meeting and steals information therefrom, dissemination of such information should become a crime of unlawful handling.  It is reasonable to ask that that be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many people use cash dispensers in banks and use plastic cards such as Visa and Access.  Crimes committed in this regard have been totally ignored.  The Minister may say that it is covered in certain sections but crimes such as stealing somebody's pin number and using the money to buy goods should be specifically and clearly set out in a Bill such as this.  Obviously this is an extension of handling but nevertheless it is a crime and people should be given clear warning that if they enter into that type of activity certain penalties will be imposed. Similar penalties should be imposed for crimes relating to Visa and Access cards and plastic cards in general.</P>
    <P>I will mention one or two areas which I think should be amended.  I would bring one section to the Minister's attention and I would like him to give me some explanation on it, that is section 10 which proposes to amend section 51 of the Post Office Act, 1908.  It provides that a person who commits a crime in that area, who steals mail or money from An Post, will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding <Col N="769" /> two years or to a fine or to both and if he is guilty of a misdemeanour he will be liable on conviction to a fine and to imprisonment with or without hard labour.  As I have said, it is proposed to amend that section and to introduce new and very severe penalties.  I would ask the Minister if any consultation has taken place with the management of An Post or with the various unions in An Post before that section was inserted.  It is useful for good industrial relations that when we change an Act such as this and introduce very severe penalties, some discussion should take place with the people involved, in this case people who recently had to accept a whole new Act which set them up in a semi-State body. When making changes which affect people's future, we should consult them beforehand.  I would like to know if consultation has taken place with the staff of An Post in regard to this section.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs extensive alterations and improvements.  I hope the Minister puts forward amendments on Committee Stage following an examination of some of the serious criticisms which have been made on the Bill here today.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of sentences, this Bill contains little or nothing which a sensible judge or jury could not deal with under the existing Act.  The Bill is a poor one and adds nothing to what is there already.  The publication of the report of the Law Reform Commission gave us the opportunity to introduce extensive and competent legislation dealing with crime, but this Bill still accepts the idea that there is only manual handling of problems and fails to attack blue collar crime which is increasing, as I have already stated.  No attempt is made in this Bill to deal with it.</P>
    <P>We will be tabling amendments on Committee stage, and do not intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. We hope the Minister &mdash; this is the first Bill he has brought before the House since taking over this Department &mdash; will be prepared to accept our comments and criticisms on what is before us and that some of our amendments on Committee <Col N="770" /> Stage will be accepted in an effort to improve the Bill and bring a little nearer to what the Law Reform Commission intended.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity, on behalf of The Workers' Party, to make some comments on the Second Reading of the Larceny Bill, 1989.  As many of the things which need to be said about the Bill from an Opposition's point of view have already been very ably and comprehensively dealt with by the two previous speakers, I hope I will not sound too repetitive.</P>
      <P>The first thing we have to note is the origin of this legislation.  During the life of the second last Government the then Attorney General requested the Law Reform Commission to look at the aspects of the criminal law and to report to the Government on the need for reform.  They were also asked to look at the broad spectrum of laws with regard to dishonesty.  The Law Reform Commission readily and willingly accepted their brief and, subsequently delivered to the Government a report on receiving stolen property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission pointed out in the introduction to that report that they were confined to dealing with receiving stolen property, primarily because of the lack of resources.  It is terribly unfortunate that they have to recite this fact in the opening paragraph to this very important document &mdash; that they were not in the position to deal with the major task presented to them by the Government, namely, a review of the law with regard to dishonesty, because they did not have the resources to do so.  A common complaint of the Law Reform Commission is that they cannot get on with their work because they have not been given the resources to do.  I do not know of anyone in this House who would suggest that the commission do not do a good job and are not deserving of the appreciation of all the Members of this House.  When introducing this Bill the Minister indicated that he wished to express his appreciation and gratitude, but let me say that the Law Reform Commission would accept his <Col N="771" /> appreciation and gratitude much more if it came in a more meaningful way.  Words are welcome but I think the Government should give the necessary resources to the commission to allow them to do their job in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe has already said, we should show our gratitude and appreciation by referring to the reports. One of the problems is that so many of the commission's reports are sitting on the shelves and are very rarely referred to.  They are never debated in this House and rarely, if ever, converted into legislation. What we see here today is the exception to the norm, a very quick response to a remarkable document in terms of its comprehensiveness and breadth of investigation.  However, when we do respond quickly we do so poorly. I wonder the extent to which the Government may be burrowing back into a Bill which they promoted when in Opposition simply to make the point?  As the Minister said, this is a Bill they presented when in Opposition, the Government of the day opposed it and they are now bringing it back because they think it is sensible legislation.  Perhaps that is a small, cheap political manoeuvre, but one cannot blame politicians who are not taking their job too seriously for engaging in this practice.</P>
    <P>A major event occurred in the intervening period, that is, the commissioning of the report on receiving stolen property. In that report the commission reviewed the anachronistic laws with regard to receiving stolen property, commented very clearly on many aspects of the law and indicated how old those laws are.  They also incorporate a review of the position in other jurisdictions of comparable standing and go on to make their own recommendations.  In their conclusion to the report they suggest a formula for a draft Bill in this area and succinctly set out, so that no one would have any doubts, a summary of their recommendations of which there are 16. It is remarkable that the Minister has not <Col N="772" /> given due regard to the findings, observations and recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission make a clear admission, and this is a matter for Government, that they did not have the resources to take on the greater task. Certainly, it is a matter of criticism that we have not had a comprehensive review of the law with regard to larceny or theft, to use its modern term in neighbouring jurisdictions at least.  It is also remarkable that we still burrow back to the 1890s and 1916 for our basic legislation on larceny, theft and receiving.  It is also a matter of criticism especially when we consider that England, our neighbouring jurisdiction, comprehensively reviewed this law in 1968.  Twenty one years ago they at least codified their law and brought it up to date, recognising that the basic legislation of 1916 and before simply was not appropriate to the socio-economic conditions existing in that country during the sixties.  This applies all the more in Ireland in the eighties.  The Theft Act in Britain was preceded by a major royal commission of investigation which indicated the need to update the law.  At that stage the same law applied to both Britain and Ireland so that what was debated in that parliament and jurisdiction during the sixties was relevant to our law here. It is a remarkable indictment of anyone who has been in Government here from 1968 that we have not properly addressed our laws of dishonesty in the way the British did.</P>
    <P>So this Bill represents a very poor governmental response to the area of law reform.  It deals with a minute portion of the law.  In a different context the Minister referred to the offences of false pretences, embezzlement and fraudulent conversion.  He referred to them in the context of property dishonestly obtained giving rise to the ongoing offence of handling. In 1988, according to the commission's report there were 261 cases of embezzlement and 897 cases of false pretences detected.  Fraudulent conversion is not mentioned.  It is probably included in the category of other frauds of which there were 293.  This is a miniscule rate <Col N="773" /> of report and detection of these crimes simply because our laws are so complex and outmoded.  They have never been addressed during the lifetime of this State with a view to bringing them up to date and made workable in the current socio-economic conditions.  That is a major condemnation that must be levelled in this debate.  The Minister should not be happy to be presenting this very small contribution to the reform of the law, a very poor response to the reports and recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>To put it even more in context we must look at the extent of the crime we are seeking to address.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the large number of larcenies that have been committed.  The vast majority of these involve property of little or no value.  The Deputy cannot be blamed for pointing then to the value of property stolen, some £34 million worth during the year; but we are talking about insurance claim values which are grossly inflated and in no way relate to the real value of the property.  Even more alarming are the figures in regard to the offence of receiving.  There were 1,090 offences of receiving detected and reported during 1988.  That is not a scale of crime that calls for hard or rash reaction unless we investigate it a bit more to see why if so many thefts are committed, of so much property is not recovered only 1,000 cases are detected and reported in 1988.  It seems incredibly small in the overall complexity of the figures that have been advanced from the commission's report.</P>
    <P>I wonder to what extent this is because the laws are out of date.  One must ask of this Bill, in amending the law, will help people to report the offence of receiving. Is receiving an offence that is easily reportable?  Is it the kind of offence that the person in the street often witnesses? To what extent will the law, as changed, assist the Garda in getting people in the community to report on the extent to which property is passing in a dishonest way in public houses, in communities, within business generally?  I do not believe it will help a great deal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> Here a point arises that in some way explains the excessive delay on the part of Governments in addressing the whole question of dishonest handling.  There are areas here where it is a way of life.  It is a profession of bravado to be a smuggler, a dishonest handler of goods across the Border where whole communities, if some of the contributions from Deputies in that area are to be taken seriously, look on it as a way of life.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the crime or receiving is a crime of the middle classes and upwards.  This strong vested class interest may be the reason it has not been seriously addressed as a crime by legislators in the past.  How many shopkeepers, bar owners, people in businesses, big and small, will accept goods through the back door that can be quickly put on the shelf, assimilated into the stock and sold on with little risk of detection? To what extent is that a problem?  I believe it is far greater than anyone in this House might be willing to admit. Dishonesty is rife in the community, not just on the streets.  Tax fiddling is not discussed at all in the context of acts of dishonesty.  It is considered fair game if one can beat the State and not pay a fair amount in return.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate inside and outside this House recently about insurance of beef, never has it been suggested that there is an element of dishonesty. Why is the Garda not investigating obtaining credit by false pretences?</P>
    <P>I believe that the delay of upwards of 70 or 80 years in this House in addressing the outmoded nature of our laws of dishonesty generally is because there are strong vested interests, at a subterranean level, right throughout our society that has not pushed for investigation.  I know the Minister for Justice and his predecessors have had numerous representations from the Fraud Squad, from the Garda Síochána, from the commissioner's office asking that urgent attention be given not just to receiving but in general to the laws in regard to dishonestly.  It has not happened to date. <Col N="775" /> This legislation is a very weak and poor response.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless The Workers' Party clearly could not object to this Bill on Second Stage.  In principle any improvement and development in the law, particularly in this area, is to be welcomed and we will not oppose the Second Reading. There are, however, individual features in the Bill which must be addressed.  We welcome the wider definitions and the fact that the concept of receiving in the narrow sense in which it was judicially interpreted is now being abandoned in favour of the wider concept of handling.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of intent, I do not share Deputy O'Keeffe's view regarding the constitutionality of the change in emphasis on the belief element within the legislation.  I welcome the fact that persons must be asked in suspicious circumstances or, as the report suggests but the Bill does not provide, circumstances of silence to answer for the handling of property.  The extent to which the Bill addresses the vast range of legal anachronisms which the Law Reform report fully explored and highlighted for us is to be welcomed.  There are, however, major reservations which will be addressed by The Workers' Party and other Deputies in opposition.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister in advance of Committee Stage will take on board some of the points raised.  The first relates to section 43 (1) of the old legislation, which is section 5 in the new Bill.  Coincidentally I was the solicitor who acted for Mr. King in the case referred to.  It is a story that can safely be told now that while we were pursuing the constitutional rights of the citizen, Mr. King was in fact a native of South Africa, a fact which thankfully never came to light during the currency of those proceedings.  We have today very good pronouncements from the High Court and the Supreme Court in that area of the law.  The fundamental issue addressed by Mr. Justice McWilliam in the High Court was that it is a cornerstone of criminal investigation and prosecution that the character of an accused person should never be brought <Col N="776" /> in aid of the prosecution in attempting to find guilt in a particular case.  For that reason the anachronistic law of 1824, the Vagrancy Act dealing with the suspected person found abroad at night or in suspicious circumstances, was struck down by the High Court.  That decision as to its constitutional infirmness was upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court.  It is to be conceded that there was a different emphasis by the Supreme Court but the fundamental reasoning of Mr. Justice McWilliam was not criticised.  We have to accept the proposition that a person's character should not be called in support of the proof of guilt as immutable and that must be respected.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission highlight this fact and go on to make the point that the 1916 Act and section 43 (1) are virtually never used.  Is the Minister in a position to say when last a prosecution in this State relied upon the provisions of section 43 (1)?  I worked virtually full time for 14 years as a criminal practitioner before coming into this House and I never once came across a case of receiving where the State relied upon that provision.  I recall defending people who were subsequently convicted on the evidence available and in the recall of the person's record it was shown that any number of offences of receiving were recorded against them.  The police simply did not rely on this provision because it is difficult to prove.  It is a proof which it skillfully challenged can boomerang against the prosecution because it can be said that their facts are weak and they are trying to rely on judicial or forensic muck-throwing.  I believe the reason it has virtually been abandoned is due to advice from counsel in individual cases or perhaps because of a directive from the DPP's office to the effect that the section is open to constitutional challenge and should not be relied on.  The Law Reform Commission, not just because of its constitutional infirmness but because in practice the section is not used, recommended that it should not be included in the Bill.  Its inclusion is a mistake and I would urge the Minister, rather than introducing unnecessary rancour in regard <Col N="777" /> to this section of the Bill, to remove it before Committee Stage.  If he is seeking to rely on it he should be able to inform the House on Committee Stage as to the extent to which it has been used in the past and indicate how he supports the view expressed earlier that evidence of this type has been vital in the past in helping to establish the <i>mens rea</i> of the accused in cases where it might otherwise have been impossible to do so.  That statement by the Minister should be expanded upon when concluding or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is not the most fundamental or important change in the legislation.  The Bill has far more urgent and important contributions to make in the area of criminal law and we should not have undue differences over this.  I have given the view of the Law Reform Commission and I have some experience in this area. I merely ask the Minister to tell us how and when this section which is being incorporated in this Bill has ever been vital to prosecutions in these cases.</P>
    <P>The definition in regard to <i>mens rea</i> is weak and will lead to undoubted difficulties. The 1916 legislation seemed eminently sensible to the then legislators. The courts, aided and abetted by skilful advocates, took the legislation asunder letter by letter, sentence by sentence, expression by expression, with the result that the definition of intent currently employed by reason of judicial interpretation is so narrow as to make the offence of receiving virtually impossible to prove in court.  The jury must be told that if an accused's explanation is believable they must acquit.  If the accused's explanation for possession or handling is not believable by them but could possibly be true, they should still acquit.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, if the accused's explanation is not believed and is, in their minds not true, by itself that does not mean the accused is necessarily guilty.  Regard must be had for the broader context of the circumstances.  Judicial construction of <i>mens rea</i> has over the years virtually made it impossible for courts and juries to find guilt in cases of receiving.  It is a difficult crime to prove.  As legislators we <Col N="778" /> should be addressing that history as it has emerged.</P>
    <P>In my view the definition introduced in the Bill by the Minister will allow for a repetition for that judicial construction. The concept of belief is in the section and we have had the experience in Britain under similar provisions judicially interpreted in the theft Act.  In my view we will end up in virtually the same position before too long.  I have no doubt that lawyers when they come to work this legislation will simply leap-frog back over all the judicial decisions that have been in place since 1916 and before, borrow on them and seek to invade the new legislation with the old thinking or adaptions of the old thinking.  We needed a departure in legislative construction of the judicial <i>mens rea</i> of intent.</P>
    <P>The formula was set out in the report; it was recommended in black and white in the summary of the recommendations. Those who did not have the time, energy or inclination to read through the very reasoned basis why the commission reached their conclusion could have consulted the summary.  According to the summary the test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen.  A paragraph reference is given so that one can find the very good reasons why that should be so.  It is referred to in their assessment of the law to date and where they were looking at the comparative laws in other states.  In their own conclusions they reasoned out why recklessness was a better approach and definition than relying on the formula of belief.</P>
    <P>The judicial necessity in interpreting belief will be a subjective one, such as if the accused reasonably believed, and in that context reasonable belief of the accused will be what he knew.  In that event we will be back to the concept of knowing.  I am not suggesting the Minister should tear up the Bill or readdress it because I want the legislation to be put through the House speedily.  I hope it will be dealt with by the House and the Seanad before the end of this term and <Col N="779" /> be on the Statute Book before the end of the year.  However, it is important that the Minister should redefine the <i>mens rea</i> aspects of the Bill and depart from the concept of belief as a basis of proof to one of recklessness, as recommended.</P>
    <P>The Myers case in Britain, as the report acknowledges, was never totally adopted into our domestic law hook, line and sinker but nevertheless in practice virtually every time an issue of proof in this area arises counsel first reach for the Myers decision as the bedrock.  I should like to ask the Minister to say if he disagrees with that view.  It has been accepted by every court here as a good basis of our law.  The Myers decision is used as a working precedent on a daily basis where issues of proof arise.  It will continue to do so unless we address this matter.</P>
    <P>There was some reluctance expressed about borrowing the British model but at least they responded to the Myers decision in that within two years of it being handed down they had amending legislation in place to put the matter right.  It is our job as legislators to try to keep abrest of conditions that emerge and develop outside, such as the changing socio-economic scheme.  In this day of computers, computer print-outs and greater movement of goods it is important that we address the question of proof.  The Bill should contain a provision that addresses the problem exposed by the Myers decision.  There should be a need to prove every entry on a record document when trying to trace ownership. It is incumbent on us to address modern business conditions in our legislation but we have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The report contains a recommendation on goods unlawfully obtained but the Minister did not address that in the Bill. He indicated that we should get away from the narrow view about goods stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained but I submit that the Bill is not as clear-cut as is required in regard to that area of the law.  I was disappointed with the provisions dealing with penalties.  I do not understand the proposition advanced by <Col N="780" /> the Minister on equal penalty.  He has not convinced me in regard to that.</P>
    <P>Judges, when sentencing people convicted of receiving, invariably remark that if we did not have receivers we would not have thieves.  The impression is that receiving is considered to be the more heinous crime of the two.  I can understand the frustration of a court if so many people accused of receiving evade conviction. There is a great inclination to throw the book at a person who is ultimately convicted of receiving but, in practice, receivers tend to come from the better-off sections of the community, they tend to be people with business interests.  It is the rare occasion that one finds the guy on the street corner being prosecuted for receiving.  As the Minister said, he is one of the foot sloggers and he is usually in the dock facing the burglary or theft charge.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate the comparisons between penalties handed down for receiving offences as against those for aggravated or grand larcenies. From years of practice in this area I have come to the conclusion that receivers have not been dealt with severely by the courts because they are people with a position in the community. By and large they are in a position to argue personal detail and family considerations that would not weigh so heavily with the more unwashed.</P>
    <P>I have to challenge the suggestion, no receivers, no thieves.  It is a myth first because all goods stolen are not received at one stage or another.  It is a myth also because theft is by and large petty, or the greater incidence of it is petty, and it is committed out of necessity.  Whether the thief has a market to pass it on does not really come into it in the vast majority of petty larceny cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad it has not been advanced here that we could abolish the crime of larceny if we could comprehensively deal with the receivers in our community, but there is an element of it in the disparity of penalty that has been introduced where the thief will receive a maximum of ten years and the receiver a maximum of 14 years.  I am not going to fall out with the <Col N="781" /> Minister one way or another.  I was just curious to know why he did not follow the recommendation of the commission's report suggesting the same penalties for everyone and I was simply addressing it lest there was a subconscious acknowledgement of this great formula one hears daily from the District Court benches and elsewhere, that we must hammer the receiver because then we will get rid of the thief.  It will not happen that way.</P>
    <P>The other point recommended by the report, and again not addressed by the Minister in the Bill, is the prospect of writing into legislation powers of compensation and the powers to forfeit property, perhaps identifiable, belonging to the receiver convicted that could be identified as coming to him through the proceeds of his crime or crimes.  Again, I wonder to what extent we are inhibited in bringing in this kind of legislation in this area because of the very strong statement on property in our Constitution. It is remarkable that in no area of our criminal law and our penal sanction is any power available to the courts to order substantial forfeiture of property identifiable or potentially identifiable as coming to the thief or the criminal by reason of his or her involvement in crime or being the proceeds of the crime.  We do not have it in the drugs area, though it exists elsewhere.  We do not have it in any of the crimes of dishonesty.  It would be very appropriate in the context of receivers whenever they are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>In summation, as I have indicated The Workers' Party will not be opposing Second Stage.  This legislation, with all its limitations, should be addressed quickly by the House on Committee Stage and passed on to the Upper House without delay, but I urge the Minister to take on board the very genuine points expressed by the Opposition spokes-persons dealing with this matter and those others who will contribute.  I think the legislation can be improved so as to represent a significant though small contribution in the whole area of the reform of our laws of dishonesty which clearly has a long way to go.</P>
    <Col N="782" />
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Ray Burke on his appointment as Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications. I have occasion to have quite an amount of correspondence with the Department of Justice and I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for the speedy and efficient way in which he deals with correspondence.</P>
      <P>Before I make some remarks on this Bill I want to revert to what has been said on the other side.  Deputy O'Keeffe's main criticism seemed to hinge on the fact that the report of the Law Reform Commission, which admittedly was excellent and strongly researched, was not followed closely.  I have read the report of the Law Reform Commission and I have read the Bill as carefully as I could and it seems clear that the parliamentary draftsman in the course of drafting this legislation was very conscious of the recommendations and of the research done by the Law Reform Commission.  I do not agree with everything in this Bill, but I do not think anybody can be justified in criticising this Bill simply and solely because it does not slavishly follow the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often campaigned inside and outside this House to end the practice we have here of following slavishly British legislation a few years after it has been enacted.  My objections to following slavishly the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, or any other commission, are similar.  If we are to adopt the approach Deputy O'Keeffe seemed to suggest &mdash; I will not do him the injustice of saying he meant this but it seemed to come across in part of his speech &mdash; we might as well let the Law Reform Commission write all the laws. The Law Reform Commission, the British legislature, the American legislature, the Irish Legislature, nobody has a monopoly of wisdom.  The Minister for Justice is an experienced man, he has a Department at his disposal and there are a number of people in this House who know enough about this area and have enough contact with it in real life to be <Col N="783" /> able to improve on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was following a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill of 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  If Deputy Flanagan will take the trouble to read the Minister's speech he will see that he referred on a number of occasions to recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  This Bill is full of sections which have been recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  Let us not misrepresent the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to various constitutional difficulties, as did Deputy Kavanagh, in relation to the amendment of section 43 by section 5 of this Bill. Deputy McCartan by and large answered that criticism.  He has given us the benefit of his very considerable experience in this area.  My research indicates that the section 43 procedure is very rarely used. Deputy Kavanagh seemed to be under the misapprehension that if section 43 was found unconstitutional because of the King case and related cases, then the entire Bill would be struck down.  Of course, we know that is not correct; it would be just a section that would be struck down.  If the section is not being used to any great extent anyway, it seems it does not make a great deal of difference. However, let me say in deference to Deputy McCartan and Deputy Kavanagh, in view of the new definition of &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; the new offence of handling into which &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; has been elevated, and in view of the new <i>mens rea</i>, I wonder if it is really necessary to have this section in the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in the Opposition calls to the Minister to look at the Bill again between now and Committee Stage to see if this section could be left out.  It is practically never used in practice, and the last thing we want now is the prospect of a constitutional action for a section of the amended receiving legislation which is struck down.  I do not think that would <Col N="784" /> be desirable in the general atmosphere that prevails at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh condemned this Bill as a very inadequate response and in the next breath he criticised the new <i>mens rea</i> as being too severe.  He was talking about men giving excuses about things that fell off the back of lorries as if he wanted a situation whereby that excuse could still be given and a person clearly guilty could walk free because he could not be proved to have knowledge that the property was stolen.  Deputy Kavanagh cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say this legislation is a very inadequate response to what he perceives as a serious problem and, at the same time, criticise the Government for trying to expand the <i>mens rea</i> to bring more of these people within the ambit of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh was also under the misapprehension that the sort of offences being dealt with here have some sort of physical implication, that there must be some sort of physical handling of the goods.  It is quite clear that is not correct. Even a person making a telephone call can be convicted of handling under this section as drafted.  Deputy McCartan gave us the benefit of his long experience in this area and I listened to him with interest.  He told me a great deal I did not know.  I thank him for his contribution which, however, I think was marred by one rather silly suggestion, the one which has been adverted to by Deputy Flanagan, namely, that the Government were trying to pull a political stroke or execute a political manoeuvre by falling back on their own Bill which was introduced in Opposition rather than following more closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  Deputy McCartan and I and everybody in this House knows that Governments and politicians only pull political strokes when they have something to gain from it.  What have we to gain as a party or as a Government from executing a manoeuvre to the effect that we are falling back on our own legislation which the Government of the time did not implement?  If in doing that we are introducing legislation which will not put more receivers behind bars I can <Col N="785" /> assure the House we will lose rather than gain.  The real political gain, if there is to be a political gain will be legislation which will combat the handling of stolen property much more effectively and be seen to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan that it is a pity the Law Reform Commission did not consider the whole area of theft law. For Deputy McCartan's information I can tell him I made inquiries and I was told that the Law Reform Commission are now looking at the area of theft law and they hope to have a report shortly, and we welcome that.  I am not saying that I would recommend an approach to amend or to update theft law which would follow too closely on the English Theft Act, 1968, because the case law and the academic writings on the English Theft Act, 1968, illustrate that grave mistakes were made in the drafting of that legislation. I will advert to them briefly even though it is not strictly within my brief.</P>
    <P>The situation for the past two decades is that we have been exposed to a diet of particularly horrendous offences against the person, some of those have been terrorist-related, the effect of which has been to immunise people and make them soft on larceny.  An offence against property is not as sensational, newsworthy or as dramatic as some of the offences against the person which we hear and read about every day.  In our more sympathetic attitude towards larceny and thieves we seem to overlook the fact that many larcenies and theft offences are committed with great violence and intimidation.</P>
    <P>We had an epidemic of crime in Limerick during the months of August and September which involved a gang of young thugs from Limerick city going ten, 15 and 20 miles out the country and terrorising elderly defenceless people in their own homes.  One case involved a man over 70 years of age who was detained for eight hours and constantly tortured and physically assaulted during the course of theft.  I had another case, a few miles from where I live, of a publican who has a small pub in a remote rural area and who suffered a stroke during <Col N="786" /> September.  One of these roving gangs learned of his stroke and raided his premises on average three times a week in September.  In both cases, those people had a ready market, in the sense of receivers to whom they could pass on the property.  If they did not have that market they would not have been out terrorising, beating and intimidating in the first place. It is incumbent on us as a Legislature to take this on board and try to do something about updating and improving the law with a view to securing convictions in this type of case.  The wife of that publican came to see me and I said to her: &ldquo;You are living in a house beside the pub, why do you leave stock in the premises at night when it is possible to remove it?&rdquo; Her reply was: &ldquo;We have to leave something for them, otherwise they might get angry and come in and attack us in our own home&rdquo;.  If that is the situation that prevails in this country in this day and age no Minister for Justice could move soon enough to try to correct it in some way.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we hear sociological, economic justifications for criminals.  I would go along with those to some extent.  There is no doubt that deprivation and alienation are some of the reasons for crime. I am acquainted with many people who have been convicted of crimes of larceny and even crimes of receiving and if they came from a different background if they had more advantages or fewer disadvantages, perhaps they would not have been before the courts in the first place. No such sociological or economic justifications can be advanced for the vast majority of receivers who, as Deputy McCartan has rightly said, come from the better classes, the middle class section of society.  It is a correct approach by the Legislature, despite what Deputy McCartan has said, to send out a clear signal today that we regard receiving as more heinous than ordinary crime.  The interpretation of the legislation is not that higher penalties must be imposed on receivers, than on ordinary criminals. The maximum penalty for a receiver or a handler, as he will now be, is 14 years <Col N="787" /> under this legislation.  The maximum penalty for an ordinary thief will be ten years. It is no harm to send out the signal that we recognise that many blameworthy, guilty receivers have walked away because of the difficulty of proof resulting from the courts' interpretation of the Larceny Act, 1916, that we are now getting serious about it, that we regard receiving as a particularly heinous crime, and that a lot of crime &mdash; I am not saying half of the crimes or most crimes of larceny &mdash; would not take place if there was not a ready market in the shape of receivers to take the goods on board.  I take Deputy McCartan's point and I agree with it.  It is ridiculous to say that if you had no receivers you would not have any thieves. One has only to state that proposition to see how ridiculous it is.  Deputy McCartan, Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Ahern have their experiences but my experience is that many people would not be before the courts for crimes of larceny and burglary or whatever unless there was a ready available market there to receive the goods that have been stolen.  Deputy McCartan spoke at length about the necessity for updating the larceny law as a whole.  I was glad to learn that the Law Reform Commission are looking at that at present and I hope they report quickly. The experience of some people seems to suggest that the Larceny Act, 1916, represents a better model for this country than something akin to the UK Theft Act, 1968.  I am not one of those people. I think the law would need to be updated but I am not saying that the 1968 Act is perfect.</P>
    <P>The new scheme in the UK Theft Act, 1968, provided the offence of theft for dishonest appropriations.  It also provided a series of offences which involved obtaining by deception.  The offence of theft in the United Kingdom Theft Act, 1968, replaced the old rules and substituted the concept of dishonest appropriation which embraces a wider range of conduct in taking and carrying away which is an essential part of the <i>actus reus</i> of larceny under the 1916 Act.  Its implementation has not been without <Col N="788" /> problems and difficulties and it has not been uncontroversial.</P>
    <P>I will mention a number of cases without going into detail, for the purpose of the record.  Anyone who wants to refer to them will see them as illustrating the point I am making, particularly in relation to the difficulties encountered by the courts with the concepts of appropriation and dishonesty.  I refer to the case of The Crown <i>v.</i> Feeley, 1973, Queens Bench, 530, the Crown <i>v.</i> McIvor, 1982, I All England Reports, 491, The Crown <i>v.</i> Ghosh, 1982, Queens Bench, 1053.  Anyone who takes the trouble to read the House of Lords judgment in the case of the Crown <i>v.</i> Morris, 1983, III All England Reports, 294, will be almost dizzy with the gyrations into which the House of Lords had to go in dealing with those concepts of dishonesty and appropriation.  Part of that is relevant to this Bill because the concept of dishonesty has been introduced to this Bill in the new <i>mens rea</i> of handling.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is no doubt that the 1968 Theft Act in the United Kingdom catches some very undesirable activity, the criminal status of which is uncertain under the law of this country. There is an interesting case called The Attorney General's Reference, 1984, 2 All England Reports, 216, which deals with a case of people who had been involved in property development, who were the sole shareholders in a number of property development companies, ripped off those companies in the sense that they took money out of the bank accounts of those companies, leaving suppliers of building materials, etc. stranded.  That sort of activity could not be criminally committed here.  It is punishable in the United Kingdom even though the memorandum and articles of association of the relevant companies allowed people to draw money from the bank account as they wished and without an explanation to anybody.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the 1916 Act needs to be updated immediately in some very obvious areas.  For instance, section 7 of <Col N="789" /> that Act refers to &ldquo;any of His Majesty's estates, palaces and houses&rdquo;.  &ldquo;His Majesty&rdquo; does not have any estates, palaces or houses in this country now.  However, there is a serious legal problem as references to the Crown cannot be assumed to have been adapted here, either expressly or by implication, because the case of Byrne <i>v.</i> Ireland, 1972, Irish Reports, 241, is authority for the proposition that in constitutional theory the State is not the successor of the crown.</P>
    <P>The 1916 legislation, to which Deputy McCartan adverted, is drafted in a rather verbose style which reflects the sort of drafting common in the last century and certainly does not reflect contemporary drafting style.  The 1916 Act provided widely different maximum penalties for different types of offences which reflected the values and views of a bygone age.  A person who stole a will, for instance, could get a maximum of life imprisonment whereas a person who stole documents of title to property received the comparatively minor maximum penalty of five years.  I welcome the change brought about by the Minister in sections 3 and 9 of this Bill. Section 3 provides that there will be a new offence of handling for which there will be a maximum penalty of 14 years. Section 9 provides for a maximum sentence of ten years for all larcenies referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with possession of housebreaking implements, etc. and provides for a maximum penalty of five years on the first conviction and ten years on subsequent and other convictions.  The legal difficulty with the 1916 Larceny Act is twofold.  First, the accused had to have knowledge that the property he received was stolen.  That had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The second difficulty related to having to prove that he received the property.  To say that somebody received something means that it came into their possession.  Possession is a nebulous and elusive concept and a great deal of the difficulty in proving a case under this 1916 legislation related to possession.  I say that for a reason which will become evident.  When hearing cases <Col N="790" /> brought under the 1916 legislation the courts had to consider at length the extent to which the alleged receiver had to be conscious of the fact that stolen goods were in his possession, under his control or in a place where he could get at them. A distinction was drawn in cases such as the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Kelly in 1953 between actual and constructive possession, a distinction which increases rather than reduced the difficulties.  The courts had to consider questions such as whether goods in the possession of somebody over whom the defendant had control were actually in the possession of the defendant.  I am talking about cases such as the Crown <i>v.</i> Wiley (1850) and the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Nugent and Byrne (1964) Irish Law Times 139.</P>
    <P>All the difficulties relating to the <i>actus reus</i> of receiving stolen property have been swept away by the new offence of handling but the concept of possession has been retained in this legislation.  Section 7 (2) says that where goods have come back into the possession of the original owner or into the possession of his agent or somebody in lawful authority, a person accused of handling those goods shall not be guilty if, before the act of handling is proved, they have come back into the possession of the other person. This represented the common law up to now so the difficulties experienced by the courts in cases like the Crown <i>v.</i> Vilensty, (1892), 2 Queen's Bench, 597, and the Crown <i>v.</i> King (1938), 2 All England Reports, 662, will continue.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission referred in detail to those cases and they have illustrated that they give rise to great conceptual difficulties and uncertainty in the law.  The Minister should have a chat with his parliamentary draftsman to see if we can arrive at a situation covered by section 7 (iii) without resurrecting or perpetuating all those difficulties.  The concept of possession again arises in section 5 (1) (a) which replaced the old section 43.  However, that need not concern us.  I am concerned about section 7 (3).</P>
    <P>I referred to maximum sentences and I welcomed them for the reasons I stated. I note that the Law Reform Commission <Col N="791" /> in paragraph 151, page 110, of their report recommend that provision should be included for compensating victims and it is disappointing that it is not included in this legislation.  I ask the Minister to include a section dealing with compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the new Bill is intended to update the law on possession of certain housebreaking implements.  There is a great deal in the section which I do not understand.  I agree that something like that is necessary because the only alternative to having a section which specifically provides for that would be to charge somebody with attempted burglary. Usually a person in possession of house-breaking implements could not be convicted of attempted burglary because it would be at too early a stage; the mere possession of the housebreaking implements would not lead to the conclusion of an attempted burglary unless he was found with the implements at the premises in question and perhaps actually beginning the process of burglary.  I agree that something should be done to prevent people having housebreaking implements.  There should be a specific offence to punish the possession of house-breaking implements because people who have those types of things in their possession clearly are morally blameworthy and should be made criminally blameworthy also.</P>
    <P>I do not understand precisely what the provisions of section 2 intend to achieve. For example, section 2 (1) states that a person will be guilty if found in possession, away from his place of abode, of any article for use in the course of or in connection with a burglary.  Section 2 (2) states that a person who is found in possession of any article made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with a burglary shall be guilty of an offence.  First of all, I do not see the reason for two different subsections here. I do not know how one can distinguish one from the other.  Are the provisions of subsection (2) intended to cover a person who is in possession of those implements at home?  Why is the defence of lawful <Col N="792" /> authority or reasonable excuse given in subsection (2) when it is not given in subsection (1)?  It appears to me that a person who is charged under the provisions of subsection (1) &mdash; and who advances the defence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse &mdash; will be able to do so anyway.  That type of argument can be advanced to disprove <i>mens rea</i>, or to establish a reasonable doubt as to guilt. I do not understand the need for the two subsections.  I do not know what they are trying to achieve.  Certainly it is not clear to me that the provisions of subsection (2) are intended to deal with different circumstances from those obtaining under the provisions of subsection (1).  I do not know why a specific defence was written into subsection (2) which arises by implementation anyway under the provisions of subsection (1).  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that when replying.</P>
    <P>The question has often arisen before the courts as to whether it was an offence to receive the proceeds of stolen property. In other words, if a thief stole property, sold that property and handed on the cash to a receiver, in those circumstances would the receiver be guilty? That is a question that exercised the minds of the courts.  As far as I can understand it, there appears to be a conflict between the judicial position in Ireland and that in the United Kingdom on this matter.  The Law Reform Commission and a number of textbooks on this subject referred to the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Farnan, 1933, 67 Irish Law Times Reports 208 as authority for the proposition that receiving the proceeds of stolen property would not be an offence. I do not know whether that is the latest word from the Irish courts on this subject. If it is, clearly it is wrong because it flies in the face of having precise terms of the definition of property in the 1916 Act.  On the other hand, in the United Kingdom &mdash; in the case of D'Andrea <i>v.</i> Woods, 1953 II All England Reports 1028 &mdash; the opposite was decided.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, on page 11 of their report referred to this <Col N="793" /> case.  I will read the section for the benefit of the House:</P>
    <P>In this case a number of savings stamps were stolen and converted for their cash value.  Some of the Bank of England notes received from them were handed to the appeleant who knew that they were part of the proceeds of the theft in conversion of the stamps.  The Queen's Bench Division had no hesitation in upholding a conviction for receiving.  Lord Chief Justice Goddard is quoted as saying</P>
    <P>Obviously the act was contemplating the theft of property which was then changed into some other property or into money and that money being used to buy something else.  It is quite sufficient to say here, without going further, that this money falls exactly into the definition of property converted or exchanged.  As the appellant knew that these notes had been acquired by theft he was properly convicted.</P>
    <P>The Lord Chief Justice there was interpreting the provisions of section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill it is said that section 7 (2) replaces a provision in the definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo; at section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act which appears to have the effect of making the offence of receiving apply to any property derived, however remotely, from the original stolen property. That would indicate to me that the Legislature in this country were doing something to confine the definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo; set out in section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act, that they were attempting to confine the definition to property directly derived from the stolen property.  If that was their intention &mdash; and that is my understanding from a reading of the explanatory memorandum &mdash; then they have made a bad job of it.</P>
    <P>The wording of section 7 (2), particularly the use of the words &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; appears to me to bring about a situation exactly similar to that envisaged in section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act.  I <Col N="794" /> happen to believe that section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act should have been repeated, should have been inserted in Irish legislation, that it is proper and correct that the proceeds of stolen property, no matter how often laundered, coming into the possession of a receiver &mdash; if he has the <i>mens rea</i> set out in section 3, that he knows or believes they represented directly or indirectly stolen property, should render him liable to conviction, that he is a proper person to be convicted. Why are we changing the wording of section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act expressly in our explanatory memorandum to confine the circumstances more directly and, at the same time, doing something which brings about the same result as the provisions of section 46 (1) of the 1916 Act? That is my interpretation.  If somebody else can advance another I shall be delighted to hear it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (4) of this Bill introduces a new definition of stolen property, that is the property that has to be handled in order to give rise to an offence under the provisions of this Bill.  The provisions of the 1916 Act covered property which was stolen or obtained in any way whatsoever under circumstances which amounted to a felony or a misdemeanour, that is section 33 (1) of the 1916 Act.  The Irish Bill does not follow that definition.  It defines stolen property in a fairly specific way.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the approach adopted in the Bill before the House omits some property which was wrongly acquired, or acquired otherwise than in the various ways set out in the section.  I think it does. For instance, the section does not cover property which has been smuggled or which has been the subject of a customs offence.  It is only right that the guilty, dishonest receipt of that sort of property should be criminally punishable.  I would ask the Minister to take a further look at this definition of stolen property.  It is my belief that the definition contained in the 1916 Act was preferable.  Difficulties have arisen in relation to the definition of stolen property in the 1916 Act, in that if a person is accused of the felony of receiving stolen property, then the prosecution would have to establish that the <Col N="795" /> original theft was a felony.  If they established only that the original theft was a misdemeanour then the accused receiver would not be guilty.  With a slight alteration in the wording the approach adopted in the 1916 Act was preferable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 7 (1).  By a curious anomaly in the law property stolen anywhere outside the Republic and received within the Republic could be the subject of a prosecution for receiving unless that property was stolen in the United Kingdom, and by the United Kingdom I mean the United Kingdom mainland.  If the property had been stolen in Northern Ireland a successful prosecution could be brought here but because of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the adaption of enactive legislation, property stolen within the United Kingdom could not be the subject of a prosecution here.  That was a clear anomaly in the law that is dealt with in section 7(1).</P>
    <P>I have one brief query on the interpretation of the provisions of section 7 (1).  The subsection states that an offence will be committed if property is handled here which was acquired in a way which amounted to an offence where and at the time the property was stolen.  Circumstances can arise &mdash; and I know of one that arose from practical experience in recent years &mdash; in which the actual acquisition of the property, the act by which the property was acquired, had ceased to be an offence at the time it was handled here.  What is the position in such circumstances?  I should like the Minister to advert to that when replying.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 of this Bill introduces a new <i>mens rea</i> for the new offence of handling.  These provisions are based on section 22 of the Theft Act of 1968 but is subdivided to overcome certain procedural difficulties set out in the report of the Law Reform Commission, page 60, lest anybody might think we had not carefully considered their recommendations.  We are following their suggestions here in relation to that part of section 3.</P>
    <P>The concept of the offence of handling <Col N="796" /> is so widely defined that if one is to read it strictly it covers certain things that are physically impossible to do.  I wonder is &ldquo;handling&rdquo; is the right word.  Perhaps &ldquo;dealing in stolen property&rdquo; would be a better phrase to use.  If we are to use the word &ldquo;handling&rdquo; we should make it absolutely clear that it does not imply just physical touching, because under this Bill even the making of a telephone call or the sending of a letter can constitute handling in relation to conveying an instruction where to deposit stolen property.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the concept of &ldquo;knowing or believing&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Believing&rdquo; was a word used in section 22 of the 1968 Act. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the Law Reform Commission reservations about the use of the word &ldquo;believing&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission adverted to the fact that the use of the word &ldquo;believing&rdquo; in the 1968 English Act was unfortunate. The difficulties in trying to expand <i>mens rea</i> by the use of the word &ldquo;believing&rdquo; were starkly illustrated after a number of court cases in the UK.  The Law Reform Commission referred to the case of the Crown <i>v.</i> Moys (1984) 79 Court of Criminal Appeal, 72.  For the purpose of the debate I will briefly read the facts of this case from the Law Reform Commission Report at page 60.  In that case the trial judge told the jury:</P>
    <P>... that strong suspicion coupled with a deliberate shutting of the eyes was not merely an alternative to but equivalent to belief.</P>
    <P>The Court of Appeal held that this was not correct and quoted an extract from the judgment of Lord Chief Justice Lane who said:</P>
    <P>The question is a subjective one and it must be proved that the defendant was aware of the theft or that he believed the goods to be stolen.  Suspicion that they were stolen, even coupled with the fact that he shut his eyes in the circumstances, is not enough although those matters may be taken into account by a jury when deciding <Col N="797" /> whether or not the necessary knowledge or belief existed.</P>
    <P>That illustrates that the attitude of UK courts was that belief was something akin to actual knowledge.  The Law Reform Commission in order to get around this diffitulty and ensure that cases like that would be decided differently here, recommended that the criterion for guilt should be actual knowledge or recklessness. The legislation does not go that far.  The approach adopted by the parliamentary draftsman here was to give a fairly detailed definition of &ldquo;belief&rdquo;. The definition of &ldquo;belief&rdquo; given in section 3 is quite clearly designed to bring suspicion within the ambit of <i>mens rea</i> for the purposes of this offence, but does it actually do so as well as it could otherwise be done?</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill inserting new section 33 (2) (c) says that a person shall be taken to have believed that a property was stolen if he thinks that such property was probably stolen.  That could be tidied up.  It represents some sort of compromise between the English Act of 1968 and the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, and it will be inadequate.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; which the Law Reform Commission recommend is not an easy one.  One can find any amount of academic writing or judicial reasoning about the meaning of &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;, but it is a safer, more direct and simpler criterion than saying &ldquo;belief includes thinking that something was probably stolen&rdquo;.  The more case law I read in this area, the more it becomes clear to me how complicated is the law and the easier it is for guilty people to walk free.  We are not justified in adding layers of definitions and words to <i>mens rea</i>.  The law in this area should be kept as clear and simple as possible.  The Law Reform Commission recommendation is not perfect but on balance it is better than defining &ldquo;belief&rdquo; as including thinking that property was probably stolen.</P>
    <P>There are some very simple sections under the 1968 Act and people who were charged under some of those sections walked away scot free because it was held <Col N="798" /> by the superior courts that the direction given by the trial judge was inadequate. I can imagine some of the directions that will be given here by trial judges when this thing starts to operate.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; adds to the situation.  If we say &ldquo;believing includes thinking&rdquo; the use of the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; indicates that believing, something is more than actually thinking, so by saying it &ldquo;includes thinking&rdquo; we are widening it anyway.  It represents an inadequate compromise between the difficulties encountered in the use of the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in section 22 of the 1968 Act and the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  I assume that what the legislature here intends is to bring suspicion within the ambit of <i>mens rea,</i> and I presume that the parliamentary draftsman feels that defining &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in this way, together with the shift in the evidential burden in section 33 (2) (b), will bring suspicion within the ambit of <i>mens rea</i> for this new offence of handling. I hope it does but it could have been done more simply following the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>A question that has arisen from time to time, particularly before the court in the UK, relates to attempted receiving. In the case of Haughton Smith (1975), Appeal Cases 476, the House of Lords in the UK held that goods had to be stolen, that it had to be established that goods were stolen in order to get a conviction for receiving and that if the goods were not stolen the accused could not be convicted of attempted receiving on the basis that one cannot attempt to do the impossible, that one cannot attempt to receive stolen goods if they have not been stolen in the first place.</P>
    <P>The UK legislation in the Criminal Appeal Act, 1981, allowed prosecutions to take place for attempted handling where the person believed the goods had been stolen and that belief turned out to be false.  Something similar should be enacted here.  Perhaps the Minister wishes to wait for a general review of the law of larceny, but it is something that might be more properly considered in <Col N="799" /> conjunction with this, because we are dealing specifically here with receiving/ handling.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new <i>mens rea</i> in section 3, to be convicted of handling a person either has to receive the property, undertake or assist in its retention, removal, disposal, etc, or arrange to do any of these things dishonestly.  Looking at this as objectively as I can I believe that if somebody receives property and knows it to be stolen he is acting dishonestly anyway.  If he receives property and believes, within the terms of the definition of belief here, that it is stolen he is acting dishonestly.  I do not think there is a necessity to add this new element of dishonesty into <i>mens rea</i>.  I have already referred to United Kingdom case law where the concept of dishonesty has given rise to great difficulty in practice. I heartily congratulate the Minister on bringing in this legislation to deal with a specific problem in the law, but my experience is that the shorter and simpler we keep it the better.  If it is too complicated and if there are too many layers of proof in regard to <i>mens rea</i> the inevitable result will be that guilty people will walk free.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>Another question that has arisen before the courts is whether the accused person, in order to be convicted under the 1916 Act, must know or believe that the property was stolen at the time he received it.  That belief is essential under the 1916 Act and the Law Reform Commission quote various cases in support of it.  I wonder what the position will be now and I would like the Minister to advert to that when he is replying.  If the receiver or the handler of the stolen property is innocent and later decides to dishonestly misappropriate the property, what will be the position now?  My own view is that if he has been charged for handling or receiving he can now, as a result of section 8 (2) of this Bill, be convicted of larceny but I would like the Minister to confirm that that is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the fact <Col N="800" /> that the new section 33 (2) (b), introduced by section 3, shifts the burden of proof on to the accused and he was concerned that that might have constitutional implications.  I do not agree that it has shifted the burden.  My understanding is that the traditional position will remain.  The burden will be on the prosecution from start to finish to prove their case.  What is shifted here is the evidential burden.  If the prosecution can provide evidence, firstly, that the property was stolen, secondly that it was handled, thirdly, that all the circumstances are suspicious and fourthly that the accused does not have a reasonable explanation, the court can come to the conclusion that the person guiltily or with <i>mens rea</i> handled that property.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission referred to the case of The People v. Oglesby, 1966.  What the Minister is doing in this subsection is putting that in statutory form.  That case and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal represent a good, sound, comprehensive statement of the law.  It is right and proper that it should be put into statutory form and I compliment the Minister on so doing &mdash; at least that is my understanding of what he is doing and I think that circumstances will bear that out.</P>
    <P>Section 8 allows the court to bring an alternative verdict when a person accused of handling is being tried and it becomes clear during the course of the trial that he is guilty of one of the larceny offences or <i>vice versa</i>.  That gets over some of the difficulties set out in the Law Reform Commission report, again lest it be thought that the Minister did not take into account what the Law Reform Commission said.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which was debated at length in this House, states in section 16 that where a member of the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of the stealing, fraudulent conversion, embezzlement or unlawful obtaining or receiving of money or other property is being committed, then certain action will be taken.  I wonder should the wording <Col N="801" /> be amended to read &ldquo;receiving or handling&rdquo; to take account of the fact that the law on receiving is now being updated?</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan lamented the fact that the law has not been updated since 1916.  I want to repeat what I have said on a number of occasions, that the 1968 Theft Act in the UK is not a very good model to follow.  We will have to build legislation on larceny from the ground up.  I am not in favour of this trend of slavishly following British legislation because it has proved again and again to be wrong and costly.  We have been debating Committee Stage of the Companies Bill, one part of which deals with loans to directors.  In the Bill as originally brought into this House in 1987, the 1986 English legislation was repeated word for word and it was a total absurdity.  It was a total absurdity in England and we imported it, warts and all.  When that became clear the Minister at the time, Deputy Burke, in fairness to him, took the legislation back to the Irish parliamentary draftsman who reconstructed it and made it comprehensible and proper legislation.</P>
    <P>I would make a number of suggestions to the Law Reform Commission in their present consideration of the general law on theft.  There are some forms of dishonest debt evasion that should clearly be criminalised because the civil law is not sufficient to deal with them.  When people evade their debts and there is a clear intention on their part to do so right from the beginning that should be criminalised.  The question of dishonest acquisition of services or labour should also be criminalised.  Section 13 of the Debtors Act (Ireland), 1872, goes part of the way to solving this problem but it is very inadequate and the law in that regard will have to be updated when introducing new theft law here.</P>
    <P>The unauthorised use of credit cards and cheque cards is something that has also given rise to great difficulty in practice. It has been suggested that in a limited number of cases it might amount to a false pretence, but again that is an area that will have to be updated and clearly and comprehensively dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> Deputy McCartan and others spoke about computer fraud.  Given the difficulty in establishing the old concepts of taking, obtaining or conversion, surely special provision is necessary to deal with this prevalent and growing area of crime.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to take anything I said as being critical of him personally.  Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, not the Minister for Justice, myself, the Law Reform Commission or the English legislators.  I welcome this Bill.  It goes some way towards solving a very real legal problem, a problem of proof, of convicting people who are providing a market for property stolen by thieves, and that is good.  There could be a number of improvements in the legislation as drafted.  I know the Minister Deputy Burke, and I know his record.  I congratulated him at the outset.  He has an excellent record in every Department in which he has served and I know that with this record and with his openminded approach to legislation, he will be prepared to listen to a reasonable case when Committee Stage is debated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin where Deputy O'Dea finished by availing of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Burke, on his appointment as Minister for Justice.  I hope the fact that we are discussing new legislation in this area so early in the Dáil session is an indication of the tenacity with which he endeavours to tackle the very real problems which come within the ambit of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy O'Dea state that the Law Reform Commission are at present undertaking a review of the wider aspects of larceny.  If that is the case I wonder is it right that we should be enacting legislation that clearly does not go far enough towards solving the very real problems that exist in that area, problems of a very technical nature, as far as the burden of proof is concerned, that were so vividly outlined by Deputy O'Dea?  More importantly, it fails to address society's response to an ever-increasing crime rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought if the Law <Col N="803" /> Reform Commission were carrying out a comprehensive review of the law with regard to larceny it would be better for us as legislators to await the production of that report and then consider introducing consolidated legislation similar to that produced in the social welfare code in 1981.  However, given that this Bill is before the House it is up to us to make the best of it.</P>
    <P>Each Member of the House would agree with me when I say that the increase in crime in recent years is alarming. One has only to go down to the Children's Court in Dublin on any morning of the week to see that, despite the best efforts of the Garda Síochána and the courts, we do not appear to be solving the problem or going anywhere near to solving it.  The figures contained in the various Garda annual crime reports bear this out.  In spite of a large increase in the number of convictions, we do not appear to be tackling the problem in the way society might wish.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the changes envisaged in this legislation will make all that much difference.  Vast areas are now so socially and economically impoverished that many people feel stolen goods are an extension of household goods.  A recent social worker's report on this topic pointed out that receiving and handling stolen goods is now an everyday occurrence and the people engaged in this practice do not see themselves as doing wrong.  A few hours before the Minister introduced this legislation the Secretary of the Inner City Traders' Association, Mr. Tom Coffey, was asked on radio for his response to a complaint with regard to the high levels of security in some stores in Dublin.  He pointed out that the level of crime in Dublin is three times that of London, that we have by far the highest rate of crime against property in the European Community whereas we have the lowest rate of crime against the person.  Clearly, our attitude to property demands serious scrutiny but this Bill fails to do so adequately.</P>
    <P>Obviously we must view this matter in the overall context.  The trend was <Col N="804" /> downwards between 1983 and 1987 but since then, unfortunately, it appears to be creeping up again.  If we compare the number of crimes detected with the number of offences recorded we will see that in the years since the early eighties the gap between those two figures has not become closer.  The latest figures available, those for 1988, show that 89,544 crimes were recorded in that year, whereas only 29,685 were detected. Therefore it is clear there is a huge gap between the two figures.  It is up to us as legislators to try to ensure that as many recorded offences as possible are detected.  This brings me back to the hardy annual, the level of resources we make available to the Garda Síochána to enable them to combat crime.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that it is only the official figures we can look at and that there is a very high level of unrecorded crime.  It is fair to say that, particularly in the larger urban areas, people do not bother reporting many minor thefts and burglaries.  For instance, bag snatching is now an every minute occurrence and bicycles now command an inordinately high level of security, such as chains and padlocks.  There is also the problem of shoplifting.  If we take these into account we can see how big a problem unrecorded crime is.  We should also examine the amount of money insurance companies have paid out in respect of claims arising out of burglaries in recent years to get a figure more authentic than the one released from the Garda Press Office or the Department of Justice.  As has already been mentioned, the value of stolen property in 1988 was a massive £34 million, of which just under £3 million was recovered.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to deal with this problem adequately.  I hope, in line with what Deputy O'Dea stated, that this perhaps is only an interim measure pending the production of a comprehensive report by the Law Reform Commission.  However, I suspect that may not be the case given the way in which the proposals from the commission were treated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of how watertight we can <Col N="805" /> make legislation we cannot ignore the question of the level of resources we make available to the Garda Síochána to combat crime.  The stark reality is that there are 155 Garda stations in rural areas without the services of a sergeant.  In Garda stations up and down the country there are gardaí, trained in crime fighting and detection, who perhaps may be six foot two inches tall and seventeen and a half stone in weight but who are deployed typing memos with both forefingers.  This problem has been highlighted on a number of occasions, yet we have failed to resolve it.  Currently there are gardaí engaged in duties which perhaps a 17 year or 18 year old clerical officer would be more than well equipped to carry out.</P>
    <P>I think that legislation such as this has to be dealt with in the light of the resources being made available to fight crime, and the lack of communication between the Government and such groups as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, voluntary groups that are endeavouring to come to terms with the ever-increasing crime rate.  We must look at this legislation in that context.  By doing so we will see that the Bill goes a little way towards solving our serious problems.  Everybody will agree that the law relating to receiving stolen goods and larceny was flawed, in so far as technical acquittals by the courts were giving rise to serious concern.  Clearly the evidence was such that it was not possible under the existing 1916 legislation to prove a conviction, and daily people who had serious question marks over their particular involvement in incidents walked free.</P>
    <P>Section 2 goes some small way towards tightening up what was a glaring loophole &mdash; the possession of dangerous weapons to commit a burglary at night.  It seemed to be acceptable to carry freely house-breaking implements down the street during the day, but not at night.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to change that.  However, I wonder if that section is sufficient?  One has also to take account of the availability of implements and weapons of a dangerous nature that could well be used for house-breaking <Col N="806" /> purposes and the manner in which they are freely available.  I accept that a Bill has already been published which will deal in some detail with extending the law relating to firearms and offensive weapons.  I hope that legislation will be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The reality is that in this city and throughout the country we have seen in recent years the alarming growth in Army surplus stores.  For a country that spends less of our gross domestic product on defence than any other European country we seem to have a very flourishing trade in Army surplus goods.  I would have thought, and certainly it was the case some years ago that Army surplus goods were for the boy scouts.  Woolly socks or Army boots or gas lamps were useful for people going on camping holidays and they appeared to be innocuous.  Today Army surplus stores are openly displaying swords, knives, bayonets and hatchets.</P>
    <P>The fact that weapons of a very dangerous nature can be sold freely over the counter in this city without there being a breach in the law is a very serious problem we have not addressed.  I hope the new firearms legislation coupled with section 2 of the Bill will go some way towards addressing that problem.  I think it is important in that regard that the Minister has included a forfeiture clause in section 2 (4).  The new section 28 (3) enables the court to order the forfeiture of any article for the possession of which a person has been convicted.  I think that is very important as it will take out of circulation many of these items that could be used at a later stage if they had not otherwise been forfeited.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report refers to this.  However, I do not think the Minister was being fair to them when he said in the course of his speech that the Law Reform Commission</P>
    <P>... have surveyed the state of the present law, both in this jurisdiction and in many others, and have put forward reasoned proposals for legislative change.</P>
    <P>He states that the House owes a debt of <Col N="807" /> gratitude to the Law Reform Commission. However, I think if the Minister were honest and fair to the Law Reform Commission he would not have said that because if he is of the opinion that the Law Reform Commission have published a fine report he would have followed on in detail some of the more comprehensive proposals, which clearly have been ignored under this legislation.  That weakens this legislation.  I do not think the Minister is being fair by complimenting the Law Reform Commission on the one hand and ignoring their report in so far as the substance of the Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea takes the view that we should not slavishly follow, for the sake of following, proposals either of the Law Reform Commission or indeed the British model.  I agree to an extent, but we must on all occasions legislate for the common good and enact legislation that is as watertight as possible to ensure that the spirit of the legislation is followed through in the best possible manner.  I am not sure we have done this.  While I would accept Deputy O'Dea's comments that we should not slavishing follow the British or other European models, nevertheless in this legislation as in any other legislation we have to bear in mind the greater interaction between states nowadays than at the time of drafting the original Larceny Act in 1916 or indeed any of the legislation that we brought forward in the twenties and thirties or in the early years of this State's existence. We now have to look at the European scene.  The more we harmonise our legislation in the criminal law code the more likely we are to be victorious in society's fight against crime.</P>
    <P>I would not like if it were the view of the House that we should not follow legislation in other jurisdictions simply because it has been enacted in other jurisdictions and we should have our own.  I think we should certainly look at the manner in which legislation is operating in other jurisdictions and if it is reasonably satisfactory we should proceed to take a leaf out of their book.  In the post-1992 era this will be of fundamental <Col N="808" /> importance in the criminal law code, as it is in the economic field, and we must look towards a harmonisation on the great European scene of our criminal law code.  Indeed, it may be incumbent upon us to look at legislation operating in Britain and continental Europe.  I do not think we should immediately dismiss the 1968 Theft Act simply because it was enacted in a jurisdiction other than our own.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Bill is in section 3 which deals with knowledge and possession of stolen property. The present law is stated quite clearly by Mr. Justice Henchy on page 26 of the Law Reform Commission report when he says that it is essential for a conviction for receiving stolen goods that the accused must at the time of receiving have actually known the goods to have been stolen.  Recklessness as to whether they were or were not stolen is not sufficient; actual knowledge of the fact that they were stolen is of the essence.  On reading that statement as to law one can immediately understand why the Minister felt it was necessary to update the law.  Nothing more than actual knowledge that the goods were stolen will now be sufficient evidence on which to found a conviction for receiving stolen goods.</P>
    <P>When the Minister and his Department were looking for a tightening up of that knowledge they definitely should have given more consideration to what the law Reform Commission had to say in their report on that aspect of knowledge. Recommendations 3 and 4 on page 115 of the Law Reform Commission report should have been adverted to by the Minister when he was drafting this legislation rather than the new section 3.  Recommendation 3 states: &ldquo;The test of liability for the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen&rdquo;. It is stated quite clearly in recommendation 4 that &ldquo;Recklessness should be defined so that a person acts recklessly if he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the goods were unlawfully obtained.  The risk must be of <Col N="809" /> such a nature and degree that considering the nature and purpose of the defendant's conduct and the circumstances to him its disregard involves culpability of a high degree&rdquo;.  That recommendation puts a duty of care on a person either handling or receiving stolen goods to inquire where the goods have come from.  Section 3 of the Bill is somewhat weak so far as knowledge is concerned.  We must place a strict duty of care on the accused which will represent a higher burden than that envisaged in paragraph (c) of section 3 which states &ldquo;believing property to be stolen property includes thinking that such property was probably stolen property&rdquo;. As Deputy O'Dea has stated already, that is perhaps a little messy as a definition and I wonder, were we to include that higher degree of care on an accused, whether we would be doing ourselves a greater service.  I think we would.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of section 3, which I believe is the kernel of the Bill, to which I should like to refer is the question of physical possession, which was dealt with earlier by both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Kavanagh.  Broadening the definition of possession is one area where the Minister followed the Law Reform Commission's proposals and in the circumstances subsection (1) is reasonable. While it does give rise to technical difficulties, I am not sure how it could be tightened up even further.  Of course, the description of handling will include much more than &ldquo;physically handling&rdquo; in so far as any association whatsoever by an accused with stolen goods, which could render him or her in serious difficulty, is concerned.  We should not let it go out that the word &ldquo;handling&rdquo; actually means any form of physical touching; clearly undertaking assisting, removing, disposing or arranging of goods is going to be sufficient.  Again I would share Deputy O'Dea's concern that perhaps the word &ldquo;handling&rdquo; is not an appropriate label, that perhaps some form of wording like &ldquo;association, associating with or dealing in&rdquo; might be more realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point I should like to refer to relates to section 5 and that portion of the Bill which deals with evidence.  Perhaps we might address ourselves more comprehensively to this matter on Committee Stage.  I believe there is a difficulty here in so far as the evidence of previous convictions is concerned. I am not sure why the Minister has seen fit to hold on to a section of the old legislation over which there was perhaps a serious question mark for some time.  The evidence of previous convictions in any trial on any matter could well give rise to serious constitutional difficulties, as has already been mentioned. If the Minister's answer is that it is a deterrent, that it may not be used but can be included in the legislation as a deterrent, why did he not broaden the earlier definitions to include recklessness as a duty on the accused so that one would not have to rely on the introduction of <Col N="811" /> evidence of previous convictions as a deterrent?</P>
      <P>I bow to the expert practical knowledge of Deputy McCartan in this regard.  He stated that before he entered the House he was engaged as a criminal lawyer for 14 years.  Of course, documentary evidence of that is already on the record of the House, and also that he was a successful criminal lawyer.  I accept what Deputy McCartan said, that during his years of practice he did not see section 43 (1) of the 1916 Act being used by the courts.  From my own inquiries I would certainly agree with that contention. However, when referring to the evidence of previous convictions the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that evidence of this type has been vital in the past in helping to establish the <i>mens rea</i> of the accused in cases where it might otherwise have been impossible to do so.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying to this debate he would be providing a service to the House if he were to give a number of instances where that evidence of previous convictions has helped in the past. Earlier speakers who appear to have expert knowledge in this regard have stated that section 43 (1) of the 1916 Act has not been used in the past and the Law Reform Commission on page 109 of their report, in so far as section 43 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, is concerned, state:</P>
      <P>In the light of misgivings we do not recommend the expansion of the section, although that has been suggested to us.  Indeed, as the section is apparently rarely relied on by prosecution, we think that no useful purpose is served by its retention in our law. Accordingly, we recommend that it be repealed.</P>
      <P>There is a need for the Minister to explain why he sees fit to hold on to this section of the 1916 Act over which there is clearly a question mark of a constitutional nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not adequate to tackle the problems we have.  Consideration might have been given to placing an onus on <Col N="812" /> dealers and pedlars of goods of various types to make inquiries as to the source of these goods.  In recent years there has been a proliferation of flea marketeers, Sunday morning markets.  I would question the operation of many of these markets and the source of the goods sold there.  Nowadays there are many door to door pedlars selling goods of questionable origin in housing estates.  Similarly pawn broking businesses are flourishing.  Let me give one incident where I feel a duty of care might have solved a particular problem.  I refer to an incident that was brought to my attention where a 17 year old boy received a sum of £100 for his mother's wedding ring. There is a compelling argument that a duty of care should be placed upon a pawnbroker or any dealer to inquire of a 17 year old whether he has obtained the ring under false pretences.  I think we have lost an opportunity to place such an obligation on dealers to inquire where goods might have come from.  All too often we see the &ldquo;Arthur Daly&rdquo; type character where people are handling goods with the proviso that no questions must be asked about where the goods came from.  If such a duty had been placed on the middle man to inquire as to the source of goods we might not have the problems we now have.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to penalties which have been dealt with by previous speakers. The threat of anything from ten to 20 years' imprisonment is not a deterrent. We have to look at alternatives to imprisoning people.  Imposing prison sentences has proved costly and statistics show that people who have spent some time in prison are more likely than not, because of the lack of rehabilitation procedures, to return to crime.  We have lost an opportunity in not providing that compensation should be paid to the victims of crime in this legislation.  In other jurisdictions that has worked quite well as a deterrent because where a victim is compensated by the receiver or burglar he realises society is doing something in response to the crime that has been perpetrated against him; similarly the wrongdoer is also seen by society to engage in the <Col N="813" /> physical handing over of compensation, whether by doing work or paying money, under the supervision of the probation and welfare services.  Up to now, the victim of crime has been ignored, and with the increase in crime over the past few years far too many of our law abiding citizens are becoming disillusioned with the legal process.  From the time an accused person is charged until the case is finally disposed of, the victim is in many ways made to feel like the accused.  There is a lack of consultation, a lack of courtesy on the part of the prosecution towards the victim, which adds further to the lack of success of prosecutions.  In this legislation the Minister should have provided for orders for compensation to be made where courts see fit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am delighted to see crime fighting legislation, albeit weak, at the kick off to the new Dáil session.  I hope it augurs well for the current Dáil session and that we will see much of the legislation promised by the last Government and the present Government to update our criminal law.  I hope the Minister for Justice will announce the reintroduction of the special committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism which did not sit in the course of the last Dáil but which, throughout its existence in the previous Dáil, worked hard and published a number of fine reports, some of which have already been acted upon.  There is a great need for that committee and I hope it will be reconstituted at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio but cannot let the opportunity pass without registering my absolute amazement at a Cabinet Minister holding such an important portfolio as Justice in addition to that of Communications. Perhaps that is why the Minister has not seen fit to listen to the Opposition responses here this morning.  I wonder if it is in the interests of the Department of Justice that the Minister responsible should also be responsible, in an unprecedented manner, for Communications. I hope the area of justice does not suffer because of that.  Having said that, I wish the Minister well.  I hope this is the first <Col N="814" /> of many Bills which are badly needed if we are to tackle the spiralling crime rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, add my congratulations to the Minister for Justice, this being his first time to put forward a Bill in this capacity.  The point made by Deputy Flanagan is a bit ungracious.  I have no doubt that one of the reasons the Taoiseach appointed Deputy Ray Burke as Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications was the excellent job he was doing at the Department of Communications. He probably was best informed in the matter of bringing in legislation to fix up the mess left by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in regard to illegal radio stations.  I agree that the Justice ministry is one of the most difficult and I have wondered why a junior post has not been created. I recall the previous Minister spent many hours in the Chamber dealing with the Judicial Separation Bill and other measures.  This necessitated much background work apart from time spent here. Deputy Burke has taken on a very difficult ministry but I have no doubt that he will excel as he has in his previous ministries, particularly in Communications.</P>
      <P>This is a very short Bill and it would be naive to think that it is the Government's sole answer to the problem.  The Bill is the first response of the current Government to the problems of crime in our society.  Crime figures, while they may be down in some areas, are up in others. There is a false perception that crime, particularly petty burglary, happens only in the cities.  As much crime, if not more, takes place in rural areas, the perpetrators often coming from the cities and urban areas.  We have a serious problem and this is one of the first efforts by this Government to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No piece of legislation, no matter how big or small or how technical, will cure all ills.  There is a need for extra gardaí. This Government and the previous one brought forward proposals to recruit 1,000 gardaí up to 1991.  This will have an effect in areas where they are most needed.  I acknowledge that there are <Col N="815" /> Garda stations which are unmanned or under-manned.  These extra gardaí, even though it will take slightly longer for them to come onstream, will help matters particularly in rural areas where there would appear to be a greater increase in crime than in the cities.</P>
    <P>A number of Members mentioned the need for gardaí to be taken out of offices. Most people would be surprised to know how many gardaí are working in offices. I understand the Minister and the Department are considering the matter. Perhaps civilians could take over certain duties such as typing.  There is, of course, an element of confidentiality which is vital in Garda work and this is probably one of the main reasons that civilians have not been doing this work.  Their employment might lead to leaks of information from Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the various neighbourhood watch schemes and I do not accept Deputy Flanagan's claim that the Government's response is negligible. These schemes have been well worked by the gardaí, particularly in urban areas. There is a current proposal for community gardaí in the city of Dublin.  I hope when the extra gardaí come onstream we will have more on the beat than in squad cars.  This is vitally important if we are to prevent crime taking place.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1916 badly needed to be changed.  Any practitioner in the courts knows it is outdated.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the Act is verbose and technical and there was always a perception in regard to receiving that it was easy to get off. Perhaps due to the quality of the district justices in my area I have not seen many men getting off because they said they did not know goods were stolen.  Common sense has prevailed and by and large those who were guilty of receiving stolen goods were convicted.</P>
    <P>The nub of the question centres on <i>mens rea</i>, malice aforethought.  A number suggestions have been made as to the way it should be handled.  The Bill suggests leaving in &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; and including &ldquo;believing it to have been known&rdquo;, which would include thinking <Col N="816" /> the goods were probably stolen.  The Law Reform Commission came down in favour of the term &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;, but I would be wary of that.  In criminal law malice aforethought was always necessary. A person in possession of a particular item in a reckless way would not necessarily have malice aforethought. The inclusion of the term &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; could bring in many people who would not have malice aforethought.  Malice aforethought would imply much more than just an intention to receive or to handle.  It would encompass a decision on a person's part to receive particular goods.  The Bill opts for the middle ground and probably covers the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>I would agree somewhat with Deputy Kavanagh regarding section 3 which refers to a person thinking that property was probably stolen.  I am not sure this is the best phrase and the Minister should have another look at it.  I do not think it is the best solution, although I am not necessarily saying that some other provision such as &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; should be included.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are alleging that the Government did not go along with the proposals of the Law Reform Commission. I agree with Deputy O'Dea that we should not slavishly accept the recommendations of the commission or any legislation introduced in other jurisdictions. It is correct to say that we should bear in mind such legislation and take into consideration other judicial decisions on it.  However, our legislation should deal with the problems we have. Our laws should suit our circumstances.</P>

      <P>In view of the importance which I attach to this matter I have taken strong action to control farmyard pollution by making generous grants available to farmers for the construction of storage tanks for animal wastes and silage effluent.  Primary responsibility for water pollution control rests with the Minister for the Environment and the local authorities. Regional fisheries boards are responsible for the protection of fisheries, including the protection of fish bearing waters from pollution under the Fisheries Acts.  As my Department have no statutory role in the control of pollution, in the circumstances, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to take the initiative suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the last 12 months, 22,613 applications were submitted to my Department for pollution control aid and approvals to proceed with work issued in 12,596 cases, involving total grants of £33 million and a total investment of £66 million which I think is an encouraging indication of the commitment of the farming community and the farm organisations to deal with this important issue.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  Having regard to the extensive volume of capital for which he has responsibility to combat rural pollution &mdash; he mentioned a figure of £66 million &mdash; I should like to ask the Minister if he agrees that that responsibility should be transferred to the Department of the Environment.  In other words, I am asking the Minister if he agrees that slurry pits and other farm installations should be subject to planning permission with one Department having overall responsibility. Is it not possible for the Minister, <Col N="818" /> having regard to the extensive discussions he had with farm organisations, to ask them to consider establishing a compensation fund to make good damage caused by accidental spillages even though he does not have statutory responsibility?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the reason the Deputy tabled the question. In general I agree that there is a sense of urgency about this matter.

I should like to assure the Deputy that I have had consultations with Teagasc in regard to this matter.  Our advisory services are sharply aware of the need to protect the environment, water courses and so on when establishing such units. That was not always the case.  I should like to assure the Deputy that I have been in consultation with the Minister for the Environment concerning the legislation he has before the House to ensure that we will have a pollution free environment. Of course, a pollution free environment is of more importance to our farmers than anybody else because of the premium prices paid for their products on the basis that they come from such an environment.  I agree that this is a matter of national interest because we must take into consideration the tourist industry.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that there was a dramatic drop in the number of fish kills notified last year compared to the previous year.  I am satisfied that that trend is continuing.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his extensive reply.  I should like to ask him to use his influence with the farm organisations to try to get them to address the minority of their members who persist in using the rivers and lakes of Ireland as an open sewer.  Will the Minister agree that, having regard to the huge sums of money given by the European Community to Irish farmers, out of the goodness of their hearts, if not their pockets, and having regard to the importance of a pollution-free agricultural <Col N="819" /> industry, farmers should see their way to establishing a compensation fund as I have suggested?  Will the Minister put that suggestion to them?</P>

      <P>If the Minister's concern that farms are brought up to a proper standard is so great, I wonder why farmers cannot get approval from the Department.  In one county there are 130 files on a desk and they will be left there because there is no clerical staff to deal with them.  That has been going on for two or three months.  I accept the Minister's sincerity in regard to this but I wonder why he permits backlogs to build up.</P>

I do not pretend that it will be possible to get all the staff necessary to process those applications as soon as they are submitted but I should like to <Col N="820" /> assure the Deputy that this is a priority with us.

Will he agree that those authorities should be properly funded to carry out inspections to control pollution?

The Department of Tourism and Transport are involved, as are the Fisheries section and the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture and Food.  We work on the basis of advancing the national interest <Col N="821" /> through common action.  I think we are achieving that as is evident from tourism, but in this case I have indicated that the Minister for the Environment has statutory control and responsibility in relation to administering penalties and whatever else.  That is the way it will remain.  If the Deputy is suggesting that a Minister who happens to be in close contact with the farmers should suddenly withdraw from it and not have a positive basis of persuasion to promote, which has been very effective, I could not agree with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finnucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the reason farmers with bovine TB and brucellosis reactors have to endure such undue delays for payment from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The delays which are occurring in the payment of reactor grants are being caused by the temporary dislocation of work involved in preparing for the decentralisation of certain sections of my Department to Cavan. Additional staff for the relevant payment duties are now being trained and it is expected that the period required for processing payments will be substantially reduced in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finnucane Mr. Finnucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finnucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  It is interesting to have the matter clarified here today because many farmers have been frustrated by the lengthy delays and I am sure every Deputy finds contacting the Department at present a frustrating experience when told that all that is available is one senior accounts person and two trainees who administer an accounts function for the entire country.  If extra staffing is required that is a priority because farmers who suffer the emotional trauma of their stock having bovine TB with the consequent financial loss have enough on their plate without waiting an excessive time. The Minister will have to reduce that time and I think he is taking the measures to do so.  Is it true that no money is available at present for FDS?  If that is the case, is any funding available at present to pay these TB grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is available for these TB grants.  The Deputy might not be aware of that because he has not been here previously and I do not say that in any sense of comment that he would not have full knowledge.  We have increased the rate of Government and taxpayers support for ERAD to an unprecedented level.  It is the only area of Government service where there has been a guaranteed payment over four <Col N="823" /> years.  It is a matter for ERAD as to the level of compensation grants they pay. Last year they increased the level of grants &mdash; they recommended to me that that be done and I did it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there is a delay and accept that that is a hardship, but we have now installed a fully computerised programme that will be available to deal with these things quickly.  A feature of the ERAD programme has been that last year and this year we have the most comprehensive round of testing ever undertaken. One of the natural consequences of that is that you will turn up more reactors than you would if you did not have a comprehensive round of testing. We are dealing with it expeditiously and the computerisation programme will be a great help in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finnucane Mr. Finnucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finnucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I contacted the Department of Agriculture and Food today in connection with a constituent and I have been informed that at present there is no financial funding to cover roadway improvement grants under the FDS but they are hoping for a subvention. Is that true?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes the four year funding programme, but in case it would have got across here that it is only the taxpayers via the Department of Agriculture who are involved, let me say farmers will be contributing much more than the Department, as the Minister knows well.  Does the Minister think it proper and correct that farmers who had either a TB or brucellosis stall have to wait six to eight months for their payment, considering they have no income in the meantime? Surely in Agriculture House that should not be allowed.  I can give five or six instances of where people were cleaned out by those two terrible diseases and still they have not been paid.  Finally, is it <Col N="824" /> reasonable to expect the smallest of farmers who would not have a taxable income in five years, never mind one, to have to produce a tax number to the Department of Agriculture and Food before they get their grant when animal disease has hit their farms?</P>

They have the primary responsibility for notifying reactors and matters of that kind because that is their role.

This is the biggest budget ever made available <Col N="826" /> and it will last over a four year programme. As Deputy Connaughton has said, it is contributed to a major extent by the farmers themselves.  There is no question of a monthly budget.  It is a multi-annual programme being implemented by ERAD.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 3, 5, 10, 11, 19, 22, 32, 47, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> The position in regard to the extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas is that the first part of the survey of all areas, including those mentioned in the questions was completed earlier this year and the second part of that survey has been completed just recently.  My Department are now processing the data obtained from these two survey exercises on computer at present and, when that processing is completed, I will present to the Government for approval the lists of areas deemed eligible according to EC criteria for inclusion or for reclassification. I would hope that this can be done before the end of 1989 and following Government approval of the lists, I will immediately make a formal submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate how long it will take to obtain EC approval or when payments can be made in the new or reclassified areas.  Deputies can rest assured, however, that I will make every effort to expedite EC approval and that the necessary funding for headage payments will be provided in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a few interesting points, one of which is that he cannot anticipate when these payments will be made to the farmers.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware &mdash; but it is a fact and it is referred to in my question &mdash; that the cattle headage payments are a cornerstone of the economic or financial outreach of the Community to small farmers under the Structural Funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that we are living under the regime of the Structural Funds at present.  Is it not only fair to ask the Minister that if the Structural Funds are in force at present, and are being paid under the various headings, we should expect that these payments would commence on the first day in 1990.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and relevant.  It is because of the importance we attach to this that we have conducted such an extensive survey.  In fact, the review covered over 4 million acres.  We are dealing with a huge survey and I committed all the staff I could to ensure that the benefit of the headage payments &mdash; about which I am fully familiar and, incidentally, I have got increases on them for the European Commission over the last couple of years would be available to the maximum number possible. Obviously, the final outcome will depend not only on the Commission but on the Council of Ministers when the matter is fully considered next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very satisfactory answer.  Counties Roscommon and Galway are the only two areas west of the River Shannon where there are farmers who are excluded.  I am not saying that the scheme should not apply to other areas but those areas west of the Shannon are the ones where it should best apply.  In County Roscommon, for instance, 4,213 farmers are included. These are relevant and very germane matters.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister be more forthcoming in relation to financing arrangements?  For instance, it is commonly felt that the delay in dealing with this has been attributed to the unwillingness of the Government to make funding available for the headage in the extra areas.  There seems to be validity in that in view of the fact that the decision to <Col N="837" /> reclassify and extend was made by the Fine Gael Government around November 1986, nearly three years ago.  Will the Minister state categorically that there will be no further delays because of funding difficulties?  Will he be more definite in relation to the rate of recoupment he expects from the Structural Fund?  Will we get the 70 per cent or 75 per cent which has been talked about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of hormonal substances for growth promotion purposes is prohibited throughout the Community. I introduced stringent regulations in September 1988 to meet our obligations under the EC Directives and to consolidate existing legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>Over 300 officers are authorised to enforce the regulations.  A variety of measures have been adopted for this purpose. These include sampling and examination, both random and on suspicion, of animals on farms, at both ante and post-mortem stages at slaughtering facilities and strict controls on both retail and wholesale veterinary medicine sales outlets. Since the introduction of the regulations the illegal use of hormones has been detected on 98 occasions in a total of 237 cattle.  Where animals are found to have been illegally treated with hormones they cannot be used as food for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have been engaged in an ongoing campaign against the illegal availability and use of veterinary drugs including hormones.  Since January 1987 prosecutions have been brought against 39 persons covering a total of 150 offences involving the illegal sale, possession or use of drugs.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the disadvantaged areas low income farmers already receive direct income aids through the mechanism of headage grant payments.  The <Col N="843" /> cattle headage scheme operates in the most severely handicapped areas and the beef cow scheme operates in the less severely handicapped areas; in both these schemes a maximum annual grant of £1,880 is available to low income farmers. The sheep headage scheme operates throughout the disadvantaged areas and in designated mountain sheep areas. Under this scheme a maximum annual grant of £1,750 is available to low income farmers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the EC Agricultural Council adopted a regulation in March 1989 permitting the introduction by member states, under certain conditions, of a system of aids to agricultural income. Discussions are in progress at Commission level on a proposed regulation laying down detailed rules for the application of such aids.  Following adoption of the latter regulation a decision will be taken as to whether the system would apply in Ireland.  The NESC recommendation, which would have wide and complex implications, would of course be taken into account at that stage, as would the views of the major farming organisations.</P>

In view of that, are he and his Department not in favour of a direct income system of payments to small farmers to encourage them remain on the land?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Common Agricultural Policy aims to ensure both a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and that food supplies should reach consumers at reasonable prices. The Government are extremely conscious of the need to reconcile these aims to the maximum extent and have thus been prepared to accept changes in the CAP designed to ensure better market orientation, provided these changes are balanced by measures to safeguard rural incomes.  The Government are, of course, also conscious of the need to maximise the value of our agri-food production, the great bulk of which is produced for export.  The value to the economy of these exports was, as the Deputy will be aware, highlighted in a Teagasc report published earlier this week.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> EC institutional support prices for agricultural products have, generally speaking, not increased since 1984 though in Ireland's case some element of farm price increase has resulted from &ldquo;green&rdquo; currency adjustments; these adjustments have had a far less than proportionate impact on consumer prices.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The CAP has assured the consumer of the availability of a wide range of quality foods, without the price and supply fluctuations which are common in many countries.  In recent years Irish food prices have increased only in line with the general level of inflation.  Between 1984 and 1988 the price of foodstuffs in Ireland according to the CSO increased by 4.7 per cent annually compared to a 4.64 per cent annual increase for all items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that arising from the present operation of the CAP consumers are hit twice?  The taxpayer pays into the Community budget in the first instance and is then taxed on the double by paying high prices for food which effectively is a transfer from the poorer taxpayer into the rich farmers' pockets.  Ordinarily, PAYE workers are paying tax and extra food costs to supplement the incomes of large farmers because that is where the income from the CAP goes.  Would the Minister agree with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken every available opportunity to highlight Ireland's excellent avian health status and will continue to do so.  Special measures such as publicity campaigns to promote the poultry and eggs industry would be primarily a matter for the industry itself. However, I will review the role of my Department in such campaigns, if and when appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the salmonella scare last year in the UK would the Minister agree that it presented a great opportunity for the Irish poultry and egg industry to capitalise on that situation in terms of marketing, and that as a first step it is essential for his Department to spearhead a campaign to promote the <Col N="851" /> disease-free status of the Irish industry and thus substantially increase their sales and exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Durkan said.  We have a very high health status in the avian area equalled only in EC by Northern Ireland and Denmark. Following a salmonella scare in the UK in 1988 the Department took immediate action and introduced a code of practice for the poultry and egg industry.  This was launched by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, on 9 December last year. The code addressed all sectors of the industry, breeders, hatcheries, growers and so on and laid down the most stringent practices to be followed.  It set very strict requirements in relation to hygiene, health standards, the use of inputs and also established monitoring procedures. The Department have taken immediate action to spearhead a programme to ensure safety for the consumer and good health in the industry and a good healthy economy in relation to the poultry and eggs industry.</P>

      <P>The European Regional Development Fund provides assistance for general economic development measures and is not the responsibility of my Department.  Assistance for agriculture is provided from the guidance section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and to a lesser extent from the European Social Fund.  I am unable to provide details of the amounts of funding which will be available for individual measures in advance of the conclusion of negotiations with the Commission on the Community support framework.  However, the Deputy will recall that earlier this year I negotiated as a special concession in advance of the Community support framework an agreement with the Commission on the introduction of the operational programme relating to the protection and conservation of the rural environment through the control of farmyard pollution.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring not to the Regional Fund but to the total Structural Funds which cover three areas &mdash; the Regional Development <Col N="853" /> Fund, which he mentioned in his question, the Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Fund.  Let me assure the Deputy that of course submissions have been made by the Government in regard to the FEOGA guidance fund for which I am responsible, and as I indicated earlier, that matter has not been concluded yet.  I assure the Deputy that there is a sizeable proportion of the total Structural Fund in the Government submission for FEOGA guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to reintroduce the Second Stage of the Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill this session. This Bill provides for the retention of a number of controls on the sale of agricultural land which will in future be exercised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Policies in relation to land will be kept under continuous review in the light of changes in Irish agriculture, the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy and other relevant developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister described the NESC report as a well informed report.  I would remind him that the report stated that there has been no coherent land policy and no structural policy in Irish agriculture.  Could I ask the Minister, is the report wrong in that regard?  Will the Government establish an alternative agency to the Land Commission, as recommended in the interdepartmental report of 1978 which many Fianna Fáil Deputies at the time supported? Will the Government consider introducing legislation based on their own White Paper of 1980, a very far-reaching White Paper?  Will it cover such areas as compulsory acquisition, control of land purchase by non-agricultural interests, taxation measures, financial assistance for new and expanding farmers and the purchase or leasing of land, all of which were covered in the previous Fianna Fáil Government's White Paper? Is he now saying that all we will literally have is a cheque book control of land distribution without any land agency, and with only an occasional slight intervention by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying no such thing.  I am impressed by the Deputy's enthusiasm for something which the previous Government, of which his party were a member, abolished.  As the <Col N="855" /> Deputy knows, that Government abolished the Land Commission in 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 23 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>In replying to a number of parliamentary questions on 26 April 1989 I gave details of the sampling of beef held under the 1988 Aids to Private Storage (APS) scheme being undertaken by my Department in co-operation with Customs.  The Department carried out an examination of the documentary details of the 2,468 contracts involved.  Following examination of the APS documentation selected contracts from the seven largest participants in the scheme, which accounted for 95 per cent of the tonnage under APS contract and almost 94 per cent of the deboned beef, were targeted for investigation to confirm that the EC rules for APS aid and export refund subsidies were observed.  The preliminary findings of the examination programme indicated that four of the firms involved in the sampling had not complied with all the terms of the relevant regulations in respect of some of their production.  Subsequently further sampling was undertaken to determine whether the infringements were isolated or existed on a wider scale.  The sampling has now been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department are in consultation with the European Commission, which has been kept informed of the progress of the investigation, to arrange for discussions about the outcome of the sampling operation and to consider the level of penalties that should be applied in each case.  Pending final consideration of the <Col N="858" /> results in consultation with the Commission services it is not possible to say precisely what level of penalties will apply.</P>
    <P>In so far as the holding of funds or guarantees is concerned, the Department hold adequate guarantees to cover all the transactions under investigation.  The precise figure for the guarantees being held is, of course, a confidential matter between the Department and the firms concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>Would the Minister state whether the report will be published in full and brought before the Dáil for debate?  I know he mentioned that a number of firms are involved in fraud. Could he state which firms?

It is very clear that this has been done fully in consultation with the Commission services and has been ongoing and will continue in the future. This was a very intensive investigation and I want to assure the House that at all times consultations have been in accordance with the highest standards whether <Col N="859" /> at home or at Commission services.  The penalties to be finally imposed will be agreed in consultation with the Commission. I cannot suggest that there will be brought before the House a report on this or on any further incidence of naming names.  That is not the way it is done.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is rather extraordinary at this stage if, as a result of his investigations he has found that there is fraud, he cannot say what penalties he or his Department propose to impose?  Would he not agree that it is vitally important to stamp out fraud and that the way to do it is to publish in full the results of the investigations and the names of the companies who have been investigated?</P>

We have been in constant consultation with the Commission and everything is being done according to the strictest possible standards. I will ensure, as I have ensured over the past two years, that this will remain the case.  I cannot, of course, indicate what the level of penalty will be until detailed consultations with the Commission have terminated and I cannot say when that will happen.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the establishment of a meat processing plant at Tuam has been held up as a result of difficulties regarding the disposal of effluent from the proposed new plant.  This is of course a matter for resolution between Goodman International and Galway County Council. With regard to the other projects proposed under the Goodman development plan, work has not yet commenced and no grants have been paid in respect of any of the projects.  The phasing of the work on these projects is of course primarily a matter for the company.  There has been no renegotiation of the job targets envisaged in the agreement with the IDA.</P>

Bearing in mind the great splash of publicity in which <Col N="861" /> the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State engaged in on the day this huge food processing venture was announced, is the Minister of State now telling the House that two years later not a single job has been created and not a single penny has been drawn down from the IDA, in other words that it has been a non-event&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was dealing with section 3, which is the kernel of the Bill.  Up until now it had to be proven that the defendant had actual knowledge of the fact that the item was stolen.  This section broadens it.  I had said that I did not particularly agree with bringing in the element of recklessness because I felt a number of people could be careless or reckless in their dealings and they might genuinely not know that the item had been stolen.  That is why I feel the Department are quite right in not taking on this element of recklessness and in dealing with the matter in a different way.  However as I have said I am not particularly sure that the words &ldquo;knowing or believing it to be stolen property&rdquo; are the right way to go about it and this should be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion this legislation reduces the onus of proof on the prosecution. There is no doubt about that.  The people <Col N="952" /> who made submissions to the Law Reform Commission had an interest in putting forward a certain type of case.  I do not think it is right that we should slavishly follow on from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report, even though the report is excellent.  I feel that the Government and we in Parliament have to tease out and bring our personal knowledge to bear on the legislation.  As I have said, interest groups put forward their own interests when they are making submissions to the Law Reform Commission and we therefore have to find a happy medium.  I hope that we will bring this point up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of actual knowledge has been part of a great deal of legislation and case law.  Indeed in the intoxicating liquor legislation the publican could say in his defence that he did not know that the person was under age and he had a justifiable case to be acquitted.  However this has been changed in the recent legislation and this shows that we are tightening up the legislation in a number of similar areas in order to make convictions stick.  There is a genuine need to tighten the legislation because as somebody said the lawyers pick holes in it.</P>
    <P>That inferences can be drawn reduces the onus on the prosecution and to a certain extent puts it on the defence.  I am not so sure that this is a good thing. The section goes on to say &ldquo;.... handles .... in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that he knew or believed the property to be stolen ...&rdquo; This shows how the onus is, to a certain extent, being put on the defence to prove that they did not in fact know that a particular item was stolen.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 43 of the 1916 Act and the allowing of previous convictions to be tendered in evidence is a fairly thorny subject.  While I would have sympathy with many of the arguments made by some Members on the opposite side of the House, and my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, counter to what Deputy McCartan has said I have come across a case where section 43 was invoked and nobody on the defence side <Col N="953" /> queried the constitutionality of that section. Deputy O'Keeffe made great play of the fact that this could possibly be unconstitutional and that what we are proposing in the legislation is an extension of that section, which the Law Reform Commission suggested should be done away with altogether.  I am not sure about this.  It is necessary to prove the prior history of someone who receives or handles stolen goods; it is good that that should be done.  I believe the safeguards are suitable to take care of any situation which might arise in a prosecution where the defendant could be unfairly taken advantage of.</P>
    <P>The idea of alternative verdicts is addressed in the Bill.  This is to be commended because in my practice I have often found that defendants who have been charged only with receiving stolen property have been let off, sometimes on the basis that they did not know it was stolen, while the prosecution have failed and have not been able to get a verdict on any other charge.  It is good that there should be an ability to have alternative verdicts.  I am glad this provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think a previous speaker mentioned that the withholding of information is well taken care of in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, where fairly good strictures are put on suspects in relation to the withholding of information.  As one speaker suggested, perhaps that provision should now be changed by including an amendment in this Bill to cover handling as well as receiving stolen goods.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy O'Dea referred to stolen credit cards but this problem will be taken care of under section 2 of the Bill which states: &ldquo;A person who is, when not at his place of abode, in possession of any article for use in the course of or in connection with larceny or burglary ....&rdquo;  I think every Deputy is aware of, and it is getting more publicity every day, the bogus collections at doorsteps. Up to now I know the Garda have had grave difficulty in charging people but under section 2 they will have the ability to charge someone who is committing this type of offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> While the Bill is only a first step, it is a good step.  A lot of the problematic areas can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister is well aware of the sentiments expressed by many Members that not only this legislation but very direct methods and resources should be made available to ensure that crime which has increased in some areas &mdash; thankfully it has decreased in other areas &mdash; is stopped.  As I said earlier, the Minister has shown in every other portfolio he has had that he takes to it with a vengeance and I have no doubt that he will implement changes which will ensure that a good stricture will be put on crime.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made some very relevant points.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh, a non-lawyer, as he said himself, in regard to the whole area of &ldquo;believing&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.  I am not particularly sure if there is a difference between them and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  Many of the problems Deputies have will be taken care of on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to give a general welcome to the Bill on the basis that new measures are necessary to combat the increasing rise in the crime rate with particular reference to the trade in stolen goods.  As we all know the trade in stolen goods has become big business and a type of brokerage has grown up over the past few years.  Because of the increasing value, size and scale of the properties being stolen it had become increasingly obvious that new measures were necessary to combat this undesirable growth in crime.  For this reason I welcome the Bill, but as I said I do so conditionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing which worries me, as is often the case in matters of this nature, is, having listened to members of the legal profession over the past few hours, how they would interpret the various definitions laid down in the Bill, with particular reference to &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;, to which the Minister referred on page 1 of his speech.  While on the one hand the proposed changes are useful, I wonder what kind of legal arguments will be put <Col N="955" /> forward in the courts when the time comes for somebody to prove or disprove, as the case may be, that, instead of the receiver having had prior knowledge that the goods were stolen, the accused believed or thought that the property was stolen.</P>
    <P>While the Bill seeks to resolve a problem it could end up in virtually the same <i>cul-de-sac</i> as prevails at present.  As a non-legal person &mdash; and again having listened to the submissions of various learned, legal people today &mdash; I can see quite a number of avenues where the counsel on either side are likely to argue into infinity the various interpretations as to how one can know whether a person had prior knowledge, whether the prosecution actually knew they had prior knowledge or whether, as in this case, they will be able to stand up and say the receiver believed that the goods were stolen.</P>
    <P>There is a need to call a halt to the cavalier attitude that has existed not just in relation to any particular type of larceny but in relation to a whole range of goods that are regularly being sold. Whole containers of meat or clothing can disappear from roadside car parks.  Virtually any commodity that can be carried by road, rail or air is now likely to be stolen at one time or another.  Such items are of no use whatever unless they can be disposed of.  The channels through which they are disposed of have means of laundering the goods before filtering them on to the market again and the Bill will probably go some way towards taking on those people.  This is big business. Whole container loads of various products have disappeared without trace only to reappear somewhere else, and in difficult times consumers may be taken in by generous offers made by people peddling these goods.  I hope the Bill will be successful in that area.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill is the whole area of &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; for the &ldquo;discerning criminal&rdquo;, for example, crowbars, hatchets and sawn-off shotguns, and the various paraphernalia necessary for a <Col N="956" /> criminal to have readily available.  There is every reason to take action to put the people who supply such goods out of business.  It has become obvious in recent years that there are people in the brokerage business who are able to lend or lease their property to criminals who might need these implements in a hurry and such people have to be put out of business. It is rather alarming that the Garda can stop an individual in possession of such items as sawn-off shotguns, hatchets or heavy duty wire cutters which would hardly be used in the ordinary household as part of the gardening equipment, and that when charged these people are often allowed out on bail.  People who carry such implements do not do so for the good of their health or that of anybody else.  They are not on an errand of mercy or involved in any community activity that I can think of.  They have no other purpose than to commit a felony and possibly to take life.  We have become complacent in dealing with people like that.  One atrocity seems to recede into the distance as another comes over the horizon.  That is an alarming development in our society.  Whether for bank robberies, post office robberies or whatever, in most cases these people have access to the materials they need to carry out such felonies, sometimes from their own resources but very often, as has been pointed out on several occasions, from firms who act as brokers in providing the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; with the day-to-day necessities of running their illegal business.</P>
    <P>The Garda have the almost impossible job of putting them out of business, and hopefully this Bill will help.  What puzzles me is why in any circumstances people possessing such implements could expect to get out on bail pending a trial.  I think there should be no circumstances in which that should happen.  The fact that they have in their possession materials of the nature I have described should be sufficient indication of their intentions. Allowing such people out on bail puts further pressures on the Garda in their attempts to curtail such activities.  It is not unusual for people who have been apprehended, almost en route to commit <Col N="957" /> a crime, to be released on bail and commit other crimes of a similar nature while still on bail in connection with an earlier crime.  This creates a whole welter of administrative difficulties by virtue of the fact that somebody somewhere decides that these individuals are innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>At what stage do such people become guilty?  Is it only after they have become involved in a heinous crime of one type or another, after they have killed or maimed somebody or do they become guilty in some way after they have purchased, borrowed or stolen the implements with which they propose to carry out crime?  I believe that two or three people travelling in a car at night with a sawn-off shotgun and assorted ammunition for it and the various other accoutrements required for housebreaking or car thieving have lost their case before they start at all and should not be considered innocent any longer.  Which is better, to apprehend them at that stage or to wait until they actually commit a serious crime and somebody's life is lost?  Are we not better to take the necessary measures to apprehend such people before things get serious?</P>
    <P>My view is not a legal view but a layman's view, the view expressed by many of my constituents.  If one talks to anybody who has been the victim of a crime over the past ten years one will quickly get a clear impression of what those people think about what should be done with people who deal in the tools of this trade.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will go some way towards making life difficult for the big providers for this undesirable growth industry.  I hope it will make the job of the Garda easier.  Other speakers made reference to the fact that the Garda now spend much of their time awaiting the appearance of various accused persons in the courts.  That is true.  It is also true that quite a number of gardaí are involved in administration and clerical duties which keep them from doing much needed work on the streets in the pursuit of criminals. I know there have been difficulties in this area before but the problem is now <Col N="958" /> of such a serious nature that we need to take account of the deployment of our best people so as to have the greatest impact on crime.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that problem at a later stage.  It is not so long since the people sitting over there were over here and what seemed easy in Opposition becomes difficult when in Government.  We have to accept that this is part of adversarial politics, part of democracy.  Nevertheless there is an obvious need for these extra gardaí whose training must be of a higher standard than ever before because they are dealing with a more sophisticated criminal.</P>
    <P>These problems must be addressed during the next few months.  This is the end of October and we are heading towards the festive season.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that adequate policing arrangements are made in this city and in every town and village.  All those engaged in organised crime will be on the road in the run up to Christmas and any person who goes out to a local shop leaves his property at risk.  We must ensure that the forces of law and order have the necessary resources to respond quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>The stealing of cars comes within the ambit of this Bill because there is quite a good business in receiving stolen car parts.  Probably all of us know somebody who has had a car stolen and who was able to identify the shell of that car a few days later, all the movable components having been stripped.  These parts are sold throughout the city and in some parts of the country.  The people involved have a highly organised market for car components and operate through known outlets. If a car is parked unattended for three or four hours after dark it is likely to be stripped of all movable components, which will then be sold.  Nobody ever seems to come upon the perpetrators of these crimes while they are engaged in removing the components.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the gardaí should be at least as well equipped as the criminals in terms of communications technology, etc.  The sophisticated criminals of today do not use the old fashioned <Col N="959" /> tools of the trade.  They have sophisticated telecommunications equipment which they utilise to tip off their colleagues in the event of imminent discovery by the forces of law and order. The equipment they use will have been stolen in the first instance and will have code numbers which will enable it to be identified and removed under the provisions of this Bill.  This will be of great benefit to the Garda.</P>
    <P>I have often read of high speed car chases involving the gardaí and car thieves.  I hope the horse power and the delivery of the Garda cars is at least as good as that of the cars used by the criminals. I know this can be brought to a ridiculous level since criminals may drive around in BMWs or other high-powered cars.  The gardaí do not need the same type of car since it is easy to custom build a car which is capable of speed when necessary.  The criminals have their own workshops where they carry out modifications to their equipment, including cars.  It all comes back to the fact that property is stolen and then modified to provide criminals with the necessary equipment to carry on their trade.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be successful in putting these people out of business.  I would hope at some stage that people who are caught in possession of the tools of the trade I have referred to can be put out of business quickly and that such people do not have access to bail while awaiting trial.  When a person carries a weapon with which it is intended to carry out a felony, a serious offence such as killing or maiming somebody, that person should be charged and remanded in custody awaiting trial.  That would present other problems but we must deal with them.</P>
    <P>We have a much more serious crime problem than most other European countries.  It is quite possible to walk along the main streets in virtually any European city and see shop windows where jewellery and other valuables are clearly displayed at all hours of the day and night.  Nobody ever seems to interfere. We have long since passed the stage <Col N="960" /> where luxury goods could be displayed to the public who could look at them at their leisure.  It is because of the activities of the criminal element that we lost that privilege long ago.  I hope we are moving doen the road towards taking on such people and dealing with them.  It is my hope that law-abiding and hard working citizens will be able to go about their business without fear of interference or intimidation.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this important Bill which, essentially, strengthens the hands of the Garda Síochána in detecting and successfully prosecuting people who have committed the offence of receiving and handling stolen property. The Bill, has, as the Minister said, its origins in the report of the Law Reform Commission of 1987 which stated &ldquo;that the existing law permits receiving of stolen property to escape conviction for unjustifiable reasons&rdquo; and that the law as it stands &ldquo;facilitates crimes of dishonesty over a wide area&rdquo;.  That encapsulates a view held by the Garda Síochána and the public for many years.  The gardaí have complained about the inadequacies of existing legislation to deal with many areas of criminal activity and of their great difficulty in achieving successful prosecutions in our courts of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a commonly held belief that many of our laws favour the criminal as opposed to the law enforcer.  I believe it is vital that the Legislature redresses the balance and I see the Bill as a step in the right direction.  Crime in modern times is at an unacceptable level.  It is our duty to provide the gardaí with a clearly defined and strong legislative back-up to enable <Col N="961" /> them to defeat and reduce the level of crime in society.  People are fed up with criminals escaping conviction on the basis of a technicality in the law or on the interpretation of laws which are either badly drafted or too loosely defined.  In many instances the gardaí are powerless to proceed with cases because of inadequacies in the law.</P>
    <P>The area of crime covered by the Bill is a particularly significant one.  Over £35 million worth of goods is stolen in the country annually.  This field of crime has proved lucrative for many major criminal gangs, and families, who operate openly here.  These criminal godfathers are known to the Garda and, indeed, to many in the community, yet they manage to evade conviction on an ongoing basis. They openly taunt the gardaí on their inability to convict them, mainly because of inadequacies in the law.  Society has been too tolerant in this respect and allowed the forces of crime too free a hand.  This has had a damaging effect on Garda morale and it must be corrected. I am hopeful that the provisions of the Bill will impede the activities of these gangs and reduce their effectiveness.  The Minister has gone on record as stating that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves.  Undoubtedly the Bill will make it more difficult for people who provide thieves with a market to evade conviction.</P>
    <P>The new provisions in the Bill will, in practical terms, mean that the prosecutors will have to show that the accused knew or believed that the property in question was stolen.  At present the prosecution has to show that a person who handled stolen goods had actual knowledge that the property was stolen, a requirement which has presented the prosecuting authorities with serious difficulties. The new provisions will render it easier for the prosecution to prove its case and should result in an increasing number of convictions of those who dishonestly trade in stolen property, whether they do so in a once off transaction or as part of a regular operation.</P>
    <P>The significance of these provisions is that the onus is now very firmly on the <Col N="962" /> individual who receives stolen goods knowing or even thinking that they were stolen, to prove otherwise.  It enables the authorities to attack this area of crime on two fronts, on the actual committing of theft and on the receiving of stolen property.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is also to be especially welcome as it modernises the law on possession of articles for use in larceny or other related crimes.  The new provision will make the possession of any item for use in larceny, burgulary, taking a vehicle without consent, blackmail or obtaining by false pretences, an offence.  The wide scope of this provision is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the provision is wide enough to cover the possession of documents for use in connection with a bogus charity collection.  This is an area of criminal activity which has been on the increase for many years.  Unfortunately, bogus charity collections have had a severe detrimental impact on genuine charities and have made people suspicious and wary of charitable collections in general, a very sad development in a society which prides itself on its generosity. I hope the Bill can in some way help to reduce the instances of bogus charities and, if it does, then a great deal will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Section 9 sets a standard ten years' maximum prison sentence for all types of larceny, and puts the maximum sentence for handling at 14 years.  The higher maximum sentence for handling is consistent with the overall ethos of the Bill, that it is a more serious offence to provide a market for stolen goods, thereby providing an impetus for further larceny.</P>
    <P>Indirectly this legislation may have some impact on the drugs problem.  Many addicts feed their habit by resorting to theft.  If this Bill succeeds in reducing the incidence of theft overall then it may have the knock-on effect of reducing the means available to drug addicts to purchase their supplies.  Such a development would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>In the overall context it must be acknowledged that the Bill represents only a fraction of what must be done <Col N="963" /> to successfully defeat crime here.  Many more measures must be introduced, including major structural reforms in the Garda Síochána.  More adequate and effective legislation must be drafted to render life more difficult for the criminal element in society.  The Minister has a difficult task ahead of him and we in this House must unreservedly support him in his efforts.  Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Ní neart go cur le chéile&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies O'Keeffe, Kavanagh, McCartan, O'Dea, Flanagan, Ahern, Durkan and, in a special way, Deputy Martin who has honoured the House by making this Bill the subject of his maiden speech.  I wish him well as a Member and I have no doubt that from the quality of his contribution he has a long and distinguished parliamentary and Government career ahead of him.  I wish him well, so long as it is not my job that he is after.  The contributions have been most constructive.  Many points were made and, while I think some of them are more appropriate to Committee Stage, I will deal with them generally now.  I envisage that we will have a detailed debate on all issues on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the contributors centred on the decision not to use the recklessness test as proposed by the Law Reform Commission.  The recklessness test proposed is a subjective one which corresponds, broadly speaking, to the test that has been applied by the courts in this country and others in branches of the criminal law in relation to violent crimes.  But there are some difficulties about the concept of recklessness and its exact scope is somewhat uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission were, moreover, unable to provide any example of this concept in use in the law on receiving/handling stolen goods in any country &mdash; though they do cite a recommendation as to its use, as a basis of criminal liability generally, which was put forward by the Criminal Law and Penal Methods Reform Committee of South <Col N="964" /> Australia in a report entitled <i>The Substantive Criminal Law</i> published in 1977.</P>
    <P>It is felt that, in the context of handling/receiving cases, the recklessness test suggested by the commission would prove cumbersome and confusing to juries.  It is important to note that it is not favoured by the DPP whose office would have to apply this provision in practice.  The mental ingredient in the offence of handling is central to the offence, given that the action on which the offence is based, which takes the form usually of one person buying conventional consumer goods from another, is, in itself, an everyday, unexceptionable activity.</P>
    <P>We think that the level of calculation and culpability implicit in the concept and definition put forward by the commission would, if applied as a test of guilt in handling cases, have a very limited effect in terms of securing the conviction of handlers who, while not knowing for certain that the property they are acquiring is stolen, have a strong suspicion or level of belief that it is indeed stolen.  Effectively, the recklessness test would in practice serve as a very narrow extension of the mental element as defined by the Larceny Act, 1916, which, it is generally conceded, places too high a burden on the prosecution to prove that the accused knew that the property he handled was stolen.  The act of calculated recklessness described by the Law Reform Commission in the definition they propose undoubtedly takes place often on the part of handlers of stolen goods.  It would be a very different thing to prove this in court, however.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the <i>mens rea</i> used in the English Theft Act, 1968, of knowing or believing that the property was stolen would be easier to apply to alleged breaches of the law in this area, particularly when modified so that belief is defined for the purposes of the offence &mdash; and in order to catch persons who strongly suspect the property was stolen &mdash; as including thinking that the property probably was stolen.  I must point out that the test as proposed in the Bill draws also <Col N="965" /> on a recommendation in the commission's earlier consultation paper on this subject which was strongly favoured.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe as well as Deputies McCartan and O'Dea raised the question of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission regarding the ordering by a court of payment of compensation by the offender to the victim, and regarding the use of business and administration records in evidence in criminal trials.  I can assure the Deputies that both of these matters are under consideration in my Department, and I hope to be in a position in the reasonably near future to put proposals to the Government which would deal with the evidential matter as regards all criminal trials and not just in relation to handling offences.  It is important to bear in mind that both matters mentioned by the Deputy have application to the criminal law generally, and go well beyond the confines of this Bill.  It is in that broader context that I am considering the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy McCartan criticised the provision at section 5 of the Bill which deals with the use, in handling trials, of evidence of previous possession and previous convictions.  I recognise that the provision is open to criticism, and I look forward to hearing those criticisms in detail on Committee Stage.  I can assure Deputies that I will listen carefully to arguments against the provision, what I ask in return is that they listen equally carefully to the points I will make in its favour.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the force of the views expressed against the provision, but I believe there is a case to be argued in its favour.  If at the close of Committee Stage I can be persuaded to a different point of view I will be prepared to look at the provisions as laid out in section 5.  I can assure Deputy Kavanagh that the provision in the Bill dealing with the Post Office Act, 1968 was fully discussed with An Post.  The provision at section 10 in the Bill is a purely consequential one and, in fact, reduces the maximum penalty from life imprisonment to 14 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and Deputy Flanagan ask &mdash; why not replace the Larceny <Col N="966" /> Act completely instead of amending it piecemeal?  I accept the need for a more thorough-going look at the Larceny Act. As referred to by Deputy O'Dea, the Law Reform Commission are in fact looking at the whole area of dishonesty and will be making further reports on the matter.  They saw receiving of stolen property as an area requiring priority attention and dealt with it separately. When their further reports are received they will be dealt with and should enable us to take a useful step towards ultimate codification of the criminal law, by perhaps codifying in one Statute the law relating to theft etc.  However because of the complexity of the matter which is compounded by the fact that the main provision is now over 70 years old, this process will be complex and protracted. The Government agree with the Commission that receiving should be tackled now.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned a possible case where the original acquisition of stolen property was innocent, but on subsequently finding out that the property was stolen the receiver decides to hold on to the goods.  In such a case, because the holder undertakes the retention of the property knowing it to be stolen, he is guilty of handling.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made about the rationalisation of penalties, I would just like to say that law abiding citizens look to the courts to respond on their behalf when criminals who prey on the community are brought to book.  It is vital to society's sense of justice that the Legislature should enable the courts to appropriately respond when greedy and rapacious criminals are convicted.  The maximum sentences proposed for the offences of larceny and handling are intended of course to provide for the worst possible instances of these offences.  It will be for the courts to decide in every case whether mitigating circumstances affecting the defendant should apply when sentence is being passed.</P>
    <P>I am sure many members of this House will have come in contact with members <Col N="967" /> of the public, perhaps old people of slender means, who have been the victims of heartless robbery.  A valuable personal memento or a radio or television set which is that person's lifeline to the outside world has been stolen, perhaps even stolen to order at the behest of a cynical dealer in stolen property.  It is of real consequence of the peace of mind of such victims of crime that every effort be made by the law enforcement authorities to bring the criminal to justice and, in those instances where such efforts are successful that a sentence is passed on the miscreant which reflects the outrage of the community at large at the offence in question.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what has been suggested I do not prescribe to the view that crimes against property are victimless crimes. Too often the victim of a robbery is the forgotten element in the discussion of crime and punishment.  The sense of injury of such individuals is sadly all too rarely considered.  However, on those occasions, and I mean the minority of cases, where a theft investigation actually results in the recovery of the property stolen and conviction of the thief or handler of the item in question it must be a real consolation to all victims of crime that a criminal who acted against another victim has been apprehended and punished appropriately for his misdeed.</P>
    <P>I am personally convinced that the public good requires the maintenance of severe penalties against dealers in stolen property.  I am also satisfied that the power to fine persons convicted of theft or handling stolen property, which is proposed in this Bill, is a useful one for the courts to have, particularly when a well-heeled professional criminal elite are committing such offences.</P>
    <P>And make no mistake about it: the professional criminal exists in our society. He is becoming more proficient at his business and more ingenious at avoiding apprehension.  The law must respond to this situation in the most effective possible manner.  That is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>A number of detailed items were raised <Col N="968" /> by Deputies and I assure them a careful note has been taken of all the points raised.  For example, one item raised by Deputy Kavanagh concerned the response to a 999 call.  He said it took an hour and a half to respond and the delay occurred because six other 999 calls had to be dealt with.  Since Deputy Kavanagh made this point this morning we have asked the Garda authorities for details of the alleged incident.  They were unable to confirm any such details in the time available and on the limited information available.  However, I ask Deputy Kavanagh to let me have the precise details of the incident in question and I undertake here in the House to make inquiries about it and communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Regarding the effectiveness of the 999 system, a new command and control system has been introduced since 1 January in the DMA which will result in a faster response time by the Garda to calls by members of the public requiring assistance. It will enable the precise location of the incident in question and of the nearest available Garda unit to be pinpointed immediately and will make the system much more efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank Deputies for their contributions and for the obvious care they took in their preparation. Deputies expressed their feelings on this whole area of larceny and theft and on the need for reform.  I can assure them I will be quite hopeful and positive in the approach I will take on Committee Stage. I look forward to a very constructive Committee Stage at an early date.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Coolock (Dublin) Law Centre Funding.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this urgent matter, <Col N="970" /> urgent because the position &mdash; as the Minister for Social Welfare is aware &mdash; is that Coolock Community Law Centre is facing financial extinction in mid-November. The last instalment paid to them in October will have been used up completely and the law centre will have no option but to close.  The Minister, being in the same constituency in which the centre is located, will be aware that the centre for some weeks now has been obliged to take on no new work or to make any new commitment to the people of the area because of the uncertainty of their future.  This is a crucially important point for the law centre.</P>
      <P>Since it was founded in 1975 it has been subjected to the most irregular, disparate and difficult treatment regarding funding. Responsibility for funding has been moved to various agencies and sources and they have wrung a financial commitment from Government time and again simply by reason of agitation, demonstration and by raising a public outcry. Frankly, that is not the way Coolock Community Law Centre should be treated.  On the last occasion on which they got a commitment from the Department of Social Welfare they were informed that the Minister would commission a report of evaluation, depending on the outcome of the report, a definite decision regarding future funding would be made.  That report, commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency, the author of which is Brian Dillon, has been with the Minister and his officials for a number of months.  It praises the law centre and its functions.  I will quote from its conclusions &mdash; time does not allow for any longer extracts from the report &mdash; as follows:</P>
      <P>The Irish Civil Legal Aid Scheme was introduced in 1980 ten years after the Pringle Committee had argued for a comprehensive scheme of Civil Legal Aid.  The scheme fell far short of what the Pringle Report had proposed and even further short of the urgent needs identified by those working in the area in a voluntary capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> Specifically in relation to the Coolock Law Centre the report states:</P>
    <P>The Coolock Law Centre has attempted to address the problems associated with equality under the law in the community.  As such it is unique and this in itself throws up problems for evaluation....</P>
    <P>The very high level of demand and activity over a period of 12 years is in some ways a measure of need for the service.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt Coolock Law Centre is needed.  It is unique and it provides a crucial service to the Dublin north-east area in general.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the commitment given to the Coolock Law Centre and the people in the area following on that evaluation report must be stood by and a decision made at Government level to establish the Coolock Law Centre on a permanent ongoing funded basis.  It must now be recognised as indispensable and everything must be done by the Minister and the Government to ensure that the centre gets a budget on which it can rely, on a yearly basis, without having to resort to this kind of activity, without mobilising the community to agitate, without going to public representatives to raise the issue in the Dáil and without troubling the Minister in his office on a yearly basis to say: &ldquo;We are facing bankruptcy yet again; can you help us out?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sum of £118,000 on a yearly basis represents very good value for money.  It will allow them to employ, in the first instance, one extra solicitor.  When last I raised this matter with the Minister in the House &mdash; again on the Adjournment debate and in circumstances similar to what we have today &mdash; on 10 February 1988, I indicated then the urgent need for the appointment of a new solicitor but funding was not forthcoming to allow for that.  I am now saying that any budgetary commitment which must be made must be such as to allow for the recruitment of such an officer.</P>
    <P>It was drawn to my attention recently, at a meeting with the staff in the Coolock <Col N="972" /> Law Centre, that the one solicitor who operates there, works on a schedule which I do not believe is equalled by any practitioner in private practice in terms of work or case load undertaken.  It was indicated that she spends nine out of ten days in court on her feet working.  She dealt with 72 cases in court during a period of six weeks.  On one day in that period she was obliged to deal with five cases running simultaneously in three different courts.  An average of eight to ten new cases a week can be expected to be taken on when the centre is operating at full capacity.  That level of activity simply cannot be sustained for much longer.</P>
    <P>The centre and the people in the area and all of us who refer &mdash; as the Minister does &mdash; people to the centre for help must have the highest regard for the officers, Roisín Connolly, Dave Ellis and Elizabeth Egan.  They do a colossal job but must be assisted.  First, they must now get a firm commitment from the Government that they will be funded on a permanent basis for the future and that it will be part of the budget of a departmental Estimate in this House.  Secondly, the budget modest as it is, must be of a minimum to allow for the expansion of staff to carry, in the small way it is asked, the huge workload of the centre.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, to hop around on this matter.  I know he has a concern for the law centre.  At a recent meeting it was indicated &mdash; and it took me by surprise &mdash; that the Combat Poverty Agency in a covering letter to the report recommended something that was not in the report: that is, that the Department of Justice should be the Department to carry responsibility for the centre.  I have no concern one way or the other: be it the Department of Social Welfare, because it is a community-based facility, or the Department of Justice, because it is providing a legal service.  A decision must be made today, or very shortly, as to which Department take responsibility.  I know the Minister says that the letter from the Combat Poverty Agency suggested the Department of Justice and, on another <Col N="973" /> occasion, suggested the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Welfare combined because of the dual function of the law centre as a community-based unit.  Now, I understand that a preference might be directed more towards the Department of Justice.  If that is the view why would the Minister for Justice not hear me this evening?  If not, I urge the Minister for Social Welfare to make urgent representations, and perhaps secure a meeting with the Minister for Justice at an early date, for Coolock Community Law Centre so that the central issue is determined as to who will take responsibility in their Estimate to fund on a permanent basis the Coolock Community Law Centre, which is an indispensable crucial service provided for the people of Dublin north-east.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make clear at the outset that Coolock Community Law Centre is not in danger of closure as this motion would suggest.  The centre has depended on Exchequer support of one sort or another for the past 15 years and there is no question of this support being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I am very well aware of the valuable work being done by the centre and have personal knowledge of its work on behalf of its clients.  In many ways the centre is unique.  It is the only community law centre in existence in the country and was established long before the civil legal aid scheme was introduced in 1981.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the centre has been funded on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Since its establishment in 1975, the centre has been funded variously by the Department of Justice, the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, my own Department and more recently, through the Combat Poverty Agency.  Since 1983 my Department have been the sole funding agency of the centre.  During the years 1984 to 1986 inclusive, the centre received grants amounting to £103,000 by way of the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from my concern about the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the centre's funding, I <Col N="974" /> arranged in 1987 for the Combat Poverty Agency to fund the centre for a three-year period to the end of 1989.  This funding amounted to £60,000 per annum.  This was the first occasion on which the centre had secure funding for a prolonged period.  In addition, following discussions which I had with representatives of the centre late last year, I arranged for a further grant of £10,000 from the Combat Poverty Agency to clear the centre's long-standing overdraft.</P>
    <P>Since 1986 alone, therefore, the centre has received grants amounting to almost £300,000.  This clearly demonstrates the considerable level of support which the centre has enjoyed since its establishment, particularly from my Department. My purpose in arranging to have the Combat Poverty Agency fund the centre for a three-year period was to enable an ongoing evaluation of the centre's activities to be carried out with a view to determining how the centre should be funded in the future.  This review which was carried out by the agency highlights the valuable work being done by the centre.</P>
    <P>The total population of the centre's catchment area is 60,000 and the bulk of its caseload of around 1,600 cases per year comes from residents of local authority housing estates.  A profile of the centre's clients indicates that they come from low income backgrounds and that the majority are women.  Over a third of its cases relate to family law issues.  These include requests for help in securing legal separations, general requests for advice on family law and clients seeking to obtain barring orders.  Other significant areas of the centre's case work include consumer rights, social welfare matters, employment-related problems, indebtedness and housing.</P>
    <P>The agency's review of the law centre's activities concludes that the centre provides valuable and worthwhile legal and other services at low cost and that it fulfils a very important role within the community.</P>
    <P>I am very well aware of the concerns of the law centre in relation to future funding.  In fact, just over a week ago I <Col N="975" /> met representatives of the centre to discuss the question of funding.  As I have said, prior to 1986 the centre was funded very much on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  This was obviously an unsatisfactory arrangement since it created a degree of uncertainty for the centre about its future.  This situation improved in 1987, however, following on the arrangements which I made at that time with the Combat Poverty Agency to fund the centre until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>During the course of my recent discussions with representatives of the centre, it emerged that there are two aspects to its funding problem.  First, there will be a shortfall in funding in the current year and the centre will require a further grant of around £6,000 in addition to the £60,000 already made available this year.  Secondly, the issue of the long term funding of the centre needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have already discussed the more immediate problem with the Combat Poverty Agency and I know that proposals for a further grant to the centre for the balance of this year will be dealt with at the next meeting of the board which will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>The issue of future funding of the <Col N="976" /> centre is currently being examined within my Department.  This examination will take full account of the evaluation report on the centre's activities and of the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency in relation to funding.  I am anxious that the matter be dealt with as quickly as possible and I intend to bring forward proposals shortly for consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the very valuable work being done by the centre.  I know that the local community is involved in this work and this is reflected in the high level of participation by local groups in the centre's management committee.  I expect to be in a position to announce a decision shortly concerning the future funding of the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal of the EC Commission to allocate each member state an additional 1 per cent in quotas, which would be made available to priority category producers, was again discussed by the Council of Agricultural Ministers at its meeting on 23-24 October 1989. However agreement was not reached at that meeting.  I would hope that a decision in the matter might be taken at the Council's next meeting in November.</P>
      <P>I have welcomed the Commission's proposal to grant the additional quotas because I pressed for such an initiative during the price negotiations last spring. However, along with some other EC Ministers I have difficulties with the compensation element of the proposal.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion that the additional quota should be allocated on a co-operative or dairy basis.  I am also aware of the suggestion that 50 per cent of the quota should be reserved for new entrants.  However I will not be making any decisions on the distribution of any additional quota until the Council's deliberations are concluded.  I can, however, say that my main concern will be to give priority to certain categories of smaller scale producers and new entrants.</P>

      <P>When the special EC western scheme was introduced in July 1988 it was necessary to increase the grant <Col N="865" /> rates under the farm improvement programme in the disadvantaged areas to comply with a condition in the EC regulation. The western measure has now been replaced by the EC scheme for the control of farmyard pollution which provides the higher rates of grant for antipollution investment on a countrywide basis.  Accordingly the grant rates under the farm improvement programme have been restored to what they were in July 1988.</P>

      <P>EC institutional prices for farm products are fixed in the context of the annual EC price decisions.  These prices apply throughout the Community and are not differentiated on the basis of farm income.  Farm income differences are, however, widely taken into account in the framing and application of Community structural measures for agriculture which provide a more appropriate framework for such differentiation.</P>

A replacement from the appropriate redeployment panel became available on 11 October.  That officer is now working on the FDS schemes and should make a considerable impact on any backlog of grant approvals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 53, and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the present level of cattle prices which are well below the very high levels which applied last year. Compared to earlier years however, this year's prices are higher than those which applied in every other year since 1985. Nevertheless they indicate that producer margins will be very tight especially given the relatively high store prices paid earlier this year.  The role of my Department in relation to cattle prices is to ensure that the market supports available under the EC beef regime are applied for the optimum benefit of the Irish beef industry. In this context I got the EC Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers to agree last January that special recognition must be given to the importance of the beef industry in our economy.  I have pressed the special Irish case at every opportunity.  I succeeded in getting agreement to carcase intervention last March to overcome serious difficulties at that time.  In September we got agreement to the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme despite strong opposition from other member states.  In more recent weeks I have been pressing our case for the need to purchase substantial quantities of beef into intervention. At this week's Council in Luxembourg, where I raised the issue, the Commission recognised that there is a need to implement the Declaration made at the January 1989 Council when tenders from Ireland are being considered.  There had already been some success already on this front &mdash; at the most recent tenders Ireland got nearly 8,000 tonnes accepted. I would hope that quantities bought in at future tenders during the peak period will be even higher and that the positive signs <Col N="878" /> evident in prices this week will continue. My Department has no direct involvement in relation to the prices paid by factories for cattle.  That matter is between individual factories and farmers.</P>
    <P>As regards the question regarding the benefits of the APS scheme permeating down to farmers the position is that this scheme is intended to allow factories to purchase beef at the time of peak production and to store it until a more opportune time for marketing it arises.  This is of obvious benefit to farmers at this time of the year.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the director of ERAD that there were 10,596 herd restrictions due to bovine TB and 380 herd restrictions due to brucellosis in 1988.  In the course of 1989 to date there have been 10,653 herd restrictions for TB and 351 for brucellosis.</P>
      <P>At present there are 8,388 herds restricted with TB and 240 herds with brucellosis of which 14 are considered to harbour active infection.</P>

    <P>(i)  Includes the effects of the tax amnesty in 1988.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1984 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1984-85.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has <Col N="882" /> been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1984 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1984-85, irrespective of whether the assessed tax was actually payable.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The reduction in the average tax payments made by farmers over the years in question is mainly due to the introduction of additional numbers of farmers to tax records since 1983-84 consequent on the abolition of the rateable valuation threshold.  It follows that the new cases, in general, had much smaller holdings and consequently had, on average, lower taxable incomes.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished.  Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax from other self-employed tax units in each calendar year by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some of the increases in the average tax payments made by other self-employed in 1987 and 1988 are due to the introduction of the withholding tax on professional fees in 1987 and the combined effects of the tax amnesty and the introduction of the self-assessment system in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Columns (a), (b) and (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ <Col N="883" /> from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangement are not included in the calculations. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referrable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

      <P>The person indicated is one of those producers whose milk deliveries in 1983, i.e., the reference year for the quota system, were adversely affected by animal disease.  The Community regulations for the setting up of a national reserve to cover this type of situation, allow additional quotas to be allocated to such producers by the substitution of deliveries made in 1981 or 1982 (whichever is the higher) for their 1983 deliveries. However, this producer's 1983 deliveries were higher than in 1981 or 1982 so my Department could not allocate any additional quota to him out of the reserve which was set up for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties the quota system has caused for producers who had animal disease in their herds.  I have sought to assist them within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations. <Col N="885" /> I have, for instance, provided that the priority categories of farmers to be covered in the arrangements for the restructuring scheme, the temporary leasing scheme and the distribution of flexi-milk, include such producers.  It was also as a result of a request made by me at the price fixing negotiations last spring that the EC Commission brought forward its proposal for the allocation of an additional 1 per cent of quotas to special priority producers.  These proposals are presently being considered by the Council of Agricultural Ministers.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned were awarded pension from 19 January 1983 at a rate appropriate to weekly means of £19.81 per week.  Means are assessed on the basis of investments.</P>
      <P>At the request of the pensioners who contended that they had disposed of certain capital, means were reassessed in July 1989.  Following reinvestigation revised means of £20.43 per week were assessed.  A satisfactory explanation has not been provided as to why the capital was disposed of.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of water quality is primarily a matter for the local authority.  However, because of public concern about the environmental implications of Cork harbour's special position as an industrial base, my Department requested the Environmental Research Unit earlier this year to prepare a position report on water quality there.  The report will be based on existing information as generated by local authorities, university surveys, AFF/ERU surveys, etc.  It will summarise the available information, assess its significance in relation to water quality and identify any gaps in the information base which need to be filled.  This report should be completed before the end of the year and the scope and extent of monitoring in the harbour area will then be reviewed in the light of the report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the East Ferry area, a detailed monitoring programme is being carried out by the ERU, Cork County Council and the Department of the Marine to determine whether significant changes occur in water quality as a result of discharges, from the recently-commissioned Midleton sewerage scheme, at Rathcoursey Point.</P>

      <P>The administration of the scheme of financial assistance made under section 45 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, in respect of the Ballyfermot special control area is a matter for Dublin Corporation. I understand from the corporation that no grants have been approved in respect of the installation of the full burning fire in the area.  It is a condition of the grants scheme that works shall not commence until applications have been approved. Accordingly, the question of payment does not arise.</P>

      <P>Bond Bridge is located on a regional road and primary responsibility for improvements to the network of nonnational roads (including regional roads) rests with the local authorities, the cost being normally funded from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by the Department for such roads.</P>
      <P>The local authority's consultants have prepared preliminary design and cost estimates for a scheme involving improvements to Bond Bridge and the nearby railway bridge, and the improvement of the immediate approach roads. The estimated cost is £624,000.  The authority have requested special road grant assistance for the scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of special road grant funding to meet an appropriate share of any costs arising on the scheme in 1990 will be considered when the road grant allocations for next year are being determined. In the meantime, the Department will contact the local authority on the question of the level and phasing of funding that would be available from local resources towards the cost.</P>

      <P>The canal and railway bridges at Sallins are located on the Clane-Naas Road, which is a regional road.</P>
      <P>Improvements involving the widening of the canal bridge were completed in April 1988, with the assistance of special road grants provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The local authority have also applied for special road grant assistance for the improvement of the bridge spanning the railway line at Sallins.  The scheme proposed by the authority would involve the replacement of the existing bridge by a bridge on a new alignment and the improvement of the immediate approach roads.  The design of the proposed scheme is at present being considered at engineering level by the Department, the local authority and Iarnrod Éireann.</P>
      <P>A special road grant contribution of £100,000 towards preliminary costs on the Sallins railway bridge scheme has been allocated for 1989.  Subject to the outcome of the current discussions in relation to the design, the question of special road grant funding to meet an appropriate share of any cost arising in 1990 will be considered when the road grant allocations for next year are being determined.  At this stage, it is not possible to give an indication of the likely timing of the construction of the scheme.</P>

      <P>In 1979 a double unit prefabricated classroom was provided at Rathfarnham Parish National School, Dublin 16 with grant-aid from my Department and the necessary technical advice in this regard was provided by the Office of Public Works in accordance with the Rules for National Schools.  In 1987 the school authorities submitted an engineer's report which indicated that there were defects in the structure.  The Department's professional staff examined the matter and recommended that certain improvement works be carried out generally in line with the school's <Col N="932" /> engineer's recommendation.  The Department indicated to the school authorities that a grant would be sanctioned towards the cost of the works.  Under the Rules for National Schools a local contribution is required in relation to any works eligible for grant.  This grant offer was not acceptable to the school authorities.</P>
      <P>I have recently approved the provision of a permanent extension to the school and I have written to the school authorities in the matter.  My Department will contact the school's consultants at an early date to discuss the further arrangements for the project.</P>

      <P>As an interim measure, it was decided that, where schools so wish, pupils entering the senior cycle in 1989-90 may take the intermediate certificate syllabus in French, German, Spanish or Italian as part of their approved senior cycle course.  Pupils doing so will be allowed sit the Intermediate certificate examination paper in the language studied at the time of sitting their leaving certificate examination and will be credited with the appropriate intermediate certificate grade.

Much of the material in the report is compiled from <Col N="940" /> the annual statistical return which is completed by the various schools and colleges throughout the country.  Given the amount of work involved in the editing and processing of statistical returns from over 4,000 primary post-primary and third-level schools and colleges, a process complicated by the late return of data from a number of institutions, and the late response to queries from my Department in respect of incorrect statistical returns, it is not possible to publish the annual statistical report within the time-frame specified by the Act.  I should also point out that a period of at least six months has been required for the typesetting, proof-reading and actual printing of each report.

        <i>The Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987</i> was published in 1984 by a previous administration. During the term of office of that administration a preliminary review of the extent and distribution of school vacation in pursuance of paragraph 2.22 of that Programme was carried out.  That review indicated that the scope for change in school vacation was limited, that marginal savings if any that might be achieved by changes would be more than offset by problems relating to scheduling of public examinations and of school transport services, effects on households where both parents were in paid employment, the influence on tourism and on the utilisation of Irish Summer Colleges and the <Col N="945" /> availability of seasonal work for young people in Agriculture and in Tourism related enterprises.  No further action was taken by that administration in respect of its proposal.
