      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the serious delays which are taking place within An Bord Pleanála because of the increase in the number of appeals; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to ensure that avoidable delays and other bureaucratic constraints can be removed in order to facilitate the speedy and effective processing of planning appeals, the resolution of which would result in productive development and consequential employment within the construction industry and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 135 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are Priority Questions and co-operation is required to dispose of them within the time limit laid down in Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concious of the need to ensure that there are no avoidable delays in the processing of appeals. My Department monitors the performance of An Bord Pleanála on an ongoing basis in relation to the number <Col N="1400" /> of appeals received, appeals disposed of and the time taken to process appeals.</P>
      <P>In response to a request from me, the board undertook a review of procedures in mid-1988 and have indicated to me that they have tightened up their procedures in relation to time limits imposed on the various parties to an appeal to submit grounds for appeal and other documentation.  Other steps taken include time effective measures on appeals against conditions in accordance with section 19 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, and against vexatious appeals.  Time targets set at my request by the board in 1988 to reduce a backlog from 1987 have been met.  In this regard comparison between the figures for 1987 and 1988 are significant.  The overall volume of appeals received in 1988 at 2,257 was somewhat less than the 1987 figure of 2,439, while at the same time the actual number of appeals disposed of by the board in 1988 was higher at 2,369 than the 1987 figure of 2,237.</P>
      <P>I am having a general review of all planning regulations carried out by my Department and I will, upon making consolidated regulations later this year, take the opportunity to further streamline procedures to further improve the operation of the planning system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps he has taken at European level to obtain agreement to this State obtaining additional representation in the European Parliament having regard to population changes which have occurred in the State; and the steps he intends taking pursuant to section 12 (2) of the European Assembly <Col N="1401" /> Elections Act, 1977 to provide for the revision of the European constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of electors and the number of seats in the Munster Euro-constituency and in the Dublin Euro-constituency; when it is intended to redress the imbalance in seats; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>134.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to revise the constituencies for the European Elections in pursuance of section 12 (2) of the European Assembly Election Act, 1977; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 41 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The number of representatives to be elected by each member state to the European Parliament is not determined solely on the basis of population.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, to seek a revision of the allocation of seats as between member states purely on the grounds of normal population changes.</P>
      <P>The constituencies for which members will be elected to the European Parliament and the number of members to be elected for each constituency at the forthcoming elections are set out in the Second Schedule to the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977.  Proposals for the revision of constituencies in accordance with section 12 (2) of that Act will be brought forward in due course.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by the registration authorities there are 703,915 electors in the constituency of Munster, which has five seats.  The number of electors in the Dublin constituency is 713,185.  That constituency has four seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that he is aware of the fact that when we were designated as having 15 seats in the European Assembly that was as a result of the returns of the 1971 Census which showed this State to have a population of just under 3 million?  Would the <Col N="1402" /> Minister now accept that, as a result of the 1986 Census returning a population in excess of 3.5 million, it would be appropriate to see, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, a review of this country's representation to the European Parliament? Would the Minister not agree that, as a result of the population increases, we are now under-represented and that this State should be entitled to 18 seats in the European Parliament as opposed to 15?  Finally, would the Minister not accept that, in the context of the single European market and 1992 approaching, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that at the next European election this country has the full representation at the European parliament to which it is entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that representation by the Deputy.  There is nothing in the European Treaties of Instruments governing direct elections to the European Parliament which requires equality of representation between constituencies. In fact, on average, each Member represents throughout the whole Community, approximately 625,000 people.  If we were to go strictly in accordance with population figures that would give us about five or six Members instead of the 15 we now hold. Therefore it will be seen that ourselves and one other country are being treated rather generously.  The Deputy quite correctly made the point that the matter has to be reviewed in so far as the revision of constituencies is concerned before 9 December 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that we should seek the maximum possible representation of this country in Europe?  Is the Minister now saying that he does not intend to seek that representation or raise that issue and can he indicate what mechanism he intends to put in place with regard to the revision of European constituencies?  Is the Minister aware that he has to submit to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the constituencies no later than December 1989?  Would the Minister indicate to <Col N="1403" /> the House whether he will establish a constituency commission with terms of reference agreed by all parties in this House to review and revise the European constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At least once in every 12 years the Minister for the Environment has to submit to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the European constituencies. That will take place before 9 December 1989.  I do not accept that we are in any way under-represented in so far as the number of seats is concerned.  In fact, with the sole exception of Luxembourg, we have been treated substantially more generously than any of the other member states.  As I have said, were we to apply the population criterion only we would be entitled to five or six seats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on the census of population taken in April, 1986 disclosed a considerable departure from the national average number of persons per Deputy in the case of certain Dáil constituencies. When the detailed census figures became available, the Government considered it appropriate to set about a revision and, to this end, set up an independent constituency commission under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The commission reported on 28 October. The commission's report was published and circulated to Deputies with a view to giving the parties in the House, interested persons outside the House and the general public an opportunity of considering the report.</P>
      <P>Since publication, it has become apparent that the Opposition parties and groups are opposed, in one degree or another, to the recommendations made by the commission.</P>
      <P>The implications of the position now arising are being studied and the options available are being reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the difficulties in this area were created of his own volition by distorting the terms of reference he gave the constituency commission.  Would the Minister now agree to politically defuse this matter by referring back to the Constituency Commission the issue of a revision of constituencies on the basis of terms of reference agreed by all Members in this House, which terms of reference form part of the motion on the agenda of this House as tabled by the Fine Gael Party?  Indeed in the interests of democracy would the Minister now accept the terms of that motion and let the Constituency Commission get on with the job on real, as opposed to artificial, terms of reference?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many apartments in multi-storey buildings have become unsaleable as vendors are finding it impossible to obtain certificates under the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act, 1988; and the action he is taking to resolve this difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to disquiet in the construction industry and its related legal services regarding the inoperability of the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act, 1988; the steps which have been taken by his Department since 1 January <Col N="1410" /> 1989 to conclude discussions with the relevant professional bodies in order to provide for an agreed form of certification which will enable the provisions of the Act to be complied with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 48 together.  The question of the inoperability of the Act does not arise.  Local authorities are at present issuing notices under the Act to owners of multi-storey buildings and the owners have 12 months from the date of service in which to submit the required certificates of appraisal of the buildings to the local authority.</P>
      <P>It is understood that some engineers do not wish to sign certain of the certificates for which provision has been made in the Act but will sign others of the certificates.  There is no indication that engineers generally are unwilling to sign certificates and, accordingly, I am not aware that vendors of apartments are finding it impossible to obtain such certificates.  In fact, some certificates have already been lodged.</P>
      <P>Officers of my Department have had a number of discussions with the Institution of Engineers of Ireland about aspects of the implementation of the Act.  Any further initiatives in this respect would rest with the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland have advised their members that the form of wording required in the certificates under the Act is such that in conscience an engineer cannot be reasonably expected to complete such certificates?  Is the Minister not aware that in some cases the Act has created a problem in that it seems to require a building designed, for example, in 1960 to conform to building standards that did not become operative until 1978? Can the Minister indicate to the House whether his officials or himself have had any meetings with the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland and what <Col N="1411" /> steps are being taken to resolve the difficulties they see in implementing this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points about that.  The Institution of Engineers of Ireland is the statutory engineering authority to which competent persons, as defined in the Act, must belong and they have not advised their members one way or the other in the matter.  Of course, as the Deputy is aware, the consulting engineers of Ireland were opposed to the whole business from the beginning.  At the last meeting we had with them the engineers indicated that they would attempt a revised draft of the certificate which would meet their concerns.  Their response is awaited.</P>
      <P>There are engineers who are prepared to sign the certificate.  There has been no indication as yet to the Department that there is any particular case where it has been impossible to get a certificate.  I have had some discussions with both the institution and the consulting engineers and I have a feeling that there will be another meeting with the latter in the near future.  I would like to see the matter finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Act of Parliament is working.  There is some difficulty with some engineers about it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18 and 40 together.  The postponment of the 1990 local elections has not been considered.  On the question of local government reform I am committed to an overhaul of the existing local government system so as to make it more efficient, cost effective and relevant to the needs of local communities.  This requires a package of measures devised and implemented on a comprehensive and integrated basis so as to secure a renewed local government system capable of facing into the demands and challenges of the last decade of the 20th century.  This will require a major legislative programme.  Work in my Department on the finalisation of a <Col N="1413" /> comprehensive programme for the overall reform of local government, including local authority structures, functions, powers, finance and legislative reform, is now well advanced and details will be announced as soon as possible.  The question of changes in the local government system in County Dublin, taking account of the special needs of the Dublin region, is a matter which falls to be considered in this overall context and the structures proposed by the previous Government are being examined in that light.</P>

      <P>A lot of work has gone into it and the Deputy will be aware of the enormous number of reports, commissioned reports and everything else which have built up in the Department over the years &mdash; I am sure the Deputy will remember that from his own time there.  A considerable amount of work has been done.  Exhaustive studies have been carried out in all kinds of areas concerned with structures, functions, procedures, devolution of powers, law reform and the question of finance, especially with regard to Dublin.  I cannot say today when it might be possible to introduce it, but we have been under considerable pressure in the legislative area.  At present we have five Bills before the House and we would like to clear them as soon as possible to get on with other necessary work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>May I remind the Minister that two years ago he announced he was giving urgent attention to the reform <Col N="1414" /> of local government and little has happened since?  Is it his intention to simply publish a Bill during 1989 to introduce a reformed local government system, or is it his intention to publish a further White Paper or Green Paper containing an insight into his thinking regarding what reforms are required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not contemplated a White Paper in this regard.

      <P>There is an Electoral Bill before the Seanad and the House at present which I understand, is being disposed of.  All that priority legislative work accounted for some of the slippage in dealing with this matter.

In particular, would he indicate whether he would support the idea in principle of Dublin being reorganised into three areas of local administration?  Would he agree that there is an urgent need particularly for that major conurbation to be rationalised more effectively than with the current structures?</P>

Of course, there were some very useful suggestions in their attitude towards reform.  It is a pity they did not finalise the matter because I am back trying to redo the whole thing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether any survey has been carried out to ascertain the extent of the use of asbestos in both public and private sector housing; whether any recommendations or instructions have been issued to local authorities in respect of same; whether consideration has been given to the danger posed by asbestos in household dwellings; the instructions which are given by his Department in this regard; and the regulations, if any, which have been issued with regard to the disposal of asbestos in domestic accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>An annual survey of the physical features of new private housing in Ireland is undertaken by the environmental research unit of my Department. As part of such surveys the extent of the use of asbestos cement roof tiles is measured and these details are available from the environmental research unit on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hazards associated with asbestos &mdash; arising from inhalation of asbestos fibres &mdash; have received wide publicity in recent years and have been extensively dealt with in construction industry trade and technical journals.  Accordingly, all involved in the construction industry would be expected to be aware of the need for care in handling asbestos, or asbestos-based materials.  The most common usage of asbestos in construction is in the form of asbestos cement.  Its use in this form is permissible under the proposed building regulations <Col N="1416" /> and is not considered to present a danger to the house occupants.</P>
    <P>Asbestos waste is a toxic and dangerous waste for the purposes of the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, and the larger local authorities &mdash; county councils and county borough corporations &mdash; are responsible for all aspects of the planning, organisation and oversight of the disposal of any such waste within their functional areas.  A number of hazardous wastes including asbestos are suitable for disposal by controlled landfilling.  This is the internationally accepted disposal method for asbestos.  Local authorities have been urged, in making waste disposal arrangements for their areas, to make provision for landfill disposal of any asbestos waste arising in their areas, including quantities arising from disused building materials.</P>
    <P>The main disposal requirements for asbestos waste are bagging in double-walling plastic sacks and deposit at least two metres from the surface or sides of the tiphead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the general public are aware of the use to which asbestos has been put, in particular in houses built prior to the eighties?  Does he consider that there is need for a public service advertising programme to alert members of the general public to the use of asbestos fibres, for example, in attic insulation, or asbestos in doors often separating garages from the main portion of the house?  This is to ensure that the public are alerted to the dangers within their own households and that members of the general public who carry out what they would see as minor renovation works on their homes do not render themselves liable to the inhalation of asbestos.  It is also to ensure that there is responsible dumping of such asbestos waste rather than having it find its way into the dustbin system and being collected as ordinary refuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in this matter.  This is a dangerous toxic substance, I am advised now that <Col N="1417" /> the greatest health hazard risk from asbestos arises from regular working with the product rather than from its use as a component in building materials and that it is not now extensively used in housing.  I understand that roofing tiles are possibly the only use and they are used from the aesthetic point of view.</P>

Would the Minister consider an effective public service advertising campaign of relatively short duration to bring to the attention of people the fact that in many pre-1980 houses asbestos is often put to uses that they may not realise and which pose a health hazard within the home to them and their children?  Would the Minister not accept that whereas professionals, builders and contractors, may be aware of the hazards, the general public are unaware of the uses to which asbestos has been put in construction over the past hundred years and of the dangers that may very well lurk within homes?  The Department of the Environment have an obligation with regard to the information service in this regard, which cannot be undertaken by individual local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that two-thirds of the workforce have lost their jobs at a company (details supplied) in County Louth because of the cut-backs in sewerage and water schemes; the schemes he proposes to sanction; the cost of the schemes; the number of schemes which this company will qualify for; the cost of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by this company, it would not be proper to nominate the products of any individual company for use in sanitary services projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the competing demands for capital from various sectors, the level of investment in the last two years in the sanitary services programme has been relatively constant, with £60 million being provided in 1988 and £62.5 million in 1989.  Under the national development <Col N="1419" /> plan, expenditure in the years 1990-93 is projected to continue at the 1989 level.</P>
    <P>I have already approved seven major schemes to start in 1989 with a total cost over £24 million.  Details are given in a schedule which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>In addition, I expect to approve tenders for about 12 new schemes, with a total value of some £21 million, in the course of the year.  As tenders for these schemes are currently being sought, it would not be appropriate to divulge the estimated cost of individual schemes, as this might affect the tendering process.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide a continuous programme of work that will be of benefit to the consumer and the pipe manufacturing industry and I would point out, in this connection, that the 1989 programme includes a significant amount of pipeline work.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to authorise as many new projects as possible to go to tender and to construction stage, bearing in mind the limits on the capital available.</P>

      <P>Fifteen centres have been designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  I am aware that a case for designated area status has been made on behalf of a number of other urban areas, including Clonmel and Dungarvan, but no further designations have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he has no intention whatsoever of designating Clonmel for urban renewal? Is he aware that already Clonmel Corporation, out of their own resources, have expended over £1 million in acquiring, either compulsorily or voluntarily, buildings in the immediate areas of the three blocks that they wish to have designated for urban renewal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that they might have acquired property for their own developmental purposes, but certainly they did not acquire it on foot of any suggestion made by me that the area might or might not be designated now or sometime in the future.  The matter is not being considered by me today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that to a deputation to his Department and to himself in January 1988 he implied at least that Clonmel would be designated for urban renewal, that there is great disappointment in Clonmel at present that he has not lived up to this expectation in view of the ever-increasing unemployment at present in Clonmel, and that developers are literally knocking at the <Col N="1421" /> doors of Clonmel Corporation asking to be allowed to develop these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Deputy's effort but I have to say to him that the deputation he referred to took place on 2 February this year and I gave no guarantee about designation.  I said if and when any other centres came to be designated I would certainly consider Clonmel carefully. That is what I said and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary. Would the Minister be more specific about &ldquo;if and when&rdquo;?

Could he be specific in indicating exactly the ifs and whens of the designation for urban renewal?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's tenacity in this matter has to be appreciated but at the same time I have to say the matter will be considered in due course if and when it is decided to further designate some of the areas.  Let me put it to the Deputy, that of the nine provincial centres that were designated in May 1988 some have come on stream well&mdash;there is some very good progress and some have been a great success &mdash; and some of them have not.  I would like to see how they all get on before we think about doing anything further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if the Government have considered the possibility of reopening all or part of the old Harcourt Street/Bray railway line as a busway and including such a project in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> especially in view of the population growth in its catchment area; if he has considered the implications of the Shankill by-pass on the possible reuse of the line; if he will take steps to ensure that the land on the line is retained to the greatest extent possible to allow for its possible reuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The operational programme for roads which was formerly submitted to the EC Commission on 30 March last includes a proposal for the construction of a busway along the old Harcourt Street railway line to Dundrum. This proposal will be the subject of a detailed evaluation by the agencies concerned, particularly Bus Átha Cliath and the local authorities.  The development plans of both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council include provisions for the preservation free from development of the line of the old Harcourt Street railway.  The Shankill/Bray by-pass road does not appear to have any direct impact on the proposed busway to Dundrum.</P>

      <P>I certainly hope the busway to Dundrum would not impact on the Shankill by-pass, but the question I was asking was would the Shankill by-pass have any impact on the rest of the route that runs by Shankill on its way to Bray?  Has he considered that end of the line?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would seem to rule out a busway all the way to Bray.  It has not been seen as a problem because it is only proposed at this stage to consider the provision of a busway into Dundrum and even longer term proposals have not seen the busway extending beyond Loughlinstown.  Bray and Shankill are already served by DART and the existing road network in the area will certainly be adequate to deal with the matter.  I see no reason to provide a busway service between Shankill and Bray.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then on the first basis that the Minister's preference is for a busway?  Secondly, because he sees no prospect for the route beyond Dundrum, does he not consider the ultimate concept, as opposed to the ultimate event, of an electrified DART line running from Harcourt Street to Bray as a realistic proposition?  Can he advise the House that that is not on the stocks or likely to occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the extension or otherwise of the DART line in any direction should be addressed to another Minister.  As far as the busway to Dundrum is concerned, of course that has to be evaluated as well.  There is the question about the viability of the busway and <Col N="1424" /> the exact scheme that has to be undertaken. There are a number of technical issues regarding access and so on.  I suggest the Deputy is talking ahead of his time.  However, it has been included and the evaluation will go on now as far as the busway to Dundrum is concerned.  I hope that comes to pass.</P>

In view of the fact that there are currently representations for inclusion in the draft development plan of the privatisation and development of the line for private purposes, would he consider that as an interim useful development?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the final decision to proceed with the busway is taken, a number of things have to be evaluated.  I suppose that could be evaluated, but if we are to do the thing right we should not become involved in interim things like cycle-ways.  That would not seem appropriate to me, maybe I have the wrong end of it.  I would think the evaluation should deal with the busway as a viable entity from Harcourt Street as far as Dundrum.  We are taking it seriously and I hope it comes to pass.  A great deal is involved but it is still at the initial stages of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is his intention that Ireland should join the so-called 30 per cent Club by signing and ratifying the Sulphur Protocol known as the Helsinki Protocol to the United Nations Commission for Europe, a convention on long range transboundary air pollution which requires countries to reduce their national emissions of sulphur dioxide by 30 per cent from their 1980 levels by 1993; and if he will make a statement on the effects on Ireland's environmental quality from such emissions at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's national annual sulphur emissions are small by international standards and there is no evidence that Irish emissions either create environmental problems in Ireland or contribute to any significant transboundary air pollution.  The financial implications for the ESB and, indeed, for the entire economy of a 30 per cent reduction in sulphur emissions would be enormous, bearing in mind our overall economic situation and our level of development. <Col N="1426" /> Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate that Ireland should sign the Helsinki Protocol to the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air pollution.  However, in sympathy with the need to control air pollution internationally and as a contribution to international efforts in this regard, Ireland has agreed to limit sulphur dioxide emissions from large combustion plants in this country to a ceiling of 124,000 tonnes annually in accordance with Council Directive 88/609/EEC of 24 November 1988.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is extremely hard for Ireland to be taken seriously when it makes representations internationally about the impact on our environment of transboundary pollution if we do not accord to European norms in areas such as this? Am I right in assuming that the Minister is saying, no, Ireland is not going to sign this Convention, that our sulphur emission standards will not be reduced in accordance with the wishes of our European partners, there is no medium or long term plan to accord to European norms in this respect and that once again we are going to make an exception of ourselves in this respect, unlike the main countries in Europe who, apparently at even greater cost, will accord to this Convention?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so far as their own SO2 sulphur dioxide emissions are concerned and in so far as transboundary emissions affect them.  I was at the final discussions regarding the thresholds to this last year at a Council meeting.  Of course, they do not regard us as having any SO2 problems at all.  As the Deputy <Col N="1427" /> knows, we have only the one major coal burning station at Moneypoint.  The thresholds were finally decided upon at Council, granting so much reduction to certain areas and then stabilising it at certain levels, and we were granted 124,000 tonnes.  They regard that as a nonsense in comparison to what they have to endure by way of emissions.  In regard to SO2 emissions, we are not causing any problem to ourselves or to our neighbours.  We have decided on limits which will involve the ESB in an expenditure of £6 million or £7 million putting in scrubbers.</P>

I put it to the Minister that the best time to take action to reduce emissions by 30 per cent is while the problem is still of manageable proportions.  Would the Minister not agree to act now before it becomes a problem and we are part of the black countries of Europe?  Is the Minister not aware of the problem posed by the Moneypoint project?  It is an acid-producing outlet which requires scrubber installation.  It is a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that.  We are playing our full part.  Our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those of our neighbours and we do not contribute to the transboundary element of SO2 transfer to any significant degree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want that to go on the record because it is not true.  The analysis of the monitoring is there for everybody to see.  The SO2 emissions from Moneypoint are not causing a hazard or acid rain here.  Neither are we contributing to acid rain levels in other countries.  I accept that there can be small incidences of acid rain in this country but they are on the east coast and are the transboundary result of emissions in other countries.</P>
      <P>The major drive at the meetings of Councils of Ministers in this regard was to reduce the level of emissions in industrialised countries so that they would not contribute to the level of acidification in their own countries or elsewhere.  We are not contributing to that.  We have it under control and we have our limits.  We will not surpass the limits which have been laid down and which are regarded as very reasonable.  No great concern is warranted in this matter at member state level.</P>

The monitoring arrangements at the stations in the Slieve Bloom, Valentia and the Burren can immediately determine the level of SO2 emissions from Moneypoint and they do not constitute a hazard.  It is not right for Deputy McCartan to suggest that there is such a hazard.  We have agreed levels of emissions.  Ours are tiny compared to those of other countries.

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to establish any statutory regional authorities with responsibilities for implementing regional programmes for the usage of EC Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> which sets out Ireland's national development priorities in the areas relevant to the three Structural Funds, has been submitted to the European Commission.  The plan is to be implemented by means of operational programmes covering various key sectors of the economy.  My Department are concerned with two operational programmes, one covering roads and another dealing with sanitary and other local services.  Both have been prepared following consultations with local authorities and took into account the views of the regional working groups and advisory groups.  The next step in the process, in accordance with the relevant EC regulations is for the Commission to issue its response &mdash; known as the Community Support Framework &mdash; to the <i>National Development Plan.</i>  In the meantime there will be ongoing consultations with the Commission and between my Department and Commission officials on the two operational programmes to which I have referred, copies of which have been submitted to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities, the National Roads Authority and my Department <Col N="1431" /> will be responsible for implementation of the operational programme for roads which was formally submitted to the EC Commission on 30 March.  I propose to establish a monitoring committee representative of the implementing authorities as well as the EC Commission, together with industrial, tourism and other relevant bodies to monitor the implementation of the programme.  In relation to the sanitary and other local services operational programme which was submitted to the Commission on 12 April 1989, the local authorities and my Department will be responsible for implementation and in this area also it is proposed to establish a monitoring committee. These committees will be in accordance with the relevant EC regulations.</P>
    <P>Specialist statutory regional bodies for the purposes of implementation would not seem to be necessary or appropriate because the operational programmes will be implemented on a sectoral basis and because monitoring committees will be set up for each of them.  Moreover the establishment of such bodies would derogate from the position and status of existing local authorities and would add a further layer to the local administrative structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that he is saying it would be totally impossible for each of the seven designated regions to determine whether the objectives prescribed by the <i>National Development Plan</i> are being achieved and that it will be totally impossible to monitor, on a regional basis, what is taking place or to take corrective action if things are going wrong?  Can the Minister confirm also that the working and advisory groups the Government established within each of the seven regions are now effectively defunct and that the Government envisage that they will play no further role with regard to either formulating further operational programmes or monitoring or implementating the <i>National Development <Col N="1432" /> Plan</i> within each of the seven designated regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan will be implemented through the sectoral operational programmes.  As I have stated, the monitoring committees representative of the various authorities I mentioned will be there to see to it that the work is completed and I think they will be able to do that in an efficient and effective way rather than setting up another layer of administration which I do not think is necessary.  I am talking now as far as my two particular programmes are concerned.  The Commission will be involved in the roads programme and the National Roads Authority will be in a position to deal with that matter very efficiently with input from local authorities, the Department and other agencies.  There will be a good method put in place with a view to seeing to it that the jobs as indicated in the programmes, when approved by Brussels, will be implemented.  I do not see any difficulty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that all the monitoring groups he is talking about will be, in effect, secretive departmental groups who will report to the Minister but will not make their deliberations public, and that therefore information as to whether the objectives the Minister is laying down in these programmes are being achieved will be rendered an official secret?  Can the Minister tell us whether, in the context of the roads and the sanitary services programme he submitted to Brussels, he had sight of and gave consideration to the final completed report of the Dublin consultants who were appointed to prepare a consultancy study on the Dublin region?</P>

There cannot be anything secretive as far as monitoring is concerned because the monitoring committees are to be set up by agreement between the member state, that is Ireland, and the Commission.  It is not something that will be done by the Government in isolation.  The Commission will be represented on it.  What would we have to hide?

I have no knowledge of the exact date but I know that our national plan is being given immediate and urgent consideration right now, particularly some of the operational programmes, among them the roads programme, as an indication of good faith and because there is a certain lead-in time to many of these projects which means we need to get on with them if we are going to draw down money this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and regulations made under that Act, the Minister for <Col N="1436" /> the Environment controls the design, specification and use of road traffic signs by local authorities.  The Garda Commissioner's consent is required to the provision of road signs in particular locations and he has the power also to require local authorities to provide signs on roads as he thinks necessary.</P>
      <P>Within the last six months, I have approved specifications for road signs for traffic control at roadworks in urban and rural areas and for signs for tourist and amenity purposes.  In relation to both sets of signs, I involved local authorities in the design process and in the case of the tourist and amenity signs Bord Fáilte were also involved.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing road traffic signs on national routes is funded by my Department.  In the case of non-national roads the cost is primarily a matter for local authorities themselves though they may, at their discretion, meet such costs from discretionary grants for non-national roads provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>A programme for the provision of adequate directional signposting on national roads, funded by the State road grants, has been in operation since 1978 and is now virtually completed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the severe cutbacks in the finance for roads allocation to Louth County Council and the consequent potholes in the road which are reported to have been linked with the death of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; if he will sanction a major financial allocation to Louth County Council to avoid further serious injury and death on County Louth roads; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that in County Louth the cover for public liability is £750,000 to insurance companies; that 50 outdoor staff have lost their jobs; that county council workers were on a three-day week; and that they can only fill potholes with clay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The road grants provided by my Department to Louth County Council have increased substantially in recent years.  The total of the grant allocations notified for 1989 represents increases of 52 per cent and 38 per cent compared with the grant payments made in 1986 and 1988, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the Deputy is mainly concerned with regional and county roads. Primary responsibility for these roads rests with the local authority.  However, because of my concern about the condition of these roads, I have made substantial increases in the levels of road grant funding for them since 1987.  The 1989 discretionary road grants allocations notified for regional and county roads to county councils amount to £47.4 million, compared with £33.4 million in 1988 and £23.0 million in 1986.  The £47.4 million <Col N="1440" /> is the first instalment of the three year programme of works on regional and county roads which I announced earlier this year.  The programme covers the period 1989 to 1991 and will cost £150 million in discretionary State road grants.</P>
    <P>The 1989 discretionary road grant allocations notified to Louth County Council for regional and county roads amount to £548,000 which represents an increase of £166,000 or 43 per cent on the grant payments under equivalent headings in 1988.  In 1989, I have also notified the local authority of special road grants amounting to £315,000 for improvements to non-national roads at specific locations.</P>
    <P>I understand from Louth County Council that the cost of the county council's public liability insurance is £80,000; that 43 outdoor employees, including 29 road workers, have availed of the voluntary redundancy-early retirement package; that the last period of short time working ended in May, 1988; and that it is the practice of the local authority to use crushed gravel and tarmacadam to fill potholes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has had discussions with the Minister for Health with regard to the introduction of legislation on the irradiation of food; and if he will make a statement with regard to the environmental impact of pesticides, chemicals, sprays and other substances used on crops and vegetables.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to the irradiation of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pesticides for use as plant protection products are subject to the provisions of the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985, which are operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Applications made to that Department for clearance to market pesticides must be accompanied by environmental studies.  Clearance may be refused, or special conditions may be <Col N="1441" /> applied to the use of pesticides, where this is considered appropriate to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>The main environmental risks associated with the use of pesticides appear to be associated with once-off incidents, involving accidental spillages or carelessness in the disposal of containers.</P>
    <P>Water intended for human consumption is required to meet stringent quality standards under the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988.  The standards for pesticides cover insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyls) and PCTs (Polychlorinated Terphenyls).  Maximum admissible concentrations are established for these products, where considered separately or in total.  My Department are not aware of any pollution of drinking water by, or exceedance of the statutory quality standard for, pesticides and related products.</P>
    <P>No problems in relation to pesticides have been found in general water quality studies and I understand that samples frequently had concentrations less than detection limits.</P>

      <P>The death of Deputy Frank Cluskey will be deeply regretted on both sides of the House.  May he rest in peace.  Frank Cluskey had a distinguished public career as a Member of Dáil Éireann for over 20 years and prior to that as a member of Dublin Corporation, where he served a term as Lord Mayor. As a junior Minister at the Department of Social Welfare from 1973 to 1977, he contributed much to the improvement of the social welfare system, raising levels of payment and introducing reforms designed to improve the welfare of the disadvantaged in our society.  He was a <Col N="1545" /> skilled parliamentary tactician and as Leader of the Labour Party in opposition from 1977 to 1981 he made very effective contributions to our debates here.  In 1983 he served in a Coalition Government as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism where he showed concern for the interests of consumers and workers before resigning on an issue of principle.</P>
      <P>He also made a notable contribution to the work of the New Ireland Forum which reflected his deep interest in Northern Ireland and his commitment to peace. Frank Cluskey enjoyed many friendships on all sides of the House.  He was widely respected.  His observations on events often marked by a keen wit were very often shrewd and penetrating and greatly enjoyed.  His explanation of his defeat in the June 1981 general election was classic in its devastating simplicity; &ldquo;I didn't get enough votes&rdquo;, he commented.  He embodied many of the best traditions and characteristics of Dublin's inner city whose people he represented diligently.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to offer deepest condolences to his family as well as to his colleagues in the Labour Party.  He will be much missed by all of us and his contribution will be long remembered.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with this whole House in extending on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party our sympathies to the children, the brother and sisters and all the family of the late Frank Cluskey and indeed to his colleagues in the Labour Party.  This House has lost a very able Member whose contributions, often laced with a very sharp and sometimes acid wit, were always to the point.  We have lost a colleague whose contribution to the body of legislation will endure and will continue to serve the people who were closest to his heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a man whom we all knew to be one of great commitment and tenacity. Many of us, on all sides of this House, have lost a close and valued friend.  Frank Cluskey never hesitated to give advice. <Col N="1546" /> He was always ready to receive advice, but he never minced his words in expressing his opinion as to the value of the advice he was being given, but even his most trenchantly delivered and colourfully expressed opinions were given with a true warmth and a genuine concern.</P>
    <P>His courage, especially over the last two years, is beyond doubt.  A great deal has been said and written about Frank Cluskey over the past two days and it will never express all that we feel about him and it will never record all that we know about him, but there must be many of us who now have a picture in our minds of that incipient smile that was often the only warning one got of Frank's devastating shafts of wit, and we could wonder to ourselves what is he thinking now: what remark is he going to make now?</P>
    <P>There are many ways we remember Frank Cluskey and one, Sir, is very apt indeed to the situation of some of us in this House and it is to remember how he described being in Government.  He said: &ldquo;It's like being on the bridge of a liner, but I'm worried about the fellow at the bottom of the gangplank collecting the tickets&rdquo;.  That says an awful lot of what we remember and will always love about Frank Cluskey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I learned on Sunday last, in common with all Members of the House, with deep regret of the death of Frank Cluskey.  He was a great parliamentarian, a fine speaker and a fearless and principled defender of his deeply felt social and political commitments.  I admired greatly his sense of principle in resigning from the Government in 1983, when he disagreed with the policy being pursued.  That sort of principle is not widespread in Irish public life where it is frequently assumed that political survival takes precedence over both policy and principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frank Cluskey leaves an impressive record of caring legislation as a fitting monument to his memory.  He also demonstrated his great courage in his long <Col N="1547" /> battle against serious illness.  His cheerfulness and his wit, even when he obviously knew he was very ill, was both inspiring and impressive to all Members of this House.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, and on my own behalf, I wish to express my sincere sympath to his three children, to his sisters, to his brother and also his colleagues in the Labour Party who I know will miss him particularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us will find it hard to accept that Frank Cluskey will never rise in his place in this Chamber again. All of us have memories of the interventions he made here in the past, where he would stand, usually without a note or a file, and while on his feet dominate the Chamber by the power of his personality and strength of his passionate, political convictions.  Frank Cluskey derived those convictions from two things: first, they came from his background as a representative of working men and women, when he experienced at first hand the injustices and inequality against which he fought all his life.  Second, they came from his contact with, and admiration for, Jim Larkin.  Although he did not do so in any conscious way, he was to model his life and his career on the message of Larkin.  He was at his most passionate whenever he was confronted, in Larkin's phrase with the deep gap between what ought to be and what is, and he was at his most determined whenever he set out to close that gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few Members of this House will ever leave behind a more impressive array of monuments to their memory than Frank Cluskey.  His legislative reforms in the seventies, the new social welfare schemes he developed, the radical concepts he introduced, will all stand as testimony to his care and concern for the dispossesed and disadvantaged in our society.  His innovative and radical action in relation to the PMPA in the eighties and his principled stand in the case of Dublin Gas, now a publicly owned company, demonstrate his commitment to the rights of Irish citizens and, in particular, to their <Col N="1548" /> right of control over their own natural resources.</P>
    <P>He left other more important monuments behind too.  His principal monument will stand forever in the hearts of people he represented, the people he stood for.  There is many a home in this city, and indeed throughout the country, where the name of Frank Cluskey will always be mentioned with affection and respect.  They are not, by and large, the homes of the rich, they are the homes of many who will have suffered neglect, discrimination and disadvantage were it not for the things that Frank Cluskey stood for, and the things that Frank Cluskey did.</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party, we will remember Frank for the way in which he united the party when he was our leader.  We will remember him for the wise advice he always offered, both to the party as a whole and to any individual member who needed help and advice.  We will remember him for his strength in times of personal grief, for his humour and warmth in the face of complex situations, and for his deep sense of principle.  Those who met him during his last illness will never forget his courage and his strength.  He dealt with pain &mdash; and there was a great deal &mdash; by shrugging it off and interesting himself instead in the problems of the world around him.  Indeed, I believe it was a source of pride for Frank that the last time he was able to vote in this House, his vote was instrumental in saving the National Social Services Board.</P>
    <P>Of course, he will always be remembered in this House as one of the more formidable people ever to grace our benches.  Frank could use all the skills of the actor to get his message across, and he frequently did.  Every trick from the characteristic hunch of his shoulders to the rapier-like Dublin wit, was used with devastating effect.  Most Members of the Dáil have their own stories of that wit, and many of them too, have their own stories of the individual kindness and concern that Frank showed them when they needed it.</P>
    <P>Frank Cluskey was laid to rest this <Col N="1549" /> morning in Dublin, surrounded by the family and friends whom he loved and who loved him.  He lies on the hillside in Sutton, with a clear view of Dublin Bay and of his city.  It seems entirely appropriate that the spot should be picked because Frank was essentially a Dubliner, a man who loved his city and its people, who was prepared to struggle for them all his life and who will always be remembered by them.</P>

      <P>Frank was born into the Dublin working class and he never lost touch with his roots.  He demonstrated time and time again his commitment to his principles and took the major step of leaving Government because he disagreed with decisions being made at that level.  There are very few who can claim credit for taking such a major step.  He also bore his long illness with courage and, in that sense as well, he was an example to us all.</P>
      <P>He is a loss to the Dáil, he is certainly a loss to socialist politics and he is a loss to the working class of this country whom he served so selflessly throughout his life.</P>

Amendments Nos. 3, 10 and 12 are consequential on amendments Nos. 1, 6 and 8.  Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 and 13 are alternatives to amendments Nos. 1, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (a), line 24, to delete &ldquo;£6,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6,250&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments to the first section of the Finance Bill relate to income tax allowances.  It is at this point that we must decide on the amount of personal tax to be levied.  Deputies of all parties have complained about this matter and the Government have said that they are doing something about it.  In the budget the greatest reductions took place at the very top levels.  We ask in this amendment that we look at the very bottom levels first and that the basic allowance at the bottom levels be raised.  There are PAYE taxpayers at the very basic level who have insufficient income to maintain their families, yet they still have to pay income tax.  There are others, such as the unemployed, who do not pay as much tax even though they are in receipt of far greater income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that needs to be made is that people should have a minimum income and be allowed to retain enough to maintain themselves and their families before the taxman moves in.  The threshold should be raised much higher.  It is usually raised each year but it needs to be raised much higher if we are to eliminate poverty in society, the level of which has been highlighted in recent reports.  We <Col N="1557" /> believe that the allowances are not adequate.</P>

      <P>I must say I was a bit surprised at the approach adopted by Deputy Mac Giolla who called for an increase in tax-free allowances as one method of alleviating poverty.  We all know very well that the tax-free allowances give a disproportionate benefit at the higher end of the income scale.  Introducing tax credits is a more effective way of assisting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be very careful about that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as you will appreciate.  I would be watched. I wanted to make the point that Deputy Mac Giolla is mistaken in thinking that raises allowance is the better way.  In 1982, when Minister for Finance, I attempted to introduce tax credits into <Col N="1558" /> our tax system.  The budget contained a number of things which got a lot more publicity which led people for various reasons, confused reasons in most cases, to vote against it.  It is worth recalling that that budget contained a proposal to substitute tax credits for tax allowances.</P>
      <P>Tax credits have one benefit over allowances in that a fixed sum would be given to everybody regardless of what income level they were at.  Therefore, a tax credit is worth the same amount to someone paying tax at 58 per cent on most of their income as it is to someone paying tax at 32 per cent on the top slice. Tax credits would remove the discrimination built into the system of allowances which gives a disproportionate benefit at the top end of the scale, and would introduce nothing more than neutrality. We are not looking for social engineering in proposing tax credits but neutrality.  I believe that Deputies Mac Giolla, De Rossa, Sherlock and McCartan and their associate, Deputy Desmond, in the various amendments they are putting forward, are barking up the wrong tree.  They should be looking for a much more radical approach in the reform of the tax system.  I am glad to say that the Progressive Democrats have also agreed with the concept of tax credits which I espoused in the 1982 budget. Unfortunately, the Dáil on that occasion, including some of those who subsequently went on to form the Progressive Democrats, voted against it. Please God, they will have another opportunity to vote for tax credits and one of the things to which I am committed in my political career is to have an opportunity of being part of a Government which introduce tax credits which will restore justice to our tax system and remove the in-built bias in favour of the better off and the disincentive to effort by those on marginal incomes caused by the present system of tax allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to a matter which is being inadequately dealt with by the Government in the early sections of the Bill, the tax treatment of children.  In France and Germany it is recognised that the cost for a bread-winner &mdash; male or <Col N="1559" /> female &mdash; of supporting a dependent child is almost as much as the cost of supporting a dependent spouse.  The family is a unit recognised under the Constitution and also in practice in most domestic budgeting. People budget as a family rather than as individuals within the family and I do not see why, therefore, a person should get a tax credit or allowance &mdash; whichever it will be &mdash; for a spouse but do not qualify for an allowance for a child or children. It is a structured injustice built into our system which promotes poverty because it has been identified by various groups who have studied poverty in this country that family poverty &mdash; and the poverty of families with a relatively large number of children &mdash; is particularly acute.  It is a form of poverty which receives no recognition in the tax system, apart from the children's allowance, which the Government have frozen since they came into office and which the Minister for Finance threatened to do away with in part for some families.  He was acting on advice which would normally be quite good but which in this case was mistaken.  The person to whom I refer usually gives the Minister good advice but she did not on this occassion.  I know the Minister has thought again about that and, as he has rethought that silly proposal, he might go a bit further and conclude that there should be some form of allowance for children in the tax code.  I would prefer to see a system of tax credits and if one did a survey of the tax treatment of children throughout Europe one would find that virtually all the continental European countries have either tax allowances or tax quotients which are similar in their effect to allow for the cost of supporting dependants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not follow that particular rabbit.  I am a bit worried about the way the Minister is approaching this by increasing exemption limits which, by their definition, are a very crude way of <Col N="1560" /> reforming the tax system.  As we know, if exemption limits are increased by leaving the rate bands more or less intact it merely means that once a person gets to the end of the exemption limits the extra pounds earned are taxed at an astronomically high marginal rate because you reach a relatively high rate of tax &mdash; which the person would have been paying if there was no exemption limit &mdash; and when the exemption ceases to operate a very high rate of tax is paid.  As we know, the budget has been criticised by many because there will be a very high marginal rate of tax on people who have incomes slightly in excess of the exemption limits set in the budget.  That will be the case regardless of whether Deputy Mac Giolla's amendments are accepted.  If the limits are increased the poverty trap will occur at a slightly higher level of income but it will still be there.  It arises from the fundamental flaw in the budget, of trying to help families through exemption limits rather than a thorough reform of the tax system.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to get rid of exemption limits because they are not a good way of approaching the problem and having a system of universal tax credits at one level for adults and perhaps variable levels for children, depending on age.  There should also be an integrated child benefit payable into such a system of tax credits for adults, children and other dependants. These are my reasons for not wanting to support Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment &mdash; or even that of Deputy Desmond which has not yet been moved &mdash; because the Deputies concerned are essentially accepting the structure of the budget presented by the Government.  I suppose that is not surprising considering the fact that they let them in in the first place. However, I do not accept the structure of the budget and it would be better to approach it in an entirely different way on the basis of tax credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally agreed with Deputy Bruton in relation to these proposals. The patchwork of statutory provisions for lower tax levels is now coming undone.  There is a choice to be made &mdash;<Col N="1561" /> which I believe should be made in favour of tax credits &mdash; between a system of credits and allowances.  The case for credits is unanswerable and one of the reasons for a system of exemptions as opposed to tax allowances is that the whole system of credits was never in place to start with.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, if you increase a tax allowance at present by £1,000 it is worth £350 to someone on a low income and about £550 to a person on a high income.  It is no wonder, in those circumstances, that we have arrived at a situation where tax allowances as a matter of social equity &mdash; because of the consequences of increasing them &mdash; were kept depressed.  Tax allowances, therefore, ceased to have any logical connection with the idea of what each individual should have exempt from tax.  The construction of income exemption levels, another rickety construction, was superimposed on top of that for certain classes of the community.  This applied to those on low incomes and they are differentiated in accordance with their circumstances, dependants and their ages.</P>
      <P>We have an extremely complicated system of tax exemption levels and every Deputy who has anything to do with finance is inundated with letters after every budget written by people who simply cannot understand the tax system and who have no idea as to how it works in relation to them.  Those who can understand the system write to complain about its unfairness and those who cannot understand it just shrink in horror from its complexities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the systems of tax exemptions and allowances should be swept away and in their place should be one single system of tax credits based on some notion of social justice, some notion of what income should be earned without any exposure to taxation of any kind.  In this context another crib I have with the amendments tabled by Deputies Mac Giolla, Desmond and Sherlock is that they do not take into account the basic level of tax that is paid on all income, that is the 7.75 per cent of tax which is paid in the form of PRSI under that label <Col N="1562" /> but, in fact, affects all incomes of whatever level and for which there is no exemption of any kind.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the United Kingdom which has a system of social insurance contributions which is distinct from the tax system and even there low levels of income are totally exempt.  There are rising rates of percentages as income grows.  However, here we have a flat rate of tax dressed up as PRSI and payable on all low incomes.  Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment fails to attack that, the greatest tax on the poor and the lowest paid. This series of amendments completely ignores that feature of the PRSI and PAYE systems.  I should like to indicate opposition to the principle of tinkering around any further with the system of tax exemption levels.  I want to indicate opposition to the idea that we should maintain a system of tax allowances and opposition to any system of taxation which fails to recognise the fundamental identity of PRSI and tax as it affects lower incomes.  I should like to put instead a radically different notion, one where employee PRSI and income tax are integrated into one system and where the lowest level of tax is of the order of 25 per cent, as I have argued for in various places and in various documents.  The tax credit should reflect some reality as to what level of income should be exempt from taxation.</P>
    <P>The only addition to that view on Deputy Mac Giolla's proposal is that the series of proposals tabled by him, Deputy Desmond and others, to this and later sections share one common defect in that they fail to address what I believe is the other great deficiency in our tax system, the one which flows from the reaction of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I will not put it any further than that &mdash; to the Supreme Court decision in the Murphy case.  We have a system where taxation allowances and taxation bands for married people are double those available to a single person.  In my view that is a fundamental mistake and it is unjustifiable. It is wrong to give to a married couple double the taxation bands and allowances as a recognition of the fact <Col N="1563" /> that they are married.  It is done in the interests of keeping in place the revenue system of aggregating the income of husband and wife.  It was an unjustifiable response to the Murphy case and has ended up, again, with the predictable consequence that the taxation lot of the single person is gravely prejudiced because of the constraints which the taxation of married people, at double their rate, presents to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That was not necessary as a response to the Murphy case and we are paying the price for it today in terms of young people leaving the country.  On all fronts I object to the approach being taken by Deputy Mac Giolla.  I accept that he is well motivated but he is prolonging the system by failing to challenge it on a radical basis.  I appeal to the parties of the left to join with the Progressive Democrats on this issue, to look for radical tax reform and not to propose tinkering amendments to the system anymore. That only encourages those in Dublin Castle to keep at it.</P>

      <P>I do not see anything in the amendments about tax credits but Deputies Bruton and McDowell tell me that they are ridiculous amendments and that what we should be suggesting is major tax reform in the form of tax credits.  For seven years I have been at this.  I have put my case to two Ministers for Finance in the National Coalition and two Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government.  None of them did anything about implementing tax credits.  Perhaps when Deputy McDowell gets into such a position, if ever, I will have to attack him to have tax credits introduced.  For some reason when people get in charge of the Department of Finance tax credits become impossible to implement.  For that matter they find it impossible to implement any kind of tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Bruton and McDowell in regard to tax credits.  The Deputies have said they are against all the amendments to section 1 but they have not said that they are against the section which provides for certain allowances. I hope the Deputies will demonstrate that they are against it.  It is the Minister who is introducing the tax allowances and in our amendment we are trying to get approval for increases in the allowances since that is the system the Minister has introduced.  Deputies Bruton and McDowell must be aware of how difficult it is to produce amendments which will be in order on the Finance Bill.  They are aware that Members cannot table amendments that will impose a tax on people.  However, we can propose an increase in allowances which will have the effect of exempting certain people from tax.  While those amendments have been accepted a whole series of others have been ruled out of order.  Deputies Bruton and McDowell <Col N="1565" /> should indicate what they intend to do in regard to this section and not confine their remarks to criticisms of our amendments which attempt to introduce some level of equity for the lowest paid in our society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has said what I intended saying, that everybody wants a <i>à la carte</i> tax reform, everybody wants to pick and choose.  The only tax change I hear people suggesting is tax reduction and not tax reform.  Deputy Bruton referred to his 1982 budget which fell and I suggest that he should look at the 1982 Fianna Fáil budget which succeeded in introducing a system which had the same effect as his tax credits.  The Deputy referred to child allowances but his memory must be very short in regard to them.  The last semblance of it, the £100 allowance per child, was taken out by the Coalition but now he is suggesting that we should include it.  If that is not <i>à la carte</i> I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the principal subject being discussed by Members, the question of tax credits.  I should like to put that in perspective and then return to what is in the Bill.  We will weigh up the arguments in relation to what I have attempted to do as a start in trying to focus on those on low income.  The main argument put forward in relation to tax credits is that such a system would reduce the relief to, and thereby increase the tax liability of, those with higher incomes.  In other words, a direct switch to tax credits would increase the progressivity of the income tax code.  Proponents of the tax <Col N="1566" /> credit system claim that it would provide relief for those on low incomes by taking from the better off.  However, a switch to tax credits based on exact conversion from the existing system would take from people who could not be described as better off.</P>
    <P>The essential difference between the existing system and a tax credit system is that the higher rates of tax commence under the tax credit system at a lower level of total income.  At present more than one-third of all taxpayers pay tax at the higher rates.  This means that if the present system was replaced by a tax credit system, and if there were no compensating increases in the amounts of personal allowances given in the form of tax credits or adjustment of the rate bands, some 60 per cent of taxpayers would be liable at the higher rates.  In other words, all existing higher rate taxpayers and very many of those currently paying tax at the standard rate would be forced to pay extra tax.  When a taxpayer is liable at the higher rates it clearly creates a loss for him if his personal allowances or deductions are converted from deductions on his marginal rate of tax to deductions by way of tax credit computed at one of the lower rates.</P>
    <P>If only the wealthy were liable to tax at the higher rates this would be justified on progressivity grounds but it could not be justified in the context of a tax rate structure which imposes the higher rates on a person having less than an average wage.  The changeover to tax credits would, in fact, bear relatively more heavily on those with modest and middle incomes than on the better off.  That is the reality of the situation in relation to this present structure.  When we are talking about tax credits, for heaven's sake let us get it into perspective.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what I have attempted to do in relation to focusing in on the lower paid &mdash; raising the exemption limits and introducing a child benefit of £200 per child to focus the money that was available directly towards those on lower incomes.  The best argument which can be made in this discussion here today is that it should be more, and I would agree <Col N="1567" /> with that, but within the limits available to me I have made a start and I believe it is the right way to go in trying to focus in on people who are on low pay.</P>
    <P>I have heard the argument being made about marginal rates of tax.  I can only gather from that that there is a lack of understanding in regard to exactly what happens.  All taxpayers on marginal relief pay less tax than they would under the normal taxation system.  That is the reality of the situation.  Quite clearly it would be unfair to subject a person whose income is only a little more than the exemption limit provided, to the normal taxation rules.  Accordingly, an easement from tax is given by way of what is commonly called the marginal relief system. Basically marginal relief means that if a taxpayer's income is in excess of the appropriate exemption limit for his circumstances, his maximum liability to income tax will be set at 60 per cent of the difference between his income and the appropriate exemption limit.  Marginal relief can be quite significant depending on a taxpayer's circumstances. I will give one example.  A married man with two children who earns £7,000 a year, who pays tax under PAYE and is subject to the normal rate of PRSI, would be some £220 better off as a result of the application of the marginal relief system. Basically what I have set out to do in section 1 of the Bill is to focus in on the lower paid, and especially to try to focus in on the lower paid who have large families. I think this provision should be welcomed by everybody.  Maybe it is misunderstood in its application with regard to the marginal rate but if the Deputies want to do their sums they will see quite clearly where the benefit comes.</P>
    <P>I want to respond to Deputy McDowell's other question in relation to the application of the Murphy case by the Revenue Commissioners.  What the Deputy has said here today suggests to me that he is totally ignoring in those circumstances &mdash; by denying the double allowance to a married couple &mdash; a wife who stays at home and does not go out to work.  That has to be the result of <Col N="1568" /> the argument I heard the Deputy put forward, but if that is not it, perhaps he would clarify it for me at some other stage.  If we do not apply the double relief, then we will ignore a wife who stays at home and does not go out to work.  I do not think too many Members in this House would be in favour of that proposal.</P>

      <P>Exemption limits cause some administrative difficulty in the operation of PAYE since they cannot readily be implemented until the taxpayer's income is known, which must be after the end of the year of assessment.  Prior to this an attempt is made to identify the taxpayers involved.  Consequently a significant number of adjustments are required at the end of the year.  Exemption limits also require the provision of marginal relief for persons with incomes slightly in excess of the exemption limits.  Depending on the size of the exemption limits in relation to the level of personal allowances, this can result in high marginal rates of tax on significant numbers of taxpayers with below average incomes.  For example, over 50,000 low income taxpayers had a marginal tax rate of 60 per cent in 1981-82.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation believed this was undesirable.  They went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also believe that general exemption limits are misconceived in principle, since to help the poor effectively it is unnecessary to relieve them from <Col N="1569" /> taxation but rather to ensure that they have an adequate income by means of social welfare payments.  We do not recommend that general exemption limits remain as a permanent feature of the income tax code.</P>
    <P>That is what the commission said about exemption limits.  Now I want to turn to what they said about tax credits, which may be amusing to the ears of Deputy Mac Giolla in his new incarnation since his party changed their minds about tax credit in practice.  I am only trying to annoy the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I want to quote again from the report of the Commission on Taxation on the subject of tax credits. They put the case for tax credits more succinctly than I could.  In paragraph 16.55 of their report they state:</P>
      <P>On this basis, there is a clear case for converting all allowances ... into credits.  However, we also believe that the married and single allowances should be given in the form of credits for three main reasons.  Firstly, it would mean a complete change to credits. This would simplify the operation of PAYE compared to a system in which there were both allowances and credits.</P>
      <P>In other words, they say that it is not sensible to give credits for, say, mortgages, unless one goes the whole way and gives credits for everything.  They continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, a credit system is easier for the taxpayer to understand in so far as the rate structure is defined in terms of total income or expenditure rather than taxable income under an allowance system.  This enables a taxpayer to identify his marginal rate of tax more easily.  Thirdly, under a credit system it is much easier to give equal absolute increases in income to all single or married taxpayers.  While this can be achieved under an allowance system, <Col N="1570" /> it is more complicated in that rate band adjustments are necessary.</P>

      <P>The Chair has tolerated a certain reference to date in respect of the credit system, but the Deputy will appreciate that in respect of Committee Stage we are obliged to refer to what is in the section.  I do not see any reference to tax credits in the section and while we might regret its absence, all we can do is pass on to what is in the section.</P>

      <P>As the Chair might say, I am not unmindful of your latitude.</P>
      <P>I think I have exhausted the subject.  I do not think the Minister is as previous as he should be to arguments on this occasion, but perhaps an opportunity will occur when tax credits can be introduced because I believe they are the solution to the injustices in the tax system.  There would be no need for this &ldquo;tricking around&rdquo;&mdash; and that is all it is &mdash; with exemption limits and all sorts of fiddling with bands in order to create a cosmetic situation in which people appear to be better off at lower income levels where, if they get a slight pay increase, suddenly they are dramatically worse off because they go over the limit which has been arbitrarily set and chosen by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister is setting himself an impossible puzzle in trying to help the poor within the existing tax system when what is needed is a radically reformed system along the lines I have suggested. I am sorry to say that Deputies Desmond and Mac Giolla, in their amendments, are simply applying cosmetics to a system that is beyond redemption.  While Deputy Desmond's cosmetic efforts in this regard, of endeavouring to make a decent budget of what is fundamentally not so, are laudable for the sake of argument, they are not laudable in practice.  I would prefer to see the support of all in this House, including the Government, for the substitution of credits for allowances in general.  That would get over the problem. I am well aware of Deputy Desmond's consistent record of support for such a policy.</P>

      <P>We got the classic response that it just could not be done, certainly it could not be done that year, that was 1983; it is now 1989 and on we go.  The report of the Commission on Taxation was an eminently successful one which I am quite certain would merit and obtain the overwhelming support of all political parties in this House, one in respect of which there is universal agreement among the social partners that we need a tax credits system enshrined within our overall taxation code.  Yet, year in, year out we have to deal with the basic exemption limits and their defects.</P>
      <P>My tabling of these amendments was simply to highlight that aspect and, in the process, endeavour to bring about some further degree of relief for those on very low incomes within the multiple deficiencies inherent in the current taxation system.  That was the only reason I tabled the amendments I did on behalf of the Labour Party.  As the Minister well knows, my party published a document in the middle of last year which was substantially endorsed by my party's annual conference quite recently, when we came out trenchantly in favour of tax credits. Unfortunately, the Minister has not, either in the course of his remarks on budget day or since, in the work done on the Finance Bill, taken this prospective benefit in tow and implemented it.  Perhaps we will have an historic announcement in the House this evening.  I might ask the Minister: is there any hope at all of some fresh thinking within his Department, within the Revenue Commissioners, within the structure, recommending that we will go on to a tax credits system?  If that were so, to say the least, I would be pleased.  I have no doubt whatever that our taxpayers would then see that a system which is lop-sided, inequitable, incomprehensible &mdash; which changes year in, year out in terms of its basic exemption limits &mdash; would be corrected, those basic deficiencies being removed overnight.  Perhaps we could do that.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister on that fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also ask the Minister if, for example, one were to increase the basic <Col N="1573" /> exemption limit from £6,000 to £7,000 &mdash; I presume that the mandarins of his Department by now have conducted a firm costing of that change &mdash; how much implementation of the amendments we have tabled would cost.  I have no doubt the cost would be very substantial but it is always interesting to have it updated. I remember well in November 1981 when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Mac-Sharry, was transfixed there and when both the Labour Party and the Workers' Party proposed a modest increase in the basic exemption limits, when we finished up having a general election on the issue. Much to our surprise we won the vote. Yet we did not know at the time how much it would cost.  However, the then Government were much more frozen than the present administration.  We would be interested in knowing the cost of these concessions demanded.  Indeed those concessions and the additional moneys could be transformed into a tax credits system which would have a huge impact on our overall taxation code.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>I want to speak about amendment No. 3 in the names of members of The Workers' Party seeking the deletion of £3,000 and its substitution by £3,125.  Ever since the introduction of PAYE here the lower paid and least well off hand the understanding that that figure of £3,000 represented some kind of subsistence rate applicable to them.</P>
      <P>I noted what the Minister said earlier about his ambition to ensure that the lower paid were looked after; that is an admirable attempt on his part.  However, his colleague in the Department of the Environment managed to implement a rent increase in respect of local authority houses.  If one were to discount all of the other expenses or increases, the generous way in which the Minister for Finance appeared to treat the lower paid would render him as somebody who could be described as a Minister for good news, at least for himself anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of a single person with an income of £3,000.  How well off <Col N="1574" /> will such a person be?  In what position would a single person in this city find themselves endeavouring to seek refuge or accommodation on that type of income?  Would they get digs for £60 per week?  I do not think he would.  I do not think he could survive but there are people who survive on less.  We should try to ensure that the very badly off are well looked after.  It was Deputy John Bruton as Minister for Finance who originally introduced the tax credit idea. Deputy Desmond's mind must have slipped because he was a party to the Government who sought to introduce tax credits and produced the appropriate legislation.  There is no doubt that there were a lot of hiccups at the time.  People were worried about children's clothing and children's shoes but nobody is worried about the VAT which is now imposed on such items and which is bringing in money.  As far as tax credits are concerned the whole idea sank with our budget of 1982 which was the most socialist budget ever brought into this House. I have to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>People in the media have examined fully what was in that budget. The members of The Workers' Party should have examined it because they voted against that budget in this House and as a result it cost a lot of money.  The progress in this House was stopped and we had paralysis for six months.  The Minister for Finance brings in a Finance Bill but cannot bring in reform because his motto is &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo;.  He is saying that £3,000 for a single person is adequate for survival in Dublin.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, do you think that is right?  Do you think that £3,000 is a subsistance income by which a person can survive in this town?  This £3,000 which <Col N="1575" /> is picked out by the moguls in the Department of Finance &mdash; whom I love so much &mdash; has nothing to do with life.  What Deputy Bruton proposed in the budget of 1982 regarding tax credits should be implemented.  When the Minister for Finance moves on to better things he will be wondering why he was not more adventurous in his first budget.  I think this is the only budget in which he will have had a chance to be adventurous.  He will be more conservative for his next budget and say: &ldquo;I made a mistake in 1989 but I will not do so again&rdquo;.  The little man on the other side will remind him that he cannot do that.  For that reason I object to £3,000 figure being regarded as an adequate subsistence allowance for a single person.  This House should get together before 1992 and have all the taxation affairs of this country reformed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There were one or two other points raised by Deputy Bruton to which I would like to refer.  The Commission on Taxation looked at tax credits in the context of &mdash; this is important &mdash; a flat rate of income tax, not in the context of the steeply progressive structure we have at <Col N="1576" /> present.  Therefore, it is a misrepresentation of their views to state it in the terms in which the Deputy has done. I did not go into the administrative side of it but I want to tell Deputy Desmond that when I came to look at the budget for 1989 I did not look at the question of tax credits because from all I had heard and read about them I knew I could not hope to achieve anything for budget 1989 and I went in the only sensible direction, that of exemption limits, and introduced exemptions for children in order to try to focus in on the low paid because that was something specific I could do.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Bruton's comment from the Commission on Taxation regarding exemption limits the system has changed.  We forced the change in the system to accomodate the exemption limits.  The child benefits this year are given throughout the year, not in the context of what the Deputy read out from the Commission on Taxation, that they are there at the end of the year.  That is why on budget night we saw on television advertisements from the Revenue Commissioners advocating applying for exemption limits straight away.  We changed the whole system because the reaction to its introduction and trying to focus in was that the system could not accommodate it.  We made the system accommodate it and that is why we made it work in deference to what the Commission on Taxation has said about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are doing in this section is tinkering around with the existing system. We would have disagreed with the tinkering around at the top of the existing system, in other words the constant erosion at the top rate as evidenced in this section.  Our amendment which has been ruled out of order sought to substitute a stiffer penalty &mdash; a rate higher than 56 per cent &mdash; at the top rate where a single person would have £25,000 taxable income and where a married couple would have a taxable income of £50,000 or, in other words, a gross income of almost £70,000.  I agree that this is part of the tinkering around with the system. The tinkering is being done at the wrong end all the time.  There is a reduction at the lower rate but the amount of the actual income increase to the people on <Col N="1578" /> the top rates is far greater than the miserable increase in income given to those on the lower rates as a result of the system we operate.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 contains a proposal we put forward in recent years, that &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers, or single parents&rdquo;.  It has already been mentioned that there is no justification for doubling tax allowances for married couples over single people.  Whether there is any argument in that, as mentioned by Deputy Bruton, the fact is that widows, widowers and single parents are the most discriminated against in the taxation system.  They have to raise families in precisely the same way as two parent families.  They have greater difficulties because, as well as raising their families, they must earn incomes. They have therefore to pay somebody to look after their young families and have many more expenses and difficulties in bringing up their children than a married couple.  Yet they do not get the same allowance as the married couple get.</P>
    <P>There was a time when there was a widow's organisation but, unfortunately, that seems to have lapsed.  There is nobody speaking for widows and widowers now.  Every Deputy here has had representations from families and individuals in this category about the discrimination against them under the taxation system.  It is only right that the new Minister for Finance be asked to look into this issue, to see if there is anything that he can do to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go into all the details as I am sure that everybody knows them. The Minister is probably aware of the difficulties experienced by people in his own area.  We are putting this forward as a blanket amendment to put these people on exactly the same basis as married couples with regard to tax allowances, tax bands, etc., and to end discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla's criticism of the taxation system in relation to the treatment of widowed people.  That is one of the natural outcomes of the Murphy decision, one of the invidious aspects in the way in which that decision has been interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners for which the Minister, despite all his earlier smart remarks about the effect of my views, has no answer.  It is completely wrong to say to a married man with a large family whose wife dies suddenly that his tax situation will suddenly worsen.  To say that that is in some way justifiable on the basis that prior to his wife's death their tax treatment was a recognition of her work in the home, is compounded by the insult that when he loses her services, his take-home, disposable income collapses. Would the Minister mind telling me how that amounts to a recognition of the woman's work in the home if when she dies, the family, taken as a group, get hammered by the Revenue Commissioners? There is no explanation for that.  It shows how wrong the system is when one's marital status suddenly doubles one's tax bands and tax allowances.</P>
      <P>It is a nonsense to say that a person, by virtue of his marriage, even if his wife has disappeared and he no longer lives with her, should have double the tax allowances and double the tax bands, which is the present law.  It is an artificiality which is not required by the Murphy decision.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, when you apply this mad logic to a widower, whose family have suffered a huge personal tragedy, for tax reasons, it is irrevelant that they have lost the services of one of the pillars of the family, because suddenly the Revenue Commissioners gang up on that family and demolish their tax status, taking away half the benefit they had because there was a spouse in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example of how wrong the Minister's defence of the present difference between taxation of single and married people, is to be found in the following proposition.  Is the Minister saying that the present tax system is a <Col N="1580" /> recognition of the contribution of married women in the home?  If so, is he saying that a working class wife contributes less to the home than her very wealthy counterpart in a rich area in Dublin?  If we double the allowances and the bands, we are saying that a wealthy lady's contribution at home is worth a hell of a lot more than that of a working class family with an income of £6,000 or £7,000.  That proves how nonsensical that defence is.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in principle to say that because a person is married he or she should get double the tax allowances and double the tax band.  No amount of phoney defence will make up for the fact that where it applies in practice to a widower, it is most unjust.  That is why the Progressive Democrat's policy, to which Deputy Bruton referred so generously earlier, carried with it the idea that the difference between the thresholds of the lower and the higher tax bands would apply, not on a basis of being married but on the family basis.  Either a family situation should justify a further extension upwards of the basic rate from £12,000 to £16,000, or it does not.  There is no justification whatsoever in saying to a married person that he or she is to have double tax status compared with a single person, but telling widows or widowers the year after they are bereaved, their situation is suddenly worsened.</P>
    <P>By way of footnote in support of what Deputy Mac Giolla says, I worry slightly about the single parents situation in this proposal, but there are many single parents who need a tax break.  It would be artificial if the mere fact that one is a single parent doubled one's tax bands and tax allowances.  In logic, that is not defensible.  In the last analysis, what Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out in the context of widowed people underlines the nonsensical nature of the Revenue response to the Murphy decision.  There was a better way, but it required disaggregating family incomes, separating husbands' incomes from wives' and treating them separately, which is the only fair way to tax people.  Some wives cannot <Col N="1581" /> make a contribution in the home, some have to go out and work.</P>
    <P>Is it fair to a working class family that a very wealthy middle class or upper class lady gets double the tax breaks simply because she is the spouse of a very wealthy man?  I do not think that is right. The more you think about the Murphy decision and the way the Revenue Commissioners responded to it the worse a decision it was, and the proof of the pudding is in the disgraceful way it treats widows and widowers.  It just adds to the disaster that befalls them especially when they have a dependent family, when the State then says it wants to take more and more of their income tax as a result of their bereavement.  I find it completely beyond my capacity even to explain it let alone justify it to any widow or widower who writes to me.  The indignation in their letters and telephone calls is very hard to deal with because it is scandalously morally wrong to treat them in the way the tax system does now.  We should admit this in this House, tear up the Murphy decision as interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners and start again and build a fair system which does justice between people who are in roughly the same circumstances but have very different incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal I was making earlier in the debate addressed quite well the problem put forward by Deputies Mac Giolla and McDowell.  The problem as put by them is that if a person is widowed and suddenly discovers that he or she no longer has double tax bands, has a double allowance but not double tax bands, the cost to that person of losing the double tax bands is enormous and occurs at a time when frequently the extra expense involved as a result of the bereavement is great, so the person is hit both in terms of having perhaps to hire help to look after children where previously the couple could have afforded to do it between them, by having their tax situation worsened by removal of the double tax bands.  I emphasise that frequently happens but not always.  If there <Col N="1582" /> is a bereavement but there are no children and just two adults living together, while the bereavement is undoubtedly substantial in its phychological effect, the financial effects may not be as severe as would be the case if that couple, one of whom dies, had a number of children. Therefore, any solution to the problem should discriminate somewhat between those who have children and those who have not, at least where the financial burden more heavily falls.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McDowell correctly acknowledged, the tax code cannot take away the pain of bereavement; it is concerned simply with financial unfairness that may arise.  My solution to that is simply to say that people with children, with family responsibilities, should have those responsibilities acknowledged through the tax code by a tax credit for the children.  At the moment the only recognition essentially given &mdash; apart from social welfare allowance to children &mdash; is in the form of a totally artificial doubling of the tax bands which is taken away in case of bereavement.  If one were to move over to a system where, for instance &mdash; to revert to the argument made by the Minister &mdash; there were two tax rates and a system of tax credits for adult dependants and child dependants, while there would be some loss for a widow or widower in that they might in respect of the scond band, if they did not have a doubled allowance against that band be somewhat worse off, the fact that they would have a credit for the children would greatly mitigate that problem.  That is an alternative way of approaching this injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made a devastating criticism of the way the Murphy decision was interpreted in so far as its effects on widows and widowers are concerned.  I do not want to think it is fair to expect the present Minister to take entire and sole responsibility for the situation in which he finds himself.  While one might have a good time teasing him about the present system, that would not be particularly fair because he is not there long enough to be able to overcome a very difficult problem arising from the Murphy <Col N="1583" /> decision.  It is not in that spirit I am speaking, but the Minister must acknowledge &mdash; which I think he will &mdash; that Deputies Mac Giolla, McDowell and, in support, myself have a case here.  I would like to look at it in the context of some form of tax credit or allowance for children because that would discriminate in their favour as against the case where apart from the pain of bereavement, there is a financial saving if two people are working, have no children, both are in their fifties and well off, and one of them dies. That saving does not apply if there are a large number of children.  The solution to this problem should be targeted to some degree at widows or widowers with children. Perhaps the Minister could look at that in whatever time is available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me say to Deputy McDowell that my earlier comments were not meant to be in the smart aleck way he seemed to have taken them up because they were only interpeting part of the argument.  There is a problem here which I recognise openly.  The calls for doubling of the bands would result from the high tax rates in general.  It is a question of doing the best you can with what is available to you.</P>
      <P>Let me put the matter in perspective to give the Deputies an idea of what is involved.  The cost of extending the double rate bands to one parent families would be about £1.8 million in 1989 and £3 million in a full year.  You could stop there.  People would say that does not look too bad.  Then you go on.  These costs would, however, be much higher: £18.4 million in 1989 and £30.6 million in a full year if married couples opting for single treatment could not be successfully excluded.  That is where we run into the first problem.  Then there is another problem. If the marriage entitlement to mortgage interest relief and life assurance relief were also extended to one parent families, as should logically be the case if you are travelling that route, the costs would be ever greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, against that background there is not an easy solution.  As Deputy <Col N="1584" /> Bruton rightly says, I am a short period here but I recognise there are selected groups it falls very heavily on, but to say they are not recognised at all in the tax code is not true.  When a person dies the present married allowance and the higher mortgage interest relief are applied.  The following year the widow or widower has an allowance; there is mortgage interest relief again and the widow has widow's pension and relief at widow's rate.  Therefore they are recognised, but not fully recognised in the way we in this House might like to recognise them.  I agree we would like to find a solution to some of the real problems out there in society, but it is not as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I will not get into the argument about the Murphy case and the interpretation of it. I have listened to Deputy McDowell who has a better legal brain than I have.  I do not pretend to have a legal brain at all.  I look for practical solutions to problems I see in front of me.</P>

      <P>I will not argue, but it would appear it is not just as simple as changing the interpretation.  We will look to see if different interpretations can be put on it.  Deputy Bruton has recognised the problem in saying there is not an easy solution to it.  He talked about going back to the child allowance in the tax code.</P>

      <P>Leave the tax credit aside for the moment.  I want to put this in perspective and let Deputies know what sort of money we are talking about.  In 1989 for £100 child allowance the cost would be £15 million and a full year for £100 would cost £25 million.  I do not subscribe to the view that the tax code is the place to deal with children.  You can deal with the size of families more directly through children's allowance and so on.  We also have to think in terms of the family who are not in the tax code.  I directed more money this year to people in the social welfare code.  I do not hold <Col N="1585" /> the view that the tax code is the place to deal with this problem.  It can be looked after and better focused through the social welfare code where there are fewer administrative problems.  In the circumstances I could not accept the amendment but we will use the opportunity throughout the year to look at the question of widows.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and I recognise that he is sympathetic. The figure he has given is quite small in that the cost of implementing this measure in respect of single parent families would be £3 million in a full year and £1.8 million this year.  The Minister indicates that it would be difficult to include them and exclude others.  I do not understand how that difficulty arises.  There is no difficulty in excluding widows, widowers etc. at present.  What is the difficulty of excluding others if we include them?  I fail to understand that.</P>

      <P>There are always complications put forward by civil servants in regard to any proposal for change.  The net result is that nothing is done.  The Minister recognises that this is discriminatory.  It relates only to the tax bands and there is no good argument for discriminating against single parents in this case.  The Minister said he would look at it again later in the year.  Perhaps he could look at it before Report Stage and come up with a suitable wording which would include them and exclude married couples opting for single allowances, etc. Surely with the expertise at his disposal the Minister could find a phrase which would include only single parents.  When somebody is included, there will always be somebody else excluded.  Every new tax allowance or incentive has anomalies. This is an anomaly which has hung on for a number of years.  Perhaps the Minister could find a way to deal with it since he sees the justice of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem that arises <Col N="1586" /> is that married couples can opt for single treatment and they cannot successfully be excluded because it is their right under the law.  If we create an exclusive band we cannot keep the others out since it is their right in law to opt for single treatment. It is not just an administrative problem.  That is where the big costs come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the view that the tax code was not the right place to recognise the cost of looking after children, in this case the children of a widow or widower.  I do not agree.  I do not understand how one can be entitled to claim a tax allowance in respect of a dependent spouse and not be able to claim that allowance for a child who is equally dependent on the taxpayer. Our tax code already gives a dependent relative allowance of £110 for an adult who is not a spouse living with a taxpayer and dependent on him or her. The Minister is not questioning the rectitude of such an allowance or proposing to get rid of it.  If the dependent relative happens to be one's child as distinct from an aunt or nephew one is not entitled to the allowance.  It is an allowance which is not given in respect of children.  In respect of a spouse one gets an allowance similar to one's own which is in the region of £2,050, plus double tax bands.  If another adult is a dependant and not one's spouse one is entitled to a tax free allowance of £110.  I do not understand why the Minister can justify a tax free allowance for a dependent relative who is not one's child and not allow a tax free allowance for a dependent relative who is one's child.  It does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that the previous Government got rid of this and that I was a member of that Government. I am not saying anything here today which is news to any member of that Government.  I was resolutely opposed to that proposal, which I regard as one of the worst decisions we made.  If there is to be recognition for dependency in the tax code there is a case for recognising the dependency of children.  I stress the condition &mdash; if there is to be recognition <Col N="1587" /> of dependency in the tax code there is a case for recognising the dependency of children.  I stress the condition &mdash; if there is to be recognition of dependency at all. If the Minister's case is that everybody should pay the same tax whether they have 20 people depending on them or are just making money for themselves, there is no justification for a child tax allowance. If, on the other hand, he is prepared to allow a tax free allowance for a spouse, for an aged or handicapped relative living in the home or a non-handicapped relative who is simply dependent, but not for children, then the Minister is being inconsistent.</P>
    <P>The argument trotted out by those who wanted to get rid of child tax allowances was that it was unfair in that it was worth more to a family with six children living on £30,000 than to a family with six children earning £5,000 a year.  That was the argument used for getting rid of the recognition of children in the tax code.  It was, of course, a false argument.  If it was a valid argument we should have got rid of all tax allowances, not just the ones for children.  The argument can be applied to all tax allowances.  If we do not want that sort of discrimination, the solution is to have tax credits for children, a system which could easily be integrated with the social welfare children's allowance.  I hope the Minister sees the logic of this.</P>
    <P>There are arguments the Minister might make about other continental countries.  Minister Wilson said earlier that these countries have not enough young people and are worried about the future.  All the people in France and Germany will be old in 20 or 30 years' time and there will not be enough young people to support them.  We are not far from that situation in Ireland if emigration continues at its present rate.  That very same situation could occur here quite quickly.  The birth rate has fallen quite dramatically since 1980.  It is still the highest in Europe but it is falling more rapidly than the birth rate in most European countries.  The decline here is probably more rapid since 1980 than in <Col N="1588" /> any other European country.  The arguments which encourage other countries at least not actively to discourage people from having children would possibly apply with equal force here.  In the seventies there was the problem of the great increase in child numbers going to school. It posed a fiscal problem and many schools had to rebuild to accommodate them.  Those schools have now been built and they are rapidly beginning to empty in the lower classes because of the effects of the falling birth rate.  So there is no fiscal or social engineering argument for not having this allowance, because whatever expense there is has already been incurred, at least as far as capital costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in using those sorts of utilitarian arguments in favour of an allowance of this kind.  It sounds as if one were talking about incentives for increased production.  What we are really talking about is recognition of the actual expenses involved for individuals in looking after a family as against those who do not.  The present Minister, for all his occasional mistakes in this field, is well aware of what I am talking about and knows exactly the reasons such an allowance is justified.  I wanted to say that because I think the Minister has inadvertently accepted an argument that was probably passed across to him about there being no justification for recognition of children in the tax code.  If that is the case there are a whole lot of other allowances that should be got rid of as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I still hold strongly to the view that the use of the social welfare system is the best way to channel any available money to children in large families, or whatever the Deputy is referring to here.  In relation to the tax code, I have no doubt that Deputy Bruton was part of the same argument and the same logic when his own Government decided to get rid of the £100 in the tax code because it disproportionately favoured the better off.  I presume that was the logic, because it is the logic I would use.  They took the decision to get rid of it.</P>

We note that the 48 per cent rate remains as it was and the 35 per cent and 58 per cent rates were reduced to 32 per cent and 56 per cent respectively.  There is no consistent logic in his decision to reduce the top and bottom rates but not the middle one.  I know the Minister had to make a choice, and perhaps he tossed a coin and decided to reduce one by 3 per cent, another by 2 per cent and not reduce the other at all. I would be grateful if he would explain <Col N="1591" /> why he chose not to make any reduction in the middle rate but only in the lower and top rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.  I had choices to make with the money that was available to me.  The 48 per cent band was widened as well.  I made a decision based on the amount of money that was available to me and reduced the 35 per cent rate to 32 per cent &mdash; the first time it has been touched for 20 years.  I reduced the 58 per cent rate to 56 per cent and, of course, everybody in the higher bracket will get the benefit of the lowering of the 35 per cent rate to 32 per cent because they have to come through the lower band to get to the higher bands. I would like to have done more but these are the choices I made.  Furthermore, I would like to see two rates of tax and, hopefully, given time, we will achieve that.</P>

      <P>I would not dream of asking the Minister to commit himself.  I would be interested to know whether his priority would be to reduce the bottom, middle or top rate.  There would appear to be a good case for concentrating the reduction on the 32 per cent rate in an effort to get it down to 30 per cent. However, the problem faced by all tax reformers is the argument made about equity which we always hear about in debates of this kind.  We are not operating in an entirely isolated environment.  The fact is that people can leave the country to work elsewhere relatively easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the Government that reduced the top rate by the greatest possible amount; it was 80 per cent at one stage and we brought it down more <Col N="1592" /> or less to 58 per cent.  The Minister has now brought it down a further two percentage points to 56 per cent.  One of the reasons this has to happen is the increasing mobility of talent.  While one might want to stand back from the whole thing in an atmosphere of total isolationist objectivity and say the priority is to do something lower down the scale, the fact is that to provide jobs we need to keep people with high earning potential in the country.  That, I suppose, is one of the reasons that prompted the Minister to make the reduction from 58 per cent to 56 per cent.  I would be interested if the Minister, without committing himself &mdash; which I would not expect him to do &mdash; would give some indication of his general philosophy about where we go from here in so far as rates of tax are concerned.  I agree with him that it would be highly desirable &mdash; and I have said this already in this deabate &mdash; to move to two rates of tax.  If we did that it would mitigate some of the problems we were discussing earlier in regard to widows in the sense that the bands would not be quite as important as they were.  There would be just one point at which the band element would have a deleterious effect and for many more people the bands phenomenon would be of no importance in comparison with what it is at present.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My philosophy is very straightforward and simple &mdash; I want to get tax rates down.  That has been my aim since I came to office and it was also the aim of my predecessor.  Our commitment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was to give tax relief of £225 million but before the second year is up we have given tax reductions of £700 million.  Certainly I will be looking at the matter in the context of next year's budget.  My personal commitment is to have two rates of tax as soon as is practical within the economic constraints and within the choices open to me, whether in next year's budget or that of the following year &mdash; I could not even hazard a guess at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> The Deputy, from his former experience, will know quite well that the most expensive area in which to reduce tax is at the lower end.  One has to be fair and equitable when considering the hard choices that have to be made and the amount of money that is available.  That is my approach.  I agree with the Deputy that the high rates of tax are a disincentive and certainly encourage some people who are in jobs to leave the country and go elsewhere but we have to continue and the only way to do so is to continue to bring the finances into better order, try to get more growth in the economy and leave more revenue available so that we can reduce the taxes to the level we would all like to see.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 11, paragraph (b), line 15, to delete &ldquo;£286&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£500&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the allowance for those on the higher rate of PRSI.  The purpose of the amendment is simply to increase this sum, which was originally £312 and was reduced in each year subsequently to £286, to £500.  I would much prefer if all PRSI payments and levies &mdash; various levies such as youth employment levies, health levies and so on have been imposed &mdash; were allowed as a tax allowance in the same way as pensions and superannuation payments.  I cannot understand why PRSI payments are not given the same status under the Finance Acts as superannuation payments and so on.  If that was the case we could abolish all the PRSI allowances.  That would be by far the fairest, best and simplest way of operating the taxation system and the PRSI payments.  It seems constitutionally wrong and against the individual rights that people are taxed twice on their gross wages and that one tax is not offset against the other.  This has been a flaw ever since PRSI payments were brought in and that is the reason I propose this amendment.  It proposes to almost double the allowance to cover those on the higher rates of PRSI payments.  The Minister should accept it.  The same rate of allowance has applied since 1983 and <Col N="1596" /> the Minister should now alter that allowance upwards to the amount I am suggesting &mdash; £500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem with this allowance.  It seems to be a bit anomalous to charge some people money for what is essentially considered to be part of Government expenditure, namely, social welfare services and then give them a tax allowance on it.  You take the money away and then give a little back.  I do not quite see the point of it.  I know the argument is that social insurance is separate from taxation and I know many people feel that if they pay social insurance they acquire certain entitlements that they do not acquire when they pay income tax.  In other words, the social insurance money that goes towards social welfare payments is their money whereas money they pay as income tax is money paid to the Minister for Finance to spend on education for their children or on other benefits for them.  It is not quite their money in the sense that the money they pay in social insurance is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason the Commission on Social Welfare rejected the idea that social insurance benefits should be paid for out of general taxation and opted to retain a separate social insurance fund.  I am not entirely convinced of that.  The reality is that these are benefits provided by the taxpayer.  Social insurance is a tax that is particularly unfair to the low paid people in the sense that they pay it on every pound they earn.  It would probably be a lot simpler and more sensible to amalgamate social insurance and tax and have one single system to finance all services including those currently financed out of the social insurance fund.  Seventy five per cent of those services are financed from the social insurance fund and the anomaly here is that the remaining 25 per cent of social insurance expenditure comes from general taxation anyway. The whole thing is a fiction and there is no independent management of the social insurance fund.  Workers do not decide on the rate of social welfare through representatives sitting on a board of directors of the social insurance fund.  The fund is <Col N="1597" /> a pure fiction controlled and run by the Government.  The contributors, the employers and employees have no control over the activities of this fund.</P>
    <P>We should go one way or the other. We should accept that social insurance is a fiction and finance it from taxation giving people on lower income exemption from social insurance payments which they have to pay at the moment.  This should be done on the basis that it is just taxation and that if people are allowed an exemption on the first £3,000 income, they are entitled to an exemption for PRSI purposes.  Alternatively we should make the social insurance fund genuinely self financing and run by the FUE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and we should let them set out the entitlements, collect the money and run it as an independent system with a general level of subsidy from the Minister for Finance. The present system where we have a nominal fund is riddled with injustices in the way it operates, because it is levied on every pound a person earns and not levied on people earning over a certain amount and it is controlled by the Government although it has a nominal appearance of independence in the sense of being a fund.  We should go one way or the other and regularise the system. We should pay for all the benefits out of taxation or have a genuinely independent fund.  Either system would be markedly better than the present system.  I am interested to hear the Minister's reaction to that approach and the reaction of Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    <P>We have an allowance for those on the higher rate of PRSI.  Why is there not an equivalent allowance for those on the lower rates of PRSI?  It does not make sense to have an allowance for those on the higher rates and nothing for those on the lower rates.  Those on the lower rates are civil servants and the self employed. Increasingly the self employed will move upwards, to 5 per cent in two years time and will presumably reach the employees' rate for general PRSI.  If we are going to retain a PRSI allowance it does not make sense to have it available only for one category of PRSI payment.  I am <Col N="1598" /> interested in the Minister's response to that.  If we do not do what I suggest we will build into the system another anomaly by having an allowance for one form of PRSI and not for another.  All sorts of special cases will be made in relation to this.  A solution is to get rid of PRSI altogether and incorporate it in general taxation or make it a genuinely self financing, self managed system of social insurance with contributors paying in and being represented in the decision making process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in Deputy Bruton's contribution. The whole issue needs to be opened up and debated.  Is PRSI social insurance or not?  What is the point in keeping a face on something which does not exist.  If it was a fund managed independently as Deputy Bruton suggests, people contributing to the fund would have specific rights.  At the moment they do not have rights, they have benefits. Those who are adept at seeking out their entitlements get all the benefits and those who are lax get nothing.  Deputy Bruton's suggestion would need more examination but I am certainly interested in his comments.</P>
      <P>PRSI is seen by the people as a tax.  If it is a tax it should be incorporated into the tax system so that we do not fool ourselves and try to fool others especially those who have the deductions made from their wages.  People only understand PRSI as money going out and they do not know to what they are entitled on foot of those payments.  PRSI as it is at the moment could be dealt with under the tax system.  It is wrong to make two separate tax deductions from a person's wages, and that is how people see it.  It is wrong that both payments are deducted on the gross and one is not offset against the other.  It is time the Minister looked at the whole system of PRSI and tax and got his act together.  There is a lot to be said for what Deputy Bruton said with regard to incorporating PRSI into the tax system or alternatively for having some separate social insurance fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the amendment I have put <Col N="1599" /> down is just tinkering around with the system.  I pointed out at the beginning that I was rather reluctant about this amendment. I am in favour of amalgamating the PRSI and tax so that PRSI payments can be offset against tax payments but in the absence of that system I am putting down this amendment that the allowance for those on the higher rates of PRSI be increased now from £286 to £500.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister's comments on tax in relation to PRSI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the amendment seeks to impose a cost of an additional £34 million in 1989 and £56.6 million in a full year and would benefit approximately 612,000 taxpayers with income sufficient to benefit in whole or in part from the increase.  Of these 612,000 some 10,000 taxpayers will become exempt from tax and 602,000 would face a lower tax liability.  Let us put in context the cost of what is already included in the Bill which is at the rate of £286.  The estimated cost is £51.1 million in 1989 and £85.1 million in a full year.  About 625,000 taxpayers benefit from it, of whom 612,000 would have a reduced tax liability and 13,000 would be relieved of tax altogether, of all those who are expected to benefit.  In cost terms alone it is simply not on, in view of the situation and taking into consideration that over £200 million in tax relief has already been given this year.  While I would accept what Deputy J. Bruton says, to an ordinary person, no matter what they pay their money for, PRSI is Government money and a tax.  That is a very general impression.  However, let us be very clear what PRSI is: it is a social contribution, not a tax, and as such is accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton has said, whatever way you pay money to the Government, the ordinary person says that is tax; that is what they think.  Let us come to the core.  PRSI is a social insurance contribution and subscribers have a right to the benefits arising from it, whereas if the money went into general taxation, they would not see themselves as having rights to it.  Second, the trade unions themselves do not regard or see PRSI as a tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They had two representatives at the Commission on Taxation giving evidence and they did not see it as a tax, they saw it as a social insurance contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They may well have, but I am only talking about the trade union representatives at this stage.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in context, giving tax relief for all PRSI payments would cost £370 million in a full year, and if you were to abolish it altogether and bring it into the general taxation, we are talking about a figure of £1,363 million, that is what is collected in PRSI.  This allowance is not paid by civil servants and some other contributors.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that, I believe it should be separate.  I know there is a lot of misunderstanding about PRSI, some ordinary people see it as a tax because it is taken out of their wage packet, but the reality is that it is a contribution to a social fund from which the contributors get benefits, but they would not be entitled to these benefits if these contributions went into general taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, while many people think that the rate of PRSI is exceptionally high it is the third lowest, in the EC member states.  Because of the cost implications, <Col N="1601" /> there is no way I can accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that while the trade union members on the Commission on Taxation expressed a sentimental attachment to social insurance &mdash; I think that is what it was &mdash; the majority of the commission said we should get rid of social insurance contributions and have a social security tax which would be levied on all income, including capital gains.  In other words, everybody, not just those in insurable employment, would pay a contribution towards social welfare.  Of course, the effect of amalgamating it into the overall system, would be that everybody would benefit from tax credits against their social insurance contributions, just as they were benefiting from them as against their tax contribution. That would be a much more equitable system of taxation for everybody. The reservations expressed by the two trade union members on the Commission on Taxation may well have represented a certain conservation of thinking that applied in the trade union movement at that particular point in the history of the movement but I am not so sure that would be the case now. However I am not going to speak on that subject.  My feeling is that there has been a great deal of change in attitudes in the trade union movement and there would be a greater openness to these thoughts now than there was in 1984.</P>

      <P>`authorised person' means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an inspector or other officer of the Revenue Commissioners authorised by them in writing for the purposes of this section, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  a person nominated by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, authorised by them in writing for the purposes of this section;</P>
      <P>`designated area' has, subject to section 27 of the Finance Act, 1987, the meaning assigned by section 41 of the Finance Act, 1986;</P>
      <P>`owner', in relation to a building, includes an individual entitled to acquire the fee simple in a dwellinghouse under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, and references to `owns' and `owner-occupied', in relation to a building, shall be construed accordingly;</P>
      <P>`qualifying building' means a building the site of which is wholly within a designated area and which, on application to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland in that behalf by the individual who owns the building, is determined by those Commissioners to be a building which is of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest;</P>
      <P>`qualifying owner-occupied dwelling', in relation to an individual, means a qualifying building which is either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" />  (i)  used at the time the relevant expenditure is incurred, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  first used after the relevant expenditure has been incurred,</P>
    <P>by him as his sole or main residence;</P>
    <P>`qualifying period' means the period commencing on the date of the passing of this Act and ending on the 31st day of May, 1991;</P>
    <P>`relevant expenditure', in relation to an individual, means the amount of the expenditure incurred, during the qualifying period, by the individual in respect of any work of repair, maintenance or restoration carried out on a qualifying owner-occupied dwelling of the individual.</P>
    <P>(b)  For the purpose of this section, so much of any expenditure as is equal to any sum received, or to be received, directly or indirectly in respect of or by reference to that expenditure, or in respect of or by reference to the qualifying building or the work to which it relates, by the individual making a claim in respect of that expenditure under subsection (2) from the State, a public or local authority or any other person or under any contract of insurance or by way of compensation or otherwise shall not be regarded as having been incurred.</P>
    <P>(c)  (i)  Where relevant expenditure in relation to a qualifying building is incurred by two or more individuals, each of those individuals shall be treated as having incurred only so much of the expenditure as the inspector, to the best of his knowledge and judgment, considers to be just and reasonable and the expenditure shall be apportioned accordingly.</P>
    <P>(ii)  An apportionment made under subparagraph (i) may be amended by the Appeal Commissioners or by the Circuit Court on the hearing, or the rehearing, <Col N="1604" /> of an appeal against any relief granted on the basis of the apportionment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this section, where an individual, having made a claim in that behalf, proves that he has incurred relevant expenditure in a year of assessment, he shall be entitled for that year of assessment to have a deduction made from his total income of an amount equal to 25 per cent. of the amount of the relevant expenditure and, in each of the five immediately subsequent years of assessment, to a like deduction equal to 5 per cent. of such relevant expenditure.</P>
    <P>(3)  No relief shall be allowed under this section for expenditure in respect of which relief may be claimed under any other provision of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>(4) (a)  Where the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland have made a determination that a building is a qualifying building and subsequently, by reason of any alteration made or to be made to the building, they consider that the building is, or will be, no longer a building which is of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, they shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by notice in writing given to the owner of the building, revoke the determination, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  notify the Revenue Commissioners of the revocation and the date thereof.</P>
    <P>(b)  If relief has been given under this section to an individual in respect of relevant expenditure incurred in relation to a building which has had a determination revoked in accordance with paragraph (a), that relief shall, where that individual has caused the alteration to be made, be withdrawn and there shall be made on the individual all such assessments or additional <Col N="1605" /> assessments as are necessary to give effect to the provisions of this subsection.</P>
    <P>(5) (a)  Where an individual makes a claim under subsection (2), an authorised person may, at any reasonable time, enter the qualifying building in respect of which the relevant expenditure has been incurred for the purpose of inspecting the building or the work in respect of which the expenditure to which the claim relates was incurred.</P>
    <P>(b)  Whenever an authorised person exercises any power conferred on him by this subsection, he shall, on request, produce his authorisation for the purposes of this section to any person concerned.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any person who obstructs or interferes with an authorised person in the course of exercising a power conferred on him by this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500. </P>
    <P>(6)  Any claim for relief under this section shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  be made in such form as the Revenue Commissioners may from time to time prescribe, and</P>
    <P>(b)  be accompanied by such statements in writing as regards the expenditure for which the relief is claimed, including statements by persons to whom payments were made, as may be indicated by the prescribed form.</P>
    <P>(7)  All such provisions of the Income Tax Acts as apply in relation to the deductions specified in sections 138 to 143 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to deductions under this section.</P>
    <P>(8)  Section 198 (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby <Col N="1606" /> amended by the addition to paragraph (a) of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (xi) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1986):</P>
    <P>`(xii)  so far as it flows from relief under section 4 of the Finance Act, 1989, in the proportions in which they incurred the expenditure giving rise to the relief,'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am introducing this measure in response to representations suggesting that tax relief should be made available to encourage individuals to come and live in inner city areas and to renovate houses there that are historically or architecturally significant.  There are, of course, already provisions in the income tax code along these lines, for example, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, provides full tax relief for maintenance, repair, etc. expenditure on houses which are determined by the Commissioners of Public Works to be of significant, scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, provided public access is allowed on at least 30 days each year.  In addition, section 44 of the Finance Act, 1986, provides for relief spread over ten years on 50 per cent of the net cost of construction or refurbishment of grant size houses in the designated inner city areas.  That is the position at present.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that the public access requirement under section 19 was preventing people from qualifying under that section, while section 44 relief is restricted to grant size houses, and this rules out most of the houses of the Georgian type in respect of which relief is now sought.  In addition, it has been argued that the spread of this relief is too long &mdash; that is, over a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>The measures which I am now proposing to the House are pitched between those two existing reliefs and contain the following features: houses broadly of the type referred to in section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, determined, of course by the Commissioners of Public Works to be of significant historical or architectural merit will qualify, but there will be no public access requirement.  We are eliminating that condition.  The houses will <Col N="1607" /> have to be in a designated area, but there will be no upper size limit.  Relief will be confined to 50 per cent of the cost of repairs, but up to 25 per cent of the relief may be claimed in the first year and the balance over five years.  This is to meet calls for relief structured to meet the high initial repairs which might face the purchaser of a house in a very poor state of repair.  The relief will operate up until the end of May 1991 when the designated areas relief comes up for review.</P>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The House is being asked to agree to an immensely complicated amendment running over three pages of text.  I think the House needs to look at this in detail, in view of the fact that, unlike the Finance Bill proper, this has not been in widespread circulation among tax consultants and so on, who may wish to make submissions.  This is always a problem with amendments introduced at this stage.</P>
      <P>The first question I would like to ask the Minister is, why is this relief confined to designated areas?  That seems to be an artificiality.  Presumably houses of a type that one would wish to preserve exist elsewhere in Dublin, other than in the very arbitrarily drawn line.  I presume that such a building in inner city Castlebar which has been designated, would apply, but an historic building in the town of Westport would not achieve similar relief.  To my mind that is anomalous; in the town of Westport, which I know very well, a town containing some magnificent buildings which ought to be preserved and would not qualify for this relief, but in parts of the town of Castlebar &mdash; because this was chosen for reasons best known to a Minister for whom I have the highest esteem &mdash; there is the possibility of obtaining this relief.  Can the Minister explain why this relief would be available in respect of buildings in Castlebar but not in Westport?  Longford has some notable buildings.</P>

      <P>Why would relief not be available in respect of buildings there to enable them be preserved and why would this relief only be payable in respect of buildings in designated areas?  I think it was Deputy Michael Pat Murphy who used to say &ldquo;lu&mdash;dikras&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will not attempt to justify it.</P>

      <P>That is another argument in favour of television.  I may have been passing unfair judgment on Deputy Michael Pat Murphy as possibly it may not have been he who said that.  If he did, it was in jest.  I am also concerned at the removal of the requirement to have public access.  Who is worried about allowing access on some days of the year? Perhaps 30 days a year is a bit much but if someone obtains tax relief in respect of a building of this kind it is not unreasonable to require public access.  I am aware that tax relief is available in respect of stately homes and there is a requirements to have public access.  What we are now saying is that if one owns a stately home within a designated area of a city one can qualify for tax relief without there being any requirement to have public access. What is the justification for this?  Is the Minister saying that in order to qualify for tax relief in respect of a big house in the country there should be public access whereas if the house is in the city there is no need to have public access?  What is the reasoning behind this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about a phrase which is written into our tax code and that is the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;.  In this amendment there is reference to the opinions of the Board of Works about the aesthetics of a building.  They are about the most subjective criteria one could get.  Essentially aesthetics is a subjective phenonemon.  Something new is often unpleasing to the eye but with the passage of years it becomes extremely pleasing to the eye because people's opinions have changed through familiarity with new forms of expression.  The Board of Works would decide in their <Col N="1609" /> collective wisdom what is aesthetically pleasing and therefore qualify for money from the taxpayer in the form of tax relief.  If there ever was an invitation to corrupt, there it is.  Officials would decide on the basis of aesthetic considerations whether A would qualify for tax relief and B would not.  We are very lucky to have a Civil Service which has hitherto been almost entirely incorruptible.</P>
    <P>The way out for officials in the Revenue who cannot draft sufficiently tightly the terms for a relief a Minister wants to give is for them to say: &ldquo;we know what you want, Minister, but we cannot quite put down on paper what exactly qualifies and what does not but we will get out of this difficulty by giving to some fellow, be it a guy who has been taken on by the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether a book is a work of art or a guy in the Board of Works who is to decide whether a book is a work of art or a guy in the Board of Works who is to decide whether a building is aesthetic, the power to make a decision on a case by case basis.&rdquo;  To grant tax exemptions on the basis of the subjective opinions of an official is no way to do business.  Yet, our tax code is riddled with that kind of phraseology.  The business expansion scheme is riddled with it.  Under that scheme Board Fáilte make decisions about whether particular activities qualify for tax relief.</P>
    <P>The merit of our tax code in the past was that it was based on rules and not on the decisions of rulers, whether they be civil servants or Ministers.  It is important that we get back to that concept.  I am aware that there is no corrupt intent behind this amendment but if we want to get to a position in a few year's time where our system is thoroughly corrupt we should continue in the way we have been going, where Ministers or officials are able to decide that A shall have one tax status and B shall not on the basis of subjective criteria, be it wealth creating capacity or some other subjective ground which is prayed in aid of what is essentially a decision to deny something to one person and give it to another.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to do this, the way to do it is to say that any building that is and can be demonstrated to be 200 <Col N="1610" /> years old or more shall qualify and that any building less than 200 years old shall not qualify.  There could be no argument about that.  It would simply be a matter of establishing the age of the building but if people are going to decide on the basis that they like the look of a particular building on one street and do not like the look of a building on another street we are in trouble.  It is about time that the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I criticise them and do so quite openly &mdash; did their job and presented us with proper legislation which lays down clear rules for deciding whether someone qualifies and not adopt this cheap approach of giving the power to some official in the Board of Works to decide whether a building qualifies.  This is a sign of intellectual laziness on the part of the Revenue Commissioners who have produced this section to harassed Ministers who want to do something that will be of benefit.  I am sure I introduced similar sections when Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>If one wants to do something they say that the only way one can do it, because they could not draft the rules tightly enough, is to give someone the power to decide.  In relation to the Custom House Dock site the Minister has the power to decide that one company qualify while another do not.  To my mind, it should be automatic and there should be clear defining characteristics. People should either qualify or not.  If they do not qualify, the place to determine whether that is the case is the courts and not the Minister's office or the office of an official.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the last six to eight years that this sort of legislation has been coming into this House, where individual subjective judgments are having to be made.  That is not a good thing at all.  This is something that I frankly wanted to say in this House before and I am glad that I have the opportunity to say it on this section as this is probably the one case where one should not decide on aesthetic grounds.  In relation to tax relief on books <Col N="1611" /> they will decide whether something is art, and this is even sillier.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment in that light because it is not the right approach.  I am not too sure that I agree with the idea of not having some public access to buildings. If people qualify for this tax relief why should the public be denied access? Perhaps a period of three days a year would be adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy accepts it.  We are trying to get people to live there so that it will become a live city. The present schemes are not working.  I am not saying that this is the whole answer to the problem and I have taken some of the Deputy's points on board because they had already occurred to me. However, it is addressing some of the reasons for the existing schemes not working.  The Deputy mentioned that there should be access by the public for 30 days per year.  If you want people to live in the inner city and spend their money on renovating nice Georgian houses in parts of the inner city, it is a bit much to ask them to allow the public access for 30 days per year, because you do not ask those who are receiving £150 million in mortgage interest relief to let people into their houses.  Right or wrong, that is my reasoning.  I did not spread the relief over ten years because I wanted to give an incentive to people to finish the work fairly quickly.  I have no hang-ups about a wider definition and perhaps the House will help me in this regard.  I could name houses outside the designated areas which I should like to see restored.  What definition will I use?  I am not prepared to allow local authorities to decide this matter because it would spread all over the country.  I am left with &ldquo;designated <Col N="1612" /> areas&rdquo; and if somebody can give me a better definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine.  This can make a contribution to reviving part of the city and give people a reasonable chance of carrying out the necessary extensive renovations.  It is no more than that, it is not being set up for any particular purpose or individual.  I do not accept that local authorities would do the job better than the Office of Public Works.  It could not be a countrywide scheme as it would be open to all kinds of abuses and I should like to confine it to inner cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without having the degree of deliberation I would have liked, I suggest that the Minister confines the relief to houses more than 200 years old anywhere in the country.  I know that there would be difficulties in determining whether some houses are 230 or 180 years old&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation it would be reasonable to allow officials&mdash; on the basis of information about similar houses and their architectural history&mdash; to decide whether a house was 200 years old.  That is as far as I would like officials to go in picking and choosing the age of a house.  Officials would be placed in an impossible situation if they were asked to decide on the basis of aesthetics in terms of the types of pressure that could be brought to bear on them either directly or through Ministers.  At least if you set an age level there is something objective and if an official makes a manifestly stupid decision that a house which is obviously 100 years old is 200 years old, you have something to go on in dealing with that abuse.  However, there would be absolutely nothing to go on if the abuse was based on the official's aesthetic judgment, because one man's aesthetic horror is another man's aesthetic dream. In basing the decision on age you would be dealing with most of the houses in <Col N="1613" /> inner city Georgian Dublin, which the Minister is anxious to deal with, but you would not exclude some of the beautiful old farmhouses on the road into the town of Longford, for example.</P>
      <P>There are Georgian and Queen Anne farmhouses and cottages in different parts of the country, the roofs of which are falling in, of magnificent aesthetic value but which are only attractive if someone is living in them and not preserved as museums.  However, they are all excluded, the only thing that qualifies for relief is houses in the inner city and stately homes.  Small cottages in rural areas, which were inhabited by the ancestors of the overwhelming majority of the people in this House, do not qualify for relief, even if they are 300 years old.  On the other hand, a stately home where the ancestors of very few of the Members lived qualifies.  There are also certain houses in designated areas in the inner city which qualify in the opinion of the Office of Public Works.  It would make a lot more sense to say that all houses over 200 years in rural areas or the city qualify. It would be a much more favourable approach to the problem and would have a tremendous effect on the inner cities.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said &mdash; I have tried to get this point over in previous debates on the Finance Bill &mdash; for preserving what is known as vernacular architecture, the architecture of the general population, where ordinary people lived.  We should not confine it to the architecture of the rich.  Unfortunately, society &mdash; it may be a form of inverted snobbery &mdash; has decided that we will give tax relief to stately homes and Georgian houses but not to the houses in which most of my ancestors and those of the Minister and Deputy McDowell lived.  If we discriminate on the basis of the social origins, the occupiers or the size of the house, it should be on the basis of age only.  There should be relief for houses which are over 200 years old.  I ask the Minister to look at that suggestion which would get rid of many problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms one <Col N="1614" /> has to be in favour of relief for expenditure of a certain kind on houses of historical value.  However, in this case I have grave misgivings whether the Minister will achieve what he wants to do.  We are talking about designated areas of the inner city and the only one with which I am concerned is Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have in the grey cells of my mind some of the outlines of the designated areas.  I know that Henrietta Street and North Great Georges street are in it but I do not think that much of my constituency is included, although I may be wrong.  I do not think that Merrion Square is a designated area but areas around the Liberties and Christchurch are in the area.  Perhaps the area that CIE own around Temple Bar may be included, I am not clear about that, but the Custom House Dock site, curiously, is in it and the quays.  There are few enough places in these areas where families will live.  It is a nice idea but not very practical.  There is private ownership of houses in Henrietta Street and North Great Georges Street but they have fallen into decay although some people swam against the tide to keep them going.  I do not know whether it is necessary, in those circumstances to provide them with tax relief to renovate their houses.  It is not unfair to mention one person, Senator David Norris, who has made a great job of preserving his house in North Great Georges Street.  Is it right to say of someone in his circumstances in particular that 50 per cent of relevant expenditure, as defined by this section, should be tax deductible?  I do not know whether it is right or wrong.  There is no claw back provision in the section.  One could buy one of those houses, renovate it, live in it and then dispose of it.  I may be wrong about that but I do not see the claw back in it and that worries me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One worry I have about this is that we give capital gains taxation a free run here. We are also going to allow income tax deductions on certain forms of expenditure. I do not know if we are going about this in the right way.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that there is a very uncertain test of eligibility for this.  Adam <Col N="1615" /> Smith did suggest that certainty should be one of the canons of taxation.  When one tries to focus tax relief on a particular problem it is sometimes difficult to have sufficient flexibility and sufficient certainty in any statutory formula. However, here we have buildings which are determined by the Commissioners of Public Works to be buildings which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  I think I am right in saying that Mountjoy Square is in a designated area.  Every house in Mountjoy Square is, in my view, of significant interest but the number of people who will move into those houses and use them as family homes will be very few. If one wants to bring people to live in the inner city one would have a better chance by giving tax relief to people who in places like Camden Street, Stoneybatter and so on, agree to take accommodation over shops and pubs and convert it into places where they are going to live rather than going about it in the way suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Relevant expenditure&rdquo; is extraordinarily defined.  It means, we are told, the amount of the expenditure incurred by the individual during the qualifying period, which is up to 1991, in respect of any work of repair, maintenance or restoration carried out on a qualifying owner-occupied dwelling of the individual. Work of maintenance could be virtually anything; it could almost involve the Senator's cleaning lady.  Her work in cleaning up the house and tidying it is a form of maintenance.  I am amazed that maintenance has been added to this provision. Heating is arguably a form of maintenance.  This is a very wide definition and it worries me on that account.</P>
    <P>The nature of the expenditure is not adequately defined.  If I get a house in Henrietta Street and decide that I am going to spend £100,000 refurbishing it, make a hames of it in the process, put in a jacuzzi and saunas in the middle of a Georgian structure, transform it but in a way that was never contemplated by the Minister, put in a bar in the corner of the salon on the first floor and a disco in the <Col N="1616" /> basement &mdash; that is all qualifying expenditure because one is refurbishing the house &mdash; the worst that could happen would be that the commissioners on inspecting the house might say that by virtue of what I had done to it it had ceased to be of major architectural significance. If one went too far one could provoke the Commissioners of Public Works into being so outraged that they would de-designate the house.</P>
    <P>The approach of Deputy Bruton is, on balance, correct.  There should be an objective definition and it should not be confined to these designated areas.  As the pointed out, designated areas were put there for very different reasons.  Ministers have moved might and main to get various portions of other towns around the country designated for this purpose. This House, when it laid down those boundaries, never took a look at the whole issue of what buildings were inside and outside the boundary.  If that had been the criterion, if we were talking about houses for people to live in as family homes, the lines would have been drawn very differently.  The Quays in Dublin may not have been included at all.  Nobody would suggest that people should go to live along the Quays.  I imagine that places such as where the Jesuits have their church at Gardiner Street, Eccles Street and other areas in Dublin which could do with some kind of incentive scheme like this to rescue a lot of north city Georgian Dublin from destruction could benefit from it but they were never, so far as I know, included in the designated areas scheme.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage that a scheme which was devised for business men is being applied as a geographical criterion for family homes and residential purposes.  It was also devised without any regard to aesthetics.  It appears we have decided that this is to be the outer limit of an architectural conservation zone.  I travel along the Quays every day as I go between this House and another place and I note a huge programme of building taking place.  It is not going fast enough but I note that most of the building is <Col N="1617" /> commercial building and the very beneficial tax régime for tenants and lettings is having a substantial effect on that area. Houses are being torn down and refurbished in order to take advantage of the new tax régime.  At the same time the boundary in terms of principal private dwellings is now being used to set out where people should go and live.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there are so many people who are inhibited from going to live in those places if they want to do so by the fact that they cannot get these qualifying expenditures deducted from their tax.  I wonder will that, as an incentive, be of much worth.  I wonder how many people will say, &ldquo;this incentive is now available and I must go mooching in the areas of Dublin around which this line has been drawn and see if there is any place in there that I can go and live in&rdquo;.  It is of much concern to me that the expenditure does not have to have any aesthetic content, that it can be horrific expenditure in terms of the damage it does to buildings.  I do not see anything in the section that requires the expenditure to be approved of.  I am always loath to get An Taisce involved but I would be very loath to see people getting a tax subsidy to wreck an old Georgian house which is of some interest and to put into it what they consider to be appointments.  I do not think that is a good idea.</P>
    <P>I re-echo what Deputy Bruton said, that this is thrown at us and we have not had time to think about it.  It arrived on our desks this morning.  It may be said that Deputy Noonan and I did the same to the Minister and in that event fair is fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more assistance to analyse these amendments. On the face of it this provision seems to be arbitrary and open to abuse.  It is open ended.  As far as I can see one could spend £1 million on such a house and get tax relief on half that expenditure.  It is a <Col N="1618" /> decent gesture in the right direction but I do not think it will achieve what it is supposed to achieve.  I do not think the provision was well thought out.  If I were Minister for Finance and I was told that centre city Dublin needed more people to go and live in it and I was asked to devise a scheme for that the last thing I would do would be to start with the designated area.  I cannot see how the designated area has anything to do with it.  Areas like High Street, Thomas Street, Kilmainham, Mount Brown and Stoneybatter which need some incentive to get people to come back to live in them have been excluded from this provision. At the same time places where nobody in their right minds would go to live, such as down in the docks area in its present state &mdash; presumably it will be changed later &mdash; will be preserved.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to say is that there are many cases where there is a street of nondescript houses but when the whole street is taken together it is of architectural importance.  None of the houses are all that important in themselves, and some of them may be quite unimportant, but suppose two families who live side by side decide to go into the inner city and one family buy a red brick fronted house dating from 1880 and the other family move into a house dating from 1790 and both families spend the same amount of money going to live in the inner city and are in the same circumstances.  If one family get half of their expenditure handed back because the Board of Works decide their house has a special merit, I wonder if that will be regarded as justice in the last analysis.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that this amendment is badly thought out and even though the Minister is on the side of the angels on this, I do not think he will achieve what he is supposed to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to respond to fairly quickly.  First, the scheme is about promoting the inner city and getting people to live in the inner city.  I want to make a few specific remarks which might ease the fears which were expressed by Deputy McDowell in <Col N="1619" /> relation to certain points.  We are using the same definition which was there in 1982.  If it was a big bonanza it would have been well abused by 1989, and I am sure the Deputy will accept that point quite clearly.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there was nothing weird involved in choosing the definitions in regard to the areas.  What alternatives do we have?  If we used county boroughs it would have been to extensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate I do not have the time to draw a new map in relation to this matter. What I am saying is that I am approving a scheme which is there in order to try to get people to live in the inner city, which I think would be desired by everybody in this House, and it is a question of which is the best way to do it.  So far, I believe this is the best way to do it.  I want to extend the provision to some of the areas mentioned by Deputy McDowell but I have not yet found a way to confine it to those areas or to draw a new map, as the Deputy suggested.  We do not have time between now and 7 p.m. to draw a new map in order to satisfy the Deputy, but I said, first it was not the bonanza some people think it was and, secondly, it is confined to 50 per cent of the total expenditure spread over six years.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to the age of the house.  All houses over 200 years may not necessarly be of architectural value.  If we were able to prove that a house was 199 years or 201 years, would we be talking about marginal relief or something crazy like that?  The suggestion in regard to 200 years sounds right but it just does not work when it is redefined down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not the answers to the tight definition one wants in a Finance Bill, and Deputy Bruton knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>Those are some answers to the points raised by Deputies.  The reason the Bill does not cover the areas referred to by Deputy McDowell is that new maps are required or whatever.  I am prepared to look at this relief in order to extend it to those areas so as to get people into them to live, which I imagine would be desired by most Members of this House.  As I said, the scheme is not, as some Deputies feared, being left wide open.  If the scheme does not work it will have cost the Exchequer no money and the fears which have been expressed by the Deputies will not be justified at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been unduly dismissive of the serious case I have been making about this point, and I know it is a technique in which he has a lot of practice.  I have made a serious <Col N="1621" /> point which I think the Minister has totally ignored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The age of the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with regard to the age of the house.  If the Minister laid down a criterion of age at least there would be some measure of objectivity in that.  There may be doubts around the margin as to whether a house is 180 years old or 200 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Or more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said already, I anticipated that argument by saying that I would have no objection to officials making a decision of that kind because at least it would have been grounded in something objective.  In my view any houses which have survived this long have survived because of some intrinsic merit anyway and they should qualify for relief. I am not sure if I know of any house which is over 200 years old about which one could say it did not have some artistic or architectural merit.  The very fact that a house has survived indicates that somebody at least thought it was worth preserving for the past 200 years.  That is good enough for me, and certainly it is much better than the idea of somebody in the Board of Works, at a particular moment in our current history, making such a decision.  It is a decision which has stood the test of time quite literally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a genuine problem in that this relief is confined to Dublin and is not available in other parts of Ireland.  The provisions of subsection (4) of the amendment are very dubious in that they provide that the Commissioners of Public Works can determine whether a building is any longer of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest. What criteria will be used in determining whether such a building is no longer of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest?  Presumably if the external facade of a building continues to exist, even though the building has been internally savaged, that facade will be of sufficient architectural interest <Col N="1622" /> to ensure that the tax relief cannot be withdrawn.  If that is the case it would appear that subsection (4) of the amendment is meaningless.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the appealing argument that this provision has not been abused since 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is the same as that used in 1982.  There is a clawback mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is the same as that used in 1982.  The argument that it has not been abused much in the past is not valid either because there are many tax reliefs which have lain dormant for years but when one or two accountants decided they were worth promoting in order to build up their practice they suddenly became huge tax loopholes.  It is not an excuse for bad legislation to say that similar legislation has not so far been abused on a major scale.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to Deputy McDowell's point about whether there would be any clawback of relief that was determined to have been incorrectly obtained, nor did he give any indication as to what would constitute maintenance or restoration.  It seems to me that we need to say that maintenance &mdash; and I suggest that these words should be included in the amendment &mdash; is maintenance which is consistent with the original character of the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, some entry requirement for the public should be retained.  I suggest an amendment which would redefine a qualifying building and delete all words after &ldquo;qualifying building&rdquo; at the top of page four of the <Col N="1623" /> Bill and insert the words &ldquo;means a building which is 200 years old or more&rdquo;.  If the Minister did that he could get rid of most of page five of the Bill and still achieve the effect he wants to achieve.</P>
      <P>If the Minister goes the way Deputy McDowell seems to be urging him, bringing in new areas such as Mount Brown, Stoneybatter, and all of those places &mdash; much as I would love to see Stoneybatter included in the &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;, as I used to shop there as a child &mdash; the next thing we would be hearing would be: sure, there are a few houses on the Old Cabra Road; perhaps they should be included as well?  What about the North Circular Road and all those other places where there are very interesting buildings. If one looks around the North Circular Road one will find there are some very interesting buildings there, some that are very old and a few which were built at the same time as was most of the road.  Is one to say that buildings there of particular aesthetic merit should not qualify because they happen to be on the wrong side of some arbitrarily drawn line on a map?</P>
      <P>I persist in the point with which I feel the Minister has not dealt at all, that the criterion should be age and age only; if a house or building is 200 years of age then it should qualify for tax relief wherever it is located in Ireland.  Of course, that will tend to have greater benefits in inner city areas because they are, by definition, older, have been there longer and there will be more 200-year-old buildings in inner city areas than there will be in outer suburbs.  But at least those in outer suburbs which happen to qualify will not be excluded.  If one relies on lines on a map rather than age to delimit the &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; there will be constant anomalies, complaints and the like.  I still believe the Minister should reconsider his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say there is provision for claw-back relief in 4 (b) in relation to Deputy Bruton's suggestion on maintenance commensurate with character.  I can accept that.  However, I cannot accept at this stage &mdash; without <Col N="1624" /> going into the matter in much greater detail &mdash; the question of the 200-year-old houses located countrywide.  The purpose of the scheme is to try and improve the quality of inner cities, urban areas. Endeavouring to have included 200-year-old buildings countrywide is off-side with the objectives of the scheme.  I could not accept that at all.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's earlier question with regard to the Office of Public Works, I recognise they have an adjudication role under the provisions of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982.  I have never heard any complaints about them.  I do not accept that they would be open to all sorts of bribery and abuse with regard to their decisions <i>vis-à-vis</i> cultural or aesthetic merit.  Who is better qualified to so decide?  For example, is the Deputy thinking of listing local authorities and advocating that they decide?  I would not accept that proposition either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly examine all the pitfalls of the age criterion. However, I have mentioned a few off the top of my head that would totally defeat the purpose of the scheme.  Within reason I accept the argument with regard to maintenance in respect of which claw-back relief is available.  I should have thought that Members would have been interested in seeing people being attracted to returning to live in the inner city.  That is the purpose of the scheme. I am surprised if that is not acceptable. However, I will take any reasonable suggestion on board, as I have done on the question of maintenance.  I could not accept the 200-year-old criterion at this stage.  However, I will examine it between now and Report Stage but I do foresee a lot of pitfalls in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we have been critical of the proposal as set out in the amendment.  Primarily that criticism emanates from the fact that this is a prime example of something which should have <Col N="1625" /> been published a week or two ago, allowing some time for public reaction, enabling Members some opportunity of examining the circumstances for which they are legislating, affording them an opportunity to consider its implications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, if one changes the character of a Georgian house and turns in into flats&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am interested in is the proposition that I buy a house in, say, North Great Georges Street.  I refurbish it at considerable expense to myself and get 50 per cent relief over five years.  Surely then I am in a position to apply to Dublin Corporation for permission to turn it into offices?  If I get that permission and say it is too big for me to live in, that by 1991 I will not even be able to repay the running costs; if I receive permission from An Bord Pleanála to restore it to its former state I can sell it as a principal private dwelling &mdash; that is, if I do not get planning permission for it &mdash; getting relief for capital gains tax purposes.  In the meantime I have also received income tax relief on the expenditure incurred to make that capital gain. Alternatively, I can convert the building into offices and be recouped my investment expenditure out of my income.  Perhaps the second point is not such a good one.  Perhaps if I owned the property and was going to convert it into offices I would not be bothered with the residence stipulation since there are so many other concessions available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> I am not happy with the provisions of the scheme because it would appear to me they will apply to so few people. Perhaps it would have been wiser for the Minister to say that residential property tax would not apply to these houses. Would the Minister think about exempting those houses from residential property tax?  For example, I saw a gentleman buying a house in Saint Stephen's Green the other day for £800,000.  If he is liable to £12,000 residential property tax thereon, that is an awful lot of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  But if one were to buy a large Georgian house in a designated area and expose oneself to that kind of tax, this kind of incentive would not be of very much use.</P>
      <P>Additionally, if there is to be a tax subsidy for expenditure on refurbishment, if one decides that is to be done on the basis of the aesthetic value of the house to start with, it would seem to me that one should at least get some value for money in terms of ensuring, for the community, that the expenditure actually improved the house, rendering it more aesthetic rather than less so.  That is the one apsect that worried me.  How can the Commissioners of Public Works go to a house in, say, Henrietta Street which I have bought and am busily converting &mdash; installing facilities such as saunas, jacuzzis in the middle of large rooms &mdash; and say it has ceased to be of architectural significance from the outside?  It would be of architectural significance but I am free to put bars or discos into it; I am free to change the whole thing into a kind of high class boudoir, or bordello, nobody can criticise my taste or anything, and I have got tax relief for all of that.  At the end of the operation I have ruined a good house at the expense of the taxpayer.  It is an extraordinary proposition but, if the Minister were happy with it, I could go ahead.</P>

      <P>I have accepted the <Col N="1627" /> Deputy's point in relation to maintenance.

If there are any reasonable suggestions as to how this scheme can be improved, I shall be quite open to them between now and Report Stage.  I believe in the scheme; the claw-backs and protections are there.  We should be doing everything possible to attract people to resume living in the inner city area.  That is the main purpose of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Privacy is something which the Government goes to great lengths to provide for themselves.  All too frequently individuals in their dealings with Government and their agencies are required to discuss very private, even intimate matters, within earshot and within view of other members of the public.  This is not as a result of deliberate policy; it merely arises from a lack of thought.  The problem is that lack of thought at the critical time when particular office accommodation is being designed and planned or acquired frequently makes it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reverse the physical arrangements which occasion the invasion of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> The intention of this Bill is to give all relevant Departments of State and agencies, local authorities and health boards one year to ensure that interviews of a personal nature should be conducted in a manner and at a place which guards against overhearing or visual observance by other members of the public.  Because of the passage of time since the circulation of the Bill it will be necessary on Committee Stage to amend the date of implementation from June 1989 to June 1990.  However, in recognition of the physical difficulties, it allows the Minister for Finance to exempt specified offices for one year thereafter or, in very special circumstances, for two years thereafter. In other words, even where there are special difficulties all designated public offices would have to meet the requirements of this Bill, without exception, within three years.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers offices of (a) the Revenue Commissioners, including PAYE inspectors and offices of the Collector General; (b) social welfare offices, including labour exchanges and Garda stations acting as labour exchanges; (c) health centres and health board offices; (d) local authority offices, including rent offices, rent assessment and loans and grants repayments offices, offices involving complaints between neighbours, and offices dealing with housing and housing transfer applications; (e) ESB payments offices and (f) any other public offices designated by the Minister in regulations. The Bill also provides power to extend its provisions to private agencies providing public services, for example, sub post offices, banks and credit unions.</P>
    <P>The rights of members of the public in their dealings with the public services, have steadily improved over the years. The reform of the public service was initiated by my colleague, Deputy John Boland, during his term as Minister for the Public Service.  The improvements which he introduced have been followed by further improvements introduced under the present Government.  I think it would be worthwhile to list the sort of improvements that have taken place in the past five years: (1) in 1983 the then <Col N="1630" /> Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, required all public servants, serving at hatches, to wear name badges so that members of the public knew the official with whom they were dealing so that they could report any hostile treatment or when they came back for further dealings they knew for whom to ask; (2) Deputy Boland also required all public servants in communication with members of the public, by letter or on the telephone, to give their names and rank; (3) Deputy Boland also introduced the Ombudsman's Act which has given considerable protection to members of the public against maladministration in the public services; (4) the Data Protection Bill was introduced by the present Minister last year &mdash; now the Data Protection Act &mdash; to protect personal information about members of the public in data banks; and (5) the Revenue Commissioners in recent weeks have published their Charter of Rights for taxpayers.</P>
    <P>These are most welcome developments and in a sense what this Bill seeks to do &mdash; although its publication long pre-dates it &mdash; is to extend that charter of rights to all public offices.  The Revenue Commissioners' Charter of Rights sums up the situation under the following headings: (1) courtesy and consideration; (2) presumption of honesty; (3) information; (4) impartiality; (5) privacy and confidentiality; (6) independent review; (7) compliance costs; and (8) consistent administration.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this charter is for the Revenue Commissioners to discharge their public duty in a manner which fosters the highest degree of public confidence in their integrity, efficiency and fairness.  I believe the Revenue Commissioners are to be commended on their initiative in this respect, and I hope that they and all other public Departments and agencies will speedily embrace the letter and the spirit of the provisions of the Bill now before the House.  This would be an important step as it is normal practice in Ireland for taxpayers to discuss their private tax affairs at a hatch right beside the queue for the hatch. <Col N="1631" /> There is a double embarrassment involved, first, those in the queue are frequently embarrassed by having to listen to the personal affairs of others being interviewed at the hatch and, secondly, they do so in the knowledge that when their own turn comes their business too will be overheard.</P>
    <P>Similarly, local authority tenants are usually required to discuss their rent arrears &mdash; and the reasons for them &mdash; in front of a queue of people within three or four feet.  This is especially the case in the new civic offices at Dublin's Wood Quay which only opened in the past year. When the reason for the arrears arise from problems of an intimate nature within families, for example, alcoholism, incest, desertion, moneylending or bereavement, it will be readily appreciated how extensive and how humiliating the invasion of privacy can be.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that it is not merely the hard case which is affected by the invasion of privacy.  In the main, ordinary individuals, even without the stressful circumstances which I have just exemplified, who have cause to discuss in public offices matters of a personal or confidential nature will be guaranteed the right of privacy.  This is a two-fold right, first, against overhearing and, secondly, against visual observance.</P>
    <P>Overhearing arises frequently because of the use of hatches in public offices. There are several examples, even in hospitals where cubicles or offices partitioned by thin walls or curtains can allow overhearing of very private business. Likewise, individuals in stressful circumstances who can be observed visually may have their privacy invaded in like degree.  I have very frequently, in the course of my duties as a public representative, witnessed situations in which members of the public broke down with emotion when discussing their problems with officials in situations made much worse by the fact that a queue of people had observed their distress.  Moreover, where members of the public strongly dispute official rulings they are put at an enormous disadvantage if they are being <Col N="1632" /> visually observed, and even more so if they are being overheard.</P>
    <P>In recent years these problems have been greatly exacerbated by security screens now so ubiquitously necessary. These screens usually make it necessary for officials and public alike raise their voices so that they can be heard, hence a wider overhearing has now emerged. This is a regrettable but necessary development.  We have now in public offices the necessity for security screens because of the way in which law and order has broken down and because of the physical abuse to which many public officials have been subjected.  The presence of those screens has added to the problems.  Public Departments, like banks and like petrol filling stations, have had to respond to the growing crime and assault problem so in post offices also these security screens have had to be provided.  That was a quick and ready response to a very real problem, but it has worsened another very real problem of invasion of privacy.</P>
    <P>This Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations to guard against this infringement in public offices. It is deliberately drafted in this way so that the Minister has the power to take on board any practical difficulties which may arise from place to place.  I acknowledge that in some places, especially older offices, there may be some physical difficulties, some particular difficulties in particular offices.  It is only right that the Minister should have the power, under certain circumstances, to delay full implementation of the provisions of the Bill for a further year, or, in exceptional circumstances, a further two years.  Three years is sufficient time to give all public offices the opportunity to adjust.  People may ask what the cost will be and that is a very fair question.  By its nature, it is a very difficult question to answer.  It is like trying to answer the question: &ldquo;What is the length of a piece of string?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From my own observation in Dublin, it would cost very little to make the sort of provisions in our public offices and public Departments that have been made in the United Kingdom which I visited <Col N="1633" /> before I circulated this Bill last year.  For instance, in the United Kingdom in every labour exchange there are private rooms for in-depth interviews with applicants. Those interviews are not conducted at hatches which, unfortunately, is all too frequently the case in this country.  I have had many complaints from individuals on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit about the humiliating embarrassment to which they were subjected in front of queues impatiently waiting for their turn to be reached.  I have had many complaints from people in those queues who have been embarrassed by having to listen to the explanation from an unemployment assistance applicant of why he and his wife are on separate payments, why he and his wife separated and when, and when they came back together again and why.  This is the reality in many of our labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>It is not part of my contention that that was deliberate, manifestly, it was not. There is nobody in the House, in this or in past Governments, no senior civil servant who, with malice aforethought, designed our labour exchanges, our rent collection offices, our rent assessment offices and tax offices, but the end result of the design, of the lack of thought, is that there is widespread infringement of privacy, so much so that many people would rather forego their rights than suffer the humiliation and embarrassment that they have observed being inflicted on others.</P>
    <P>Even if there is a good deal of cost, this is a proposal which must be taken on board.  I do not believe there will be considerable cost.  I believe that reasonable arrangements can be made very easily in most public offices.  I have in mind, for instance, the new civic offices in Dublin, on the famous Wood Quay site, designed and built in recent years and only open about a year or two.  If you are unlucky enough to have a rent assessment or rent arrears problem, or a problem in relation to a housing application, a housing purchase, a loan or grant application, a loan and grant repayment, loan and grant arrears, you must discuss your problem at a hatch, through <Col N="1634" /> a security screen in most places, out loud in front of people within a few feet of you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>So it has not even that saving grace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that same building there are large public areas which are not used.  These should be converted into waiting areas so that where the interviews actually take place is distant from the queues and can be separated from visual observance from those queues where necessary, by mobile screens.  There would not be an enormous cost.</P>
      <P>In the course of preparing for this Bill, I have visited not only the United Kingdom but several of our own tax offices.  I must say that we had great sport in getting through security, but we did, just to prove the point of the total lack of privacy in so many of our tax offices.  Down in Hawkins House, for instance, on several floors, one gets out of the lift, turns right and there is a long corridor of hatches. The corridor is about four foot wide and there are about 25 or 30 hatches; they are every few feet.  Three feet away along the wall are seats where people sit waiting. These are partitioned, long offices.  It may mean moving the partitions around a bit.  It is certainly not a very thoughtful, considerate arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the cost overall is hard to quantify, it is one of these things that has to be taken on board.  Certainly the principle has to be taken on board.  We have to set out on the road to implement this reform.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of the Bill on Second Stage, I will, of course, be open to accepting reasonable amendments on Committee Stage.  Given the Minister's record and that of his Minister of State, they are likely to adopt that approach and I have every confidence they will do so.  Likewise I have no doubt that all the other parties in this House will support the principle of this Bill on Second Stage and I am prepared to discuss on the later Stages any amendments which may be necessary to provide against excessive cost or to graduate the cost over a longer <Col N="1635" /> period than is proposed by the Bill, provided it does not lead to excessive delay.</P>
    <P>What prompted this Bill was an experience I had regarding a woman who became a deserted wife.  After years of harassment, beating and neglect by her husband who provided very little out of his income for the support of her and of their several children, he eventually deserted her and she was left with enormous arrears of local authority rent based on his total income which she never saw, and she was now the subject of a court order for eviction arising out of those arrears.  The court case had already taken place, the sheriff's pink notice for eviction had issued.  This was to take place within weeks.  The purpose of the visit was to go in and discuss with the rent supervisor in his new, beautiful civic offices, which are a great improvement on the offices that went before, this woman's dilemma and difficulty and the reasons she should not be levied with all those arrears or, if she was to be levied with them, at least why she should be given a reasonable time to pay them having regard to her present income.  I am not going into the more specific details of the case but they were harrowing, intimate and offensive.  We went to look for the supervisor, a very considerate man.  I asked if there was nowhere we could discuss this problem except in front of the queue at this hatch and through this glass screen.  He said unfortunately there was not.  I refused to discuss the individual case in front of the queue two feet from us because of the circumstances, so we had to leave the queue and let the supervisor get on with the rest of those waiting there.  It was only when the queue was ended and the doors already locked, that we could discuss the lady's problems. However, that was not before we had heard unwillingly and observed unwillingly the harrowing details of the problems of those other people in that queue. What is more, alongside that queue were four or five other parallel queues at four or five parallel hatches.  I invite any Member of this House who is not familiar with the Dublin civic offices, sometimes <Col N="1636" /> called the bunker, to go and visit the rent assessment office, the rent collection office and the &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; office where people have to come in to talk about their homelessness, what accommodation might be available to them and explain the reason for their homelessness. Nobody who has observed what happens there could but strongly support the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>However, the problem is not confined to Dublin Corporation civic offices.  It is extensive.  I was at the funeral this morning of the late and revered Deputy Frank Cluskey and afterwards several colleagues and former colleagues came to me and said, &ldquo;I heard you on the radio this morning describing your Bill&rdquo; and I found myself nodding in agreement: &ldquo;That is just the way it is in Limerick&rdquo; or &ldquo;that is the way it is in Cork&rdquo; or &ldquo;that is the way it is in Galway&rdquo;.  That is just the way it is in so many public offices. Obviously it would be an exaggeration to say that is the way it is in all public offices. That is manifestly not the case, but I decided that day in those offices which had been open for only a few months at the time &mdash; this was the first rent arrears case of a serious nature that I was dealing with since their opening &mdash; to do something about it.  I made inquiries as to the provisions of the law and the practice in different Departments and in other countries.  I decided then to propose to my colleagues on the Front Bench and in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party that we should promote a Bill, which turns out to be the Bill before the House, the Public Offices (Privacy of Interviews) Bill.</P>
    <P>I know we can be emotive about issues and in our emotion magnify the problem and get it out of context.  I know also that to generalise from a specific case is often dangerous, but I am satisfied, having gone around many tax offices, labour exchanges and local authority offices in this city and having spoken to many of my colleagues from around the country, that the problem is significant, that its resolution would be widely welcomed by people of all classes, social status and political persuasions.  That is why I am <Col N="1637" /> absolutely confident that the principle of this Bill will enjoy the widespread and, I hope, unaminous support of the House.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact, as I have said, that there has been significant progress in the last five years both under this Government and the last Government. It is right to give credit where credit is due.  The Data Protection Act enacted under the present Government is an advance, a protection of rights.  It is a guarantee of confidentiality to persons, many of whose personal details are in data banks.  Likewise the initiative of the Revenue Commissioners is a development which is and should be warmly welcomed by all concerned.  The Ombudsman Act preceded it, as I have said.  The right of individuals to know the name and rank of the public official with whom they are dealing is also a very welcome development.  This Bill can be seen as the next step in that progress all of which has enjoyed the support of all sides of this House.  It is not a party political Bill; it is a non-political Bill to protect all of us and all those we represent. Usually people go to public offices only when they have a problem.  Frequently that problem is tricky, difficult and personal.  Nobody would begrudge the expenditure over a period of whatever money is necessary to provide the minimum amount of privacy to which people are entitled.  It is in that context that I strongly recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>If you are agreeable, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to share the rest of my time with my colleague, Deputy Monica Barnes.  I ask the Minister and all the other parties to support the Bill.  I would certainly be open to constructive amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for agreeing to allow me to contribute on this fundamentally important matter.  It may be a small Bill in terms of its size and complexity, although I am sure the Minister believes it is not a small Bill in regard to its financial implications.  If we really want to work towards a society where there are egalitarian standards and which allows dignity to the individual, regardless of class or financial independence, we have no option but to take up this Bill and work towards its implementation.</P>
      <P>I will have occasion at another time to decry the building of the new civic offices in Dublin.  Despite the damage to the history and foundations of Dublin, it is a great disappointment to learn that these civic offices did not take into account at the planning stage the needs of the people going there.  Most of those people go in desperation with deep personal problems. It is not simply a matter of ensuring that we change conditions in the present offices.  The Minister is not directly responsible for environmental matters, but perhaps planning permission should not be given for civic and public offices dealing with the people's problems unless private facilities are built into them.  We are not talking about some privilege or some extra luxury facilities.  We are talking about the fundamental rights of a democratic society in which the two basic tenets are the right to information and the right of the individual to human dignity and personal privacy when some of that information is being passed on, particularly when it is of a personal and private nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Members present come from smaller communities outside urban Dublin.  The last thing we want in small communities is for everybody to know everything about us.  In rural areas there is not the crowed anonymity which one might get in Dublin.  I come from a rural background and there are very proud people in those communities who, rather than allow themselves to be embarrassed <Col N="1639" /> in front of neighbours, will not seek the rights and facilities which they desperately need.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the reform which has taken place in the Department of Social Welfare.  However, there is no way we can build a fairer society than by giving dignity and support to social welfare recipients if there is embarrassment, humilitation and an exposing of people's most personal and painful problems.  Dignity and privacy must be an integral part of the reform of health care and social welfare.</P>
    <P>We are aware that in Dublin and some rural areas there are law courts where important consultations about the future of a person's life have to take place in front of family members, even children, on footpaths or in the toilets because no other facility is available.  On the one hand we say we are building a just and caring society, yet on the other hand we have built into the system a disparaging of people's feelings and a loss of sensitivity about what people have to go through, particularly in these devastating and traumatic cases.  If we are saying that we cannot afford dignity and full rights we are saying we cannot afford a real democracy. It is as fundamental as that.</P>
    <P>The staff cope with an inadequate system which must put huge stress on them.  This at times must force them into being unnecessarily curt or frustrated and impatient because of their difficult working conditions.  Two things must happen. One of the reforms brought forward by the former Minister, Deputy John Boland, was that the responsibility of information and the counselling needed by people in a distressed state should not lie on the shoulders of young, inexperienced and unskilled junior clerical staff.  It is totally unfair to put a burden on them which would be demanding and draining for people in more senior positions, mature people who have a sense of wisdom, compassion and experience of life.  Staff with skills in conflict resolution who can deal with a very angry or frustrated person must be available as well as facilities for private discussion in the <Col N="1640" /> type of offices described.  We should also take into consideration the special training and the status to be accorded to the staff who are dealing with that because if we denigrate that job we are denigrating the people who are looking for the service. This is all tied up with the basics of human rights.  Under this Bill a great number of our citizens because they would get the private and confidential information they seek in those offices, would not have to have recourse, as they do at this stage, to the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman and his staff would not be as overburdened as they are if we provided the privacy and the facilities to deal with these problems at base.  In regard to the disadvantaged, who are the majority of the people who have to have recourse to offices and information like this, the provision of these facilities would be an investment that would pay off, and it must start now.  The fact that these facilities do not exist now shows a lack of insight and sensitivity to the people we have been dealing with up to now.  If we feel that what is available at the moment is good enough for such people, we are really saying that is all they deserve.  The vulnerable in our society need more support, privilege, luxury and privacy than those of us who have the independence, the self esteem and the pride not to be overcome or to feel threatened by circumstances that would embarrass others. I know and expect that the Minister, when he has taken all this into consideration, will respond positively to this Bill tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Chomhairle, the Government, while subscribing fully to the motives which inspired Deputy Mitchell's Bill, cannot support the proposed legislation for the various reasons which I will outline to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government readily accept the general principle of ensuring privacy for individuals being interviewed on matters of a personal nature at public Department and offices.  Progress is being and has been made in public authorities <Col N="1641" /> around the country and I will outline in more detail examples of the type and scope of private facilities available later on.</P>
    <P>It is also accepted that in many instances more remains to be done particularly in the Department of Social Welfare. However, the Government believe that the best way to approach the issue of privacy in public offices is in the context of a general on-going improvement in the quality of service to the public.  This will have to be achieved in the context of its policy of giving Departments and agencies more not less, discretion in the management of their own budgets for running costs to which the Minister for Finance referred in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>Local managers are in daily contact with their client groups and as such are best placed to determine the facilities required in Departments and local offices consistent with efficiency, courtesy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation along the lines proposed by Deputy Mitchell would have the effect of forcing local management to devote resources to privacy facilities at the expense of expenditure on other operational requirements to which they might accord a higher priority.</P>
    <P>Because of its broadness, the measures in the Bill would also be likely to raise general expectations and encourage frivolous demands for privacy which, although ultimately unsustainable, might well create delays and general inconvenience. This would be particularly true in Revenue and Social Welfare offices which have large client groups.  The Bill acknowledges this dilemma.  By requiring that agencies need only comply with the proposed legislation &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;, it gives rise to risks of further confusion and delays for the public which, I am sure, were never intended.</P>
    <P>Most day-to-day business conducted between members of the public and public authorities can be described as personal, private or confidential in nature. While much of this is routine and might be outside the scope of the proposed legislation, there is still a substantial <Col N="1642" /> number of contacts which would fall within the terms of the Bill.  Within the context of the Bill, the Departments with the largest numbers of daily clients are the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I propose now to outline the background against which these agencies operate, the measures they have taken to date in regard to privacy and their plans for future progress.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Revenue Commissioners, it is particularly true to say that nearly all personal callers wish to discuss personal, private or confidential matters.  However, let me put the implications of the Bill in perspective as regards the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have 270 public offices throughout the country dealing with tax and customs and excise matters.  On the tax side alone there are more than one million employees paying PAYE, about 100,000 registered employers and 115,000 VAT traders.</P>
    <P>In addition there are approximately 180,000 self-employed persons on the record and 60,000 companies.  In the Dublin area, more than 450,000 employees call regarding their personal income tax to the tax office every year. The Collector General deals with another 150,000 personal callers every year.  It is important to remember that the great majority of these callers come in without appointment and are dealt with on the spot.  This is the level of service the Irish taxpayer has come to expect and which he-she is entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>Clearly the procedures and facilities for dealing with such numbers have to achieve a balance between conducting the business with privacy and confidentiality and providing a fast, effective service which disposes of the taxpayer's problem while he-she is at the counter.</P>
    <P>In the generality of cases, this is achieved to the satisfaction of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Most callers are dealt with at the public counter but where more complex or sensitive matters have to be discussed, or where the taxpayer requests it, interview <Col N="1643" /> facilities away from the public counter area are generally available.</P>
    <P>I now wish to outline some of the developments that the Revenue Commissioners have already undertaken, and will undertake in the future, which will maintain and improve on the high level of service provided to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In 1988, the Revenue Commissioners initiated an innovative means of dealing with 165,000 PAYE taxpayers with the opening of a PAYE local inquiry office in Mount Street in Dublin.  The office is open all day from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. including lunchtime.  There are special facilities for the disabled.  The use of modern technology and the highly developed computer systems of the Revenue Commissioners make it possible for most queries to be dealt with at the computer terminal before the taxpayer leaves the office.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of opening that office.  I was able to quote my own tax number and have my information given to me there and then at the counter, and I was very impressed indeed.  This local inquiry office in Dublin has been recently supplemented by a similar inquiry office in Kilkenny.  It is the intention to establish more and more of these &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; local inquiry offices with the twin aims of improving service to the public and the efficient use of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>In the Collector General's office in Dublin, a centralised inquiry office is being set up which will meet the needs of personal callers, who are mainly employers and traders, where all questions relating to payment of PAYE-PRSI, VAT, income tax or corporation tax will be dealt with in a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a central inquiry office where all aspects of a taxpayer's business can be dealt with, has been under consideration for some time. However, due to the current difficult economic circumstances and because of the very high cost involved, the implementation of this project has been, regrettably, deferred.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners and their staff have always been conscious of, and <Col N="1644" /> have provided for, the entitlement of taxpayers to privacy and confidentiality.  The recently launched charter of rights for persons in their dealings with the Revenue Commissioners contained a formal acknowledgment of this entitlement and a commitment by the commissioners that their staff would continue to observe this right in dealing with taxpayers' affairs. The relevant section of the charter reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Privacy and Confidentiality &mdash; (In your dealings with the Revenue Commissioners) you are entitled to expect that personal and business information provided by you will be treated in strict confidence and used only for purposes allowed by law.</P>
    <P>This statement is an earnest of the Revenue Commissioners' and the Government's commitment to privacy and confidentiality for persons in their dealings with public organisations.</P>
    <P>The charter of rights was welcomed by the major bodies representing those who have a lot of dealings with Revenue.  The vast majority of staff and the trade unions have also welcomed the charter of rights. Poster versions of the charter in Irish and English are on display at Revenue's 270 public offices throughout the country &mdash; 106 tax offices and 164 Customs and Excise offices.  Leaflet versions of the charter are available in dispensers to members of the public in all public offices.  Full page newspaper advertising was used to promote the message of the charter.  Training courses are being provided for staff within the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise in all aspects of the charter.</P>
    <P>In short, the Revenue Commissioners are taking all steps open to them within the financial constraints of the current difficult economic circumstances, to ensure that members of the public in their dealings with the Revenue can conduct their business expeditiously, with complete confidentiality, with full respect for their dignity and in a pleasant and friendly atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The position in the Department of Social Welfare is that members of the <Col N="1645" /> public have access to officials of the Department to discuss matters arising from services provided by the Department at 50 employment exchanges and one control office, 79 branch employment offices, 101 offices of social welfare officers, five public information offices and 113 signing centres and Garda stations around the country.</P>
    <P>At employment exchanges alone, the Department of Social Welfare see around 110,000 clients on a weekly basis.  Offices accept new claims, decide claims, carry out signing functions, pay unemployment benefit and assistance and review claims. Much of the work at the exchanges could be considered to be of a routine nature and as such might be exempted under the terms of the Deputy's Bill.  However, taking new claims, review interviews, etc.  Would definitely fall within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Overall at the present time, only the offices of the 101 social welfare officers and a limited number of exchanges provide the type of privacy facilities which I think Deputy Mitchell has in mind, that is, facilities which protect against overhearing or visual observance by other members of the public.  A massive capital investment would be necessary if Social Welfare were to attempt to fully meet the terms of the Bill and even then there are offices, for instance some branch employment offices, where it would just not be feasible to provide the facilities required.</P>
    <P>Having said this, however, improvements are being made in all new offices and where possible in offices being extended and refurbished.  I recommended to Deputy Jim Mitchell, and indeed to any other Member of this House or the Upper House, that they visit the new exchange in Nutgrove Shopping Centre in Rathfarnham or, when he is next in the west, the new exchange in Galway city to see what is being achieved. Indeed, the new exchange in Ballyfermot in the Deputy's own constituency, which is due to be completed this year, will incorporate full privacy facilities.</P>
    <P>The programme of improvement of <Col N="1646" /> social welfare offices is a long term programme and the Government are satisfied that the Department of Social Welfare, together with the Office of Public Works as appropriate, are making every effort within available resources to improve the overall level of service, including the provision of privacy facilities, to the public.  I should point out, however, that there is no prospect of the type of improvement sought by Deputy Jim Mitchell being introduced within the timescale envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, let me briefly run through the arrangements for privacy which already exist in some of the other agencies specifically mentioned in the Bill.  In the Department of Health, the office of the general registrar of births, deaths and marriages is the principal office to which members of the public attend for services.  The main requests are for copies of births, deaths or marriage certificates.  These are dealt with at public counters.  These requests are, in the main, of a routine nature but where cases of a confidential nature arise, facilities are available for private discussion.</P>
    <P>Any confidential matters which a caller to the Department may wish to discuss, e.g. cruelty to or sexual abuse of children, may likewise be discussed with an official in complete privacy.</P>
    <P>In the health boards routine matters arising with members of the public are dealt with at public counters or hatches. Confidential matters are dealt with in complete privacy.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Government are satisfied that the existing arrangements in force for dealing with confidential matters arising from the provisions of the health services are more than adequate and consider that a statutory framework to govern these matters is not warranted.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour operate an information unit to deal with inquiries from the public about their rights under legislation administered by them.  A large percentage of inquiries in 1988 related to redundancy and holiday entitlements and dismissals.  During 1988, there was an average of 166 inquiries each day.  Of <Col N="1647" /> these about 15 per cent were from personal callers.  Given the personal nature of the majority of these inquiries, the Department of Labour have a facility whereby personal callers can conduct the inquiries in total privacy &mdash; the need for such a facility was recognised by the Department at an early stage in the operation of the information unit.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, members of the public will generally approach FAS for information by calling to their training centres or employment services offices.  In most cases the initial inquiry will simply be seeking information in regard to training courses, job vacancies or temporary employment schemes.  Such inquiries can be dealt with without the necessity to conduct matters in private.  In the event that a private interview is required, there are facilities in all FÁS training centres to conduct a private discussion.  The same situation prevails in the FÁS employment services offices.</P>
    <P>On the establishment of FÁS, it was recognised that many of the employment services offices needed to be upgraded in keeping with the direction given to FÁS by the Minister for Labour to develop a more client-centred orientation for all their services.  Many of the poorer quality offices inherited by FÁS have been replaced by more suitable premises and/or will be modernised and refurbished. This is the case right across the country, both in Dublin and in all the provincial centres.  In all instances the prime objective of FÁS in this regard is to enable FÁS clients to transact their business with dignity, efficiency and in circumstances appropriate to the situation.</P>
    <P>In the larger offices of the ESB, a private room is provided near the customer contact area where sensitive matters are dealt with in confidence.  In their smaller offices, sensitive matters are attended to in the local supervisor's office and, generally, arrangements are in hand to ensure that full privacy facilities will be provided in areas where they do not already exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> During this debate, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, will outline to the House the measures in force to ensure privacy in his Department and in local authorities.  I am sure that he will inform the House of his Department's plans, which are well advanced, for the provision of a major new driving test centre in Dublin.  I understand that when it is completed, it will provide top class facilities for driver testing and will relieve any overcrowding at the other two test centres in the city.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the introduction of the legislation proposed by Deputy Mitchell would involve extra costs for the Exchequer.  I have already referred to the significant costs which would undoubtedly arise for the Department of Social Welfare.  The Deputy's definition of the nature of the business to be covered in the Bill is so wide that even taking account of his provision to exclude business of a routine or perfunctory nature, the attendant costs are likely to be very significant indeed.</P>
    <P>While the bulk of these costs are likely to arise in relation to the Department of Social Welfare, other Departments and agencies are likely to incur heavy expenditure as well to ensure that the potential demand could be met.  To take one small example, where privacy facilities are provided away from the main area of activity in an office, it will be necessary, under section 5 of the proposed legislation, to install security features such as alarms to provide for the safety of staff.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill also makes provision for an appeals mechanism.  This proposal would undoubtedly involve the provision of extra staff across the public service to process appeals.  As such, it is completely at variance with Government policy which is aimed at reducing public service numbers.  The Deputy's Bill makes no reference to these extra costs.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that it would be quite wrong and indeed inconvenient to the general public, to give individuals a statutory right to conduct certain business in private without taking account of <Col N="1649" /> the degree to which financial resources were available to facilitate the exercise of that right.</P>
    <P>This Bill as presented to us proposes to do just that and in effect would compel the Government to increase public expenditure.  Coming from the Opposition side of the House, the Government find this proposal to increase expenditure, in what is essentially an administrative area which is already receiving attention, wholly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Looking at the text of the Bill, I also conclude that, as drafted, it is totally unworkable in practice.  Subsection (1) of section 4 gives a right to privacy to any caller at a public office in respect of business &ldquo;of a personal, private or confidential nature&rdquo; while subsection (2) expresses the intention that business of a routine nature be excluded.  How could any public official manning a public office be expected to comply with such vague legislation?  The official would have to exercise discretion.  Such discretion would, of necessity, be exercisable by busy junior officials.  It would make no material change in the present situation and would therefore be unworkable.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy says and the spirit of what she says.  It would be wonderful if we could have senior officials to deal with every individual who comes to the hatch.  The Deputy will agree that on many occasions people come to the hatch looking for application forms.  Surely we must have a system whereby people are trained to respond to the public and if necessary a senior official can be called.  As in any organisation, public or private, senior officials have responsible duties and have to make decisions.  They can be on call when needed but cannot always be available.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, section 4, subsection (3) (a) only obliges public agencies to observe the guidelines on privacy &mdash; I quote &mdash;&ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  How can such a provision be construed as an obligation? It would not improve the present situation in any way.  In these circumstances, the cost of implementing the bureaucratic procedures involving the making of regulations, exemptions, appeals, monitoring, etc.  which would be required to give effect to this Bill otherwise would be nugatory and difficult to justify at any time for such a dubious return.  Such additional costs are unthinkable at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> I note that in the media publicity surrounding this debate, it has been suggested that this Bill, if enacted, will remove hatches in public offices.  Let me make it quite clear to the House that the proposed legislation will not have this effect.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's colleague, former Minister for the Public Service in the previous Administration, Deputy John Boland, sought to remove hatches in all public offices as part of the campaign to provide a better service to the public &mdash; a campaign which is still in operation.  I commend Deputy Boland for the work he did in this area.  For very good reasons of security, Deputy Boland was forced to accept a situation which fell short of his original plans and the relevant section in the White Paper on the Public Service reflected that position.  It said:</P>
    <P>Where possible, hatches are being removed in public offices.  Where it is necessary to retain them they will be improved and modernised to ensure efficiency, courtesy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>This is still the position and provisions of the Deputy's Bill would in no way alter the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell in his opening address acknowledged that the work initiated by Deputy Boland is still continuing under the present Government and will continue.  Where new facilities are being provided, be they purpose built facilities or renovated office facilities, we are striving to provide the best modern facility possible in the most private environment and atmosphere.</P>
    <P>In fact, if anything, section 5 of the Bill would have the effect of reinforcing the hatch system since it would oblige Departments or agencies to have regard to the safety of their personnel and requirements of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>The Deputy's interpretation of what I say is very harsh.  I am making the point that the Bill makes it mandatory that these security obligations would be carried out.  I am saying that we cannot sustain that kind of extra mandatory expenditure.</P>
      <P>In summary, much progress has been made in recent years in upgrading the general level of service to the public by our public service agencies.  This having been said, however, the situation in relation to privacy is not perfect, nor does the Government claim that it is. However, it is worth noting that all the measures I have mentioned have been introduced without legislation and with minimal disruption of service to the general public.  These improvements will continue as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The best way forward on this issue is through the normal administrative processes of public authorities and indeed this debate will serve as a further reminder to Departments and their agencies of their obligations to pay particular attention to the privacy issue in their public offices.  Whatever the outcome of this second reading debate, I will be pleased to bring the views expressed by Deputies in the House to the attention of all Ministers with a request for a renewal of efforts to improve customer service at public offices across the public service as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The Government believe firmly that legislation to achieve these very desirable improvements is simply not necessary. We are convinced that the same objectives &mdash; to which, of course, we fully subscribe &mdash; can be met by other means. I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Mitchell for his initiative and commitment. He has highlighted the situation that exists in certain offices and has brought it to the attention of this House. We will strive with might and main and with all the resources at our disposal to improve facilities for the public at large but we cannot make it mandatory to incur expenditure out of resources that presently do not exist.  Accordingly, and regretfully, we oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will be very brief.  I would find it very difficult to oppose the principle of the Bill.  Those who have to frequent establishments as mentioned in the Schedule to the Bill are obliged to declare, under appalling conditions in both Government and health offices throughout the country, matters which they consider private and confidential.  People are hesitant to go to such places, knowing that their business transactions are exposed to everybody, are within easy earshot.  This is humiliating.  It often causes people who are in real need of help not to seek that help.  Of course, the real problem must be attributed to Governments down through the years who embarked on the practice of renting rather than erecting purpose built premises, specifically designed premises to bring about more efficiency, to facilitate staff and to ensure that the interview area is planned to allow for confidentiality.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Finance and assigned to the Board of Works I availed of the opportunity to have erected at Sullivans' Quay in Cork Government buildings which were planned and designed to bring all Government services under one roof, thus facilitating the general public as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I never agreed with the practice of Government buildings at exorbitant rents, not to mention the substantial sums of moneys spent in altering these various premises which were never to the satisfaction of the staff and general public.  I want to emphasise this point because, having been a Minister assigned to the Office of Public Works, I know that a Government Department would ring and say they were in urgent need of a premises in order to facilitate a particular service. Immediately the Office of Public Works people would drive around in search of a suitable premises.  What a waste of taxpayers' money.  I can well appreciate what the Minister has said tonight, that because of financial restraints it is not possible to erect purpose built premises but we should look to the future.  I hope the mover of the Bill will give this matter consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Privacy in Government offices is nil. At this stage no matter what efforts are made by the staff concerned we cannot alter existing buildings.  However, I make a very special appeal tonight to the executive officers in Government offices that in so far as it is possible they should try to facilitate people where they have to make a statement outlining their financial position or matters of that nature.  An effort should be made to provide an area within the premises where people can discuss confidential matters with officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister read a fairly lengthy script which was hardly necessary.  The principle of the Bill is to try to bring about an awareness of the importance of providing the facilities necessary to ensure confidentiality at Government offices.  If one were to go into the economics of providing Government offices, one would find that there is an abuse of taxpayers' money in that area.  We are renting premises knowing that they have not the necessary facilities for administering the services.  When I was assigned to the Board of Works I saw the opportunity of providing the Revenue Commissioners in Cork with a suitable premises when they were seeking accommodation and I took the opportunity to prove to some people the importance of building office accommodation where we could house all Government services under one roof rather than saying to somebody to go half a mile down the road to another office.  This arrangement, as well as bringing about more efficiency, lends itself to the principle of this Bill which is the question of confidentiality.  I appeal to the Government to proceed in this way in future.</P>
    <P>I was frustrated on a number of occasions when Ministers of my own Government were screaming out for premises, telling us to find them urgently. We were investing money in something that would never belong to the State and we could be there for the best part of 30 to 40 years.  In fact, we should have been building our own premises which would now be an asset to the State.  I am saying this because of my convictions on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> People have come to me complaining about the lack of any possibility of confidentiality. Deputy Mitchell outlined the case of the unfortunate woman going to a Government office where everybody could listen to her business.  The older generation are not used to this kind of thing and rather than have to go to a building where hundreds of people could listen to what they have to say, they would deprive themselves of some essential service.  We have to face this matter in a realistic fashion.  It is not possible to provide them in any of the buildings I know of where Government services are provided.  I have been through them but I believe that executive officers should try to make some part of the premises available when a person seeks privacy. This can be done even if it means a bit of tightening up here and there.  That is what the Bill seeks.</P>
    <P>To be honest the Minister went to unnecessary trouble in preparing his brief.  What we are talking about is the principle of trying to meet a need which has existed down through the years.  It cannot be met in the way the Bill envisages, but I have no doubt that we can go a long way in meeting it.  That is why I make a special plea to those in charge of Government offices to try to comply with the Bill as far as possible.  Let no one say tonight that we can enact a Bill which we know cannot be complied with.  I am in total agreement with the principle of the Bill.  Anyone who has experience of working in the Board of Works and being told about certain things happening in certain offices throughout the country knows how frustrating it is trying to meet this need in buildings which were not designed with this need in mind.</P>
    <P>I hope everyone agrees with the principle. The Deputy who moved the Bill tonight said that he was prepared to facilitate the Minister in every way possible on any amendments he may table on Committee Stage.  That is only fair but we have to be sensible and realistic.  At this stage we can only talk about making the best out of a bad job and try to facilitate those unfortunate people who <Col N="1656" /> have a right to meet officials to talk about their problems in the strictest confidence and not in the presence of others who may go on to the street afterwards and talk about what Mrs. So-and-So had to say at the office.  This need can be met if people bend and say we should try to meet the principle.  Not everybody wants to talk about their problems in strict confidence but quite a number do and we should try to meet their needs by making some area available within buildings.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which aims to provide a statutory basis in relation to privacy for members of the public during interviews of a personal nature in specified offices of public Departments and their agencies.  This Bill cannot be commended to the House as it is totally unnecessary legislation.  I firmly believe where particular problems arise in matters such as this they should be dealt with in a common-sense way without recourse to the law.  We would all accept that there is an obligation to provide for privacy in certain dealings between the public and public servants. However, this obligation can be met by good manners, a civilised approach to human relations and an understanding by public servants of the obvious requirements of privacy based on mutual respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that in my time in O'Connell Bridge House &mdash; and this is my third term &mdash; I have received no complaints from the public in regard to the transaction of the business of that office. Everybody will realise that this is a pretty busy office dealing with thousands of applications for grants and other relevant matters.  Credit must go to the staff in the building who have handled all of these cases as far as I know in a most humane way.  I am very pleased to know that.  If we were to provide private accommodation it would slow things down and if the numbers were big I would not have as much space as I would like to have.  I am glad to say that the officials of my <Col N="1657" /> Department have treated people with serious problems with sensitivity.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter for legislation which would have the effect of imposing unnecessary obligations on a number of Government Departments, including my own, local authorities, health boards, FÁS, the Electricity Supply Board and such other offices as may be designated. If the provisions of the Bill were to be fully implemented I have no doubt that considerable additional staff and accommodation costs would arise and at the same time the rigid procedures required would increase the time for dealing with individual cases and possibly lead to unnecessary delays also.  I have long experience of serving on my own local authority and the constituents I represent, both in Laois and Offaly, have never complained to me about the county councils, the health board or any official.</P>

Where improvements can be made I have no doubt that the Departments involved will be favourably disposed to making them.</P>

    <P>Section 4 states that, from the commencement date, any person who has called to engage in business of a personal, private or confidential nature at any of the offices covered by the Bill, shall have a right to insist that such a discussion shall be protected against overhearing or visual observance by other members of the public.  There is no legal definition in the Bill as to what constitutes business of a personal, private or confidential nature and, naturally, individual members of the public could put their own interpretation on these terms.  In these circumstances, <Col N="1658" /> it would be open to each and every individual who has dealings with the bodies specified to demand a totally private interview room.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister, in introducing safeguards to the business expansion scheme, introduced a series of amendments.  My amendments would restrict a company to a share capital issue of £2.5 million if it is to be eligible for business expansion scheme investment.  While I fully agree with the Minister in his attempt to redirect the business expansion scheme back to its original intent the cut-off point is too low. As I understand it, where any company issues qualifying shares after 12 April 1989 no relief shall be given for any excess over £2.5 million.  In arriving at that figure all qualifying shares issued by the company, since the advent of the scheme, are taken into account.  Consequently, no account is taken of shares issued which do not qualify for the relief because the person to whom they were issued did not qualify for relief or, alternatively, the <Col N="1659" /> individual lost part of the relief by reason of the restriction of £25,000 on any individual taxpayer.  In those circumstances, we are not talking about a business expansion scheme investment which amounts to £2.5 million but about one which would amount to £2.5 million if all shares qualified. Of course, they will not, so the section does not allow a business expansin investment of £2.5 million because some of the shares &mdash; to reach the total of £2.5 million &mdash; would not qualify for the scheme.  Therefore, the ceiling should be raised.</P>
      <P>The sum of £2.5 million in a trading house scheme &mdash; which is a legitimate one &mdash; is very low.  When I first read the section I understood that there could be an issue of £2.5 million each year but the Minister clarified this on Second Stage and said that the totality of shares issued in any company to be eligible for the business expansion scheme would be £2.5 million.  I put down an amendment to raise this sum to £5 million although there is nothing magical about that figure.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the ceiling and to raise it to what his officials and the House regard as an appropriate figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a good scheme when it was introduced but it went off the rails in recent times.  It was open to all sorts of abuses; whether by options or guarantees, the risk was taken out of it and banks started to use it as a substitute for traditional lending.  That is not the purpose of the business expansion scheme.  It was intended to get small to medium size companies off the ground. These were firms in a high risk area and no other area of traditional lending was open to them.  An analysis of the scheme up to October 1988 showed that only 12 out of the 300 companies raised amounts of over £500 million under the scheme. The £2.5 million ceiling does not, of course, prevent companies from raising non-business expansion capital above that limit from the Stock Exchange or by other means.  In addition, there is nothing to stop companies from coming together in partnership in a joint venture &mdash; or with other companies &mdash; with a view to undertaking projects which would require larger funding.  In other words, if there was a joint venture each company would be entitled to £2.5 million.  In view of the fact that only 12 out of the 300 companies raised over £500 million I am being generous in relation to a joint venture.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to get clarification of some of the provisions in the section.  Will the Minister comment on the scope of the restriction on leasing and financial activities. The leasing of plant and equipment, other than the chartering of ships, would not be regarded as qualifying trade.  The leasing of land and buildings and the carrying on of financial activities is also mentioned.  I should like to know what is the scope of the &ldquo;financial activities&rdquo; definition.

      <P>The business expansion scheme was introduced to help generate equity capital for high-risk companies in certain sectors of the economy which would otherwise have difficulty in raising such capital but which offer substantial potential for increasing employment and output.  Leasing, and other similar financing operations, which are now being excluded generally from the scheme &mdash; the International Financial Services Centre has always been excluded &mdash; are not the sort of activity which falls into this category.  Because one can often look to a tangible asset for security, it is not high risk in nature and <Col N="1662" /> the employment potential is limited relative to the resources employed.  In addition, because of the circumstances in which such activity can qualify for the BES, that is, only if it is an export service, the benefits derived by financing companies through the BES would largely flow abroad to the non-resident clients of the companies in question.  Tax relief funded by the Exchequer &mdash; that is, by the general body of taxpayers &mdash; would, in effect, flow to foreign residents without substantive benefit to the Irish economy. In the circumstances, it was decided to exclude leasing and other similar financing operations from the ambit of the business expansion scheme.</P>

Are we talking about loans, mortgages, leasing, lease rental, hire purchase, and all similar arrangements, equity investment, the factoring of debts and the discounting of bills, invoices and promissory notes, and all similar instruments, the underwriting of debt instruments and all other kinds of financial securities and the purchase or sale of financial assets?

A leasing company in the finance world that raised money under the BES &mdash; we read of some of them in recent times &mdash; could use that money, and more than likely would use it to a large extent, if not entirely, for asset financing or leasing activities in the UK or elsewhere.  In that kind of situation the benefit would flow outside the State but would be paid for by the Irish taxpayer.

Does the Minister believe that that provision is extensive enough or should some of the urban areas which are under the remit of county councils, rather than borough councils, be included?

      <P>I understand that self-catering schemes are also being stimulated by another tax driven mechanism in that 75 per cent of the capital cost can be written off over a number of years.  Will the Minister clarify the present position of that scheme?  Has the Minister any figures to suggest whether writing off the capital cost of a holiday village or the use of the BES scheme had a higher frequency when it came to erecting holiday villages?  Both schemes have been used and I wonder if the Minister has information on the other scheme.  We always talk about locking the door when the horse has bolted, but I wonder if we are locking the right door in this case.  Should we be locking a different door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible, in circumstances where a large complex is being built under the tourist provisions of the business expansion scheme, where a health centre including tennis courts, squash courts, restaurants and bars and so on was being constructed and added to it was some self-catering accommodation, to give an exception to that self-catering accommodation?  Has the Minister thought of making an exception of self-catering in those areas where it does not amount to more than 25 per cent or 30 per cent of a total project rather than having a blanket exclusion where there is <Col N="1664" /> a large project?  If such a project was on the lines I am suggesting, and if the capital cost of the self-catering element did not exceed one-third or one-quarter, that would seem to be a legitimate exception, but it would be caught under the total exclusion.  Has the Minister had such a case brought to his notice?  It has been brought to my notice and I am sure it has been brought to the notice of other spokespersons.  Will the Minister consider this matter with a view to moving an amendment on Report Stage which would allow for that exception which seems to me to be genuine?</P>

      <P>The latter comes under the areas excluded such as the County Borough of Dublin.  In the definition we have tried to tighten things up.  I do not know if a better definition exists.  Nobody would disagee that the business expansion scheme in Dublin city, and other urban areas, was being used to erect town houses, blocks of apartments and so on. It became a total tax gamble.  We wanted them excluded in the definition. Such developments are very desirable for tourism in other parts of the country, but I do not think the exemption is desirable for parts of Dublin 4.  I do not think anybody would argue with that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to move on to the other restriction which the Minister proposes to introduce.  A very large number of schemes were being offered before the end of the tax year which involved guarantees of one kind or another to people who invested in the business expansion scheme.  With regard to subsection (2A) of section 7, I think the Minister's intent is that no relief will be available on any shares which are the subject of either a put or a call option at a price other than their market value at the date on which the option is exercised. I do not understand subsection (2A) and I should like the Minister to clarify it.  It seems that the intent of the subsection (2A) is that there would be no guarantees. If one puts £25,000 into a business expansion scheme &mdash; and one is eligible and is a taxpayer at the higher marginal rates &mdash; it would cost about £10,500 or £10,600, whichever is the accurate figure. The schemes I saw on offer were by finance houses who said: &ldquo;If you leave your money in for five years it will cost you £10,500 nett but we guarantee that we will buy your shares from you at £18,750&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

I know of schemes where there was a commitment to purchase all those shares at £18,750, and I saw another scheme which suggested that the shares would be purchased at £25,000.  I presume the intent of subsection (2A) of section 7 is to remove the guarantees so that at the end of five years the value of the shares would be the market value&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Effectively, the Minister is saying in subsection (2A) that somebody cannot buy a £1 share for less than £1, and therefore cannot buy 25,000 £1 shares for less than £25,000.  So far as I can see, the section which purports to take out the guarantee, copperfastens the guarantee.  I should like the Minister to look at that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What the Minister is proposing works fine there, but on the other side, we have a scheme which encourages people to put their savings into risky ventures, which might be good for the country and for employment, and where the exposure is about £10,500 for a £25,000 investment, any agreement to purchase shares back after five years for more than £10,500 will take the risk out of it, especially the nearer one moves to £25,000.  As the section is drafted, an investment bank organising a scheme would be required to pay £25,000 for the shares after five years if the value of the shares was less than £25,000.  If that is the case, the Minister is giving a guaranteed return of over 19 per cent to an investor at the highest marginal rate of tax, but I do not think that was his intent when the section was drafted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to clarify the matters and be specific about it.  I am referring to lines 40 to 45 of subsection (2A) of section 7 on page 15 of the Bill which states:</P>
      <P>to purchase, or otherwise acquire, any eligible shares for a price which, having regard to the terms of the option or the terms of such arrangement or understanding and the net effect of those terms considered as a whole, is other than the market value of the eligible shares at the time the purchase or acquisition is made....</P>
      <P>It seems that the market value of the shares at the time the acquisition is made will be the nominal value of the shares; it cannot be anything else unless they are publicly quoted, and they would not be in business expansion schemes.  The Minister seems to be saying, in circumstances where the value of the shares drop, the only kind of guarantee which would be permissible would be one that they would be bought back at par.  Of course, if the shares were bought back at par this would give somebody a return of 19 per cent compound interest over five years.  It works perfectly the other way: if the value of the shares goes up, the Minister is cutting off the guarantees and protecting the investor who will have to get the full value of his investment after five years, but not in circumstances where the value of the shares decline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the phraseology of subsection (2A) the Minister is effectively saying that if somebody enters into a certain class of agreement to do a certain thing within the qualifying period, or the &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; as the subsection says, he will not be entitled to any relief in respect of the shares to which the agreement relates.  The agreement, which is effectively outlawed, so to speak, is an agreement &ldquo;to purchase, or otherwise acquire, any eligible shares for a price which, having regard to the terms of the option or the terms of such arrangement or understanding and the net effect of those terms considered as a whole, is other than the market value of the eligible shares at the time the purchase or acquisition is made&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan, that if on day one I buy £25,000 worth of shares and hand over a cheque for £25,000 to somebody, that is the market value of the eligible shares at the time if, on the same day, I make an agreement for a put option, a call option or whatever.  That seems to me to be the market value on that day in so far as market value is ascertainable.  If somebody guarantees to buy back those shares at par at any stage &mdash; as I understand it it does not have to be at the end of five years but at any stage &mdash; then that operation is not outlawed by the provisions of that section.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, these people may be laughing all the way to the bank because, for a lot of these schemes to work all they are concerned with is guaranteeing a par buy-out at the end of the scheme.  Am I correct?  The Minister may have been too generous.  The whole idea of a guarantee is at variance with the concept of the business expansion scheme.  There was supposed to be equity capital; there was supposed to be risk involved; that was why the tax concession was given.  If the provision is to be amended to take account of what Deputy Noonan is saying the appropriate thing <Col N="1670" /> to do is simply say that any kind of put or call option agreement disqualifies the shares from relief and does not have anything to do with market value or anything else.  Rather let people lie with their investment and incur its inherent risk.  It seems to me that the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> of the scheme was that people were to take risks.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Bruton introduced this scheme he was talking about making entrepreneurs of a whole class of society. This is a wheelchair form of entrepreneuralism if one can actually hand out one's money and guarantee that the shares will be bought back at par value after a certain period.  I think Deputy Noonan is right, that the Minister may have created a loophole there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should not confuse the issue of the shares on day one with the issue after five years.  One must hold one's shares for five years.  I might recommend that they go back and read the relevant subsection (2A) (a) (i) (I) which reads:</P>
      <P>acquires an option, where the exercise of it, ...</P>
      <P>that is the exercise of the option at the end of the five year period:</P>
      <P>either under the terms of the option or under the terms of any arrangement or understanding subject to which or otherwise in connection with which the option is acquired, ...</P>
      <P>Therefore two operations take place: (1) shares are issued on day one for five years; then (2) the exercise of the option is after the five years.  It is not at the start; it is at the end, and one has to hold them for five years.  The determinant is the purchase price on the exercise of the option after five years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30a:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;The following Statutory Instrument is hereby revoked: Income Tax (Employments) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 58 of 1989).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In section 8 there is a reference to the provisions of Regulation 31A (inserted by the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 58 of 1989) of the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 1960.  It was rather difficult to figure out what that was all about.  Therefore my amendment proposes the insertion of a new section.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the budget the Statutory Instrument was issued &mdash; Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 1989 &mdash; which implemented the intent of the Minister's statement in the course of his budgetary remarks that it was intended to extend the period during which employers could pay over to the Minister, the Government, the Revenue Commissioners, the amounts deducted from their employees from one month to a year.  I objected to the proposal in the budget and I am objecting to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that deductions from employees' wages &mdash; the PAYE tax paid by employees, not to their employer but to the State or the Revenue Commissioners, their income tax to the State for the various social services provided by the State, the upkeep of the health service, the educational services, social welfare services, local authority services and so on &mdash; are paid over by employers on a monthly basis.  Under the regulations the Minister has issued &mdash; it is not a free for all &mdash; he can decide that an employer can retain amounts deducted from employees by way of PAYE for up to one year.  This gives employers a free loan <Col N="1672" /> of deductions from employees' wages for a year.</P>
    <P>My first objection is to its whole constitutionality aspect.  The PAYE system is open to question constitutionally. Luckily for the State it has not been questioned because it would be a disaster for the State if it were found to be unconstitutional. But, on the basis of the property clauses in the Constitution, an employee has no property other than the wage he earns at the end of a week for his labour.  However, under the PAYE system he never gets that entitlement to payment for his week's labour into his hand; the deduction is made by the State from his wages before ever he receives them.  The whole constitutionality of that exercise is open to question.  The man does not get what he earns for his labour at the end of the week.  After all, the only thing he has is his labour and the payment he receives therefor.</P>
    <P>Having accepted that position for the past 30 odd years the employee is now told that his boss can withhold these deductions from his wages, not the Government, the State, but his boss. That really stands the whole aspect of the constitutional rights of the citizen on its head.  What rights has the citizen?  Can be refuse to pay his tax over to his employer? Has he the right to say: no, I will not have that deducted from my wages and held by you; I will take it myself and hand it over to the Revenue Commissioners rather than have you hold on to it for 12 months?  On the Revenue Commissioners side I am amazed at the introduction of this new regulation.  An article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 April 1989 entitled &ldquo;<i>Massive increase in Revenue's tax write-offs&rdquo;.</i>  It was a report to the effect that the Public Accounts Committee of the Dáil had been told by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the amounts of tax written off.  It had risen from £1.7 million in 1985 to £11.5 million in 1986, and to £20.7 million in 1987.  Of that £20.7 million the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Philip Curran said:</P>
    <P>Over £20 million of the write-off in <Col N="1673" /> 1987 was due to defaulters leaving the jurisdiction; ceasing trading and leaving no assets, or being in liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>A sum of £20 million was due as a result of defaulters walking off and leaving the jurisdiction or ceasing trading and leaving assets, an activity open to any company under the company laws here and which occurs frequently by setting up a new company and moving to it the assets of the other company.  But you have another company under which you can proceed to trade.  We are dealing with a lot of gangsters &mdash; I suppose that is the best way to put it &mdash; who set up fly-by-night companies.  Many people who do not pay over the money deducted from their employees in PAYE and PRSI do not pay their trading debts or whatever and use various activities for avoiding payment.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners said they had instituted a new tier system for pursuing arrears at an early stage.  In other words, for larger remitters a special team would be assigned as soon as the computer threw up a slippage problem with payments.  The slippage problem used to be detected over a month, two months, three months or four months.  Now one, two, three or even four years may elapse before the slippage problem is noticed. A second programme was being devised for the early identification of arrears among smaller remitters.  I do not know what that programme was.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the Minister is encouraging slippage and creating difficulties for smaller employers by telling them they can hold on to their deductions for a year. If there is a small employer who pays over £1,000 per month or so, that is all right for a month or two but when it comes to the end of six months it would be £6,000 or at the end of the year, £12,000 which would be a very big sum for a smaller trader and for many others who would be paying out £20,000, £50,000 or more and who could thereby be in serious difficulties at the end of the year.  Rather than assisting employers this would create difficulties for the many who <Col N="1674" /> employ half a dozen, a dozen or two employees.  On both counts from the point of view of the employee and from the point of view of the employer I fail to see the reasoning of the Minister in introducing this new regulation.  It does not appear in the Bill exactly what he is doing but it appears in this regulation, which was issued by the Minister that he is informing employers that the remittances of PAYE deducted from their employees can exceed a month, or longer intervals, but not more than a year.  One can say that one does not have to pay over the deductions until the end of a year.  I would ask the Minister to explain the reasoning behind this regulation.  He said it was for the purpose of assisting small employers who have difficulties in their accounting procedures or whatever and to simplify matters for them.  I do not think that is a sufficient explanation and I would like to hear the Minister give the detailed reasons for this regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have misgivings about this because part of me &mdash; I suppose it is the right of centre element of me &mdash; would say that anything that makes it easier from the point of view of the employer and takes away bureaucracy and paperwork and an extra load off the Revenue Commissioners is perfectly sensible. It seems to me that that is a justifiable aim to pursue.  I look to the other side of the coin and wonder whether we are getting a proper explanation as to the circumstances in which these new dispensations with prompt accounting will be allowed to employers and small traders. From my own experience with the VAT system &mdash; and that is a personal one &mdash; it strikes me that many people who are sole practitioners and liable for value-added tax would be, to put it mildly, tempted to use their VAT as working capital if they were given a year's use of it.  Inevitably that will carry with it implications in terms of cash flow for the State.  Even on the most mathematical basis, if you do not look at it from Deputy Mac Giolla's point of view, that is, workers' PAYE, but from the other point <Col N="1675" /> of view and even if you mentally categorise it, which I agree is not strictly right to do, as the employer's money and the employer's pay roll taxes, there is a loss to the State if you annualise what was previously a monthly or bi-monthly payment.  The loss to the State is clearly a cash flow loss because interest is notionally lost in these circumstances.  By the usual mathematical formula a half of the annual interest rate is lost if you postpone payments to a one-off payment at the end of a year.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate generally, and not simply in relation to PAYE, what the effect of his proposals to relax the accounting periods for taxation by employers and sole traders is likely to be.  How much money does he think will be lost to the Exchequer as a consequence on one front, where people do a flit &mdash; as Deputy Mac Giolla said &mdash; with the money, where other people become insolvent and where other people simply use the interest on the money for the purpose of their business?  There must be a cost to the Exchequer in collecting tax in an inefficient manner.  I accept that must be an additional cost but also there is a definite provable loss if you only have to pay once a year as opposed to every two months because there must be some interest payable on the moneys.  At present many people who are in default on their VAT are actually charged interest when they are late.  Apart from that kind of penalty interest, there is the opportunity cost interest, that they have to either borrow the money and pay interest on it to a bank or, alternatively, that they can, if given the run of the money for a year or whatever, use the interest themselves.  The Minister indicated at the time of the budget that he would do this.  I did not object then and I have not objected publicly to it since, but there is a very substantial danger that it will significantly increase the level of default.  It certainly will affect Exchequer cash flow.  I have never seen any figures in an Estimate under either of those headings, no matter what way you look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This clause is there to preserve the <Col N="1676" /> preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners as creditors in insolvencies.  I do not agree with that at all.  It is wrong that the Revenue Commissioners, who have all these draconian powers of collection and penalty to extract money from employers or sole traders or whoever, should, in the event of a company going bust, get their payments out of the wreckage whereas sole traders who have sent reminder after reminder and been down on their knees to these people and have no power to get the money out of them, go without any remedy whatsoever and lose their money.</P>
    <P>It is not fair that the State should have this preferential creditor status.  It leads to people regarding the State as a kind of bank which will be all right if things go wrong.  It leads to a laziness of mind on the part of the Revenue Commissioners that they do not chase up money when it is due.  It means injustice for unsecured creditors, such as ordinary trade creditors, who will find themselves out of pocket.  Would the Minister address some of those questions in reply?  I am genuinely perplexed as to how it came about that a Minister for Finance who claims to be financially strapped for cash could suggest giving up a cash flow benefit of this kind in circumstances which, as Deputy Mac Giolla pointed out, are likely to lead to an increased rate of default.</P>

      <P>To put the matter in perspective, figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the largest number, or one per cent of cases, contribute 80 per cent of the PAYE revenue. The smallest, 70 per cent, contribute less than one per cent.  In relation to small traders and small businesses, I am dealing with a minute part of that 70 per cent which in total contribute less than one per cent.  That puts it in perspective, even <Col N="1677" /> if one were to lose it all and get nothing, but that is not the position.  What is important to realise is that the regulations set out the considerations which the Collector-General may take into account when authorising an employer to pay over his PAYE and PRSI payments on an annual basis.  These include his belief that first, the authorisation will not result in a loss of tax; secondly, the employer concerned will meet his obligations under the authorisation; thirdly, the employer has been a registered employer for at least one year; and fourthly, all P.35 returns which establish employees' entitlements to pay related benefits have been received from the employer in time. This is not an absolute right for everybody but an option that the Collector-General has, when looking at the track record of small businesses.</P>

      <P>The question of constitutionality was raised by Deputy Mac Giolla.  At the moment PAYE and PRSI payments are held on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. That question has never been raised good, bad or indifferent.  With regard to the present matter, the same applies.  If it is wrong for a month then it is wrong for two months or 12 months.  I do not see the logic of questioning it now if it was not questioned before.</P>

In Part IX of the Bill the preference will go &mdash; I am not pre-empting what the Dáil may or may not do.  The Revenue Commissioners will be on the same playing pitch as any other creditor under the protection of the court if they appoint an examiner.  We are taking away the administrative burden from small businesses which contribute such a small amount.  Even if we got a fraction <Col N="1680" /> of the big businesses, it would release a plus cash flow to the Exchequer which is all it is about, getting a better tax collection system and reducing the burden all around.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The thinking at the time when the Bankruptcy Bill was gestated and drafted was that Revenue should maintain the preference. On this section I agree with the Minister. The Revenue Commissioners are entitled from time to time to look at the way their people are employed.  If there is to be a better administration of Revenue and if greater use is made of what are now depleted staff numbers by reallocating staff into an area where there is likely to be a bigger return of taxation from another area where there is now only a trickle, that makes a lot of sense.</P>
      <P>There is a cash flow argument on the other side, that is, the small trader.  My doubt is that, with the best will in the world, many small people will get into frightful difficulties.  They will no longer have the discipline of regular payments. At the end of 12 months the cash flow will have been fairly good, but they will have spent it.  I agree with the Minister that there will be a better cash flow for Revenue, by re-allocating resources within Revenue, but I would be very worried if I were an accountant looking after the interests of the small business person. I would tell him not to opt for this, because it could lead to difficulties.</P>

Surely somebody has done some calculations on that, and even if it is a minute part of 0.1 of a per cent of something or other, what is the something or other, and how much money are we talking about?

      <P>They still have to deduct it, they still have to make out the pay packets, they still have to do all the work and the money is just there.  As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, where is the administrative burden in receiving this money on a monthly basis?  You have your small percentage of this 70 per cent.  I do not know how many people or how much are involved, but the Minister might be able to tell us.  You have this small number of people paying in this money every month, and it is a terrible administrative burden on the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot see where the terrible administrative burden is.  We are not talking about these companies paying their taxes on their <Col N="1683" /> own profit; we are talking about them paying over the money deducted from their employees.  It is just a question of sending the money in.  The Minister's only argument is that he will be taking the administrative burden from the Revenue Commissioners and letting a whole stream of people free.  How many will he free?</P>

      <P>I never heard of any difficulty experienced by those who run a regular business paying over the money they deduct from their employees except that they do not want to do it. That is not their problem.  Their problem with the Revenue Commissioners is assessing what their profits are and all that hassle and administrative work that entails.  That is their administrative problem and that is the administrative problem with the Revenue Commissioners. Are we going to allow them off that as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not bother them about whether they are making any profit for a year, two years, or five years.  What about that? The Revenue Commissioners will waste a great deal of their time focusing on this small number of people who are going to <Col N="1684" /> bring in only 1 per cent.  I do not know whether 70 per cent of the companies are contributing a total of 1 per cent of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners. Is that their own or their employees' contributions? All these percentages are open to question and I would love to have some table or figures showing exactly what the Minister is talking about.</P>
    <P>The last point is in regard to preferential treatment.  I did not oppose this section because it gave preferential treatment to the Revenue Commissioners. Deputy McDowell made a very emotional speech about giving these terrible Revenue Commissioners preferential treatment over the poor small traders who are working hard for a few bob to keep their families together, but he never mentioned the banks getting preferential treatment.  He does not object to the banks getting preferential treatment over the poor small traders, the Revenue Commissioners or anybody else.  That is perfectly all right.  Why should the Revenue Commissioners not have preferential treatment?  I think they should have preferential treatment over the banks or anybody else and that is why I agree with the section giving preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the statutory instrument. This is going to creat hassle on the job for small companies and it will take 12 months &mdash; it might take two years &mdash; before the employees realise this is happening, but I will try to let as many of them as possible know about it.  Money will be deducted weekly from the employees wage packet and they will think it is being paid to Revenue but next year or the year after they will discover it is not.  This will create industrial problems in small companies which they do not need because they have enough problems of their own already.  When employees discover the money is being held and not paid over, they will be very mad, I assure the Minister.  I have not yet heard one good reason for doing this.  I have heard two contradictory reasons, one during the budget debate that it will be a great help to the small traders and now that it will be a great help to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We still do not have one figure for <Col N="1685" /> the amount of money that will be left outstanding for 12 months, the number of people in the Revenue Commission who will be released to go after the big fish, or any such reasoned arguments that we would like to hear.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us the amount of money involved, the number of people involved and what is going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced now about the practical aspect of what the Minister said.  It is wrong to be theoretical about this, but a thought occurs to me. If we are interested in cash flow and the Exchequer, surely, we should consider charging the employer and the sole trader interest for the privilege of hanging on to the money for a year.</P>
      <P>It would be a huge advantage to me in my other capacity as a barrister to be able to hang on to VAT for a whole year.  I would have no incentive to pay it at more frequent periods.  I do not see why I should be left with that advantage. Nobody has knocked down the Minister's door demanding this from him.  They have all been trained into the two-monthly discipline and some of them have behaved better than others.  If this advantage is to be given to employers and sole traders, I do not see why they should not be charged for that benefit.  This is a point for the Minister's consideration. The principle of the whole thing leaves me with one misgiving.  A big, important employer will be got at every two months and the Minister for Finance will send his hounds after that employer if he is a week late and interest will be charged.  If the employer is not so big and important, the Minister is saying he does not care any more.  The bigger and more important the trader becomes, the more savage the treatment he receives.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I agree <Col N="1686" /> with the Minister.  It is self-evident that one should not spend £100 to go after £1. It is clear from the explanation that this is a section in ease of the Revenue Commissioners, not in ease of small traders. Small traders may get into difficulty.  If I may be permitted an aside, the notes of clarification are intensely interesting.  It appears that 1 per cent of the big players are contributing 80 per cent of the income and 70 per cent of the small players are contributing 1 per cent of the income.  No wonder we are a bit confused.  If that is clarification I would hate to be provided with a note which would attempt to muddle us.  It reminds me of the arithmetical conundrums we had when we were kids &mdash; the flock of geese are flying over the Shannon and the gander below asks the gander above if there are 100 of them there; there would be, he says, if we doubled our number and doubled it again, then halved the number, with you thrown in.  The Minister's note of clarification is about as clear as that.  I am not surprised that Deputy Mac Giolla came back for more.  The Minister has totally confused everybody with his explanation. However, he made the case when he said that it does not make sense to spend £1,000 to go after £1.  I accept that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla's arguments are totally contradictory.  If I did not bring in the regulations there would be no need for his amendment to remove the regulations.  He went on to say that he agrees with giving the Revenue Commissioners preferences.  What is the point in continuing the argument? That is what I am trying to do.  At the same time Deputy Mac Giolla has an amendment to remove the regulations.  I cannot get that clear in my mind.</P>

      <P>Do we spend £1,000 to go after £1?  Let us not talk about &ldquo;biggies&rdquo; getting away.  The Government last year introduced self-assessment for the self-employed, as a result of which £70 million more came in during 1988 than was estimated.  Later this year self-assessment is being extended to companies.  It <Col N="1687" /> is all about improving the system and getting in more tax, which will reduce the burden on every taxpayer.  If Deputy Mac Giolla cannot understand the problems that arise for a one-man or one-woman business in making out VAT returns every month or every two months when they cannot afford somebody to do it for them, it is quite clear that he has not had this experience.  There is a lot of bureaucracy involved for somebody who is not trained in it.  This provision provides relief in that regard.  The Deputy should ask any small business person who is honestly trying to run his business. Not only will there not be a loss to the Exchequer but there will be a gain in terms of cash flow.  That is good business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 9, but in Chapter I, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;&mdash;Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, is hereby amended by the addition after subsection (7) of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>`(8)  Any individual who is aggrieved by a refusal by the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination under this section may, by notice in writing to that effect given to the Revenue Commissioners 30 days from the date on which such refusal is given him, make an application to have his claim for a determination heard and determined by the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
      <P>(9)  The Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine an appeal made to them under <i>subsection (8)</i> as if it were an appeal against an assessment to income tax and all the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967 relating to such an appeal (including the provisions relating to the rehearing of an appeal and to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law) shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969.  It is to do with the relief from income tax on qualifying work by artists.  A claim for exemption from income tax on the profits of the artists' qualifying work can be made only where <Col N="1689" /> the individual is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to have produced original and creative work of cultural or artistic merit.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide a right of appeal against the Revenue Commissioners' refusal to grant the determination that the claimant's work meets the requirements of the section, that is, that it is original and creative as well as having cultural or artistic merit.</P>
    <P>The procedure at the moment is that people who believe they have produced work of cultural or artistic merit apply to the Revenue Commissioners for an exemption from income tax on foot of any profits arising from that particular work.  The Revenue Commissioners, on receipt of this preliminary claim, consider the evidence provided and can consult with such person or body or persons as in their opinion may be of assistance to them.  The Revenue Commissioners then either grant a determination or refuse it. Where the determination is refused there is no right or appeal.  This amendment seeks to grant such a right of appeal to the appeal commissioners with provision for rehearing by a circuit judge and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>I do not think the section is being operated as originally intended in particular cases that have been brought to my attention. It seems to me to be a catch 22 situation.  If the Revenue Commissioners find against one, one can appeal to the appeals commissioner and subsequently to the Circuit Court.  If the Revenue Commissioners refuse to adjudicate, there is no right of appeal.  There are circumstances where if somebody submits a work which he believes is creative or of cultural or artistic merit and the Revenue Commissioners refuse to adjudicate on it there is no right of appeal, whereas if they adjudicate in the negative there is a right of appeal.  The purpose of this amendment is to require the Revenue Commissioners to grant a determination.  Then if it is in the negative the appeal mechanism is in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed this in a different way before, that if somebody was deemed to be refused after a certain <Col N="1690" /> time he could appeal.  They should be entitled to have the issue determined. The Revenue Commissioners should not be entitled to leave somebody in limbo wondering whether or not they are entitled to a determination.  I know the Revenue Commissioners are busy but it would be better if their minds were concentrated on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am not talking about a situation where there is a delay or where because it is not very important work it is not dealt with and other work is taking priority.  I am talking about a situation where it is policy not to adjudicate because adjudication in the negative allows an appeal to the appeals commissioners and then to the Circuit Court.  I know that there have been decisions in the Circuit Court with which the Revenue Commissioners did not agree and which they considered not to be in accordance with the strict interpretation of the Act.  Arising from these decisions it is practice now in certain circumstances not to give the determination. Consequently one cannot appeal.  It is the classic catch 22 of the novel where the only way one can get out of the Army on health grounds is to prove one is insane, but one had to be insane to be there in the first place, so one could not get out.  This is the same situation. One has an appeal if the Revenue Commissioners decide against one; but if they refuse to adjudicate against one, one cannot appeal.  It was not the intention of the Taoiseach when, as Minister for Finance in 1969, he introduced this section.  It is a minor enough point.  It does not arise very often but it should be corrected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the case made by Deputy Noonan it seems he is trying to imply that the Revenue Commissioners set themselves up as an authority on what has or has not artistic merit. From where I sit I do not see that as being the case, although the Deputy talks about certain evidence that he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, recognises the reality of the situation by making specific provisions to enable the Revenue Commissioners to consult with <Col N="1691" /> such person or bodies of persons as, in the Commissioners' opinion, may be of assistance to them in dealing with claims for relief under the section.  The Commissioners seek advice from these authoritative and reputable sources in the case o&dagger; every claim to exemption made under section 2, and the Commissioners follow the advice offered in considering whether a determination in favour of the claimant should be made.  Where the Commissioners are unable to make a determination in favour of an individual it is always open to the individual to submit further evidence in support of his or her claim and the Commissioners will have regard to such further information in every case.</P>
    <P>If they refuse to adjudicate I do not see any problem about going back again with different information.  I do not have a feel for the problems.  The Revenue Commissioners consult in every case with the people who should know, who are best qualified to know.  That is the position under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The difficulty arises in that a claim for exemption from income tax on the profits of artists' qualifying work can be made only where the individual is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to have produced original and creative work of cultural and artistic merit.  If they go through the procedure and the Revenue Commissioners determine that it qualifies, it qualifies.  If they go through the procedure and it is determined that it does not qualify then there is an appeal mechanism, but in cases where the Revenue Commissioners refuse to give a determination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they fail to make a determination one is not entitled to the relief.  If they just sit and do nothing they can effectively frustrate one and prevent one from getting to the Circuit Court because there is nothing against which to appeal.  All there is is a failure to determine.  I proposed this a year ago in a different form.  What Deputy Noonan is now proposing is that one has a right of appeal against a refusal to make a determination just as one has the right to appeal against a negative determination. In other words, there should be some obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at some determination so that the taxpayer is put in a position such that he can appeal a failure to make a determination just as he can appeal against a determination which is made against him.</P>

In at least one case, or possibly two, an appeal went before a Circuit Court judge and he found in favour of the author of the textbook.  Since then when textbooks go to the Revenue Commissioners on these grounds they refuse determinations because they do not want the appeal considered in the Circuit Court and they are frustrating the intent of the section in that area.  I am not arguing that textbooks should be in or out; I am arguing that the procedure should be available to people and if the Revenue Commissioners say there is no artistic merit in a textbook the person should have the right to appeal.  At present there is no right of appeal against a failure to give a determination and that is the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, as is usual on this occasion, to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and your office for facilitating me in raising this, what I see as an important and urgent issue.  I would also like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, a Minister who has dealt very comprehensively in the last couple of months with the issue of insurance.  I am pleased he is here to listen to the case I have to make and I hope that, having raised a number of matters with him, he will indicate some hope because I believe hope and action is needed in this area.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue whereby on the one hand people who have been in employment have been faced with massive increases in the premia levied on them by the insurance company involved while on the other hand, there is a need for controls on the numbers of people driving taxis and employed in that area.  I understand that the PMPA company, in considering and reviewing the overall position of premium to be levied on the taxi industry for the current year, employed the services of an investigator to look into the area of losses and the present problem was highlighted.  On the one hand an owner driver was being levied a premium of, on average, £1,500 while cars driven by two or three drivers would be levied with the same amount of premium.  In other words, these cars would be on the road for 24 hours a day as opposed to the average of between seven and eight hours for an owner driven vehicle.  I accept this is an issue that had to be addressed but my basic point is that the rather drastic action taken by the insurance company was excessive and has had a very profound impact to the extent, I am reliably advised by the taxi federation, that upwards of 500 taxi drivers have been put off the road with a consequent increase in the other problems that arise from their unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> Basically what has happened is that the insurance industry introduced a rule this year that the owner driver of the taxi pays the full premium and that a second or subsequent driver pays exactly the same for their driving of the vehicle.  The obvious onus rests on the second or subsequent driver &mdash; the &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; driver as he is called &mdash; to raise this money.  That was not the practice heretofore.  Previously a single premium was paid, usually by the owner of the car, and the &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; driver would then contribute during the year on a weekly basis to pay off the share of that premium.</P>
    <P>The position has to be contrasted against some basic facts about taxi drivers that are often not accepted or certainly not stated often enough.  In a recent survey, giving the figures relating to taxi drivers in Dublin, it was established that out of 1,835 drivers, 1,100 had a clear record of driving, driving without claim, for five years and upwards.  In other words, they were carrying the maximum bonus of 60 per cent available to them from the insurance company.  That in itself is a remarkable record.  It is estimated that in the past five years there have been fewer than ten serious claims involving taxi drivers.  Therefore, the facts regarding the overall performance of taxi drivers are somewhat distorted.  In living memory there has been only one fatal accident involving a taxi driver in Dublin and that was when a taxi collided with a stolen motor car, leading, regretfully, to the death of a passenger in the car.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts relating to what I believe is a very laudable record of safety among taxi drivers in the city.  Contrast that against what has been the impact of the decision of the insurance company in a single fell swoop to introduce a practice that amounts to, for many of the drivers, upwards of a doubling and, in some instances, a trebling of the premium to be levied on any one motor car.  The consequent loss, as I have indicated, of approximately 500 jobs indicates that the action on the part of the insurance company was excessive and must be a matter of concern to any Minister of Government involved in this area.  The Minister <Col N="1696" /> of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce has indicated that the level of premia is something of active interest to him in his portfolio so I hope he will take on board this question of the scale of premia to be levied on taxi drivers in the city.</P>
    <P>The loading system employed by the insurance company involved is also something that is worthy of investigation By way of an example, a taxi driver to whom I spoke today advised me that he has been driving for 27 years with a clear record of no claim and has earned the maximum bonus available to him of 60 per cent reduction on the basic premium. Should he have an accident involving a claim, no matter how small, he will lose that entire bonus cover and revert to a zero bonus rating.  Subsequent on that, the maximum bonus he can work back to, irrespective of whether he achieves another 27 years of clear record, would be 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reality of the system currently in operation is that another driver of that car carries exactly the equivalent of the premium of the owner driver.  A driver coming perhaps out of retirement from some other work and being lucky enough to get the means to start driving a taxi will carry the equivalent of the premium of the first driver, without regard to the record of the &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; driver.  He may be a person of eminent record with no claim or no blemish whatsoever, a supreme, competent driver, but because he is unfortunate to be associated with a driver owner who has had the misfortune of losing his bonus, he must carry a penalty. If there is a third driver exactly the same applies.</P>
    <P>This is a pressing problem, even more so at a time when many taxi drivers are now trying to get members of their families into the industry.  There is a major restriction on licences being issued.  I do not recall any licences being issued in Dublin in recent times.  The only avenue available to a taxi driver to allow his son or daughter to work in this job is through co-driving.  If a taxi driver wants to bring his son or daughter in, he must be in a position to pay double or sometimes treble the premium he would have to pay for his motor car.  The practice prior to <Col N="1697" /> this was that insurance companies charged £12 on top of the first premium for open driving.</P>
    <P>I accept that that was not an entirely fair system, and that has been highlighted by the taxi federation and the insurance company but what has now taken place is far too drastic.  No one envisaged that it would have had the impact it has had on employment in the industry, as has happened in Dublin.  There is an additional 50 per cent loading on the premium for young adults under the age of 25 years.  A father wanting to introduce into the taxi business a son who has left school but who cannot find other work must pay 100 per cent extra on his premium plus 50 per cent if the son is under 25 years.  That is an indefensible system.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look at the points I raise and will report back to me or to the taxi federation as to what can be done to put matters right.  It is a cause of major concern to the taxi federation that there is only one insurance company in the city prepared to deal in taxi premiums. It is unsatisfactory that there is no competition.  The PMPA have an effective monopoly with the result that they can take hard decisions without fear of losing clients to a competitor.  That monopoly must come to an end.  If other insurance companies provide motor insurance they should be prepared to provide for taxi drivers.  The record of taxi drivers indicates that they do not present a serious risk to any company.  The Minister should do his best to involve more insurance companies in providing cover for taxi drivers.</P>
    <P>As long as the PMPA are primarily the company involved with taxi drivers &mdash; and they will continue to be for the remainder of this year &mdash; the Minister should look at the figures upon which the PMPA seek to justify the current increases.  Because the PMPA have a monopoly they have seized on a representation made to them to deal with multiple drivers of single cars, to introduce an exorbitant and indefensible scale of increase of the premiums.  I am sure they did not have any appreciation of the serious impact that would have down the line in terms of job losses.  The Minister should challenge the PMPA on the <Col N="1698" /> matter.  Their figures do not justify the increases.  They have merely seized a good market opportunity when defences were down.  The Minister should get the company to realise that they must rejig the rebates and assist drivers to get back behind the wheel.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also look at the question of loading procedures?  I have given an instance of what happens in Dublin where a father wants to introduce a young son into the business.  The huge loading there cannot be justified on the figures, and the Minister should look at this.</P>
    <P>A lot of taxi drivers looking for insurance cover who are not entertained by any company and who seek recourse through the normal channels of the Minister's office invariably find that the response in the &ldquo;forced&rdquo; quote given at the instigation of the Minister is completely unrealistic.  They are quoting premium figures of treble and sometimes four times the average insurance premium cover available to taxi drivers in this city.  That is punitive and unfair.</P>
    <P>Those are the issues that have been raised as a result of the recent action by the PMPA because of the serious impact on employment in this service industry in the city.  I call on the Minister to investigate the issues I have raised.  I do not expect that at such short notice the Minister has all or any of the answers I am looking for tonight, but I invite him to respond in whatever way he can this evening and to respond later, after investigating the issues, to me or to the federation.  If necessary perhaps the Minister would agree to meet the taxi federation to discuss this problem so that we can relieve the hardship that has been caused by this sudden unexpected decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCartan for raising this issue.  I appreciate the difficulties and understand the frustrations of taxi drivers generally with regard to costs, particularly insurance costs.  I will give very serious consideration to all the facts and figures which Deputy McCartan has given the House this evening.  I will look <Col N="1699" /> carefully at the facts and at the suggestions the Deputy has made this evening.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any possible loss of 500 jobs in the taxi business as a result of increased insurance premiums.  I would certainly value further data on that from the federation.  I understand that the number of licences for public service vehicles including taxis is around the 6,000 mark and applications for such licences are on the increase.  Indeed such is the demand to get into the taxi business that Dublin Corporation have limited the number of taxi plates to around 1,835 since 1979 and the going rate for such plates is now around £30,000.  Of course, a large number of taxis would have two or more drivers.</P>
      <P>The problems of high insurance costs is directly related to the high number and level of claims.  Over the past number of years insures have suffered large underwriting losses on their motor accounts.  In 1987, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurance companies suffered underwriting losses of £32 million on their motor business.  Faced with losses of this magnitude insurance companies had little option but to increase their premiums or exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.  I understand that among the main classes of motor vehicles, taxis have the highest claims frequency rate &mdash; in fact the insurance companies indicate to me that taxis are almost four times more likely to have an accident than are private cars.  I have heard what the Deputy has said this evening and I will see where the discrepancies arise in this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PMPA which are the largest insurers of taxis, have 1,817 policy holders on their books, and in 1987 incurred a loss ratio of 150 per cent on these accounts.  For every £100 taken in in premiums £150 is paid out in claims.  As a consequence they have had no option but to increase rates for taxi drivers and in particular for the named drivers on policies. The extra loading on additional drivers which will affect about 700 policy holders, would not appear unreasonable given that a second or third taxi driver means that the vehicle is on the road for <Col N="1700" /> longer periods and therefore exposed to much greater risks.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the company we are talking about has the lion's share of this business, there is no reason other insurance companies would not complete for the business.  Unfortunately, the reality is that other companies do not seem to regard it as lucrative business or lucrative enough to go after.  As premiums go up and competition increases, other companies should be able to look at that marketplace.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Deputy's suggestions, I will take the specific step of encouraging other companies to look at this marketplace and see whether they find it commercially attractive to provide insurance.  We can be sure of one thing. If there was money to be made in insuring taxis, the other companies would not leave it to one company, because competition in the insurance business is quite severe.</P>
    <P>I can certainly ask the company we are talking about to consider allowing each driver to be a policyholder independently and in that way earn an independent bonus.  I am aware that the company may not find that idea attractive for all sorts of reasons but I will certainly draw it to their attention as a possible solution for the taxi drivers.</P>
    <P>My primary responsibility in the area of insurance is to ensure that companies maintain their solvency and that they maintain their statutory reserves.  I have to respect the right of insurance companies to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  I simply cannot compel the PMPA, or any other insurer, to make patently uneconomic decisions in respect of any class of business. I am also very conscious of the dangers involved if an insurer were to reduce its rates below a financially viable level and I am certainly not advocating that.  We have had that experience in the past.</P>
    <P>While I understand and sympathise with the frustration with the recent premium increases for taxis, I regret to say that the figures which I have outlined above in respect of claims would appear <i>prima facie</i> in any case to justify these <Col N="1701" /> increases.  However, I will look at the matter again.</P>
    <P>Greater road safety, in particular by taxi drivers themselves, would help considerably, but this goes of all drivers on the road and not just taxi drivers.  I think it is fair to say that most people are preoccupied with insurance cost, availability and coverage, particularly in the motor classes.  There is widespread agreement that the cost of motor insurance in this country has been too high for far too long.  It is also generally accepted that the high cost of motor insurance is directly related to the number and level of claims, the underwriting losses sustained by insurance companies and the enormous expenses which arise in the claims process, particularly when the courts are involved.</P>
    <P>The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognised that motor insurance rates were too high and undertook to move quickly to facilitate a reduction in insurance costs.  The House will be aware that the Government have, over the past two years, tackled this area fairly vigorously, and with some sense of urgency.  In a general sense there is a lot of work to be done, but we have achieved some success.</P>
    <P>The most important commitment given by Government was to abolish the use of civil jurys in personal injury and fatal accident cases in the High Court.  The Courts Act, 1988, came into force on 1 August 1988.  Jury trials in personal injury and fatal accident cases are no longer available to parties in litigation from that date.  The object of this change is to bring greater consistency and predictability into the awards of damages in these cases and to enable a much greater proportion of cases to be settled at an earlier stage in legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry, and many others, have for long cited the availability of jury trial as a principal cause of the high cost of motor and liability insurance in this country.  The Government have now delivered on their commitment to do away with the jury system.  There is, therefore, a clear onus on the insurance industry to translate the benefits arising from that important change into lower insurance premiums.  I have already said <Col N="1702" /> to the industry, and I repeat it now, that I expect any reductions brought about by this change will be passed on to the consumer.  I am currently undertaking a study of how the system has been working since 1 August 1988 and I hope to be able to make an announcement about that shortly because I am very anxious, as I am sure the House is, to see what effect the non-jury system has had on insurance.</P>
    <P>The cost reduction measures already taken will have a beneficial effect on motor insurance costs.  I should remind the House that up until the end of 1988, the consumer price index showed that in general insurance costs across the board were down 6 per cent, and I understand from the figures that will be announced shortly that in the first few months of this year there has been a reduction also in general insurance rates, after years of increases.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been linked with the jury issue is the concern about high legal costs.  Until recently, virtually every personal injury case in the High Court &mdash; no matter how straightforward &mdash; involved at least eight lawyers, including three counsel on each side.  That was regarded, quite properly, as an extravagance and there is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to reduce legal representation in superior court cases.  In line with that commitment, the Government decided to include a provision in the Courts Act, 1988, that empowers the Minister for Justice to regulate the number of counsel whose fees can be recovered by a successful plaintiff in a personal injury case.</P>
    <P>Independently of possible statutory intervention &mdash; though some would say because of it &mdash; the Bar Council announced it would abandon the long standing three counsel practice in personal injury cases when jury trial ceased. In addition, in response to my call for rationalisation of legal representation levels, an agreement was reached recently between the Insurance Industry Federation and the Bar Council which provides that only one counsel will appear in personal injury cases up to £25,000 and two in cases over £25,000.  I am also conducting a study to <Col N="1703" /> see how that change is working out. I am very anxious to ensure that the spirit as well as the letter of the law is kept in practice on a day to day basis.  I will have some further information on that matter for interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is looking at the idea of a Book of Quantum of Damages. Such a book is published in Britain, and used there as a guide for the insurance industry, the legal profession and the Judiciary in settling and deciding cases.  Another development worth mentioning is a recent initiative by the Irish Insurance Federation in arranging that member companies will maintain a record of major categories of injury, and will collate data on award settlements, and circulate the results to members and to my Department.  Such data will complement data on court awards in injury cases and help to provide an overall view of the quantum of damages in personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>Another commitment is the question of introducing a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court to enable subsidiary issues to be disposed of by agreement between the parties before a trial.  The aim would be to limit the issues going to court to those that remain in dispute between the parties.  This would speed up matters considerably.  As well as reducing legal and expert witnesses' costs, such a facility could have a major influence on personal injury cases by providing new procedural machinery to advance the prospects of settlement in cases that go all the way to trial at present.  I understand that the Minister for Justice hopes to put proposals to the Dáil shortly in the context of a court and court officers Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation in his Department, to facilitate the introduction of a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I understand the Minister for the Environment is proposing to introduce legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.  The measures proposed could include the impounding of motor vehicles to deal with uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>I would hope for rapid progress on most, if not all these areas.  For my part, I will do everything possible to keep up the momentum.  We have made considerable progress in the past two years in the jury, legal representation and competition areas to get insurance costs down.  However, there is still a lot of work to be done.  I am constantly reminding the insurance industry of the need to reorganise and rationalise themselves in the context of 1992 so that they can meet international competition.  One thing is certain, this industry will face substantial competition in the years ahead, both from within this country and from outside. This will have a corresponding effect on insurance rates in the years ahead. There is a lot of work to be done.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to say to Deputy McCartan that I value the points he has raised.  I have taken very careful note of them, particularly of the facts and figures he has given, and following his request, I will be quite happy to meet with the Taxi Federation and discuss the matter with them as soon as is practicable.  I understand their frustration about insurance rates because many motorists feel the same way.  However, we have been making substantial progress in this area and I would not want undue levies to be imposed on taxi drivers, and we will do everything possible to assist them. Obviously, I cannot turn back the economic tide and I have to take account of the loss ratio.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question is mainly concerned with the networks of regional and county roads which are primarily the responsibility of the local authority. Because of my concern about the condition of these roads, I have made substantial increases in the levels of road grant funding for them since 1987.  The 1989 discretionary road grants allocations notified for regional and county roads to county councils amount to £47.4 million, compared with £33.4 million in 1988 and £23.0 million in 1986.  The £47.4 million is the first instalment of the three year programme of works on regional and county roads which I announced earlier this year.

      <P>As I have explained in a letter of 12 April 1989 to the Deputy, I do not propose to establish such an inquiry.</P>
      <P>The main facts regarding the planning decisions relevant to this case, made by Dublin County Council and An Bord Pleanála, are matters of public record. Both bodies would have been obliged to reach their decisions on the basis of the proper planning and development of Dublin county, regard being had to the provisions of the development plan at the relevant time.  Both bodies would also have been obliged to act impartially and without bias.  Within these basic requirements, the law clearly contemplates the possibility of a planning authority and An Bord Pleanála reaching different determinations in respect of the same planning application and of certain planning decisions giving grounds for compensation claims.</P>
      <P>It must be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that both Dublin County Council and An Bord Pleanála have in the present case observed the basic requirements referred to.  No evidence contrary to this presumption has been offered and a judicial inquiry would not therefore be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider, in any event that early consideration and enactment by the Oireachtas of the Local Government <Col N="1450" /> (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1988, rather than a retrospective and costly inquiry, will best serve the public interest in relation to the important question of planning compensation.</P>

      <P>On 1 May 1989 Ireland signed a Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, commonly referred to as the Geneva Convention concerning the control of emissions of nitrogen oxides or their transboundary fluxes.</P>
      <P>The principal requirement of the Protocol is the stabilisation by 31 December 1994, of national emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at 1987 levels.  The Protocol also requires parties to it to commence negotiations in due course on further steps to reduce NOx emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> Projections of future national emissions show that, without controls, Irish Nox emissions would increase considerably by the end of this century, largely as a result of increasing demand for electricity in a growing economy.  We are, however, committed to participating actively in the international fight against air pollution and, while nitrogen oxide emissions do not present an environmental problem here, action will be taken, in line with the Protocol, to stabilise these emissions and reduce them below the level they would reach on existing trends.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the Protocol in Ireland will involve not only the fitting of low NOx technology to new power plant, but also the retrofitting of a significant proportion of our existing power plant. It will also involve controls on industrial emissions and the introduction of more stringent vehicle emission controls.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a proposal regarding the freeze marking of horses is included in a submission by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals dealing with possible new legislation on horses generally.  However, I do not consider that the matters dealt with in the submission are primarily the responsibility of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food indicated recently &mdash; Official Report for 13 April 1988, Vol. 388, No. 6, col. 1525 &mdash; that the submission was being examined in his Department.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures indicate that there was a slight increase in the number of recorded indictable offences for the subdistrict of Dunshaughlin in the 12 month period ended 31 March 1989 as compared with the corresponding period ended 31 March 1988.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that certain measures, including the deployment of mobile patrols operating from Trim and Dunboyne as well as from Dunshaughlin station, have been taken to deal with the situation.  The Garda authorities assure me that the position is under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">

      <P>Garda authorities inform me that the current allocation of two Garda cars and one motorcycle to Raheny station is adequate to meet the current needs of the area. The Garda authorities also inform me that they have no indication of any recent upsurge in crime in the Kilbarrack area and that the crime situation in the Raheny subdistrict generally, so far this year, is <Col N="1462" /> considerably improved in comparison with the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>I stated the position regarding community policing in the Dublin north-east area in my reply to the Deputy's question of 14 February 1989 (No. 37) and the situation remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that measures taken by them to deal with a spate of burglaries and incidents of malicious damage in the Bishopstown Garda subdistrict earlier this year, resulted in a number of youths receiving prison sentences. The authorities consider that there is now an improvement in the local crime rate but they will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have no proposals at present to allocate a second patrol car to Bishopstown station.  In addition to patrols carried out by the existing car assigned there, the Bishopstown area also receives attention, as and when required, from mobile units operating from the district headquarters at Togher and from the divisional headquarters at Union Quay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 to 83, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to outline exactly how Wheatfield compares with older prisons. It would compare differently with the different institutions but, under each of the headings mentioned by the Deputy, its standards would be high by reference to both national and international comparators.</P>
      <P>The original intention was that both a place of detention and a prison would be built on the Wheatfield site.  Total expenditure to date, including the various elements mentioned by the Deputy, is £45.42 million of which £39.84 million is apportionable to the new place of detention and £5.58 million to the prison.  The prison has of course not been built but necessary services have been provided for it.</P>
      <P>Since Wheatfield was handed over &mdash; it was completed in February 1988 &mdash; there has been a Prison Service presence there so that various essential tasks could be carried out prior to opening.  The staff concerned also have a security role but it is not possible to say what proportion of the cost would be in respect of security alone.  The current weekly cost of the staffing arrangements is approximately £1,800 and the cost to date is approximately £170,000.</P>
      <P>There are 320 cells, each intended for single occupancy.  The categories of offender to be accommodated in Wheatfield will be decided shortly.</P>

Because of his high stocking rate, his claim for livestock headage grants exceeded the allowable limit of £30.66 per acre of the forage area devoted to grazing beef cows and £18.21 per acre of the forage area devoted to grazing other cattle.

The agency will be responsible for the regulation of the liquid milk market throughout the country.  It will register all dairies and liquid milk producers within the State who satisfy hygienic, processing and other technical standards.  In order for producers to register it will be necessary for them to have a written contract with a registered dairy guaranteeing all year round supply or supply during the winter months.  The agency will be empowered to refuse to register any contract which in its view does not provide adequate compensation for the costs of winter production.</P>
      <P>The board of the agency will consist of an independent part time chairman together with representatives of producer, processor, retail, distributor and consumer interests.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to say when precisely the agency will commence operations as this will depend on when the necessary legislation is enacted. However I am anxious that it should start as quickly as possible.  In the meantime I have decided that a preparatory committee composed of representatives of the industry should prepare for the establishment of the agency.

    <P>Pension of £24.50 per week is now in <Col N="1478" /> payment.  This is the rate of pension payable to a person whose weekly means are between £28 and £30.  In this case the means, derived from a holding, are assessed at £30 per week.</P>

The Inspector of Taxes will now write to the taxpayer for the information necessary to carry out a review of her liability for 1988-89.  On receipt of the required information the review will be carried out and if any tax is found to have been overpaid the appropriate refund will be made.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer was married on 8 April 1989.  The normal procedure as set out in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1983, is that a married couple are taxable as single persons during the year of assessment in which the marriage takes place and any claim to repayment of tax arising as a result of marriage is dealt with after the end of the tax year in which the marriage takes place.  However, in this case as the taxpayer's wife is not working arrangements are being made to issue to him as a concession and on a week-one basis, a tax-free allowance certificate incorporating the married allowance and double-rate bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>An Post's current contribution rate of 16.7 per cent to the company's pension fund in respect of service given by its employees on and after vesting day (1 January 1984) is based on an actuarial report prepared in 1988.  The pension fund is separate from the accounts of An Post and is managed by independent trustees, nominated by An Post, for the sole benefit of company employees and their dependants.  The contributions of An Post to the fund may not be used by the company for any purpose other than payment of pension benefits.</P>
      <P>As provided for in its Articles of Association, the company, with the permission of the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance, has built up to the required annual financing rate of 16.7 per cent by charging to the profit and loss account the following percentages of pensionable pay: 1984, 11.5 per cent; 1985, 12.5 per cent; 1986, 13.5 per cent; 1987, 16.2 per cent; 1988, 16.7 per cent.  At 31 December 1988 the cumulative under-financing in the fund was approximately £7.4 million. The company is committed to making up this shortfall.  As already published in An Post's annual report, the financing of the fund in future years will be increased to compensate for the under-financing following completion of the next actuarial report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of pre-vesting day pension entitlements, which is the liability of the Minister for Finance, has been delegated to An Post under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  Payments made by the company in accordance with such delegation are made out of the pension fund and must be re-imbursed by the Minister for Finance in any year in which income from the fund is insufficient, because of the <Col N="1488" /> delegation, to pay the pensions of that year.</P>

      <P>Total road grant payments to each local authority in each of the years 1980 to 1989 are set out in table 1.</P>
      <P>In this period, the only discretionary grants allocated to local authorities specifically for county roads were grants for county road strengthening (from 1986 to 1988) and grants for works on county roads under the EC Western Package (from 1981 to 1989).  Details of these grants, which are included in the amounts shown in table 1, are set out in tables 2 and 3.  The tables are being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>EC Regional Funds grants are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of locations at which there have been regular testing of water quality for swimming in the Dublin region in each of the past three years; the number of breaches of adequate standards which have been reported; and if he will make a statement regarding the prospects for testing and water quality during the swimming season of 1989.</P>

      <P>During the 1986 and 1987 bathing seasons the beaches at Dollymount and Portmarnock were monitored for compliance with the national bathing water quality standards.  In 1988, I made regulations giving legal effect to these standards and increasing the number of areas to be monitored in the Dublin region to nine, the additional beaches being those at Skerries, Portrane, Donabate, Portmarnock, Sutton, Dollymount, and Killiney.</P>
      <P>In both 1986 and 1987 one beach was recorded for the faecal streptococci parameter at Dollymount from samples taken on 16 and 11 occasions respectively. Standards for transparency, salmonella and floating materials were each breached on one occasion during 1988 at this location.  Also in 1988, breaches of microbiological standards occurred at Donabate on one occasion and at Sutton on two dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> During the 1989 bathing season, a further three beaches will be monitored &mdash; Loughshinny, Rush (south beach) and Malahide.</P>
    <P>Overall, bathing waters in the Dublin region have been of a high quality and the occasional breaches recorded for individual parameters have not given cause for concern on public health grounds.</P>

I am informed that Dublin Corporation are at present carrying out a detailed study of the Bull Island area and that part of the study includes an <Col N="1503" /> assessment as to whether it would be appropriate to make a special amenity area order for the area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of people who are currently paying repayments on house loans at fixed interest rate set in excess of the present variable rate available on new loans from local authorities; the total sum of money involved; and if he will consider allowing these people to opt for the variable rate terms on the outstanding balance of their loan as an alternative to their present terms.</P>

      <P>The information requested regarding the number and value of fixed rate loans is not available in my Department. Where a loan has been advanced at a fixed interest rate, that rate applies for the life of the loan in accordance with the terms of the mortgage agreement. The question of applying a variable interest rate to these loans does not, therefore, arise.  It should also be remembered that the funds advanced to the local authorities to make these loans were advanced at a fixed rate of interest.</P>

Experience has shown that water quality is excellent in most areas and in 1988 the vast majority of bathing areas achieved compliance with the required standards with ease.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable for water quality data to be announced with weather forecasts given the large number of locations monitored.  The European Communities (Quality of Bathing Water) Regulations, 1988, provide that any person may have access to the monitoring results by visiting the offices of the responsible local authority, and, if the standards are breached at any location, the local authority must give such public notice as it considers appropriate having regard to the nature of the breach and any possible implications for bathers.

      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, understand that the new GMS contract contains a number of significant entitlements which differ from the terms of the original 1972 GMS contract.  Such entitlements include: superannuation, leave entitlement together with an extension of the items of services under the special services listing.  It is, therefore, not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the projected increase in the cost of the new GMS contract at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I have previously stated in the House, the estimated cost of the new GMS contract is £50 million in a full year.  This represents an increase of £5 million, approximately, on the latest figures available for 1988 on the cost of GMS doctors' services.  I have also mentioned previously that this increased cost <Col N="1517" /> is expected to be off-set by a reduction in the cost of drugs and medicines provided under the scheme, through a combination of expected change in the pattern of general practitioner prescribing and the use of the drugs formulary, which should be available shortly to GMS doctors.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps also point out that the cost of general practitioner services in the GMS has increased significantly over the last five years, ending 31 December 1987 from £29.680 million in 1983 to £42.213 million in 1987.</P>

      <P>On 21 December 1988 the Council of the European Communities adopted a Directive on a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years duration.  This Directive must be implemented by all member <Col N="1528" /> states before 4 January 1991.  The Directive will apply to the teaching profession and I am confident that when it is implemented by the UK authorities teachers trained here will be eligible for recognition in Northern Ireland.  I could not comment on the question of immediate eligibility for appointment to posts of responsibility as I am not familiar with the arrangements with regard to length of service and qualifications for appointment to such posts.</P>

      <P>Youthreach is a new joint <Col N="1529" /> initiative between the Departments of Education and Labour which commenced in February of this year.  Currently the VECs, who are operating the scheme on behalf of the Department of Education, have over 200 trainees enrolled, and this number is projected to rise to 600 before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As this is a new scheme, it is not possible at this early stage to give an accurate estimate of the final cost of the scheme in 1989 but it is considered that the £2½ million which the Department has budgeted for the scheme this year will be sufficient to cover costs to be met by the Department.  The cost of training allowances, estimated at £600,000, payable to the participants is being covered separately by FÁS.</P>

      <P>Dyslexia is not a specific condition but is a general term used to refer to various difficulties associated with reading disability. Accordingly, I am advised that no useful purpose would be served by the setting up of a school-based register on the lines implied in the Deputy's question. Teachers are urged to note particular learning difficulties pupils may have and to bring them to appropriate attention.  Assessment in the area referred to by the Deputy is, however, carried out by the schools' medical service or by reference to one of the assessment teams based in the health boards or child guidance clinics.</P>
