      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the late sitting but I object to the Order of Business for today on two grounds, first because of the content of the Order of Business in relation to the Social Welfare Bill and, second, because of the aims of the Government in relation to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the Order of Business as it was presented to the House today because, although it was agreed last Thursday between the Whips, on Friday the Government sought to change the Order of Business for today.  I object to what they are trying to do in the Social Welfare Bill.  The court recommended that levels of increases be given to certain recipients of social welfare and this Government &mdash; consistent with what they have been doing in the area of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the Order of Business as outlined by the Taoiseach.  The first question I put to the House was: is the proposal for the late sitting this evening agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the proposal to apply a guillotine to the Social Welfare Bill to complete discussion on Second Stage at 1.30 p.m.  The 1985 Act had a guillotine applied to it by the then Coalition Government and problems arose subsequently.  I have no doubt that problems will arise from this Bill also.  I <Col N="963" /> object, therefore, to the guillotine being applied.  I also object to (1) as it seeks to exclude The Workers' Party from the 30 minutes slot.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would comment on yesterday's judgment in the High Court by Mr. Justice Hamilton in the course of which he found that the Oireachtas was in breach of its obligation under Article 16 of the Constitution to revise constituencies, especially since the publication of the results of the last census.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to my prepared script I should like to refer briefly to what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe had to say about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It ill behoves this House to deride the efforts of a voluntary organisation to create employment throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Society of St. Vincent <Col N="972" /> de Paul received £500,000 in the budget this year.  They are working on a programme of creating one job in each conference of the society throughout the country.  Over the last two to three years they succeeded in creating 630 jobs in different conferences.  I commend their efforts, as a voluntary body, in using the resources at their disposal &mdash; which happen to be worth while in terms of administrative skills on the part of people with knowledge of business and industry &mdash; in helping those in the community who are unemployed to find employment or to become self-employed.</P>
      <P>I want to commend those efforts.  I know there has been some comment in the Press and on Radio Éireann which I thought was pretty scandalous, of the lowest kind, probably brought on by the fact that at present Members feel &mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there could be a General Election in the wind and, consequently, they are grasping at any straw.</P>
      <P>It is most unfortunate that, when a voluntary body takes the trouble to undertake this task throughout all their conferences &mdash; and remember they have 10,000 voluntary workers nationwide; they constitute one enormous voluntary body &mdash; their efforts are derided.  If all the voluntary bodies, church groups and other agencies bent their wills to the creation of employment, in helping those about them in our society in the way in which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul organisation have done, there is no doubt in my mind but that we would be doing much better in the creation of employment than we are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I should point out that some of the projects they have under way are for workshops &mdash; furniture repair and other projects of that nature. It is important that that be emphasised in this House because we gave them £500,000 in the budget to assist in the development programme they have undertaken and which constitutes a new departure for their society, representing <Col N="973" /> an important change in the direction of their work.  Rather than deriding their efforts, as an Irish person, I felt humiliated listening to RTE this morning, to hear the sneering and snide remarks of their commentator about a voluntary body's efforts to create employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have decided to introduce this legislation to deal with the situation arising from the recent Supreme Court decision in relation to the 1985 Social Welfare Equal Treatment Act, pending a review of the full implications of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
      <P>The Government are concerned at the wider implications of the Supreme Court judgment which could have major budgetary repercussions.  It is necessary to take immediate action to deal with the situation arising in the current financial year so as to ensure that expenditure remains within the existing budgetary allocation.  The decision of the Supreme Court would otherwise result in an estimated additional expenditure this year of not less than £21 million and not less than £31 million in a full year.  These are conservative estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to maintain the arrangements which were made by the previous Government and enacted by the Oireachtas in 1985.  The 1985 Act was designed to implement the European Community Directive on equal treatment for men and women in the social security code.  That Act gave married women living with their husbands access to unemployment assistance in their own right for the first time.  This meant that a married woman could qualify for unemployment assistance while her husband was in receipt of an insurance or assistance payment. It was a basic principle of the 1985 <Col N="974" /> Act, however, that unemployment assistance payments should continue to be provided on the basis of the needs of the household.  This Bill maintains the principle and the clear intention of the 1985 Act that unemployment assistance payments should be provided on the basis of the needs of households.</P>
    <P>The 1985 arrangements were found by the Supreme Court to be defective in that they treated households comprised of unmarried couples more favourably than households comprised of married couples. Clearly it was never intended that this should be the case and the anomaly has only arisen as a consequence of the particular arrangements which were made at the time applying only to married couples.</P>
    <P>The basic principle embodied in the 1985 Act, that unemployment assistance to married couples should be paid on the basis of household needs, is a reasonable one and this Bill is designed to uphold this principle.  To do so, however, it is necessary in the light of the Supreme Court judgment, to also apply the principle to the small number of households comprised of unmarried cohabiting couples who qualify for unemployment assistance.  It has yet to be established how many, if any, such households are covered by this provision.  It is clear, however, that the numbers involved will not be great.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the 1985 legislation did not address this issue.  It raises the whole question of the treatment of different household situations within the social welfare code.  This is a very complex area which needs careful consideration in all its various aspects.  The Government have therefore decided on a fundamental review of the concept of the household for social welfare purposes. This examination will be carried out by a review group consisting of people who are highly qualified in this area.  It will be chaired by Mr. John Curry, who was formerly chairman of the Commission on Social Welfare.  In the light of their analysis, the Government will consider what changes are required in the social welfare system and these will be <Col N="975" /> brought forward in time for next year's budget.  At that stage, the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to consider the various issues involved in the context of the associated Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider this to be the only reasonable and realistic approach in the circumstances. In extending the present arrangements to cohabitees, we are maintaining the basic principle embodied in the 1985 Equal Treatment Act.  I do not envisage any difficulties in applying the extended arrangements.  The concept of cohabitation is not a new one as far as social welfare legislation is concerned. It already applies in a number of our schemes and its application does not give rise to any major difficulties.  It simply means that in future claimants for unemployment assistance will be required to state whether they are living as man and wife.</P>
    <P>While, in the light of the Supreme Court decision the position of cohabitation needs to be addressed immediately, it is of course only one of a number of possible household situations which can arise.  Other obvious examples are brother and sister households, parents and children both claiming or people sharing a flat.  The review group will need to look at how the social welfare system treats these different situations so that a consistent and equitable approach can be adopted for the future.  This problem already arises in relation to the fuel allowance scheme where only one allowance is paid per household although there may be several persons with individual entitlements living in the household.</P>
    <P>The requirements of equal treatment will also have to be taken on board.  The 1985 Act which provided for equal treatment necessitated further fundamental changes in the system.  To some extent this was responsible for the present difficulties in as much as the approach adopted was to discontinue the head of household concept.  It may well be that it will be necessary to reintroduce the concept in some shape or form, perhaps by requiring that one person be nominated as head of the household.  This <Col N="976" /> whole area will have to be examined by the review group and they will have to have regard to the practices applied in other countries in this matter.</P>
    <P>It will also be particularly important that the new arrangements continue to have regard to the position of households where only one spouse is claiming and the other is working in the home.  It was one of the underlying principles in the 1985 legislation that households where both spouses were in a position to claim should not be treated more favourably under the unemployment assistance system than households where only one of the couple is in a position to claim. This principle is maintained in the present Bill and is in my view an important one.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Government's approach in the social welfare area this year has been to direct the available resources to households who are in the greatest need.  There has been a particular focus on families, particularly families of the long term unemployed and families of those at work on low pay. Substantial increases in the rates of the lowest social welfare payments have been provided for which, taken together with the increases given in 1988, mean increases of almost 25 per cent in these payments.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 11 per cent increase provided to the long term unemployed and recipients of supplementary welfare allowance last year, a further special increase of 12 per cent is being provided this year and this will come into effect from July next.  In practical terms, this means that an increase of £29.10 per week has been provided to a family with five children over the past two years.</P>
    <P>At the same time, a number of other major improvements have been made in the levels of social welfare payments.  A minimum child dependent allowance of £10 per week has been introduced, child dependant allowances payable to long term social welfare recipients have been extended up to age 19 where the child continues in full time education, the higher rate of child benefit is being extended to the fifth child from October next and new social assistance schemes <Col N="977" /> are being introduced for widowers and deserted husbands who are bringing up children on their own.  The introduction of these new schemes means that the payment being made to a widower on supplementary welfare allowance with five children will increase from £80.80 per week to £115.30, a very substantial increase of £34.50 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition, major improvements in the family income supplement scheme are to come into force from July next. These include increases in the weekly income limits, increases in the maximum payments, extra payments to families with six to eight children, an increase in the rate of supplement and a reduction in the minimum number of hours of work required each week to benefit under the scheme.  For example, a family with five children with an income of £120 per week will now receive £50 a week bringing their total up to £170 per week.</P>
    <P>All these improvements in the levels of social welfare payments have been made possible through the efficient allocation of resources in a fair and equitable manner.  This approach has enabled us to more than maintain the real value of social welfare payments and provide significant additional resources to those on the lowest levels of payment especially families on long term unemployment assistance.  At the same time, we have simplified the system through the streamlining of the various rates payable in respect of dependants.  Over the past two years, the number of different rates payable in respect of children have been reduced from 36 to 12 and the number of rates payable in respect of adult dependants have been reduced from ten to six.</P>
    <P>These improvements have demonstrated the Government's commitment to improving the position of families and to directing a substantial amount of resources to them.  Over the last two years an additional £257 million has been specifically allocated by the Government for improvements in the social welfare area.  In these circumstances, the comments of some of our opponents are ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, where <Col N="978" /> both of a married couple are entitled to a social insurance payment in their own right, each receives the full personal rate of payment.  The limitation provided for in section 12 of the 1985 Act, only applies where one or both of the couple are entitled to unemployment assistance. This reflects the underlying objective of the unemployment assistance scheme which is to provide a level of financial support in the case of unemployment which is related to the needs of the household. The fact that the payment is needs based means that households with similar needs should receive the same level of financial support.  This point was emphasised when the 1985 Act was being introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Barry Desmond.  He stated at the time that the unemployment assistance scheme is clearly a family household type scheme because the income of the spouse is taken into account in assessing the means of the claimant.  He considered that the provisions of section 12 were necessary to prevent the scheme from being used as a general top up on family income and to avoid inequalities in the level of payments provided to families in different circumstances but with similar needs.</P>
    <P>It was also necessary to ensure that implementation of the equality Directive did not give rise to any discrimination against married women working in the home.  If the limitation provided for in section 12 were not applied, married couples where both spouses are available for work would receive a substantially higher payment than the vast majority of other married couples where one spouse, either by choice or by necessity, works in the home.  This would be in total conflict with the needs based nature of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>The level of unemployment assistance payable must be related to the needs of the claimant and it would be inequitable to provide households with identical needs with different levels of payment. It is clearly evident that a couple living together, especially married couples, are financially interdependent.  All of the <Col N="979" /> main living costs such as housing, fuel, household goods etc., are shared and there are obvious economies involved. International research carried out on equivalence scales suggests that the appropriate social welfare rate for a couple living together is about 1.6 times the rate for a single person.  This view was also shared by the Commission on Social Welfare which recommended that the appropriate payment for a couple should be 1.6 times the personal rate. The current rates of payment following this year's budget increases are in line with this.</P>
    <P>The overall task of the review group which is being established will be to examine the social welfare code as it affects households with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions.  This will necessitate a fundamental review of the provisions for the assessment of means for needs based social assistance schemes as applied in different household situations.  It will also be necessary to review the limitations on payments applied to different household situations. It is intended that the review will be concluded within the next six months so as to enable the Government to consider whatever changes are required in the context of next year's budget.  It is envisaged that the necessary changes will be introduced in the associated social welfare Bill.  I believe that this review provides us with an ideal opportunity to reform our payment structure so as to bring about greater consistency in the treatment of households with similar needs through the various social assistance schemes.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the group for consenting to participate in the review.  I know that they each bring with them a wealth of expertise in their respective fields and I look forward with great interest to the results of their work.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill remedies the defect identified by the Supreme Court by extending the provisions of section 12 (4) of the 1985 Act to unmarried couples who are cohabiting as man and wife. There are two subsections in section 12 <Col N="980" /> which are being amended.  Section 12 (1) provides that where both of a married couple are entitled to unemployment assistance, the overall amount of assistance payable to the couple would be limited to what they would receive if only one spouse claimed and received an increase in respect of the other as an adult dependant.  The Act provided that each of the couple would receive half of the appropriate &ldquo;married&rdquo; rate of assistance. Section 12 (4) of the Act provided that where one spouse is in receipt of a benefit or pension and the other is in receipt of unemployment assistance the overall payment made to the couple would be limited to what they would receive if the spouse entitled to the higher benefit or pension payment claimed and received an increase in respect of an adult dependant. In this instance, the Act provided that the payment to the spouse entitled to assistance would be reduced in order to stay within this limitation.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment concerned section 12 (4) only and in its judgment of 9 May 1989 the Supreme Court found that this subsection was defective in that it treated married couples less favourably than cohabiting couples. While section 12 (1) was not at issue in these proceedings, this subsection, which limits the entitlements of married couples in exactly the same way, must also be regarded as defective.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the limitation is to be applied, however, in cases where one of a couple is in receipt of benefit or pension and the other is in receipt of unemployment assistance is being changed.  Under the provisions of the 1985 Act, the amount payable to a couple in these circumstances was limited to the &ldquo;married&rdquo; rate of the higher social insurance payment.  Following on this year's budget increases, the long term rate of unemployment assistance will exceed the basic rate of unemployment and disability benefit.  The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to allow a person to have the benefit of whichever is the higher rate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that any claims for unemployment assistance made on or <Col N="981" /> after the date of the Supreme Court judgment will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the amended section 12.  This section also provides that married couples to whom the provisions of section 12 applied, who have not submitted claims in writing or initiated court proceedings for an increased rate of unemployment assistance prior to the date of the judgment will not be entitled to retrospective payment.</P>
    <P>By virtue of section 2, the provisions of the amended section 12 will apply to couples cohabiting as man and wife with effect from 9 May 1989.  Section 3 provides that any such person who may have benefited from the higher rate of payment will not be liable to repay any payments made under the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the arrangements the Government are making in this Bill are in my view reasonable, responsible and fair.  The immediate anomaly is being addressed and at the same time the wider implications are being considered in a calm and sensible way.  In this way the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to consider the full implications and make adequate provision for any necessary changes in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

They are not being criticised and it was altogether wrong and unfair of the Minister to put forward this spurious defence, basically when he is trying to defend himself.

While I have major reservations about the manner in which the Minister has handled this issue, as a member of a responsible Opposition, I recognise the need for urgent legislation following the Supreme Court decisions and, accordingly, I will not be opposing this Bill.</P>
      <P>Because the Minister did not take into account the probability of a court defeat at the time of the preparation of the Estimates, he has left himself with no room for manoeuvre financially to enable him to do what we would all wish him to do, to increase the amount rather than reduce it.  Accordingly, he has left himself no option but to preside over a pathetic approach resulting in the actual reduction of amounts paid to an indeterminate number of couples who are cohabiting. The Minister, therefore, has taken the soft option in introducing this Bill.  In many ways it is clear that it was an option which at this stage he had to take because he did not have the planning or the foresight at the time of the preparation of the Estimates last October to make due preparations to enable him to follow any other course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position we find ourselves in leads to a much broader question, that is, the manner in which the shambles of our social welfare code is being amended. Essentially, it is very clear to me that amendments are court-driven and not need-driven.  What we are dealing with today is another anomaly in a long series <Col N="984" /> of anomalies highlighted by the courts. This points to the absolute urgency of a major overhaul of our entire social welfare code.  Virtually every change of consequence is dictated as a result of court decisions and not as a result of a policy decision by the Government.  Our social welfare code has been developed over the years in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion and now we have this spectacle of the Minister, like the Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke, trying to patch over the hole that has been created as a result of the court decision.  The Minister is putting another patch in the patchwork quilt that constitutes our social welfare code.  It has been my consistent view since I assumed responsibility for this portfolio that that is utterly the wrong approach.  What we need is an overall review of our social welfare code, a streamlining of that code so that we will have a fair and just system. This will not be achieved by the kind of knee-jerk Pavlovian response of the Minister to crises as they arise.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has set up a review group and this is a good decision.  I have every confidence in the members of the review group but why is this only being done now?  As I mentioned, it is almost a year and a half since the High Court adjudicated on the Hyland case.  I am quite sure the Minister had advice from his legal team that the prospects of the High Court decision being overturned in the Supreme Court were very slim indeed.  Why then did the Minister not take action following the High Court decision?  Why did he leave it until now to set up this review group?  Again, it was a hasty response to the decision of the Supreme Court and one that indicates there was no strategic thinking of any description on the part of the Minister or the Government as to how the social welfare code should be framed or shaped for the future or how in particular the huge series of anomalies in the code should be ironed out.  Therefore, we end up with the Minister marking time by grafting onto that shambles of a social welfare code a provision which will leave him and his civil servants policing the bedrooms of the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> This arises, of course, because of the provision in section 1 (5) which defines a couple as a married couple who are living together or a man and a woman who are not married to each other but who are cohabiting as man and wife.  It is very interesting that there is no definition of cohabitation in the Bill and this raises a very major question as to the Bill's workability.  The Minister said there was a reference to cohabitation already in the social welfare code.  What he did not say is that the reference is in an old statute, again without definition.</P>
    <P>Also left unsaid by the Minister is that there are no Departmental guidelines, no written instructions to social welfare officers as to the basis on which cohabitation is to be considered proved or otherwise. I understand that in investigating this matter social welfare officers will look at who is living in the house and the position about one person supporting the other or not, but at the end of the day there are no guidelines as to how cohabitation is to be established, so we are now in the ludicrous situation that we do not have a statutory definition nor have we Departmental guidelines on this issue. The House deserves an explanation from the Minister as to how this provision is to be enforced.  At this stage we have no idea at all as to how that will be done.</P>
    <P>The position of the Minister in hastily producing this legislation is further highlighted by the fact that he has not got a clue as to the number of people involved. He has stated this clearly in his speech. He has no option, so in many ways he is taking a leap in the dark, making provisions for cohabiting couples without having the slightest idea as to the number of people involved.  The best he can say in his speech is that he does not believe the number is very great.  Are we talking about an estimate of 100, 1,000 or 10,000?  The Minister owes an explanation to this House as to how many people he anticipates will be affected by his decision.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court and the position in which the Minister now finds himself must, even at this late stage perhaps in the twilight of this Dáil, bring <Col N="986" /> even him to the conclusion that the entire system must be overhauled.  There must be an approach which will involve searching out and then eliminating the poverty traps and the anomalies in the system. There must be a major effort to remove the disincentives to job creation in the system.  Above all, there must be a clear approach on the part of this Government &mdash; or if we cannot get it from this Government, the next one &mdash; to improving the lot of those in greatest need.  This Bill is no substitute at all for that kind of approach, that major overhaul leading to a fairer, more streamlined system.</P>
    <P>The Bill arose as a result of a constitutional case taken by the Hyland family.  It is incumbent on all of us in this House to be seen to observe fully the letter and spirit of the Constitution. There are other issues involved in that at present which I will not go into, but since this Bill arose as a result of a constitutional decision it has to be examined itself from the point of view of its constitutionality. I am not a constitutional lawyer but it seems to me that there are at least grounds for suspecting this new Bill itself is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the Bill creates a further discrimination.  On the face of it we now have a capping of the payments to a man and a woman who are cohabiting but this capping does not apply to other men and women who would be residing in the same dwelling but who would not be cohabiting.  I am speaking of, say, a father and daughter, brother and sister or a boyfriend and his fiancée who might be under the same roof but might be conforming to the highest moral standards. What then is there for those?  They may be incorrectly, improperly and unfairly found to be cohabiting.  That would be an injustice in itself.  On the other hand, if they are not so found they will be entitled to the full, separate payments but they would be at a higher level than for the pair who are married despite the fact that they are under the one roof. Their outgoings might be, therefore, less, as the Minister explained in his speech.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not a constitutional expert but it appears to me there are <Col N="987" /> grounds for suspecting that this measure designed to cover a constitutional loophole, may itself be unconstitutional.  In the interests of good order and good government this Bill should be referred to the President with a request that it be referred to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking about the constitutional aspect, the court which decides the constitutionality of a Bill in that situation is the Supreme Court.  If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting this Bill may be unconstitutional, the proper thing is to have its constitutionality decided on by the Supreme Court.  Accordingly, I am suggesting to the Minister that this is the proper course of action to follow.</P>
      <P>Leading on from that, it seems that the constitutionality of a number of provisions of the social welfare code may be open to question.  I am aware there are quite a number of cases before the court on the basis that different provisions of the social welfare code are unconstitutional. Therefore, my second proposal is that as part of the social welfare system there is need to review the working of different aspects of the system from a constitutional point of view.  This is necessary so that policy can then be established within clear constitutional parameters.  I am saying this at this time because I can envisage, perhaps not the present incumbent, but a Minister for Social Welfare in the future coming into this House, again in response to some other court case, telling me he is doing this very thing.  It should be done now because it would be of major assistance in establishing a clear policy for social welfare reform in the future.  At the very minimum we should be aware of the constitutional parameters within which we can operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further aspect of the Minister's speech which has to be referred to is the question of the figures and the amounts. I am worried that the figures that have <Col N="988" /> been produced in relation to this problem may be quite misleading.  On the face of it we have to accept that the Minister is giving us correct estimates from his Department.  He tells us that the decision of the Supreme Court would result in additional expenditure of not less than £31 million in a full year.  Normally one accepts figures from Ministers as being correct but he has provided no breakdown and he owes us an explanation as to how the figure is made up.  I understand there are 8,000 married couples whose payments are capped under the 1985 legislation.  Taking an average of £14 per week to level up, those payments would produce an annual expenditure of £5 million. There is a very substantial gap between those two figures.  At the very minimum the Minister owes the House an explanation as to how the other figure was floated into the reckoning.  If the problem could be resolved by levelling up at a cost of £5 million, it could be accommodated within the financial parameters. I accept that the figure of £31 million which the Minister did not have the foresight to provide for in the Estimates would be virtually impossible to include.  A figure of £5 million is a different matter.  The Minister should say how he computed his figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also explain how he intends to deal with the right to privacy. Last week we debated a Bill introduced by the Fine Gael Party to establish the right to privacy for social welfare applicants and other people in public offices in discussing their affairs with public officials.  Despite the initial reaction of the Government in opposing the Bill, perhaps for reasons which fit into a broader scenario, they caved in and accepted the principle of the Bill.  The Minister should explain the extent to which there will be an invasion of privacy as a consequence of this Bill.  What will be the extent of the power of a social welfare officer to make inquiries to establish cohabitation?  Is the Minister putting the social welfare officers in an entirely invidious position, establishing them as official peeping Toms?  That is the kind of question that arises in relation to the <Col N="989" /> workability of the cohabitation provision and the Minister must give an explanation as to how he expects the provision to be implemented without an invasion of privacy.</P>
    <P>A contradictory approach has been adopted in this Bill when compared with the approach adopted in tax legislation. We do not have an integration of the tax and social welfare systems, which would be the obvious answer to many anomalies. The Minister does not seem to be aware that the Murphy case regarding the tax issue resulted in an entirely different response from the Government of the day.  We now have the ludicrous position that couples may be treated as married under the social welfare code and paid accordingly and yet treated as single under the tax code, their allowances being diminished accordingly.  That is an entirely inconsistent and contradictory approach.  It exemplifies the lack of any consistent approach by this Government in looking at the position of people under the tax and social welfare codes in a comprehensive way.  The Minister has had to introduce hasty legislation in response to the Supreme Court decision, without having given full thought to the consequences.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill is a typical piece of Fianna Fáil juggling.  It is another chapter in the saga begun by the Taoiseach in 1979 when he produced his Irish solution to an Irish problem.  All of us have a duty to ensure, whatever our views on the substance of legislation, that what goes through this House is as far as possible in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not a clue as to the number of people who will be affected by this Bill.  It is clear that some people will suffer hardship as a consequence of the Minister's approach.  There is a duty on him to propose transitional bridging arrangements which would at least ease the adjustment of those directly affected by the provisions of this Bill.  He should give a commitment that through the supplementary welfare system or otherwise provisions will be established to cater for the exceptional needs of those directly affected.  That is the very minimum the <Col N="990" /> Minister should do by way of recompense to whatever number of people are involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left himself open to criticism because of the rushed manner in which this Bill has been introduced. He has left himself no room for financial manoeuvre and he has forced me and others in this House into a position where we must accept the urgent need for legislation. Nevertheless the Minister has raised many issues as a consequence of his action, the legacy of which will have to be tidied up by his successor as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that this legislation is being rushed through the Dáil.  I understand the reasons for it but I sympathise with the Minister because I believe many loopholes will be found in this Bill as time goes by.  I would ask the Minister to monitor this legislation very carefully and to amend it immediately if hardship is shown to result.  This is a very sensitive area.  In other countries criteria are set down regarding cohabitation.  The Supplementary Social Welfare Act of 1976 in Great Britain sets down the criteria in Schedule I, Part III, 1 (b) as follows: there must be a common household; there must be stability in the relationship; there must be financial support; there must be a sexual relationship; there must be children and there must be public acknowledgement of the relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let me know exactly the kind of criteria to be set down here regarding cohabitation.  Before the Department of Social Welfare make a decision in regard to cohabitation they must be furnished with a report from the social welfare officer. How is he to obtain information that is not given voluntarily?  This legislation will be unenforceable for a number of reasons.  The social welfare officers will not have the necessary time to observe cases and provide the information that is essential if they are to stand over their reports.  It would be an imposition of additional duties on social welfare and <Col N="991" /> community welfare officers who must, when they get a request for assistance, wait and watch the family.  It is a very difficult and sensitive area and it would be most difficult for social welfare and community welfare officers to enforce this legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation is being rushed through the House without careful consideration and assessment of the whole situation. For instance, what happens when the views of the community welfare officer and those of the social welfare officer conflict on the question of cohabitation? What is the deciding factor then?  A social welfare officer can establish the fact of cohabitation but the person involved can go to the community welfare officer in the health board and apply for assistance and get it because the community welfare officer has a doubt about cohabitation. Such a person can then apply for various other allowances such as rent allowances and things of that kind, resulting in additional cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I am questioning the criteria rather than anything else in the Bill.  I wonder how often deciding officers will have to seek legal advice on this matter and how often cases will go before the courts? That will be additional cost on the State to defend their views on the question of cohabitation.  We saw protesters outside the door this morning.  I do not believe in their protest but they have many views which I would like to hear to establish what we really mean by cohabitation.  I would not like to be the welfare officer who has to adjudicate on such matters because there will be many innocent victims.</P>
    <P>In the recent past several health boards have sought legal advice in relation to certain provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Some of this legal advice centered around aggregation of means of spouses who have not gone through a marriage service but are living together.  The legal advice the boards received was that the community welfare officers could not aggregate the means of couples living together who did not go through a marriage ceremony.  What <Col N="992" /> measures does the Minister propose to introduce to cover these cases in future? I have found nothing in the Bill to cover this and every day of the week community welfare and social welfare officers are looking for legal advice on certain cases before making a decision.  One has only to check with the various offices to know that is the case.  Hours are spent in deciding what decision community officers must make in areas like establishing the fact of cohabitation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hold up the House because we only have until 1 o'clock and I would like to give other Deputies an opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill.  I was glad to hear the Minister announce the setting up of a review group.  It is long overdue.  We have been advocating simplifying the whole social welfare system and it is a pity that before this review group report back, further legislation is being introduced resulting in more complications.  The Minister probably has a reason; he is looking for additional moneys, but how much money was saved last year as a result of the Department's attack on abuse?  It was well over £40 million.  Why is this money not being redirected into areas like those we are talking about this morning?</P>
    <P>When one throws a net to catch the abusers, innocent people are bound to be caught up in it.  The sensible way to approach this difficulty is to fully implement the spirit of the EC Directive and comply with the 1985 Social Welfare Act whereby the State fully recognised that men and women, married or unmarried, should have equal access to an adequate income from the State to meet their domestic needs.  Even if this additional measure would cost an estimated £31 million it could be made up by more prudent management and the simplification of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Children do not have any choice as to whether their parents are married but they will now be financially deprived of substantial amounts of social welfare payments, payments which are generally recognised as doing little to alleviate the <Col N="993" /> appalling levels of poverty in this country. The Minister should carefully monitor this legislation.  In quite a short time we will see a lot of hardship and the children are usually the victims.  I have made inquiries from social welfare offices, from community welfare offices and so on and I have been informed that they cannot administer this Bill which seeks to turn them into a sort of peeping Tom for the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not condone the abuses.  I have stood up here on many occasions to support the Minister's attack on social welfare abuses.  I would urge the Minister to be very cautious in the way this legislation is administered.  I am afraid that the children will be the sufferers because of this legislation.  The Minister should monitor this to ensure that children do not suffer just because this legislation is being rushed through the Dáil to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to go to the country tomorrow morning.  Within weeks of the passage of this legislation, possibly even during the election campaign, this legislation will inflict hardship and we will have little hope of coming back to the House during that period.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure that the legislation is administered carefully.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the British social welfare system which sets down a very definite criteria with regard to cohabitation.  I believe this criteria is also used in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of important points to be made on this Bill but first I would refer to the opening remarks of the Minister in relation to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The Labour Party are well aware of the tremendous work done by this organisation throughout the country.  I am particularly aware of their work in my constituency.  On a daily basis they deal with people in a quiet, dignified and private way.  It is unfortunate that this matter has come in for the type of discussion and comments that have been made over the last few days.  I agree that every assistance should be given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  If I were to choose an organisation charged with <Col N="994" /> the responsibility with which they are charged, an organisation who carry out their function very well under their charter, the organisation I would choose would be the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I join with other Members of the House in putting on record our full support for and commitment to this society.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being dealt with wrongly.  I do not blame the media for an impression that is being created with regard to the Hyland family.  The media are putting across a view but, as a result of statements emanating from Government sources and the Minister's Department, there is the impression that the Hyland family, who took this famous case and won it against all the odds, have done something wrong.  That is the impression being created in the minds of the general public. It is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts.  The case does not relate to what married couples did wrong or to what cohabitors did wrong, but to what the Oireachtas did by not correcting a situation that was wrong from the beginning. It is immaterial whether we blame one Government or another, or one Minister or another.</P>
      <P>At one stage we went to a Minister with a deputation &mdash; and it was not Deputy Desmond &mdash; and pointed out a number of anomalies that existed in relation to EC equality measures.  The deputation were not listened to at that time and we have not been listened to since.  The EC equality measures were forced in, in November 1986.  There were two Fianna Fáil Governments in power prior to that and neither Minister for Social Welfare applied the EC directive.  It was only when there would have been numerous cases before the European Courts, that the Government were forced to apply the directive in a way designed to save the maximum amount of money, as all legislation is applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure this morning has only one purpose and that is to save money. It is not designed to correct an anomaly following a High Court decision.  It will create many more anomalies which will <Col N="995" /> hang around the neck of whatever Minister will handle social welfare.  We cannot cure or resolve an injustice by creating another.  In most cases cohabiting couples cannot remarry because of the laws of the State and are forced to live together. Effectively, they are being measured by their morals in this Bill.  This is not a moral issue.  Moral issues should be dealt with by the churches and not in social welfare legislation.  Whether they should live together is a matter for them to decide.  There is no law on the Statute Book which states that they cannot do so.  I am a perfectly happily married man with a family and I intend to stay that way.  I am not encouraging people to go off and live together but I am saying because of the laws of the land people are forced to live together, against their will in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>We are putting them up to ridicule and creating the impression in the minds of the public that the issue is the morals of people cohabiting.  I can assure the House that we will be opposing this Bill and will call on our other Opposition partners to do the same.  There has been enough talk about what the Government have not done and what they should be doing. Today we reach the crunch and decide whether we put it to the Government collectively that they are either right or wrong in robbing over 80,000 married couples of their rights.  That is what this Bill is designed to do.  It is designed to take £14 per week out of the pockets of properly and duly married couples.  Let us call a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>Those protesting outside the gates have called it the snooper's charter.  This obnoxious legislation which should never have come before this House is no more nor no less than that.  These people have rightly challenged, in accordance with the Constitution, an anomaly which was pointed out in paragraph 9.4 of the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare and by me on behalf of my own party on a number of occasions.  It was pointed out by a commission set up by Deputy Desmond when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  We are now into the third <Col N="996" /> year of the term of office of this Government and this anomaly has not yet been corrected.</P>
    <P>The Hyland couple decided to exercise their democratic and constitutional right and take the case to the courts.  They won their case, and won it on behalf of all married couples not just on their own behalf.  I have been involved with social welfare appeal boards for the last 30 years and as every Member of this House knows, as the departmental officials and the Minister know, the rule is that one always takes a test case.  One does not go ahead with 80,000 test cases on any aspect of social welfare.  One selects one, two or three cases, depending on the numbers involved.  Therefore, it automatically follows that the favourable decision reached in the Hyland case should apply in all similar cases.  That is the principle, a principle which we have adhered to since the foundation of the State.  We are breaking that tradition with this legislation and it is a dangerous precedent to set in this House.</P>
    <P>This course of action does not allow or encounter people to exercise their constitutional rights.  Most of the defective legislation passed through this House was in the social welfare area.  It was pointed out recently by The Workers' Party that 12 cases were turned about.  They are correct in their assessment.  We are robbing people of their right to challenge bad legislation or bad sections of bad legislation in the courts.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is that if they take their case at great expense right up to the Supreme Court we will simply bring further bad legislation into Dáil Éireann, overrule the decision and wipe away the views of the major court of the State.  The court which defends the democratic and constitutional rights of the people is being interfered with this morning, and it is being interfered with on financial and monetary grounds.  We are putting a price on democracy and on the constitutional rights of the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The question of cost is secondary.  It was well known that this case was before the courts and that the Commission on Social Welfare had pointed out this <Col N="997" /> anomaly.  It was also well known to those of us involved in the area of social welfare that the case being put forward by this couple was a very good one and that the court would rule in their favour.  That was the view of all the legal people involved and the experts who knew anything about social welfare.  It had been suggested to me that provision had been made in the Estimates for this but I have some doubts about this now.  It seems that a deliberate attempt is being made to circumvent &mdash; let us call a spade a spade &mdash; the decision of the highest court in the land by introducing further bad legislation.  It is obvious that this decision will be challenged in the European Court when we will be the laughing stock of the European Community. This is the only country in the European Community which does not have equality measures in respect of husbands and wives.  They should be classified and dealt with individually and not messed around in the manner we propose this morning.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not designed to correct an anomaly.  It is designed to take £14 per week out of the pockets of every married couple.  I hope this message gets across rather than that the Hyland couple, with every married couple who claim equality or wish to claim equality with cohabiting couples, have done something wrong.</P>
    <P>The question is how do we decide whether a couple are cohabiting.  The two previous speakers have referred to this issue.  The Minister should tell me how he is going to decide.  In my home town and county, and particularly in Dublin city as the Acting Chairman will know, men and women share three, four, five, or six room flats.  How are we going to determine which couples are living together?  Will it be possible for a man and woman to talk together in the one room, never mind to have sex together? The only way we would be able to decide is on the criteria laid down in British legislation which has failed miserably and on which this Bill is based.  This is defective legislation and will not work.</P>
    <P>You cannot really define people who are cohabiting.  Do you employ an army <Col N="998" /> of social welfare snoopers?  There are already enough of them operating.  Will this be a new army of bedroom snoopers sent to find what is happening between two people living in the one building? They will have to establish whether a couple is sleeping together.  If they are, they will have to determine whether it is for one, two or three weeks or three months.  How do we define whether they are cohabitating?  We have enough problems at present with community and social welfare officers dealing with all kinds of claims in regard to social welfare benefit without introducing the element of cohabitation.</P>
    <P>We are now introducing another huge layer of bad legislation which will make it impossible for social and community welfare officers to carry out their duties. Already &mdash; and the Members know this &mdash; there is a six to eight week delay in the processing of unemployment assistance cases in every employment exchange from Cork city to County Louth.  How do we overcome that problem?  We should employ more people within the social welfare code but we cannot do that because of the embargo on public service recruitment.  Indeed, those already working in the Department of Social Welfare are being offered early retirement and redundancy.  This was brought in under the so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Obviously, as a result, there has been a reduction in the number of people operating in the Department of Social Welfare, and that came across quite clearly from the trade unions representing the officials advising us today. They pointed out at their union conferences what was happening and yet we are introducing legislation which will demand an army of social welfare officers to implement.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>With a general election pending, it is hard to see how this will be justified to the electorate.  I hazard a guess that in Dublin city and elsewhere every married couple in this category will vote against the candidate of the Minister's party, and I would not blame them because a fairly substantial sum of money is involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The provision in regard to retrospection put paid to any doubts I had in relation to this legislation.  It convinced me beyond all reasonable doubt that this was bad legislation because it incorporated the provision that retrospection can never again be secured by a person or persons going through the courts.  What happens if the Hylands decide &mdash; as they may do &mdash; to challenge this further in the European Court?  They will win their case because the anomaly was pointed out by a commission set up by the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>How will those of us who will be reelected feel when, in two year's time, the European Court will rule in favour of this couple and all the others affected by the Bill?  Who will foot the bill?  What legislation will we put through the Dáil to overcome or get around the decision of the European Court?  In accordance with an EC Directive, applied in November 1986, it was corrected by a decision of our Supreme Court.  It may in the short-term save £21 million to £31 million, but that is the wrong way to put it as we have been cheating married couples out of £21 million per year.  It is almost as if the decision of the Supreme Court was giving them £21 million to which they were not entitled.  On the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court they would get £21 million to which they were entitled from November 1986 and which should have been applied by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1984 when the directive came through.  These people are claiming that they should be paid retrospectively to the date on which the case was submitted to the courts but they are legally entitled to it under European law.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on that and not to blame any particular Minister or Government.  Every Government have perpetrated an injustice. Maybe the present Minister is making the same mistake as a result of bad advice from his officials, perhaps he is accepting the advice in order to save money, but what about the £88 million taken out of the pockets of social welfare recipients? What about the bonus scheme operated <Col N="1000" /> by some medical officers within the Department?  They are disallowing social welfare benefits as a result of a cursory examination.</P>
    <P>It has been reported to me that on one day about 26 people were refused social welfare benefits and forced to appeal. The only factor on which the decision was taken was to feel their pulse or take their blood pressure.  It did not matter if a person had only one leg, a major illness like cancer or tuberculosis or a malfunction of the liver or kidneys.  It did not matter if a person presented the doctor with all sorts of evidence from a specialist to say that he or she was not fit for work, the idea seems to be to take them out of the system to save about £88 million.  Of course it may be justified to take some people off benefit but these cases are rare.</P>
    <P>There was no provision in the budget for saving £88 million so that amount saved on social welfare goes back to Government coffers.  However, when £21 million to £31 million is due to people and squarely in accordance with the law, we rush through legislation, 24 hours before calling an election, when the House has no opportunity of going into it in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister, he has to put the best face forward.  He said that there had been an increase in social welfare, and that is true.  However, a percentage increase of nothing is nothing, no matter what you call it.  Even assuming that there was an increase of 25 per cent in social welfare benefits during that period it is important to point out that there was a 100 per cent increase in differential rents in the last two weeks, a 100 per cent increase in rents paid by old age pensioners, a 100 per cent increase in rents paid by widows with children and a 100 per cent increase in rents paid by those on unemployment assistance.  That is what the instruction of the Department of the Environment to local authorities has achieved.  The majority of social welfare recipients will receive an increase of £1.80 from the first pay day in July but from next week or the following week, they will have to pay a minimum increase <Col N="1001" /> of £2.60 in their rent.  On my calculations that represents a net decrease in their income of 80p per week.  Those people will not be receiving a 25 per cent increase and the majority of those on differential and fixed rents face a 100 per cent increase in their rents.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where social welfare recipients are paying more in differential rents than they would be if they were buying their houses on a purchase scheme.  That is crazy and it would only happen in Ireland.  It is hard to imagine that people who will be paid a 25 per cent increase in their benefits will be asked to pay a 100 per cent increase in their rents and that many of them will be paying more in rent than they would have to if they were buying their house.  It is misleading to say that those people are being given an increase of 25 per cent in their benefits.  The Minister is misleading the electorate, even on the eve of an election.  That is deplorable.</P>
    <P>In many ways I admire what the Minister had done in regard to social welfare but it is important to point out that since he took office he issued 25 regulations the vast bulk of which tightened up on social welfare benefits like a screwdriver tightens a screw.  The result is that it is virtually impossible for some categories to obtain social welfare benefits.  The qualification period has been increased some 400 per cent but there was no mention of that by the Minister this morning. The minimum qualification period has been increased and the ceiling reduced. The period of payment has been restricted. Those changes have taken place under regulations introduced by the Minister and those regulations did not go through the House but details of them were issued to managers of employment exchanges by way of ministerial order. Members of the House became aware of the changes when constituents approached them to complain that they had not received benefit for one reason or another.  For God's sake, we should not refer to a 25 per cent increase; we are talking about a reduction of £14 per week in benefits paid to all married couples in this category.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell has extended the scope of the debate significantly in his efforts to deny that progress has been made in the area of social welfare in the last two years.  He has forced me to take issue with him on a number of matters.  He did not deal with the topic before us but went on to complain about local authority rents and so on.  In view of that it is necessary to refer to some of the changes that have taken place in the area of social welfare. Deputy Bell must be aware, and undoubtedly would admit it in private, that Dr. Woods is a most innovative Minister.  That has been recognised by most people.  All parties accept that he has eliminated many anomalies.  The Government have had to introduce this legislation arising out of the recent Supreme Court decision and the Minister dealt with many other anomalies in the last two years.  For example, the anomaly in regard to widows' pensions had been knocked about for many years and nobody had the enthusiasm to deal with it until Deputy Woods took office.  When I was elected to this House and got involved in the committee reviewing social welfare benefits I was amazed to find that we had 36 different rates of child benefit payment.  That was incredible.  I am sure the public are not aware of it. However, last year the Minister cut the figure to 24 and reduced it further, to 12, this year.  What is more important is that the allowances were rounded upwards. There was no saving to the Department and it was wrong of Deputy Bell to infer that there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years we have had the ludicrous position in regard to urban and rural rates of payment for the long term unemployed but the Minister has changed that.  Again, he rounded the payments to the higher level of the two.  The Minister streamlined rates for adult dependant allowances from five different rates to two rates and again, he rounded the payments upwards.  If we are to tell the public the bad news, like Deputy Bell was preaching, we must also make them aware of the many innovations and changes that have taken place under Deputy Woods. <Col N="1003" /> These cost £71 million this year.  The Minister sought, and obtained, support for his programme of change.  There was a little nit-picking at the outset but, generally speaking, Deputy Bell and others admitted in private that changes were long overdue.  For many years members of health boards, and others, have been preaching about the need to extend the free electricity scheme for the elderly.  I can recall pleading for a change in that scheme seven years ago and suggesting that the elderly should be permitted to carry unused units from one billing period to another.  Previous Ministers told me that that would be too costly for the Department and the ESB but Deputy Woods was able to change the scheme.  I could carry on for an hour outlining the changes made by the Minister in the last two years.  It is very unfair of Deputy Bell, and others, to suggest that welcome and long over due changes were not made by Deputy Woods.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that I am very worried about many of the decisions of the Judiciary in the last eight or nine years.  Those court decisions have cost us more than £600 million to date and many of them were contrary to the wishes of the House.  I would be worried about the Judiciary deciding what is right or wrong in regard to social welfare and other areas.  The House should endeavour to produce correct legislation at all times. Unfortunately, Deputy Bell and his colleagues, did not get their legislation right in 1985 with the result that our budgetary targets have been upset.  The Minister has adopted a wise course of action in not just dealing with the immediate problem but in deciding to establish a review group to look at the change in society in the context of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Rapid and radical changes are taking place in society, some of which we could not have imagined happening 12 or 15 years ago, and these changes have to be dealt with.  Throughout Europe the standard practice is to take a household as a unit, no matter what the circumstances are or the relationship of the people living in the household to one <Col N="1004" /> another, and deal with it on that basis.  In Ireland the primary grouping has always been the family and I am sure no one here would genuinely wish people who cohabit together to get a greater degree of benefit than a family unit.  I do not think the general public would favour that and my knowledge &mdash; and I am not that long in the senior league in politics &mdash; from mixing with my constituents is that they would not like to see that happening. There has to be change in that area and we need to go further than the single case dealt with by the court.  There will be a knock-on effect in dozens of different areas and there is a need for us to look at the overall situation.  I recommend that in future we should take a household as a unit regardless of the marital or other status of the people in that household, recognise the needs of the household, compensate them accordingly and make benefit available to them.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to knock the Minister and say that people are being deprived of X million of pounds to which they are entitled.  It is taxpayers' money which Deputy Bell and others are floating around and because it is their money we are recirculating we need to be very careful about how we do this.  The minimum estimate needed to implement the changes under one heading in the court decision would be £21 million for this year alone.  If this is done there will be a number of knock-on effects which could not be catered for at this time and I believe the Minister &mdash; and no other Minister has so humanitarian an approach &mdash; has taken the correct decision.  I strongly support the adoption of his recommendation and the setting up of a proper grouping to examine future payments and I recommend that this should be done in terms of a household unit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Social Welfare <Col N="1005" /> (No. 2) Bill, 1989, as the Bill is in breach of the spirit of the EC Directive on Social Welfare Equalisation, will cause additional hardship for people on already inadequate incomes, will give rise to further anomalies and is an unacceptable response to the Supreme Court decision in the Hyland case&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I want to express once again my regret that this House saw fit to apply a guillotine to this debate.  A guillotine was applied to the debate on the Social Welfare Act, which is being amended today, with the consequent effect that there was insufficient debate at that time and the various anomalies, and not just this one, which arose have had to be dealt with by way of the introduction of provisions to cushion the effects that arose.  It is not a good way of doing the business of this Dáil to rush through legislation like this which effectively denies many Members of this House who have a wide experience of dealing with social welfare the opportunity to make a contribution and to point out the practical difficulties which can arise with regard to legislation, particularly in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>I regard this as one of the most shameful and disgraceful pieces of legislation to have been brought before the Dáil by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The reaction of a government with any shred of integrity or humanity would have been to increase the levels of unemployment assistance payable to married couples to bring it into line with the amounts paid to non-married couples.  Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil, true to their nature, have chosen to further impoverish people on already inadequate incomes.  This Bill is a fitting epitaph for a Government who have consistently pursued a policy of making the rich richer and the poor and everyone else poorer.  They have spent the past two and a half years hitting the old, the sick and the handicapped.  What more appropriate way for them to end their reign than by hitting the poor on social welfare?</P>
    <P>On the evening of the Supreme Court decision the Department of Social Welfare clearly indicated they intended to <Col N="1006" /> prepare legislation to provide for additional payments for married couples but this plan was apparently personally vetoed by the Taoiseach.  The Bill before us should be rejected &mdash; and here I should like to say how regrettable it is that the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats have apparently decided they are not going to oppose this Bill &mdash; because it is clearly in conflict with the spirit of the EC directive on social welfare equalisation and will also give rise to all sorts of ludicrous anomalies.</P>
    <P>For instance, a brother and sister sharing the same house or flat and sharing all living expenses will now receive a higher level of unemployment assistance than a married couple.  House sharing arrangements where people share expenses are now quite common &mdash; there are dozens of advertisements seeking such arrangements in any evening paper.  However, two people living together under this arrangement but not cohabiting will now receive more than a married couple or a man and woman who are not married and cohabiting.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of how &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; is to be defined and established. This is not defined in the Bill and it already gives rise to great difficulties in other areas of social welfare entitlement. The Bill raises the prospect of social welfare officers snooping around and peeping through bedroom windows to establish whether people are cohabiting. This is a degrading prospect both for those on social welfare, who are already imposed on in relation to denial of privacy to an enormous extent, and for departmental officers.  I hope social welfare officers will take a stand on this issue and refuse to become Deputy Woods' sex snoops.  Indeed I am happy that the CPSSU have already indicated they are concerned about the work their members may have to undertake arising from this Bill.  The Irish National Organisation Of The Unemployed have pointed out that similar types of legislation in England have resulted in officials inspecting the contents of bathrooms and arrangements in bedrooms.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, another serious reason <Col N="1007" /> for opposing this Bill is that it is contrary to the spirit of EC Directive 79/9 on equal treatment for men and women on social welfare.  In fact, the Bill is of dubious legality itself.  EC Directive 79/9 was designed to remove all forms of discrimination based on sex or marital status from the social security systems of member states.  The Coalition Government in their Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, chose to implement the equality principle in a narrow and restrictive way with the purpose of saving money at the expense of people who had long been discriminated against by our social welfare system.  At that time The Workers' Party opposed a number of the provisions in the 1985 Act and tabled amendments which found no support on either side of this House.  Indeed, the then Minister steering the Bill through the Dáil, Deputy Barry Desmond, defended it as being equitable and practical and a reforming measure which he strongly recommended to the House.  When the Minister was speaking earlier he inadvertently referred to Deputy Desmond as Deputy Barry Fitzgerald&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably he was right to the extent that we witnessed a performance here yesterday which would have done Barry Fitzgerald proud given that it was Deputy Desmond who had steered that Bill through the House in 1985 and refused to accept an amendment which we had tabled.  In fact, he denied that the section he was pushing through was in any way unconstitutional or in breach of the directive.</P>
      <P>I might draw the attention of the House to the Official Report of 3 July 1985, column 292, when, in response to a question of mine, the then Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond stated:</P>
      <P>We have carefully checked the legal basis of the provision and we are advised that on both directive and constitutional grounds the subsections are entirely sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> One of the points I raised specifically in the course of the Committee Stage debate on the 1985 Act was that section 12 &mdash; by restricting certain payments to married couples to the level they had been, or would be if one spouse was a breadwinner and the other a dependant &mdash; was flouting the intention of the directive and probably also was unconstitutional. I drew particular attention to the precedent created by the Murphy tax case.  The Workers' Party sought the deletion of the flawed section 12 provisions but ours were the only Members to vote against it.  The High Court and Supreme Court have since confirmed that we were right.  Those responsible for steering that Bill through the Dáil and those who advised them must share a great deal of the blame for this mess.  Had they listened to the advice we offered many difficulties could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>The courts confirmed that the 1985 Act was in conflict with our Constitution.  The question remains: does this discrimination also contravene European Community Directive No. 9 of 1979? We believe it does.  On that basis The Workers' Party are lodging a formal complaint against the Government to the European Commission.  We assumed that, when the Hyland constitutional case succeeded in the Supreme Court &mdash; as we had expected it would &mdash; the Government would themselves introduce appropriate amending legislation incorporating the necessary retrospective element. Since this has not happened, since Fianna Fáil have taken the disgraceful decision to follow the example of the Coalition Government by equalising downwards rather than upwards, our complaint to the Commission will be made as a matter of urgency unless this Bill is defeated, which is probably unlikely given that the Fine Gael Party and Progressive Democrats have indicated that they do not propose to oppose it.</P>
    <P>If the clear discrimination against married couples which has obtained to date is found to contravene the European <Col N="1009" /> Community Directive, then the Government will be required to provide justification for its continuance.  Given that the payments now being levelled down are among the lowest in the whole of the social welfare system &mdash; well below the levels which bodies such as the Commission on Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency defined as being the minimum necessary on which people could live &mdash; we do not believe that the Commission would accept any such justification plea by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a second major doubt about the legality of the provisions of this Bill. Even at European level if the provisions of this Bill are deemed to have removed whatever discrimination has obtained to date, married couples who have been adversely affected by the legislation to date, will have a right under European law &mdash; that is EC Directive No. 9 of 1979 &mdash; to seek retrospective remedies. National law cannot remove a right bestowed directly by European law. Rulings of the European Court have made that clear.  Therefore, it appears that section 2 of this Bill, outlawing retrospective claims, is in contravention of European law.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to contrast the response of the Government in the Hyland case to that to the Supreme Court judgment in the Murphy tax case.  In that instance there was no question of equalising downwards: all eligible taxpayers quite rightly benefited.  In all fairness, those in receipt of social welfare &mdash; who generally speaking live on incomes much lower than those of taxpayers &mdash; are entitled to the same consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government have also deliberately inflated the possible cost of increasing the entitlement of married couples.  Their estimate of the cost, at £31 million, included the cost of equalising the payments to all married couples, that is, not merely those in the labour force but also in the case of married couples where one spouse is a genuine adult dependant, and might have no wish to be in the workforce and have no legal equality with those who do form part of the workforce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> The overall implementation of the EC Directive on Social Welfare Equalisation was a botched job.  The original incompetence and penny-pinching of the Coalition Government are now being matched by Fianna Fáil.  The implications of the original botched job are still being felt. The cushion payments which the Coalition Government were forced to introduce in 1986 to deal with some of the anomalies &mdash; when the public discovered that tens of thousands of families stood to lose substantial sums because of the provisions of that 1985 Act &mdash; are due to cease in July next.  Although the value of those cushion payments have since been reduced many families still face a substantial drop of as much as £18 per week in their income and consequent additional hardship if those payments are abolished.</P>
    <P>The cessation of these payments and the political row which will follow constitute some of the reasons the Government are apparently making a dash to the country on 15 June.  I believe they are in for a rude shock.  The electorate will not so easily forget the cruel hardship imposed on the old, the sick, the handicapped, the poor, the unemployed and the emigrants.  Today the Opposition have the opportunity to drive this Government before the electorate.  I would appeal to them to support The Workers' Party amendment today in this House at 1.30 p.m. affording the electorate an opportunity to declare their verdict on two-and-a-half years of Fianna Fáil misrule with the support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before contributing to this debate, so that nobody accuses me of having wrong motives, let me declare an interest.  As a lawyer involved in a law firm outside this House it was our law firm that was privileged to represent the Murphys in the Murphy tax case and also the Hylands in this major social welfare case.  Indeed, it was because we believed that the social welfare system, as it operated, was inequitable and discriminatory against married couples that we saw fit to assist the Hylands in processing their <Col N="1011" /> claim through the courts.  I am very familiar with the history and legalities of this matter.  I would have to say that I agree with some of Deputy De Rossa's comments.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that this Government bring this Bill before this House apparently a day before the announcement of a general election.  It is appropriate because there is little doubt that the Government would have a majority support for the Bill in this House.  I do not think there is any doubt about that in the context of other people being away on European election canvassing.  It is appropriate that the Bill go through the House and that this and other steps taken by this Government in the social reform area be judged by the electorate.  Of course, this is not a social reform measure, it is a regressive approach to a major social issue.  It is appropriate that this be one of the closing Bills with which we deal because, in the context of attacking our economic problems, there is a way of minimising its impact on the old, the sick, the handicapped, those in disadvantaged areas and those in receipt of low incomes.</P>
      <P>This Government have been notorious for failing to get the balance right.  On other occasions in Private Members' time this House has joined to highlight that fact.  I do not want this Bill to go through this House without putting on the record my views of it and its approach to this issue.  The Family Planning Bill, published by the present Taoiseach when Minister for Health in 1979, was described by him then as an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  This Social Welfare Bill published by his Government can best be described as an Irish solution to an inequality problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to take this Bill seriously. Under its provisions every applicant for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, disablement pension, old age contributory pension, old age pension, retirement pension or invalidity pension will be liable to questioning by social welfare officers about matters solely of relevance to their private, personal lives.  The extraordinary <Col N="1012" /> invasion of the right to privacy required by the provisions of this Bill will enable every social welfare officer to question social welfare applicants of any age about their personal relationships.  Entitlement to receipt of unemployment allowance and benefit will no longer be established by mere proof by an applicant that he or she is unemployed and available for employment but will also require the applicant to establish to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Welfare that he or she is living alone and maintaining a celibate life.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare are in earnest about the promotion of this extraordinary Bill &mdash; on the basis that the Minister and the Government intend to push it through this House, it appears they are &mdash; a number of serious questions arise.  Are we to have a new category of civil servant in the Department of Social Welfare called the morality officer, whose job it will be to investigate the private lives of social welfare applicants and recipients? Will we have a separate departmental principal officer leading a newly established morality brigade on nightly visits to the homes of social welfare applicants or recipients to determine whether unemployed or disabled men or women are cohabiting as couples?  Will similar visits be paid to old age pensioners?  How will the Department of Social Welfare, for the purpose of this measure, determine whether an elderly pensioner and a younger unemployed companion residing together in the one house are cohabiting as man and wife &mdash; as the Bill refers to it &mdash; or merely residing under the one roof so as to avoid the distress of living alone? Will the new morality officers be furnished with bright, new and sparkling departmental ladders and binoculars to carry out their functions?  Will they be taught the skills of urban and rural camouflage so that they can carry out surveillance operations in household gardens and rural hedgerows and remain undetected?  Will they be taught the art of photography so that those under suspicion can be caught in the act?  Perhaps the Minister could answer some of these <Col N="1013" /> questions.  All of this sounds funny but it is difficult to see how this Bill can seriously be put into operation unless the Minister intends to establish this new morality brigade.</P>
    <P>The judgment in the Supreme Court in the Hyland case sought to remove a discrimination from our social welfare code which resulted in unemployed married couples obtaining a lesser sum by way of social welfare than other individuals residing together.  It resulted in provisions in our social welfare laws which penalise the married state being held invalid.  The Government in this Bill are seeking to turn the Supreme Court judgment on its head and instead of putting married couples in a position of equality with others are seeking to introduce a new and curious discrimination to be imposed on other couples.  This discrimination will not affect unemployed brothers and sisters residing together, unemployed men residing together, unemployed women residing together or unemployed parent and adult child residing together and many others.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to maintain in being a discrimination against married couples similar to the discrimination which the Supreme Court has held to be unconstitutional. In so far as the Minister has received advice that this Bill is not constitutionally infirm I would challenge the correctness of that advice both for the reasons I have already given, and for a variety of other reasons, in particular the way in which the Bill seeks to deal with retrospection and with the interim period as the law applies from the date of the Supreme Court judgment to the date of the enactment of this Bill.  I have very grave doubts as to this Bill's constitutionality and in so far as other Members of this House have expressed those doubts I would agree with them.</P>
    <P>Coming from a party which over the years has boasted of their commitment to the family and marriage, Fianna Fáil's approach to this Bill is a classical example of the shallow and unthinking approach shown by them in Government.  I think, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if it was not <Col N="1014" /> so serious, this Bill should more appropriately have been published on 1 April. If the matters it addresses were not so serious it would not deserve to be taken seriously and would be treated as a joke. I would ask the Minister at this late stage, before we take Committee Stage of this Bill, to think again.</P>
    <P>The Government should think again and check the advice they are getting. They should have a different social approach to the issue they are confronting and instead of enacting this measure they should simply withdraw it. It is one of the most half-baked ludicrous pieces of legislation which have been seen in this House since the Family Planning Bill, 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions to the Bill and to the Second Stage debate.  Deputy O'Keeffe, at the outset, was very concerned about the lack of departmental guidelines as to what constitutes cohabitation. When cases of cohabitation are being determined a number of factors are taken into account.  Indeed Deputy Wyse referred to similar arrangements in Britain.  These factors include co-residence, the financial situation, the social situation and the sexual situation in the sense of having children as a result of the relationship.  It is not necessary to prove that all four criteria are met to establish cohabitation.  If it can be established that a couple reside at the same address and satisfy any of the other requirements they are generally deemed to be cohabiting. It is not essential that a sexual element be present.  Co-residence, financial, social and sexual co-residence means that a couple are living together.  In establishing this fact it is necessary to examine the circumstances and the duration of their living together, the name or names given as owning or renting the property occupied by the couple, the type of accommodation available, how it is shared and the allocation of duties within the household.  The financial side covers the sharing of the financial burden between the couple.  It is not necessary to prove financial dependence but rather that the couple's financial arrangements are similar to those of a normal married couple.  The social arrangements cover such matters as a permanent relationship, as being seen to be living in the neighbourhood as man and wife.  It is not a problem that arises only in Ireland.  From listening to Deputy Shatter it would appear that this was something which arose suddenly here, today, or yesterday, and that we in Ireland have suddenly invented cohabitation.

      <P>The arrangements which we are making today are probably the first step towards the determination of a household situation.  If Deputy Shatter spent more time, perhaps working with his party, rather than with his vested interest &mdash; to which he referred &mdash; why then did he not advise his party in the years which have gone by.  We are taking this step now because there was a defect in the Bill.  Indeed, it might well have been better for Deputy Shatter to have advised his Government at the time, because it was his Government which brought in that legislation.  It is he who, skulking among his own partners in the House and among the Fine Gael Members, then goes out to the courts and challenges his own party's Bill.  That is the kind of thing we are seeing again and again in this House.  If Deputy Shatter has views why does he not make his wisdom available to his own party when they are bringing in a Bill; then he would not be faced subsequently with a defective Bill, which is what we are faced with here and what we are trying to remedy with two actions.  The first action is to deal with the immediate situation, which Deputy Shatter knows quite well would cause enormous difficulties throughout the social welfare system.  He has not referred to them in detail, but even from what he had to say, it is quite obvious that the ramifications of this decision are quite substantial.  They have to be dealt with immediately.  What we have done &mdash; and what he might have encouraged his party to do when in Government &mdash; was to set up as a matter of urgency a review group to sort out once and for all the assistance schemes for households.  That brings into line the question of how brothers and sisters and others living in the same household should be treated.  There is a simple system that is used on the continent and which gets over the legalities. That is that you nominate the head of the household.  As I have said in my speech, there is no way we will pay five fuel allowances to a household needing one set of heating.  Obviously to do so would be ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need, therefore, to look at how we <Col N="1017" /> will direct the assistance we are giving to social welfare beneficiaries, and that is why we are setting up the review group which is comprised of experts in the field, people who are familiar with the area. They will take the work of the commission a step further.  The Commission on Social Welfare said we should pay in accordance with need.  They also said that if there was a question of people living together, the dependency rate should be 0.6 of the full rate.  That would be 1.6 of the full rate for two individuals.  Yet the commission said there should be equal treatment.  The difficulty is that on this side of the House we have to take account of all these suggestions and make them work.  We have to use taxpayers' money to do that.  We are being entirely responsible in what we are doing here today because we are not only tackling the immediate question raised by the Hyland case, section 12 (4), but we are also dealing with a similar one covered by section 12 (1).  These two are being dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>We believe that a review is urgently necessary before further action is taken and that this is the right way to go about it at this time.  This is a very responsible approach on the part of the Government. A number of Deputies, and Deputy Wyse in particular, raised the question of supplementary welfare officers' involvement. They are not affected at this stage, but they would certainly be involved in the review.  The review will be covering the wider implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>When a social welfare officer establishes the fact that a couple are cohabiting and then goes to the home assistance officer, would he not be involved immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If a case of cohabitation is established, the people involved will be paid the same as a married couple are paid.  This brings me to another point which is very relevant, and is particularly relevant to what Deputy Bell had to say. This Government are giving married couples, particularly those on long term <Col N="1018" /> unemployment assistance, very considerable increases.  Nobody can deny that.  Those increases were not given by previous Governments and to suggest, therefore, that we are trying to penny-pinch on married couples is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell asked us to compare the level of payments in 1986 with those of today.  In 1986 a couple on long term unemployment assistance with five children would have received £104, if they were in receipt of the urban rate, and £103 if they were in receipt of the rural rate.  Now in 1989 they are getting £127 per week.  In terms of the consumer price index increases for other people within the scheme, that is a very considerable increase.  This Government have been giving increases where most needed and in general we have been allocating our resources in accordance with need.  We will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to tackle this matter immediately, to ensure that married couples continue to get what they are getting and to review the position of the relatively small number of people who may be affected by these two provisions of the Bill.  The numbers affected are relatively small and when a couple are making a claim they will have to say whether they are married or are unmarried but living together as man and wife, a cohabiting couple as it is commonly called.  There will be a declaration involved in making claims.</P>
      <P>Obviously, another way to approach this in the future is to ask a couple to state the head of the household.  As I have said, this is one approach that is used by other countries and in fact the review group will look at this issue because it needs to be examined at this point.  I accept that but I do not see any massive change at this point.  The review group will report in time for the next budget, which again is a very responsible approach and any action that needs to be taken will be taken in the context of the associated Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been various references to the Murphy case and its implications for equal treatment.  However, that is an entirely different situation because in this <Col N="1019" /> case we are talking about the allocation of resources in relation to need.  In effect we are asking how we allocate resources in relation to need in the social welfare schemes bearing in mind the provisions of equal treatment.  This Bill will certainly deal with the most immediate questions arising from the Supreme Court decision, but there are much wider issues which will have to be tackled.  That is why we have set up the review group and I would like to thank the members of the group for agreeing to participate in the review.</P>

      <P>It is an expert group, and all the people on it are clearly recognised as being expert in the field.  I do not think their expert knowledge in the area could be called into question.  They range from Mr. John Curry who was chairman of the Commission on Social Welfare; Dr. Fionola Kennedy, an economist; Dr. Claire Carney, Department of Social Science, UCD; Mr. Tony McCashin, a social policy analyst with the NESC who did some of the analytical work for the Commission on Social Welfare; Mr. David Byrne, senior counsel, &mdash; he was invited to participate because it was felt we should have a legal expert &mdash; Mr. John Hynes, Assistant Secretary, Department of Social Welfare, who is very much involved in the Department's development work in policy and planning and Mr. Michael Guilfoyle, a principal officer <Col N="1020" /> in the Department of Finance, dealing with the social welfare matters.</P>

      <P>It is an expert group.  I am quite satisfied that this group will get into the technical side and present an analysis, on which the Government can take action in the next budget and in the associated Social Welfare Bill.  As far as I see it that would be immediate action and would be very responsible.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies De Rossa and Jim O'Keeffe asked about the numbers involved.  It is estimated that if only 20 per cent of those people who would be eligible to claim and whose spouses are on unemployment assistance claimed it would cost an extra £26 million.  The figure of 20 per cent is seen as a very conservative estimate and I do not see why it would not be very much greater. This only relates to the most immediate aspects covered in the Bill but there are other aspects, which also have financial implications for the taxpayer in general. They have to be considered in a cool atmosphere and decisions have to be taken in relation to them.  I am quite happy, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that these matters can be dealt with.  It will mark a step ahead and I believe there is a responsibility on us at this stage to take the action that is proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It was with some concern that I learnt a few weeks ago of various figures quoted in the written media and on radio and television about increases in crime in 1988.  Therefore, it is obvious that the figures and all the necessary detail are available.  Would the Minister not agree that it is far better to produce a report early so that we can base policy decisions on actual facts as distinct from waiting until well into the second half of the year before making these details available to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important to have the final figures available as early as possible.  The figures which are mentioned from time to time are provisional figures relating perhaps to particular areas.  They are not final figures and that is one of the problems. Figures for a particular area may be discussed on a provisional basis.  I would agree that the figures should be available as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy there is no question of anything of that sort.

The Deputy will be very familiar with the areas where the Garda have been placing their main concentration of late.</P>

I am sure the Deputy is aware that as an individual he is very renowned for his hard work and dedication to getting on with the job.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he wants to have the report published urgently.  In relation to the question generally, the Garda authorities, in association with the other authorities, have comprehensive arrangements in place and obviously would adjust those in the light of any experiences either at home or abroad.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of gardaí at present involved in the neighbourhood policing scheme; if he has any proposals to extend further this particular scheme; if he will consider providing neighbourhood policing in urban areas on the basis of one garda per 2,500 households; if he will further consider the establishment of small neighbourhood police stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of three sergeants and 55 gardaí are currently engaged full time on community policing schemes, with an additional three sergeants involved on a part-time basis.  As indicated in reply to Question No. 16 on 20 April 1989, schemes are now in operation on a pilot basis in selected subdistricts of four of the five Garda divisions of the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the question of extending the scheme to other sub-districts in the area is being considered.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that a ratio of one community garda to 2,000 to 3,000 households applies in the case of community policing schemes already in operation.  It is envisaged that a ratio of this order will be maintained in the establishment of any future schemes.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to establish small neighbourhood police stations. Apart from the capital cost involved, the establishment of new stations tends to absorb Garda manpower, which, in the view of the Garda authorities, can be used more effectively on outdoor operational duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In relation to the latter point on the neighbourhood police stations, every time this is mentioned people assume that we are talking about the normal type of police station, but what I <Col N="1026" /> am talking about is a building in a community that people can identify with, which need not necessarily be manned on a 24 hour basis.  Of course we need the ordinary established police stations as they operate at present but the community or neighbourhood policeman should have some premises at which people could contact them during periods of the day.  I would also ask the Minister if it is envisaged that, with the extension of the neighbourhood or community policing scheme, gardaí on this scheme would be given the opportunity of working more flexible hours and that negotiations could take place with the Garda representative associations with a view to coming to some agreement along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Neighbourhood police stations are what would be called police clinics in local terms.  One is in operation in Donaghmede and a sub-station is planned for Leixlip.  These are being considered as some of the newer approaches to policing.  These include the neighbourhood watch system and community policing.  They are all operating on a pilot basis and the Garda authorities will be reviewing the matter to decide which would be the best method of operation for the future.  The community policing method is proving to be fairly effective. The question of extending the network when the pilot phase is over will arise. Other questions in relation to hours, flexi-time etc., will have to be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention gives details of the number of instances in <Col N="1027" /> which temporary release is granted and the most recent year for which this report is available is 1987.  These statistics in relation to 1988 and this year will be compiled in due course.  Statistics, however, are not available which would show the relationship between temporary releases and sentences or which would show the number of releases where conditions relating to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service or reporting to the Garda Síochána were imposed. These could be compiled only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>
      <P>The number of offenders on temporary release on a day-to-day basis is, of course, recorded.  The average daily number on release over the past week was 308.  This can be compared with a figure of 315 for the same period last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know why the Minister should feel it is not worth while compiling statistics which in the end might prevent people from remaining in prison at the very high cost of £600 a week.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is no correlation between those who are given temporary release and the problem of recidivism?  Is he satisfied that the lack of supervision of those who are released has no bearing on the continuing criminal habits of those who have been in prison at least once?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics generally are very useful and the statistics mentioned would also be useful, but the gathering and collating of these statistics would take a great deal of time.  If computer programmes can be developed which could link them in, that would make the information more readily available.  I have noted what the Deputy has said in that regard and will convey her views to the Minister.  The decisions are related to the nature of the offence, the length of the sentence served, behaviour while in custody, previous criminal history and the Garda view of the likely threat to the community which a particular release might involve.  These are among the <Col N="1028" /> factors taken into account.  Conditions are established which relate to the different circumstances.  That is the way the system operates.  More information on the actual combinations would be helpful.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the public perception is that the over-riding reason for early releases is overcrowding in our prison system?  We have spaces for only about 1,600 prisoners but we have over 2,000 prisoners accommodated in prisons and places of detention.  Would the Minister not agree that this is the over-riding reason for early releases and that there is no scientific reason behind it.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the spread of the drug known as <Col N="1029" />&ldquo;crack&rdquo;; and whether the Garda Síochána have any particular proposals to counter its importation into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no evidence of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; being available in this country.  The Garda are monitoring the whole drug problem very closely and they are taking all appropriate measures, in co-operation with the customs authorities, to prevent the importation here of all illegal drugs, including &ldquo;crack&rdquo;. These measures include close international co-operation and efforts to detect any evidence there may be of attempts to bring &ldquo;crack&rdquo; to this country or to increase the supply of cocaine, from which it is derived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is rather timely.  Last evening in the south of England there was a police riot as a result of a raid on a bar which was involved in the use of &ldquo;crack&rdquo;.  I am surprised to hear the Minister say there is no evidence of the availability of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; in this country.  If it is widespread in Britain, as it appears to be, we can be assured that it is on our streets in Dublin.  Has any research been done into this matter?  What preparations have been made for dealing with the problem in the light of the fact that it is far more difficult to deal with a drug of this kind as distinct from heroin?  The effects of this drug are very serious. There is large-scale dumping of it on the British and European markets.  We would have our heads in the sand if we were to suggest that there is no evidence of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; in this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Garda authorities talk about evidence they are talking about clear-cut evidence.  They are very much aware that &ldquo;crack&rdquo; is available and in over supply in America.  Consequently there is a danger that it will be brought to the European market in substantial quantities.</P>

      <P>There is a big supply available at present.  The Garda authorities have assured the Minister that the situation is being closely monitored and they are very conscious of the danger. They are working closely with the British authorities in this connection.  The Garda authorities have advised me that the seizures of cocaine have been falling steadily in recent years.  In 1985, 293.17 grammes were seized; in 1986, 170.7 grammes were seized, while the figure in 1987 was 30 grammes.  There has been a decline in the seizures of cocaine.  I understand that the provisional figures for 1988 are of the same order but Deputies generally will realise that vigilance is of the greatest importance in this area.  The Garda have assured the Minister that they are being particularly vigilant at present especially because of the supplies that are known to be freely available elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from my limited knowledge of this drug that its use eventually leads to violent behaviour, which is a serious aspect of the increase in the taking of this drug.  What progress has been made in relation to the combined effort of European Ministers for Justice to face up to the reality of 1992 when trade barriers will be removed and the transportation of drugs, like everything else, will be far easier?  Has there been any movement at all in establishing a European intelligence agency to coordinate information from the member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate question but I can assure the Deputy that the Minister and his colleagues in Europe take the matter very seriously and would be concerned about the implications of 1992 <i>vis-á-vis</i> freedom of movement. Accordingly, they have had meetings to discuss the measures which they would propose in the light of the 1922 developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated on other occasions, I intend to introduce a court and court officers Bill later this year.  This will include a provision to facilitate the introduction of a system of pre-trial procedures, to settle as many issues as possible before the trial of actions in the High Court, including claims involving insurance companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Like other Deputies here, I read about these proposals in the newspaper. Apparently we cannot get that type of detailed information in reply to a parliamentary question.  It is a matter of grave disappointment to many of us who stuck our necks out in relation to the abolition of juries in civil actions to find that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the reduction in the level of claims being paid and the reduction in the level of premiums have not taken place.  In fact there is an attempt to increase considerably the motor insurance premiums.  Would the Minister not agree that we should be very slow to carry out any further changes in our court procedure until there is clear evidence that there is a reciprocal arrangement on the part of insurance companies to reduce the premiums they are charging the consumer?</P>

      <P>The Minister will be very concerned to ensure that as part of the package of the reduction of costs these <Col N="1032" /> developments will be provided as soon as possible.  The Bill in question will contain other proposals apart from the pre-trial procedures.  Some of these involve important matters of policy which have yet to be finalised.  The Minister would hope that the Bill can be introduced fairly soon so that it will be brought into law before the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the last similar experience we had, namely, the abolition of juries, contrary to the undertakings given that there would be reductions in insurance premiums, has produced the opposite result? Can the Minister now say, before this legislation is visited on us, what the insurance companies are going to do about it, having regard to the fact that the last venture cost us at least an increase of 4½ per cent in motor insurance premiums? What will the increase be on this occasion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that waiting for the new courts Bill is going to mean a huge delay in making any changes in the administration of the cases in the Four Courts and elsewhere? Would he not agree that there are other devices available to his Department and through the administrators of the courts in terms of changing the rules? Could not a lot be done by way of orders and ministerial regulation to streamline and improve the system at least in the interim?  Are we not facing into at least a two year delay before legislation could ever be introduced and passed in this House, to deal at a minimum with the reorganisation of the courts?  Surely something must be done in the interim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the co-operation of the other side of the House, legislation can be dealt with fairly effectively.  Over the last two years that has been fairly obvious.  In relation to the pre-trial procedures to be operated by the Master of the High Court, it is intended that they will be operated by rules of court.  This will allow greater flexibility since procedures would require alteration from time to time and that would be most conveniently achieved by rules of court. The proposed Bill will enable such rules to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that tactically it is very unwise to make commitments to introduce further legislation in this area until we actually see something coming from the other side in terms of a reduction in insurance premiums? Once one makes a further promise it can be said that once we have this additional legislation permiums may come down.  The last time we were told categorically that a major change in our whole legal system, abolishing juries, would have a major effect on the level of insurance premiums here and that has not happened.  The onus is on the insurance companies to tell us why this has not happened before we commit ourselves to further changes in our legal system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of civil legal aid and advice provides for its administration by a board appointed by the Minister for Justice. The term of office of the current members does not expire until 23 March 1991.  As and when vacancies arise, I am more than happy to consider persons for board membership from as wide a range of groups as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to additional funding for the board, I have already said that the effect of the remedies provided in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, in putting extra pressure on the Legal Aid Board, will be closely monitored.  The Act will not come into effect until 19 October next.  The problems facing the board are under active consideration at the moment to see what can be done to relieve their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the truth of the matter is that the Legal Aid Board are simply not in a position to provide anything like the service that is required, that many of the offices cannot take new cases for weeks or months, that there is an immense backlog and that they just cannot cope with the volume?  Will the Minister also agree that the Minister for Justice gave a commitment after the passing of the Judicial Separation Bill that he would make a personal effort to secure additional funding for the board to enable people who wished to avail of the new separation remedies to have access to legal remedies through the Legal Aid Board?  All I am asking is if the Minister has asked the <Col N="1035" /> Government for the extra money, and, if so, has he got it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling Question No. 7, I want to make it clear that I was casting no reflection on any member of the board with regard to the impossible task the Minister for Justice has imposed on them, by asking them to run the scheme without adequate resources, but a fact drawn to my attention at a conference in Buswells on 21 April last was that no member of the consuming public who has recourse to law centres, and no member of the Coolock Law Centre &mdash; the only properly constituted law centre &mdash; or FLAC, the students group, is represented on the Legal Aid Board.  While the Minister is prepared to consider people from as wide a range of areas as <Col N="1036" /> possible, would he not agree that it is important to have on the board a member of the consuming public on the one hand and a representative of those who are active in delivering free legal aid services on the other?  Does the Minister agree that that is a desirable objective?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The board as constituted makes provision for what might be described as lay members &mdash; there is provision for four lay members.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in this area the first thing to do is to relieve the free legal aid system from the public service embargo because the real difficulty is that if somebody has a long-term illness or leaves there is no replacement?  Instead of talking about putting the scheme on a statutory basis we should ensure that staffing is kept at its original level.  We are in the ridiculous situation that because of the pressure of work there is more illness in this area and more people are leaving or taking leave of absence.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that it was very cold hearted of the Minister for Justice not to answer the representations made to him over a year ago, for aid to working class families whose members died in prison while serving sentences due to the neglect of the State, and that the least the Minister could have done was to make some gesture towards costs in excess of £1,600 which I submitted to the Minister and <Col N="1040" /> which the families cannot afford to discharge?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of fines being collected is running at approximately £6 million a year and the amounts being collected are tending to increase, despite the arrears.  It is inevitable that there will always be some arrears, representing work on the collection process being done by courts staff and by the gardaí.  Every effort will continue to be made, within the limit of resources, to keep arrears in check but with due regard to other urgent work commitments of courts staff and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that this is a scandal likely to continue given the reply the Minister has just given?  Some time ago the Minister indicated to the House that the value of fines being collected is £6 million a year.  At present the value of fines outstanding is £7.5 million. Would the Minister not accept that clearly in this case the law is an ass or, to use a more parliamentary phrase, the law <Col N="1043" /> is being brought into disrepute?  In my question I asked the Minister if he would make a statement on his intentions regarding the recovery of sums due. Would you allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, to suggest alternatives or to ask the Minister if he has considered alternatives to the imposition of a custodial sentence in the event of a fine not being paid?  Does the Minister envisage the introduction of an on-the-spot fine?  Such a scheme might obviate the need to impose a five-day or seven-day prison sentence in the event of a fine not being paid.  Clearly the courts are not imposing this penalty.  If the penalty of imprisonment was imposed in respect of the amount outstanding the prisons would not be able to cope.  What is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the figure collected each year and the estimated figure, the figure of £7.5 million to which the Deputy refers. The totals run over from one year to another.  They are not going to be exactly the same, there is a difference between the two.  One of the reasons for this is that approximately 10 per cent of warrants <Col N="1044" /> cannot for one reason or another be executed.  I am sure the Deputy could think of all the different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No.  For instance, if someone emigrates or something else happens, a warrant cannot be executed.  Every effort is being made, within present staff resources, to keep arrears in check.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information. In any event it is a separate question. In particular cases, for example where there are difficult family circumstances, a fine may be reduced.  Obviously this would affect the totals also. This is an indication of the sensitivity and balance in the law.  I know of cases, as I am sure the Deputy does, where such an approach is justified.  Members of the House would be very happy to know that this happens, given that at present there are many people who are long-term unemployed.  I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that there is support for the abolition of the death penalty and, in more normal times, I accept that there would be merit in a full and open debate on the pros and cons of such a move.  However, times are not normal and there are armed subversive groups inimical to the institutions of the State.  In such circumstances my primary concern &mdash; and that of the Minister for Justice &mdash; is to provide the maximum protection possible for those who defend our democratic institutions.  I am concerned that a move to abolish the death penalty at present could give the wrong signal.  It would remove the additional protection which the death penalty provides for members of the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service, who are especially at risk from violent criminals, some of whom have been murdered in the execution of their duty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The first group of 16 offenders will be in the younger age group and selected from the existing institutions in Dublin. They will be transferred to the new place of detention on 13 June next.  Further groups of offenders will be transferred over the following months in the light of operational experience at the institution and demands on the prison system generally.</P>
      <P>Regulations for the centre under the Criminal Justice Act, 1970, will provide that male offenders aged 16 years or over may be transferred there.</P>
      <P>No decision has been taken regarding the transfer to Wheatfield of offenders infected with the HIV virus.  I accept, however, that they are one of the categories of offenders whose situation will call for particular consideration when the reallocation of available accommodation, consequent on the bringing into use of Wheatfield, is being decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister specify how many months it will take for the transfer of the projected number of prisoners to Wheatfield?  He said it will happen over a number of months, but only 16 prisoners are being transferred initially.  We were told that Wheatfield would relieve congestion in the prisons but we are now told that only 16 prisoners will be transferred initially.  When will the rest go?  If they are removed from St. Patrick's Institution, does that mean consideration will be given to moving other prisoners into St. Patrick's?  In relation to HIV or AIDS prisoners, is consideration <Col N="1049" /> being given to moving them to Wheatfield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These are generally operational matters for the Prison Service. The question of the speed at which transfers will take place depends on the experience of the first transfers.  No decision has been taken regarding the transfer to Wheatfield of offenders infected with the HIV virus.  The Minister has noted what the Deputy said in that regard.</P>

      <P>With respect, I do not believe it is simply an operational matter that cannot be divulged to the House as to when the prison is expected to fulfil the role which has been carved out for it over the last number of years.  It would surely be normal to say it would happen over the next three, six or nine months and that it was expected to move 160 prisoners in groups of 16.  The public want to know how soon the drastic and dreadful conditions in our prisons will be relieved by the use of this prison, which cost £38 million to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>Given that the groups of 16 are to be young offenders aged, I presume, between 16 and 21 years, will the Minister confirm that they will be picked because of the trouble they caused to the institutions in which they are currently serving their sentences as it appears that Wheatfield is suitable because of its security arrangements? Will the Minister give the criteria by which the 16 offenders will be chosen? <Col N="1050" /> Could he also advise the House as to the conditions, particularly rehabilitative conditions, training programmes and so on, that will be available to those young people in a high security and totally inappropriate institution for people of that age?</P>

Work on the completion of the final phase of a programme to <Col N="1051" /> increase the number of toilets, etc. available to offenders is currently in progress and is scheduled to be completed in a few months' time.  The completion of this programme will mean that toilet facilities in the reception area, work areas and all wings of the prison will have been improved in recent years.</P>

      <P>I should like to put it to the Minister, bearing in mind the problem we discussed under the last question, that one way of coping with the problem of numbers in prison is to introduce a half-way system.  Will the Minister accept that it would be a desirable objective to consider a system between the absolute of no bail on the one hand and a bond on the other, a house bail under which a person would be confined to a specific area?  Has the Minister given consideration to the scheme in operation on a trial basis in Britain under which people are tagged and a record kept of their whereabouts?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are satisfied with the operation of the Carriage Office.  That office is responsible for the administration of the system of licensing of taxis in the Dublin area. However, it has no responsibility for determining the number of taxi licences on issue, nor have I any ministerial responsibility in the matter.  Under the terms of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Licensing) Regulations, 1978, the power to determine the number of taxi licences for the Dublin taxi meter area is vested exclusively in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of taxis licensed to operate in that area has remained at 1,824 since 1979.  The number of transfers of licences which have taken place in the area in each of the years referred to in the first <Col N="1054" /> question is as follows: 1986, 155; 1987, 171; 1988, 157; 1989 (up to 18 May), 78.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is deputising for his colleague, the Minister for Justice, but I respectfully submit to him that it is time we all acknowledged that the figure of 55 is derisory in the context of the overall problem.  Will the Minister agree that one of the greatest social ills undermining the whole fabric of our society is the prevalance of under age drinking and the failure to control it?  Will the Minister <Col N="1055" /> acknowledge that the number of convictions is an indication that the legislation has been totally ineffective and that it is time it was rigidly implemented?

Would he agree that it is particularly urgent in view of the fact that, without postal communications, people's rights to use the postal system to vote in the European elections will be severely disrupted if not set at nought?  We are here concerned about disabled persons entitled to a postal vote and, most importantly, about members of the Defence Forces who, I have no doubt, will want to say a lot in this forthcoming election. Would the Minister bear that particular aspect of the problem in mind?  Would he ensure, by whatever means, that these people will be entitled to vote come what may?</P>

      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate on this subsection Deputy Shatter queried whether existing fixed interest rate housing loans &mdash; on this provision coming into operation &mdash; could be subject to redemption fees again.  This amendment was drafted with the intention not to interfere with the present position in regard to existing housing loans, but, in view of the Deputy's point made on Committee Stage, I am tightening up the drafting to make sure that the relaxation of the ban will apply only to fixed rate housing loans made after the commencement of the operation of the provisions of section 22.  The protection afforded by the 1986 Act will be maintained even in the case of fixed interest loans.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1a in the name of Deputy Quinn.  I might draw the attention of Members to the fact that amendment No. 1b is related.  Therefore, with the agreement of the House, it is proposed to take amendments Nos. 1a and 1b together for discussion purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 50, line 12, after &ldquo;directors&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at least one of whom shall be a woman&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I indicated earlier that I would raise this matter on Report Stage.  I sought advice as to the precise format of this amendment. I am conscious of the fact that on Report Stage in accordance with the rules of the House I can make one contribution only.  Therefore, I will endeavour to be as comprehensive and concise as is possible.</P>
      <P>The principle is very clear.  We had a substantial debate on the issues surrounding this on Committee Stage.  The Minister has had advance notice of my intention to table an amendment.  I apologise for the fact that, because of its precise formulation, it was not tabled as quickly as I should have liked.  However, if one takes amendments Nos. 1a and 1b together, one sees it is quite clear that the principle of at least one third of the directors of any building society as constituted within the framework of the provisions of this Bill when enacted &mdash; hopefully within the term of this 25th Oireacthas &mdash; will be women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might well ask: why do I put forward this proposal?  I do so for the following reasons.  The first is I believe that the outrageous attempts to date to prevent women from being elected to the boards of building societies &mdash; with all the concerted might and apparatus of those institutions and administrations, particularly of one building society &mdash; constitute an affront to the majority of our people.  It is also an affront to the majority of households, of which women form a critical and, in some cases, dominant part.  This has its historical roots in the struggle for representation that a <Col N="1085" /> particular person, Muriel Scorer, fought, not merely on behalf of herself but on behalf of all women.</P>
    <P>The second reason I put forward this proposal is that, increasingly, with the creation of single adult households &mdash; I am endeavouring to use the most technical phrase possible, in many cases because of the failure of Irish society to deal comprehensively with marital breakdown and the formation of second households &mdash; the problems with which women in particular are confronted in the first family home, or in attempting to establish a second, are quite substantial.  At the highest level in building societies &mdash; by that I mean their boards of directors &mdash; there need to be people who can relate to, who can empathise and sympathise with, who have friends or who have had themselves direct experience of the problems to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The third reason is that, increasingly &mdash; and there has been demographic research carried out within the Department of the Environment to underpin this point &mdash; we can expect a larger percentage of household formation to emanate from single women, or women as heads of households in a manner that has not been the case historically heretofore.  Their needs, in terms of borrowers as well as investors, should be adequately recognised and represented.</P>
    <P>I began on a pragmatic basis because I do not really feel the present Government have a commitment to equality to the extent I believe they should or certainly to the extent of my party.  The fourth reason I put forward this proposal is a fundamental one of equality.  It is about time we structured equality into institutions such as building societies because of their size and importance.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept these two related amendments, the core of the intent being contained in amendment No. 1b.  Amendment No. 1a is a logical extension of the principle, but the principle is one third.  There is no shortage of talent and there is no shortage of ability.  The building societies themselves have recognised the need to move, albeit at a very <Col N="1086" /> slow pace, to try to have female representation on their boards.</P>
    <P>If I could anticipate an argument which might come from the other side of the House it would be as follows: it is not for this House to prescribe the manner in which the composition of the board of directors should be composed, therefore, we have no right prescribing the way they should be elected.  We have gone into extraordinary detail in sections 50, 51, 52, 53 and so on to regulate the way in which people would be elected, the way in which they are appointed, the way in which they shall retire and so on, but because of an unease in the past, we have given ourselves the right and the power to regulate the manner in which these people are elected so as to satisfy standards of democracy.  I put it to the Minister that standards of democracy in 1989 &mdash; the last remaining 11 years of this century, and the last year of this decade &mdash; require that these standards be extended to ensure equal representation of both sexes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did have advance notice of his intentions in this matter and I thank him for the manner in which he has dealt with that.  We discussed the matter at some length on Committee Stage.  I was hoping that the Deputy might have reflected upon his intention and perhaps decided that it was not proper to pursue it at this time in this legislation for the purposes which he has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate, both Deputy Quinn and Deputy Shatter referred to the lack of female representation on the boards of building societies.  They suggested that there should be a provision in the Bill requiring that each building society would have at least one woman amongst its directors.  I said then that I could think of two women who were directors of societies, and, since then, I took the trouble to check it out. I would now like to inform Deputies that five of the ten building societies have a woman on the board.  I was hoping that, <Col N="1087" /> had Deputy Quinn sought that information and realised that half of our building societies already had female representation on their boards, he would have considered that things were moving properly in that regard.  The position is not quite as bad as was suggested, or as was thought, by Deputies last week.  It has improved significantly in the past few years.  That is not to say that I would be completely happy with the present state of affairs as to female representation on the boards.  Like the Deputies, I too would like to see women more strongly represented.  However, I do not believe that these amendments are the right way to go about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to direct them to do certain things for certain people would not be in accordance with the true principles of democracy, as seemed to be enunciated by Deputy Quinn in his original proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not State bodies where directors are appointed by the Minister.  Had that been the case, Deputy Quinn's argument would have much greater validity. Yet legislation on State bodies has not gone as far as these amendments.  It seems extraordinary that the Deputy <Col N="1088" /> would be pursuing the matter now for the private sector when he has not been pressing the issue in the State sector, where, obviously, we would have a better opportunity of considering his proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will wish to pursue that matter again at a later time so far as the State bodies are concerned, but why he would jump into the private sector to pursue his point of view at this time I cannot understand.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency Acts do not require that there should be even one woman on the agency board, let alone one third of the directors.  This agency is in the same line of business as the societies. I think the Deputy has overdone it so far as amendment No. 1b is concerned. Be that as it may, in an election as we have in the appointment of building society directors, any statutory requirement of the kind suggested is fraught with difficulty.  Take the position in this House as a good analogy.  We would all like to see more women elected to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we speak about that every time an election is talked about but it has never been seriously suggested that there should be some legislative requirement that any proportion of the seats be reserved for women, because to do so would be a serious interference with the democratic process.  I have never heard Deputy Quinn, nor any other Deputy, suggest that it should be laid down in legislation that so many women would occupy the seats of this House, irrespective of any other consideration. We can encourage women to take a more active part in political life, to take a more active part in institutions of any kind, and we can encourage and facilitate the election of women in societies, but we should not try to impose that on the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> The provisions in the Bill &mdash; and this is worth repeating &mdash; strengthen the democratic procedures for director elections in societies.  If women members of societies wish to elect fellow women to the boards, they will, of course, have a better opportunity now of doing so than they ever had before.  The legislation goes quite a distance to make that possible, and I think that was conceded by Deputy Quinn on Committee Stage.  The democratic procedures for the holding of elections are being laid down in legislation in a very tight way and that will ensure fair play and the highest standards so far as the election of directors is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to encourage women heads of households to get involved in that process and I think they will.  Now they will recognise that the new statutory regulations laid down for the election of members to become directors of these institutions is fair and above board for all.  In fact, we go even further than that, we are going to have independent supervision of those elections.  That is a major feature that has not been highlighted outside yet, and it is an innovative provision. The report of that supervision will have to be made to the Central Bank, which will have to be satisfied that the election of directors is not just seen to be fair, but is fair.</P>
    <P>On a more detailed level, Deputy Quinn's amendments would not sit too well with other important provisions in the Bill governing the appointment of directors.  For example, the fundamental requirement at section 50 (1) requires that all directors be elected to office.  The amendments would also be inconsistent with subsections (2), (3), (8) and (10). Therefore, the amendments could not be inserted without a full reconsideration and extensive redrafting of sections 50 and 51.  Futhermore, the transitional position would have to be provided for too.  Deputy Quinn, being a good legislator, recognises when he puts that into context with his suggested amendments &mdash; so far as the rejigging of the whole framework of sections 50 and 51 is concerned &mdash; that that would be an extraordinary change.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn's objective is laudable and I have to accept that he is doing it in the best interests, as he sees it, of the future of the building society movement, but I am afraid his proposal is not practical at this time.  I recognise, of course, that there is an increasing number of women as heads of households <Col N="1091" /> but there is nothing to stop women from getting more involved and seeking positions through the democratic process, which is now been laid down in a very fair and equitable way.  As the years go by, I hope they will seek office and have greater representation.  We have come a fair way and half the societies have female representation on their boards. Hopefully, that will increase as time goes on, but in the meantime I ask Deputy Quinn to recognise that it is not possible and it is not a practical step to what he suggests at this time.</P>

      <P>I think the spirit of what Deputy Quinn is trying to achieve should be accepted by the Minister.  It is not necessarily the function of Opposition spokespersons to act as draftspersons but it is up to us to point out the deficiencies. Clearly Deputy Quinn's amendments underline a serious problem and one that was highlighted in a controversial way in the case of recent battles by one lady who wanted to establish herself on the board of a building society.  I would prefer to deal with this issue and the general question of representation on boards by means of a Bill which would cut across State, semi-State and private companies generally, which would deal positively with the issue of discrimination and would not necessarily single out the Building Societies Bill as the only or indeed the exclusive vehicle that would deal with the question of women directors. I would prefer that there would be a broad analysis of the understatement of women's contributions in the economic and infrastructural sector to try to redress that balance.  I support that general principle. I do not believe that the intention of the amendment is anything other than laudable.  It highlights what is a serious problem.  I am often struck by the under-representation of women, not just on boards but at all levels.  I recall an occasion when, for my then party, I was handling a Bill to deal with rape and <Col N="1092" /> when Deputies, including myself, were disadvantaged because of the under-representation of women.  I think this is something that Government should address globally and without apology to any section of our society.  It is an important issue.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity, as it may be the last opportunity one gets for the moment, to thank the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with the debates in which I have been pleased to participate.  I have always found him to be helpful, constructive and indeed genial.  While conceding little ultimately, he has conceded where he has thought such concessions were genuinely in the interests of the Bill.  I would prefer in a properly structured Oireachtas to deal with the minutiae of such issues in another forum which would be to the side of the main House and this would allow us to make speedier progress.  The reason we do not get more legislation passed is highlighted by the manner in which some stages of the Bill were handled by some of the people referred to by the Minister and indeed by one or two to whom he did not refer.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in essence a good Bill.  I think it has been welcomed by everybody. However, I have no doubt that if you went through it line by line again, there would be some elements that could be improved.  The issue highlighted by Deputy Quinn is one that I would like to see improved, a I think everybody here would.  If the Minister has a proposal which would deal with this issue, either in this Bill or right across the board, we would support it.  Having said that, I hope the Bill has a speedy passage and that it is effective in ensuring that this area is regulated in the way the Bill seeks to do, which is in accord with the public interest. I wish the Minister well in the Bill's passage through the Seanad and in any other exertions which might befall him in due course.</P>

    <Title>An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park Bill, 1989  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Molaim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara Uair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná An Blascaod Mór, an t-oiléan is mó de scata oileán amach ó leithinis an Daingin, Contae Chiarraí, a chaomhnú do na glúnta atá le teachta agus chun cosc a chur le haon fhorbairt nach mbeadh fáilte roimpi.  Tá sé mar chuspóir aige freisin spéis an oileáin don chuairteoir a mheádú agus é a chumhdú mar áit a bhfuil luach mór cultúrtha ag baint léi.  Tá An Blascaod Mór, atá breis is trí mhíle ar fhad le hachar míle agus céad acra nó mar sin ann, trí mhíle farraige ón gcuan ag Dún Chaoin ar an mórthír.  Ní raibh riamh níos mó ná dhá chéad duine nó mar sin ina gcónaí ar an mBlascaod Mór agus bhí saol cruaidh acu ar ghabháltais de thrí nó ceithre acra.</P>
      <P>Baineann áilleacht uasal nádúrtha leis na Blascaodaí agus is cuimhneachán beo iad ar an saol a bhíodh ag mórán Éireannaigh thar glúnta gan comhaireamh. Le blianta beaga anuas, tá An Blascaod Mór tagtha chun cinn mar áit oilithreachta dóibh siúd a bhfuil cion or leith acu do theanga agus do bhéaloideas na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bunaíodh Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid ag muintir an cheantair sa bhliain 1986 chun an t-oileán a chaomhnú agus a chosaint mar chuid luachmhar dár n-oidhreacht. Léiríonn bunú na Fondúireachta go soiléir go bhfuil fonn ar mhuintir an cheantair sin go ndéanfaí an áit shainiúil seo a chosaint agus a choimeád mar ba chóir.  Tá sé soiléir, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh sé thar acmhainn ag aon eagraíocht phríobháideach tabhairt faoi na deacrachtaí atá le sárú agus ba léir gurb é réiteach na faidhbe ná go nglacfadh an Stát seilbh ar an oileán agus go ndéanfaí é a fhorbairt, i gcomhar leis an bhFondúireacht, mar Pháirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil. <Col N="1098" /> Gan gníomhaíochtaí na Fondúireachta ní bheadh an reachtaíocht seo ann.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to safeguard for future generations An Blascaod Mór, the largest of a group of islands lying off the Dingle peninsula, County Kerry, and to prevent any unwelcome development thereon.  It is also designed to enhance the island's interest for the visitor and to preserve it as a place of great cultural value.  An Blascaod Mór, which is over three miles long and comprises some 1,132 acres, is three miles by sea from the mainland harbour at Dunquin.</P>
    <P>The Blaskets are majestic in their natural beauty and are a vivid reminder of a way of life now vanished but which many Irish people lived for countless generations. An Blascaod Mór has become in recent years a place of pilgrimage for those who love the Irish language and its folklore.</P>
    <P>Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid was established by the people of the area in 1986 to conserve and protect the island as an intrinsic part of our heritage.  The Fondúireacht represents a clear expression by the local community of their wish to ensure that this unique place is protected and cared for properly.  Clearly, however, the resources required and the difficulties to be overcome would exceed the capacity of any private organisation and, accordingly, it seemed to those concerned that the proper thing to do was for the State to acquire the island and, in co-operation with the Fondúireacht, to develop it as a National Historic Park. The activities of the Fondúireacht have indeed made this legislation possible.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are as follows: The Commissioners of Public Works will be authorised to acquire &mdash; by agreement or compulsorily &mdash; any land on the island, with the exception of certain lands owned or occupied by persons who owned or occupied them since 17 November 1953 &mdash; which is the date the island was evacuated &mdash; or, where such persons are deceased, their close relatives. In such cases the Commissioners may acquire the lands by agreement only. The Commisisoners' land and other land <Col N="1099" /> acquired under this legislation will be designated a National Historic Park.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that this National Historic Park shall be maintained, managed, controlled, preserved, protected and developed by the Commissioners for the use and benefit of the public as an area in which the historic heritage, culture, traditions and values of the island and its inhabitants will be preserved and demonstrated and its flora, fauna and landscape will be protected.  It goes on to set out the duties of the Commissioners in respect of the park, including fostering and promoting its use as a centre of culture, education, leisure and recreation; fostering and promotiong the use of Irish; conserving the flora and fauna of the island and the surrounding seas; conserving or restoring and preserving the traditional dwellings and other buildings on the island and a number of other appropriate functions.  The Commissioners will be empowered to make by-laws for the care, detailed management, preservation, protection and development of the park.</P>
    <P>There are provisions whereby certain powers of the commissioners may be delegated to Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid Teoranta.  The intention is that the Fondúireacht will be entrusted with the general management of the park.  In this way, the local community will be fully involved in the protection and preservation of a valuable and important asset which in one sense belongs to the nation but is very much the special responsibility of the people of Corca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>An Blascaod Mór will, under these provisions, become a place where the visitor will be brought into immediate contact with much that our European civilisation has half forgotten, a habitat in which the wildlife of the western seaboard can continue to flourish and a historic monument to the genius of the Blasket writers and to the courage and tenacity of the people of the island.</P>
    <P>The people of the Blasket Islands were a true community in whom the harsh and often perilous conditions in which they lived fostered a deep sense of mutual <Col N="1100" /> interdependence and trust.  Their way of life, rich in tradition and folk custom, provided a link with the immemorial past. The details of that way of life have fortunately been preserved for us by many scholars, antiquarians, linguists and literary men, such as John Millington Synge, Karl Marstrander, a Norwegian scholar whom the island people called &ldquo;an Lochlannach&rdquo;, the Viking, and Robin Flower, whom they affectionately called &ldquo;Bláithin&rdquo;.  Most important of all, however, is the fact that island life has also been preserved for us in the unique writings of the islanders themselves. Visiting scholars such as Brian Ó Ceallaigh and George Thomson encouraged and guided the Blasket writers to undertake some of their most important work. These works have been translated into many languages and recently &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo;, the autobiography of Tomás Ó Criomhthain, has been translated into French by Jean Buhler.  Our own Brendan Behan also wrote a beautiful poem about the deserted Blaskets.</P>
    <P>No comparable area in the world, inhabited by such a small number of people, has been responsible for such an extraordinary flowering of literary genius.  Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin all wrote works, the importance of which, as literary masterpieces, outweighs even their value as records of a life whose dignity and nobility transcended the harsh conditions in which it had to be lived.</P>
    <P>In putting this Bill, which has passed all stages in Seanad Éireann, before the Dáil, I am doing so on the basis of all party support.  The Bill has the support of all the Deputies and Senators from the Kingdom of Kerry who have been involved in its preparation and the members of Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid. In this regard, I would like to put on record my appreciation of the very important part played by all of them in helping to make this legislation possible. We had a very full debate in the Seanad during the Second and Committee Stages of the Bill when Senators welcomed it wholeheartedly.  I gave an undertaking <Col N="1101" /> then that I would propose some slight changes in the Bill in this House to satisfy concerns expressed by some Senators.  I am proposing that the Bill as passed by the Seanad be amended on Committee Stage so as to provide that by-laws made by the Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, under section 3 of the Bill, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I will also propose an amendment which will require the Commissioners, where they consider it appropriate, to consult with the Fondúireacht before by-laws are made.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú le gach duine a chomhoibrigh go fial flaithiúil san obair seo chun An Blascaod Mór a chaomhnú do na glúnta atá le teacht.  Tá mé cínnte go n-éireoidh leis an reachtaíocht atá á plé againn tráthnóna chun na cuspóirí atá roimpi a bhaint amach.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo atá á phlé againn anseo tráthnóna sa Dáil, Bille a tháinig chugainn ón Seanad agus, mar a dúirt an Taoiseach é féin, cuireadh fáilte fhorleathan roimhe ó gach taobh den Teach nuair a bhí sé ag dul tríd an Seanad. Bille é seo a bhfuil sé mar aidhm agus mar chuspóir aige Páirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil a bhunú nó a chur ar bun ar an Bhlascaod Mhór, agus is beag duine sa tír nár chuala trácht ar na Blascaodaí agus go speisialta ar an Bhlascaod Mhór.  Is beag buachaill agus cailín scoile nach bhfuil eolas acu ar an cheantar sin.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh na sárleabhair a cuireadh ar fáil, &ldquo;An tOileánach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Peig&rdquo; agus na leabhair eile, go raibh siad ar na cúrsaí sna scoileanna bunoideachais agus iarbhunoideachais sa tír seo agus, leoga, i dtíortha go leor eile ar an domhan.  Mar sin, féach, oileán beag, tá clú agus cáil air ar fud an domhain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith an rud agus is maith an cuimhneamh ar an Bhlascaod go gcuirfí Páirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil ar bun ansin.  Tá eolas agam féin ar na himeachtaí atá ag dul ar aghaidh ansin le roinnt blianta.  Casadh an Fhondúireacht orainn tá cúpla bliain ó shin, sílim i 1986, nuair a tháinig siad <Col N="1102" /> anseo go Baile Atha Cliath.  Sílim go raibh an Taoiseach é féin i láthair an tráthóna sin ag Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais, agus chuir siad a gcuid pleananna romhainn ansin.  Bhí an Teachta Begley ansin fosta, agus b'fhéidir an Teachta Quill, atá sa Teach, agus fiú amháin an tráthnóna sin bhí tacaíocht iomlán le fáil ag na cuspóirí a bhí ag an Fhondúireacht. Ina dhiaidh sin casadh an Fhondúireacht orainn arís ag an Chomhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge.  Chasamar leo níos mó ná bliain ó shin, agus phléigheamar na ceisteanna arís agus na pleananna a bhí acu, agus bhí sé de ádh agus de phribhléid agam féin agus baill eile den Chomhchoiste cuairt a thabhairt ar Chorca Dhuibhne agus an dúiche stairiúil sin bliain ó shin.  Is cuimhin liom, maidin lae bhreá sa samhradh, gur casadh an Fhondúireacht arís orainn i nDún Chaoin, agus thug muid tacaíocht arís do na pleananna a bhí acu, agus is breá an rud go bhfuil sé ag teacht chun cinn anois agus go bhfuil an reachtaíocht ag dul tríd an Seanad agus an Dáil.  Agus nuair a chuimhnímid ar an Bhlascaod agus cad a tharla agus mar ab éigean do na daoine é a fhágáil beagnach deich mbliana agus fiche ó shin, cuireann sé ar ár súile dúinn chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé aire agus aird ar leith a thabhairt do na hoileáin fós ar an chósta a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí iontu, oileáin ar mo chósta féin, Toraigh agus Árainn Mhór, cósta na Gaillimhe agus síos ar fud an chósta go léir.  Táimid chun an Pháirc Náisiúnta Stairiúil a bhunú ar an Bhlascaod, ach ba chóir go mbeadh sé de dhualgas orainn, mar sin, gan dearmad a dhéanamh orthu agus gach cuidiú a thig linn a thabhairt do na hoileáin ar an chósta a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí go fóill orthu, go speisialta na hoileáin a labhartar an teanga Ghaeilge orthu.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provision of this Bill for the establishment and maintenance of a national historic park on An Blascaod Mór off the coast of Kerry.  It was inevitable that the community of An Blascaod Mór would be forced to leave the island and seek a living elsewhere.  With an average holding of three or four acres it was not possible to live a life which <Col N="1103" /> depended to a large degree for its survival on fishing and farming.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the tenacity of the people that they lived out their lives as long as was possible both in the physical and mental sense.  They toiled on the bare land and drew from it all it could give. They fought with the raging sea and gathered its harvest.  Yet it was not possible to continue to live on the island.  Apart from the perpetual difficulty of winning food there there was the constant struggle to obtain fuel for the homestead fires. We can recall Peig Sayers' account of her own son Tomás and his much lamented death when he went to gather heather fuel for the fire.  That incident is an indication of how constant the struggle for survival was.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that the people whose life was a constant struggle for mere existence should be commemorated by a national historic park.  There are many other reasons to perpetuate their memory. The people of An Blascaod Mór were unique.  They left a large corpus of literary work.  They have built their memorial in the words which live on in their books.  We now pay our respects in establishing a national historic park, an ongoing tribute to the islanders who have, through their writings, left us their own legacy.  It is fitting that the very soil which was an inspiration to the islanders and their literary creations should now be held by the Irish nation as an indication of its respect for the past generations of An Blascaod Mór's community. Although Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers and Muiris Ó Suilleabháin are the most famous of the island's writers, An Blascaod Mór has been an inspiration for many more writers and artists.  Such a small community, an island community, has never in the history of this country shown such a great flowering.  Many of the authors wrote under a system which ignored their language and often expressed hostility towards it.  In the face of those odds, without official support, the writings of the islanders flourished and brought international recognition to An Blascaod Mór.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> The people of the island received recognition for their allegiance to their native culture.  They were revered because of their faithfulness to their way of life, their lack of pretension and their ability to convey to the world the uniqueness of their existence.</P>
    <P>When we stand in Dún Chaoin and look out across the ocean to An Blascaod Mór we marvel at the contribution of so minute a community to the life of this country in the past century.  That contribution has not ceased as there are regular additions to the literature from islanders and their descendants.  One calls to mind the writings of one Pádraig O Méalóid, who was a very close relative of the major Blasket writer Tomás Ó Criomhthain.</P>
    <P>The National Historic Park is a fitting tribute as it will preserve much of the physical inspiration for future generations. The community of An Blascaod Mór, although scattered to the four corners of the earth, is a source of encouragement for us all.  Today, as we stand on the brink of greater integration into Europe and with the advent of universal communication and entertainment, we fear for our unique traditions and heritage. An Blascaod Mór received the attention of Europe.  Some of Europe's most famous scholars came to the island and they were made welcome.  The islanders earned their respect.</P>
    <P>They did not grovel to the academics from both England and the continent. They had no need to.  They were welcomed and not seen as a threat, because the islanders were steadfast in their adherence to their own form of life. Although an Blascaod Mór has been deserted for years it has a lesson for us today.  It can teach us the value of self-respect. If we are strong in our own culture we can withstand the detrimental affect of alien influences, absorb what is beneficial and thereby strengthen our own ethos.</P>
    <P>The islanders welcomed the visitors and it is fitting that this Bill will provide for the return of the visitors to An Blascaod Mór.  We are aware that the island has much to offer the visitor apart <Col N="1105" /> from its scenic setting.  The island will give an insight into the traditions of former generations; it will give us an understanding of the constant battle which the islanders waged with the elements.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, Tory Island, further from the mainland than An Blascaod Mór, is seeking assistance to preserve its community.  The island's cooperative launched a development programme recently and I am appealing to An Taoiseach as Minister for the Gaeltacht to provide the necessary support for the community on Tory Island to enable that vigorous community to continue to live on the island as they wish to do.  Tory has an activie community which faced many difficulties and the provision of a safe harbour is an immediate need.</P>
    <P>We hope that the development of a national historic park will lead to increased employment in the locality.  It would be an appropriate tribute to the past generations of islanders who, through their work, raised the banner of An Blascaod Mór if the present and future generations were to receive employment there.  We have already seen the expertise of the Office of Public Works in operation in managing national parks and they have achieved a great deal.  They have, through their professionalism, been responsible for a major growth in the tourist industry in the areas in which they have been involved.</P>
    <P>In Glenveagh National Park in Donegal, the board are involved in excellent work and they attracted almost 100,000 tourists to the national park last year.  I hope that with their involvement in An Blascaod Mór, similar success will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Tomás Ó Criomhthain said: &ldquo;Ní bheidh ár léitheidí ann arís&rdquo;, and Peig Sayers said that she did not think that there was a person &mdash; chomh Gaelach léi.  Both were correct.</P>
    <P>This Bill will establish a fitting monument, not only preserving their homes but also the wonderful flora and fauna of the south-west of Ireland, a unique flora in its close relationship with the flora of the Iberian Peninsula.  That tie with the <Col N="1106" /> south-west mainland of Europe adds to the importance of the island and our need to preserve it.</P>
    <P>An Blascaod Mór will be a major attraction which will draw visitors not only from Ireland but from many parts of the world.  They will come to pay homage to a people who have made a major contribution to the rural literature of modern Europe.  We are, however, uneasy about the lack of clarity concerning the acquisition of lands on the island and we earnestly hope that this matter will be rectified amicably.  It is imperative that the matter of land transfer is solved to the satisfaction of all parties, because of the nature of the project and the evident public support it enjoys. The project has received coverage outside the country and it could draw adverse attention were the problem not solved quickly.  It would be disastrous were lengthy legal procedures to arise, delaying the establishment of the national historic park, and it is certain that it would be to the detriment of the project were this Bill found to be unconstitutional or even if the President had to refer it to the Supreme Court before signing it.</P>
    <P>Has the Bill received efficient attention from its drafters?  Should the matter of acquisition of the island have been clarified before the Bill was introduced?  After all, this is not emergency legislation.  The proposal for the establishment of a national park has been in circulation for some time and it seems that the Bill has been introduced before all problems associated with getting the project off the ground have been solved to the satisfaction of the parties involved.  I hope all this will be cleared up and that it will not unduly delay the establishment of the national park.</P>
    <P>Thar rud ar bith eile is í an Ghaeilge a ndeachaigh an Blascaod Mór chun tairbhe di.  Is chuig an oileán iargúlta seo in imeall na bóchna a tháinig mórscoláirí na teanga ó thar lear, daoine iad a raibh clú agus cáil orthu as siocair a saothair acadúil, daoine mar Thompson, Jackson, Marstrander agus An Bláithín.  Bhí urraim acu don teanga agus nocht siad an t-ómós sin do bhunadh an oileáin.  Bhí sin <Col N="1107" /> ina chuidiú ar muintir an oileáin.  Ba mhór an t-ábhar misnigh ag an phobal na daoine uaisle seo a fheiceáil ag deol na teanga.  Tábhachtach agus mar a bhí sé do phobal an oileáin, bhí sé lán chomh tábhachtach do mhuintir na hÉireann, mar thug sé tuiscint dóibh ar earra luachmhar, an teanga seo acu féin a bhí ina seilbh.  Ar an drochuair, ní ann don phobal a thuill oiread measa, a thuilleadh, ach seasann an tairbhe a rinne siad go fóill.  Is cóir dúinn a gcuimhne a choinneáill buan ar an charraig lom a bhí mar áras acu.  Bhí siad dílis don teanga, agus ní amháin sin ach bhí siad dian dícheallach á saothrú.  Bheadh sinne ag déanamh éagóir orthu mura ndéanfaimis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Pháirc nua Náisiúnta Stairiúil, agus tá áthas orm go mbeidh páirtíocht ag Roinn na Gaeltachta san fhiontar nuair a bheidh sé faoi lán seol, mar tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh siadsan a ndícheall chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ansin.  Tá súil againn go mbeidh an coincheap sin in uachtar nuair a bheidh Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ag leagan amach polasaí i leith na páirce.</P>
    <P>Is cloch choirnéil an Blaoscad Mór in oidhreacht na tíre.  Cá bhfios nach gcuirfidh sé borradh agus fás faoin oileán in athuair agus go mbeadh a ainm in airde réime i gcéin agus i gcóngar.  Ba dheas dá mbeadh cónaí le bheith ar an oileán arís mura mbeadh ann ach an beagán a mbeadh cúram na dturasóirí orthu.</P>
    <P>Arís, cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille agus beidh suim againn sna himeachtaí ansin, agus nuair a bheas an pháirc faoi lán seol beimid uilig ag tabhairt cuairt air.</P>

      <P>Maraon lena bhfuil ráite cheana féin, cuirimse chomh maith fíorchaoin fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus geallaimse tacaíocht, mo thacaíocht féin agus tacaíocht an Pháirtí Dhaonlathaigh, don Bhille agus do gach rud atá i gceist sa Bhille seo.  Tá áthas ormsa go rabhas féin ar dhuine de na Teachtaí ba thúisce a thug cabhair airgid don Fhondúireacht nuair a thosnaíodar.  Chomh maith leis sin, agus maraon lena bhfuil ráite ag an Teachta McGinley bhíos i láthair ag na <Col N="1108" /> cruinnithe go léir a bhí ag lucht Fhondúireacht an Blascaoid le Comhchoiste an Oireachtais don Ghaeilge agus na cruinnithe eile a bhí ag an bhFondúireacht leis an Taoiseach anseo agus le muintir na Dála ó thosnaigh an feachtas chun an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin, tugann sé áthas agus sásamh domsa an Bille a bheith os comhair na Dála mar atá sé tráthnóna inniu. Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Taoiseach as ucht an tsuim speisialta a chuir sé féin sa ghnó seo agus as ucht an am a chaith sé chun cuspóirí an Bhille seo a thabhairt chun cinn.  Tréaslaim chomh maith le muintir na Fondúireachta agus le muintir Dhún Chaoin agus cheantar sin Chiarraí as ucht an éacht oibre a dheineadar chun gnó na Fondúireachta a thabhairt go dtí an tslí faoi mar atá sé anseo inniu.  Gan aon amhras, chuireadar chun oibre le dúthracht a thaispeáin dúinn go léir gur féidir rudaí suntasacha a dhéanamh fiú amháin nuair a bhíonn airgead gann agus nuair a bhionn a lán rudaí eile idir lámha ag daoine gnóthacha.  Thaispeáin muintir na Fondúireachta gur féidir sin a dhéanamh. Mar sin, ba mhaith liom moladh speisialta a thabhairt dóibh siúd agus do gach duine a chabhraigh leo chun an Bille seo agus an dréacht-Bhille a thabhairt chun críche.</P>
      <P>It is with deep delight that I stand to praise this Bill, which opens up a number of possibilities for the nation.  As a little girl I used to go to that part of County Kerry during my summer holidays to learn Irish in the Gaeltacht, which is not as good now as it ought to be.  Also I drank, as school children and teachers did, of the writings and literature of that great island.  Therefore it is with deep delight that I stand to give my full approval and support to this Bill.  Today is a proud day for the nation.  Despite all the emphasis nowadays on economic, scientific and technological matters, this Bill is an indication that we have not lost our sense of priorities or values.  This evening, which is a very busy one for most of us, we are pledging our support for this Bill and to do everything we can to achieve its aims and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My quotation is not very accurate but <Col N="1109" /> following his death, somebody said of Macbeth.  &ldquo;Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it.&rdquo;  Perhaps the same can be said of the 25th Dáil &mdash; nothing becomes the Dáil more than this second last Bill.  I think this is the second last Bill, the Universities Bill is due to be debated tomorrow.  Be that as it may, it is only fit and proper &mdash; not taking too much credit &mdash; that our generation recognise the value of this island.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that this island and all it stands for is preserved as a natural birth right for the next generation and that this island is acquired and developed as a national historic park in the manner laid out in this Bill.  That is the right thing for us to do.  If we do otherwise we will stand condemned.</P>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the Taoiseach and the members of the Fondúireacht who worked relentlessly during the past few years to collect money, gain support and iron out the serious problems which seemed to beset this project at its initiation.  There is no doubt that they deserve great credit and our admiration for what they have done.  Let this be a headline for other parts of the country which have the potential to do something similar when there is a strong local commitment which springs out of a deep conviction.</P>
    <P>When people are prepared to do what has been done they receive a lot of support, and in this case they have received the support of the people who matter.  I have no doubt that the blessing which the Taoiseach has given to the project has been of enormous advantage to them.  I welcome the provision which allows for the making of by-laws to ensure that the park is adequately preserved and developed.  Every effort must be made to ensure that the island is linguistically, and culturally as well as geographically accessible to all people, both Irish and otherwise.  In this respect I would strongly advocate the establishment of an intrpretative centre and a resource centre on the mainland, preferably at Dun Chaoin, to act as a sort of shop window for the island so that both visitors and our own people will be lured to the island from what they <Col N="1110" /> see and learn at that centre.  Such a centre must be provided if the aims and objectives of this Bill are to be fully realised.</P>
    <P>I ask that provision be made for this at the same time.  A centre should be provided on the mainland, preferably at Dun Chaoin, properly laid out, to bring a living dynamic island to the notice of people who want to visit that part of County Kerry.  I hope they will be encouraged to visit that part of County Kerry, because it is the ambition of every right minded person to market this island.  It is one of our greatest selling points and we should market it well both at home and abroad.  That is the first recommendation I would make.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning once again &mdash; and this was referred to earlier this evening &mdash; that last week there was another translation of <i>An tOileánach</i> from Switzerland. It is extremely ironic that most of the interest in the island has been shown by scholars outside Ireland.  This would seem to suggest that <i>An tOileánach, Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i>, and <i>Peig</i> are more widely read by adult communities outside Ireland.  If this were to continue to be the case it would be a great pity.</P>
    <P>Each time I visit Sceilg Mhichíl &mdash; once a year &mdash; it strikes me very strongly how few Irish people visit the island.  One may find this little rock full of young Germans, young French or young Dutch, but very few Irish people.  This points to a lack in our education system in that we have failed to instil in our young people an appreciation of what Sceilg Mhichíl stands for.  I hope the same will not happen to this new national historic park when it comes into being.  I hope the education system will make every effort to ensure that every child is instilled with an appreciation of what that island stands for and what it means to them, because it is their inheritance.</P>
    <P>Because of the way some books about the island were presented, some people unfortunately were put off visiting the island.  That position has now changed. That is the kind of change we must encourage and foster because the last thing we want to see is this island becoming a curiosity for a small minority of <Col N="1111" /> scholars.  It would not be worth the effort if this were to happen.  It must be open to all our people.  If this is achieved great possibilities will be opened up.  I hope this will happen parallel with the development of the island.</P>
    <P>Let me say a few words on the Irish language, given that we now stand on the brink of 1992.  Extra demands are going to be put on our young people to acquire and foster oral competency in modern European languages.  However, there is a mistaken idea abroad that when this happens in our schools, the Irish language will go into decline.  I am not one of those people who say this.  As a matter of fact, I would argue the opposite will be the case.  Our people have access, through the school system, to two languages from a very early age.  This predisposes them to picking up a third or fourth language much more easily than young people who go to a school where they are taught only one language from the start.</P>
    <P>I hope the opening up of modern European languages and literature will enhance our knowledge and appreciation of our own language and literature.  If our knowledge of the language declines, then our interest in our literature will also decline and fewer people will have access to the poetry and prose of the great writers whom we celebrate in this Bill, and the objectives of this Bill would be defeated.  I say strongly to those who might argue that less effort should be put into teaching and learning the Irish language that this is not so.  There must be more of an effort put into the teaching and learning of the Irish language in a European sense because undoubtedly languages nourish one another and feed off one another in the same way as cultures and literature nourish and feed off one another.</P>
    <P>I hope that the passing of this Bill and all it stands for will lead to a dynamic enrichment of our own culture in a European sense and that we would, through open dialogue with Germans and French in their own language, have access to their literature and at the same time open wider access to our literature among the <Col N="1112" /> Germans, French and other Europeans. We have a lot to bring culturally to the rich tapestry of European culture and the imminence of 1992 should help to focus our attention on that point.  It should also help to enhance our respect, appreciation and love for things Irish, literary or otherwise, and the newly restored and revitalised Blasket Island would be the kind of powerhouse to feed and nourish that ideal.  We should become very fulfilled and rounded Europeans with a great love and appreciation for our own literature, customs, flora and fauna and equally open to the literature, writings and customs of other European people so that one would enrich and nourish the other. There should be a great sort of second coming and revitalisation of Irish culture as a result of this Bill coinciding almost directly with the adoption of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>There are times in history when certain things come together, sometimes by accident and other times by design.  It is a happy thing for us that these two matters coincide.  The adoption of the Single European Act opens up cultural as well as economic possibilities.  I hope that what I have outlined will happen and that those of us who have influence will spare no effort to make sure that it does happen. What was begun in the Seanad last week and which will be taken a stage further in this House this evening will be well worth all the effort and will bring a great feeling of enrichment to Irish people and to Europeans.</P>
    <P>I have very few worries about the Bill but one of them is in relation to land, which I hope will not be a source of conflict.  This ought to be a true occasion for celebration and I hope that the land issue will be resolved and that it will be acquired by agreement if at all possible. That is important for everybody because we need all the support we can get to make sure that the objectives and the aims of this Bill are fully met.  The acquisition of the land is very important so, from the start, I hope that any potential conflict will be warded off because if it slows down the momentum maybe the great occasion will pass.  Certainly the <Col N="1113" /> voluntary for fundraising for this kind of project tends to diminish if something does not happen on the ground.  That is a fact of life.  If legal wrangling were to slow down the development of this historic park one of the effects undoubtedly would be that voluntary subscribers would be inclined to subsidise it less and less or to delay their subsidy.  That is just one of the many dangers I see if there is trouble in acquiring the land.</P>
    <P>The goodwill and fervour with which key people approach this Bill must be harnessed and kept from being diluted or diminished.  I welcome the Bill.  I ask that an interpretative centre be provided at the same time as the park comes into being as it would be the key to making the park successful.  A number of people who obviously are convinced of the value of this project and what it stands for have spoken very passionately about it.  I read all the Seanad debates on the subject, which were a delight.  However, we must not keep this park for ourselves, we must pass it on to the next generation and to a great many more people who perhaps are not convinced of or conversant with the value of the writings and all that this island, An Blascaod Mór, stands for.</P>
    <P>Guím rath agus rathúnas ar an mBille seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom céad míle fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Is é mo thuairim gurb é an rud is suntasaí a tharla i gceantar Gaeltachta le blianta fada.  Táimid an-bhuíoch den Taoiseach, i gCiarraí, mar gheall ar an tsuim phearsanta a chuir sé sa Bhille.  Níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil Peig Sayers, Tomás Ó Criomhthain agus Muiris Ó Súilleabháin an-bhródúil má tá siad ag éisteacht linn, agus is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil siad. Bhí siad i ngrá leis an gcultúr Gaelach, leis an traidisiún Gaelach, agus ar bharr sin, an teanga.  Dúirt Peig Sayers ina leabhar, &ldquo;Slán le beartaí an tsaoil seo anois, agus go mór mór leis an aimsir aoibhinn aerach atá caite agam anseo.  Is baolach liom ná déanfad a thuille saothair feasta ar mhaithe le teangain na sárfhear, ach tá cion duine déanta agam, b'fhéidir.  Do <Col N="1114" /> dhéanfainn oiread eile, agus ba chroí liom é, ach tá an chairde caite.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unquestionably if Peig Sayers were listening to us now &mdash; and I have no doubt she is &mdash; she would be extremely proud, as would her literary genius fellow islanders Tomás Ó Criomhthain and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin. She and they, through this Bill, achieved what would have been their dream, which was a very simple one, to preserve all things Irish as they loved everything Irish.</P>
      <P>The Great Blasket Island stands like a Colossus off the coast of west Kerry.  It is a monument to a proud past, a testament to a massive culture, a relic of another age and another time.  It is true that if these literary geniuses had not existed it would have been difficult to understand that age and time.  They were part of an age and time that could not possibly have been understood without them.  To their eternal credit they preserved the Irish language just as they held their complete faith in God and in the hereafter.</P>
      <P>Their lives were simple and hard lived, they did not have it easy.  Peig Sayers said: &ldquo;Ní raibh sé sámh&rdquo;.  Apart from the fact that they lived difficult lives and found it hard to get by there was a spirit in them that could not be denied.  They possessed something that could not be defined and perhaps it might be best described as a sense of freedom, of being, a sense of community, of feeling for one another and, above all, a sense of patriotism. They were patriots to the core, honest, simple, decent and dignified people and they exhibited that in all they did, in everything they wrote and in all they said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That island has a massive heritage.  It possesses something that is rare in the world today.  The development of the Great Blasket Island as a national historic park places it in a unique position because, unquestionably, it is unique.  It is marvellous to see the Bill going through the Dáil at a time when the country has its own difficulties and after the Government were obliged over the last number of years to try to rectify the financial problems facing us.  It is marvellous in an <Col N="1115" /> age of materialism to see that the spirit of the nation is very much alive.  In this regard it is only fitting that I, a Deputy from South Kerry, should pay a personal tribute on behalf of the people of County Kerry, and on my own behalf, to the Taoiseach, without whose help the Bill could never have been brought before the House.  His efforts in regard to it are deeply appreciated and they epitomise what has been true of his entire political career, his commitment to Irish culture and the Irish way of life.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid, which was largely responsible for the Bill.  They saw a unique opportunity and grasped it.  They worked themselves tirelessly in order to achieve their aim.  I am delighted for them this evening because what they have achieved is something of historic importance, something that will live on for generations of Irish people to know, love and enjoy.  The development represents a unique opportunity for the Dingle Peninsula. With the development of Dingle harbour and the opening of an international airport at Farranfore, the entire Dingle Peninsula has been opened up in a way hitherto unimagined.  Those developments represent an opportunity for the Dingle Peninsula to develop its tourism industry in a way that could not have been envisaged some few years ago. I have no doubt that this national historic monument will attract to the Dingle Peninsula those who have a love of things Irish, those with a sense of history and those with a spirit of freedom.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that off the Kerry coast there are two of the most important historical and archaeological islands in western Europe.  Skellig Rock, which is off the coast of the Iveragh Peninsula, and the Great Blasket island are two of the most significant national monuments which this country, or any country, could possess.  This is a marvellous day for Irish heritage, a marvellous day for the Irish language, a marvellous day for Irish tradition and a marvellous day for all those who love things Irish, its history and its literature.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille, agus fáilte Chiarraíoch dó.  Tá draíocht dhothuigthe ag baint leis na Blascaodaí leis na cianta, draíocht a mheall na scoláirí ón Eoraip, ó Mheiriceá agus ó gach páirt den domhan, mar a dúirt an Taoiseach, cosúil le Marstrander, Robin Flower agus John Millington Synge agus a leithéidí.  Is iontach go bhfuil an draíocht chéanna ann fós, agus bhí sí le feiscint sa scannán iontach a dhein Muiris Mac Conghail.  Is dócha gurb é an draíocht chéanna a mheall an Taoiseach, chun seilbh a ghlacadh ar Inis Mhicileán. Bhí saol crua ag muintir an Oileáin riamh, agus is deacair iad a lochtú nuair a thug siad cúl ar an oileán agus aghaidh ar an mórthír i 1953.  Ná dúirt na scríbhneoirí ón Oileán &ldquo;Nach breá mór fairsingí Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá seanaithne ag mo mhuintir ar an Oileán le fada an lá.  Bhí mé féin anchairdiúil leis an bhfile, Micheál Ó Gaoithín, mac Pheig Sayers, agus ceann de na cuimhní is buaine agam ná lá a shín sé píosa páipéir amach dom agus é ar leaba a bháis san ospidéal sa Daingean. Léas é.  Bhí dán scríofa aige ag comóradh oscailt Scoil Dhún Chaoin.  Sa dán a scríobh sé an-mholadh don Chomhrialtas agus don Aire Oideachais, Risteard de Búrca, agus bhí trí véarsa aige mar gheall orm féin.  Ceart, is fíor a rá, bhí sin ar cheann de na bronntanais is luachmhaire a fuair mé riamh.  Is ceart agus is cóir dúinn ár n-oidhreacht a chosaint, agus ar an bpointe seo tréaslaím leis an Taoiseach de bharr gach rud atá déanta aige go dtí seo agus do na hoileánaigh atá fágtha i nDún Chaoin.  Deirim leis an Taoiseach ag an bpointe seo gur cheart deontais speisialta a thabhairt dóibh chun maireachtaint.  Níl sé ró-éascaí do chuid acu, agus ba cheart do Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí na tithe a thóg siad idir 1953 go 1954 a fheabhsú agus é sin a dhéanamh anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blasket islands were inhabited by a community of self-sufficient people living by the sea and on the sea where the ill wind often brought a rich harvest and a sudden storm ended in tragedy.  They were a community of families living as families should and those of us who were <Col N="1117" /> fortunate enough to know them were enriched by their behaviour and example. Theirs was an uncorrupted outlook and philosophy of life which was uncontaminated by radio or television or any outside influence.  Tá seanfhocal ann, pós duine ón oileán agus pósann tú an t-oileán ar fad.  My family had a long association with the islanders.  Indeed, two of my grand-aunts married men from the Blasket Islands and if they were alive today &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach will take joy in this &mdash; they would be delighted to see their grandson, T.P.Ó Conchubhair contesting the Údarás election in Munster in the coming weeks on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The Blaskets, as the Taoiseach pointed out, have given the country some of its finest literature.  Tá ráiteas ann, ní bheidh a leithéidí arís ann.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute in the House to the man who in my opinion opened the floodgates.  I am referring to Brian O'Ceallaigh of Killarney, a secondary school inspector in the early years of native Government. He may have led an unusual life but surely he deserves better than to be buried in an unmarked grave in Yugoslavia. Beannacht Dé le hanamnacha na marbh.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill represents a move in the right direction but some of the provisions are of the sledgehammer-and-nut variety. I am concerned about some of the provisions but if the Taoiseach can allay those concerns I will gladly accept them.  The people targetted under section 4 are the only ones who have expended any major sums of money and put time and effort into the restoration and preservation of the island, including in particular the house of Peig Sayers, over the past 35 years.  Section 4(2) is also divisive because it sets up two classes of people, some whose property is exempt from nationalisation and others whose property will be liable to compulsory purchase.  The Office of Public Works will be able to pick and choose any piece of property, either by agreement or compulsorily, and this will further <Col N="1118" /> damage the value of the remaining parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Last but not least &mdash; and I say this sincerely &mdash; with regard to the holdings of the islanders which are free from this legislation, section 4 will damage the value of property not liable to compulsory nationalisation.  Such property will become liable to nationalisation if transferred or sold to any person of non-island extraction.  It is unlikely that any bank or institution would lend money on the security of such property, whether for improvement or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I attended several dinners of the Fondúireacht and at the last dinner which was held in the ESB office in Fitzwilliam Square I suggested that somebody should have approached the owners of the property and come to an agreement.  I have in my possession a letter written on behalf of an American widow who owns half the land on the island.  This letter is sent by Williams, Stevens, McCarville &amp; Frizzell, Attorneys at law, Buffalo, New York, and addressed to the Honorable Margaret Heckler, 42 Eglin Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Ambassador,</P>
    <P>We communicate with you by facsimile copy because of the apparent pressure of time and our desires to protect the interests of an American citizen in Great Blasket Island.</P>
    <P>We enclose a copy of my letter of May 9, 1989 to the Irish Times ...</P>
    <P>I will not go into that.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>Phillips Brooks was a very loyal and creative member of the United States Information Service and at times during his career served in Mexico City, Beirut, Paris and London.  He inherited a very modest sum from an aunt in Buffalo and it was through this connection that I came to know him and his lovely wife.  When he informed me of the original 1972 investment in Great Blasket Island, I must confess I was concerned that this might be the Irish equivalent of the Brooklyn <Col N="1119" /> Bridge.  Phil was so trusting and honorable and had great faith in his Irish solicitor, Peter Callery, that I felt somehow, some day the investment would pay off.  His untimely death in 1975 left a wife and children in a strained financial situation which they have enjoyed to this date.  The possibility of realizing something on the original investment would be of considerable importance to the family and if you can put this correspondence in the hands of the appropriate member of your staff, it would be greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>This is the paragraph I take exception to and it is uncalled for:</P>
    <P>We have been favoured with copies of some of the recent extracts from the Irish Press and I would have to guess that no one in the Parliament would be too sympathetic with the interests of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; so that we are in hopes that your good offices can be of assistance.</P>
    <P>We feel sure that the sale of Brooks' interest could easily be negotiated without the necessity of nationalisation as proposed by the Parliament.  Many thanks for your interest, concern and protective arm.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>E.W. Dann Stevens.</P>
    <P>That kind of publicity for this Parliament is not good enough and is why I hope the Taoiseach will engage in consultations. He has it in his power to ensure that negotiations will be way ahead of nationalisation.  If this goes into the courts and there is a constitutional case, as has been threatened by one individual, hundreds of thousands of pounds could be lost and, as Deputy Maureen Quill said, the momentum of this project would be lost also.</P>
    <P>There are many islands in this group, Beig Inis, Inis Tuaiscirt, and I know one of the owners of the other islands is prepared to sell it to the State, if it wants to buy it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will include <Col N="1120" /> his island for posterity so that it will stay with the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill breaks new ground in regard to what is to be done with An Blascaod Mór and provides for its restoration by the State before handing it over to the Fondúireacht.  I have a slight reservation about this and I believe the State should have some clawback.  Perhaps the by-laws which are to be made by the Office of Public Works would cover the point I am making and if the Taoiseach can assure me on this point I will be happy.  I believe the Fondúireacht should only get this property on a three year lease and if it does not work out as it should, the State should repossess it.  The present Fondúireacht is top class but perhaps the next group of people who take over will not be as good.  I should like to protect the State's interests, and I know the Taoiseach will be very interested in this aspect also.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach knows, there will be a need for licensed ferries and proper landing facilities will have to be provided both in Dún Chaoin and on the island. That has to be our first priority.  I believe I played a small part in this, even if I have to blow my own trumpet here this afternoon.  I was Parliamentary Secretary in the Office of Public Works during the period 1975-77 and we were concerned that the island was being bought up.  I should like to put on record that the men in the Office of Public Works at that time were excellent.  Danny Lynch was my private secretary at that time but he has now gone to greater things &mdash; he is PRO of the GAA.  He was dispatched to Dún Chaoin and while the midnight oil was burning in Kruger's pub, Lord have mercy on the dead, he hammered out an agreement with some of the islanders so that the State would have a holding on the island and it could not be taken over entirely.  I should like to put on the record the part Danny Lynch played, while the midnight oil was burning and I suppose over the pints he drank slowly, in hammering out that agreement.  He did tremendous work and we supported him. As I said, I was in the privileged position <Col N="1121" /> of secretary in the Office of Public Works at that time.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach for bringing in this legislation.  His visits to Dingle have done nothing but good for the locality.  Everytime he visits the area it means a lot to the people there.  I know the Taoiseach's heart and soul is in the legislation, and if he allays the fears of genuine people, apart from the people who have a pecuniary interest in the legislation, I would be satisfied.</P>

Is é seo an chéad Pháirc Náisiúnta sa Ghaeltacht, agus tá áthas orm gur tugadh aitheantas don Ghaeltacht seo tríd an mBille seo a thabhairt isteach agus Páirc Náisiúnta a oscailt ann.  Is é seo an t-oileán ina raibh Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin agus mórán scríbhneoirí eile, agus sna leabhair atá scríofa acu siúd tá sé an-fhurasta an Ghaeilge a léamh agus a thuiscint iontu de bharr an tslí inar labhraíodar féin agus an tslí inar scríobhadar iad.  Sna Blascaodaí tá sé bailithe, ár gcultúr, béaloideas agus stair na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh pleananna againn chun Páirc Náisiúnta dá leithéid a oscailt sna Gaeltachtaí eile, i mo Ghaeltacht féin i gCorcaigh, am éigin.  Mar níl aon dabht ar domhan ná gurb é a leithéid seo de áit a mheallfaidh tuarasóirí thar lear le teacht go dtí ár dtír, agus is é an chéad rud a déarfaidhís leo féin ná, &ldquo;Cá bhfuil an áit nó an bhfuil aon áit acu ina bhféadfaimis a fháil amach cad a tharla blianta ó shin nó cad é an saghas cultúir a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta?&rdquo;  Anois tá áit againn, a bhuíochas sin don Taoiseach agus don Rialtas as an áit seo a chur ar fáil sna Blascaodaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá áthas orm, leis, go dtabharfaidh sé spreagadh don Ghaeilge, agus go speisialta do dhaoine óga sa Ghalltacht.  Mar tá rud nua, sílim, agus go speisialta ó bhuaileamar isteach sa Chomhargadh, i measc an aosa óig, nach bhfuil aon ghá in aon chor leis, nach bhfuil puinn measa acu ar ár dteanga.  Ach ní fheicim, nuair a bheimid inár mbaill den Chómhargadh <Col N="1122" /> i 1992 cad ina thaobh nach féidir linn ár dteanga féin a bheith againn.  Níl aon dabht nach bhfuil sí ar an teanga is furasta a fhoghlaim.  Tuigim go maith Béarlóirí, an mhuintir óg, go speisialta leanaí óga, go bhfuil sé an-fhurasta dóibh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus teacht amach go soiléir lenár dteanga Ghaeilge i bhfad níos fusa ná bheith ag labhairt i mBéarla. Sin é an taobh chrua, ag cur tuilleadh brú, agus i gCiarraí, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil jab an-mhaith déanta air seo, agus bheinn ag iarraidh go leanfaí leis an saghas sin tacaíochta a thabhairt dár dteanga.</P>
    <P>Gan dabht, na leabhair agus uile a scríobh na daoine ó na hoileáin seo, ní fhéadfaí riamh dearmad a dhéanamh orthu.  Bheadh eagla orm, leis an nGaeilge nua mar atá sí tagtha isteach, go dtógfadh sí áit na scríbhneoirí seo, ach anois nuair atá an pháirc náisiúnta á cur ar fáil ag an Rialtas, tá sin ag cinntiú go leanfaidh an obair atá déanta ag Peig Sayers agus a comrádaithe ansin, go mbeidh sé ann le feiscint thar na blianta ag teacht.  Tá inár nGaeltacht féin tuarasóirí ag teacht ó áiteanna thar lear, agus tá páirceanna dá leithéid, ach ní páirceanna náisiúnta iad, ach tá sé an-bhreá do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a rá leo, &ldquo;Féach, má théann tú amach anseo.&rdquo;  Tá áit amháin in aice liom, mar Ghuagán Barra in mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, agus nuair a thagann na mílte tuarasóirí ann i rith an tsamhraidh, agus an rud a bhíonn siad a lorg ná conas a mhair na daoine ann, cad é an tslí bheatha a bhí acu blianta agus blianta ó shin, tá roinnt de le feiscint san áit sin, in nGuagán Barra, mar a deirim.  Tá aithne agat féin air, a Cheann Comhairle, chaithis tréimhse ann, cúig nó sé bliana déag ó shin, agus is minic a labhraís faoi, agus sin é atá ag teastáil go speisialta sna Gaeltachtaí.  Is í an Ghaeltacht an t-aon áit atá sásta an cultúr seo a thabhairt chun cinn agus a choinneáil. Má fhaigheann muintir na Gaeltachta tuilleadh tacaíochta chun é sin a dhéanamh &mdash; ní an iomad atá ag teastáil uathu chun é sin a dhéanamh &mdash; níl aon dabht ná go ndéanfaidh siad é sin agus go bhfuilid <Col N="1123" /> sásta gach rud a dhéanamh chun t-aitheantas sin a thabhairt agus an sean-nós a choinneáil ina bheatha.</P>
    <P>Féachann muintir na tíre ar an Dáil agus orainne anseo mar dhream nach bhfuil aon rud ag déanamh buairimh dúinn ach a bheith ag déileáil le hairgead agus le gnóthaí na tíre gach lá den bhliain a fhad is atáimid anseo, agus nach bhfuil aon rud ar intinn againn ach a bheith ag cur cánach ar dhaoine agus ag plé timpeall leis.  Ach leis an mBille seo tá sé soiléir do mhuintir na tíre ar fad go bhfuil níos mó ná sin ag tarlú anseo sa Dáil. Nílimid ag déanamh dearmaid ar ár gcultúr, agus is ceart nach ndéanfaimis.  Nuair a léifidh siad sna páipéir go raibh an Bille seo á phlé, cuirfidh sé i gcuimhne dóibh go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta dóibh. Arís, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach.  Tá súil agam go bhfaighfidh sé gach tacaíocht atá ag teastáil chun an Bille seo a chur tríd anseo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am much obliged to you for having given me this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, first, because I very much approve of its provisions and, second, for what I shall call sentimental reasons.</P>
      <P>My first introduction to the Blasket Islands was back in the late thirties when a book entitled <i>An tOileánach</i> by Tomás Ó Criomhthain was prescribed by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland for their second Irish examination.  I studied that book and often think of it with affection. I made mental resolutions then to spend my holidays there but, like many such resolutions, I regret to say I did not keep any of them.  Even at this late date I feel a great affection for the Blasket Islands, derived from my studying of that book for the second Irish examination, in which I am glad to say I was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on having taken the initiative to preserve the last of the Gaeltacht Blaskets as a national park or property.  That initiative has my full approval.  In my capacity as Minister for <Col N="1124" /> Lands I had the idea of initiating legislation to protect our off shore islands. When I say &ldquo;protect&rdquo; I mean protect them for the nation to ensure that they do not fall into wrong hands and be abused or misused.  I regret to say also that I was led to believe, at that time, that to enumerate or list our offshore islands would constitute a mighty task, never mind taking them under control. With the experience I now have, had I to do it again, I would overcome that difficulty.  All I was suggesting then was that they be protected, that steps be taken to ensure that they would not be lost to the nation or fall into hands from which it would be very difficult, or shall I say very expensive, to retrieve them.  I am glad to note that the Taoiseach himself has settled on the Blaskets, and that the first step, at any rate, has been taken to create a national park there.  I give that my wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the other point, that is, that our offshore islands should be listed, surveyed or enumerated and should be protected, but not in a narrow or a troublesome way, for this nation and that, in order to develop them &mdash; that is the word that would be used to do whatever was going to be done with them, though it might not always be development &mdash; and to change their use, the permission of the Department of Lands or the equivalent of the Land Commission should be required.  I say this because once these islands, or any island or property, fall into private ownership and are developed it is then very difficult to get them back or to put them to proper use.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to ramble on, for reasons which most of you will know.  I am not in a fit condition to do that at present but I will summarise what I have been saying by giving my absolute approval, as a former Minister for Lands, to the proposed development, to the protection of the islands and to the scheme outlined in this Bill.  I congratulate all those concerned with it.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, I do not suppose many of the islands have changed hands but now is the time to protect them, it is <Col N="1125" /> not when they have changed hands and become valuable and partially developed that it would be possible to protect them. I suggest that the Government seriously consider enacting new law which would make the consent of the Board of Works or the Land Commission a necessity before any change of ownership or change of use is carried out to these islands.</P>
    <P>While I may not be strictly in order now &mdash; and that is the wrong thing for any person on his feet to say because he is putting all concerned on notice &mdash; I note that the Land Commission is being abolished and that the Government have given their benediction to that.  The abolition of the Land Commission without any protective machinery being put in its place is a great mistake because the land will be grabbed and gobbled up by people and the small man will be deprived of increasing his land or of acquiring a farm.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by saying that I sincerely hope the Land Commission will not be abolished or if it is abolished that the smallholders will still have an opportunity of increasing their acreage and that they will not be at the mercy of the man with the big cheque book or the man who has access to large sums of money.  I was very surprised to see that it was proposed to abolish the Land Commission without, as far as I know, any machinery being put in its place to protect the small and medium sized farmer.  I sincerely hope there will be second thoughts about this and that what I have said will be heeded.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the chance to say a few words on this Bill this evening.  While some people might say that the Blasket Islands are some way outside my constituency, I have long had an interest in minority groups in this country &mdash; and indeed in other countries &mdash; and islanders certainly are a minority group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people might see this Bill as a kind of grand gesture on the part of the <Col N="1126" /> Taoiseach.  I am not against grand gestures &mdash; I would not be so small minded &mdash; but there is a time and a place for them.  I have long had an interest in the islands, and especially in the buildings of the islands and, in particular, the dry stonework, the timber work, the slates and other aspects of the buildings.  The islanders did not import tradesmen from the mainland but did most of the work themselves.  The dry stone walling especially is unique in these islands.</P>
    <P>I have had an interest for a long time also in the writers from the islands.  The Taoiseach and other Deputies have spoken about Tomás Ó Criomhtháin, Peig Sayers and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin. They have all provided us with very valuable pictures of life on the island, of the life and work of the islanders.  We also owe much to outside writers, especially British writers, who came in and showed a great respect and warmth and, indeed, a great love for the islands and the islanders. I would just mention a few &mdash; the Taoiseach has referred to them also &mdash; Robin Flower, a poet and translator, the Marxist scholar, George Thomson, who taught in UCG for many years and wrote in a very sympathetic way about Ireland and its people.  In more recent times, in 1984, Joan and Ray Stables' book, <i>The Blasket Islands</i>, was published by O'Brien Press.  These outside writers helped, through the English language, to reach a wider audience about the life of the Blaskets and the people who lived there.  Also other foreigners &mdash; I use that word in a decent, good sense &mdash; have contributed richly to our understanding of life on the islands.  These included Professor Von Sydow, who was also a very sympathetic beholder and chronicler of life there.  Life on the Blaskets had many unique features which have not been mentioned in the discussion this evening.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell on the methods the islanders had of dealing with sheep. They did not have boundaries to fence off the different plots and fields but they had a communal, co-operative way of sharing the rearing of sheep; from the lambing up to the time of selling the <Col N="1127" /> sheep, this work was done in a co-operative way.  That is a very interesting feature of life on the island that we on the mainland could, perhaps, emulate and copy.  We are often inclined, and this debate shows this, to dramatise and glamourise island life to see it from afar through rose coloured glasses.  Anybody reading Tomás Ó Criomhthain's <i>An tOileánach</i>, the islandman, could have no such illusions whatsoever because he knew all about the hardship and dangers of life on an island.  He described life in his writings as he found it.  There was not very much glamour in anything he said or wrote.  He mentioned especially the difficulties that a husband or father had making a living and rearing a family on the island.  That fact has been glossed over.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in 1916, the year of the Easter Rising, the island population reached the highest recorded point of 176 people, but, unfortunately, from that time until the final evacuation in November 1953 the population declined steadily. Almost all this decline took place under self Government.  We cannot be very proud when we reflect upon that and we ourselves must take some responsibility for the decline of the island.  This is a very poor reflection on successive Governments who pay lip service to island life and to the noble qualities of islanders. Before their final departure from the island, their plight was brought to the attention of no less a person than Mr. Éamon de Valera, but at that stage he could do little to arrest the decline.  By 1953 only 22 people remained on the island and they subsequently left.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are inclined to ignore this sorry record of neglect and to elevate the life of the islanders to an artificial level.  However, if we had built decent harbours and piers on the island, the people might have been able to build up a viable fishing industry.  However, we did nothing of the kind.  We also failed to provide proper medical and education services.  We did little or nothing to develop agriculture on the island.  For instance, Robin Flower, who has been <Col N="1128" /> praised here tonight, commented that the soil on the western island of Inis Mhicileán was too rich to grow potatoes but that it was good for cabbage, onions and even tobacco.  As far as I am aware very little effort was made to encourage the growing of these crops.</P>
    <P>Almost all the Deputies who have spoken have praised in the most fulsome way the island literature.  I do not want to throw cold water on their praise but they described island life in glowing terms, and Deputy O'Donohue described the islanders as being honest, simple, decent and dignified &mdash; a nice piece of alliteration.  I do not think it is accurate to describe islanders in this all embracing glowing manner.  You can feel cosy when talking in that vein but it does not correspond to the world I live in &mdash; and I have travelled as much as anybody. I do not believe it is right to ennoble islanders in this way as if they were somewhat superior or more noble than people who live in centre city areas.  I do not think you can make such distinctions between people, and certainly not the people I have met.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound acrimonious, because it would be out of place at this time, but I cannot help feeling that we are glorifying the islands and their way of life in a way that does not correspond with reality.  We are doing this when Dublin Corporation are about to engage in the clearance and detenanting of Sheriff Street, which is not so far from this House, to make way for the new Financial Services Centre.  We should not forget that Sean O'Casey and Brendan Behan lived only a stone's throw away from Sheriff Street and they wrote about the area and its people.  Yet very few would stand up in this House and talk about the decent, dignified, honest and simple people of Sheriff Street.  I do not want to make a comparison between island writers and the world famous O'Casey and Behan, because that would be invidious and it would be wrong to do so, but I would not want to be unfair to anybody.  Therefore we must keep a sense of balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> I mentioned informally to the Taoiseach this morning the name of a friend and colleague, Dr. John de Courcy Ireland, who is well known to the Taoiseach. Dr. John de Courcy Ireland was recently described in <i>The Irish Press</i> as a white knight and the Taoiseach sought his advice on the problem in Dún Laoghaire. Dr. Ireland has much to contribute to maritime matters in this country and the Taoiseach should call him in once again to consult on the future of the Blasket Islands.  I hope the Taoiseach will be big enough to do that.  Dr. Ireland has many realistic ideas, he is not carried away with grandiose schemes but wants to put our fishing fleet on a proper commercial footing and this House could benefit from his advice.  I will leave it to the Taoiseach to take up this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quibble with the Taoiseach or sound acrimonious, but I must put on record that it was an English couple, Joan and Ray Stables, who first conceived the idea of a national historic park in their book <i>The Blasket Islands</i> published by the O'Brien Press in 1984. They should be given some credit for this and that fact should be put on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well.  It would be churlish of me not to do so.  I hope it will herald a new era for the Blasket Islands, for the future generations of Irish people and foreigners who may wish to visit or live on the islands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank and praise the Taoiseach for introducing this Bill.  I hope it will be the first of many.  I would also like to place on record my praise for the Office of Public Works.  The people of <Col N="1130" /> this country have reason to be grateful for their ability in preserving and developing some of our greatest cultural treasures, Knowth, Newgrange, Clonmacnois, to name a few.  If I may, I wish to enter a personal plea that they continue with their good work on manmade structures, particularly the curvilinear glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens and the very historic debtors prison in Green Street.  These are also ornaments to our heritage, but unfortunately they were manmade, unlike the Blasket Islands, a development of nature, which have stood the test of time better than these artefacts I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope the Taoiseach will not put &mdash; if I may use the term &mdash; all his cultural eggs in one Blasket but may continue the work as seo amach.</P>

The people of Kerry appreciate the Taoiseach's interest and initiative in bringing forward this Bill and are indebted to him.  I would like also to compliment the Office of Public Works, as no doubt they played a leading role.  I would like to thank the Blasket Island Foundation, because without their interest and organisation I feel this Bill would not be before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1910, a 29 year old English scholar visited the Blasket Island for the first time.  It was a time of change and improvement on the island.  The old medieval system of the common field, under which each family owned strips of land scattered around the island, was abolished by the Congested Districts Board.  In its place each family was given a block of land suitable for tillage and another for pasture.  The islanders found it hard to accept this change but the advantages were soon apparent.  The fields were easier to work and were fenced in more securely.  At the same time the roads of the island were repaired, Slipe na mBád was built and <Col N="1131" /> the new houses were erected at Slinnean Bán between the hill and the fields.</P>
    <P>That English scholar fell in love with the island and with Ireland.  He joined in the works that were taking place, so much so that, as Tomás Ó Croithinn said, it left &ldquo;rian na piocóide ar a lámha&rdquo;.  He returned with his newly wed wife in 1911 and in time he brought his family to the island and sent them to the island school &mdash; they could be described as the first &ldquo;Gael Linn&rdquo; scholars.</P>
    <P>Those times of change and improvement date to a time when, as Deputy Kemmy said, our country was ruled from Westminster through a secretariat in Dublin Castle.  When Saorstát Éireann was established in 1922 the islanders somewhat naively expected that the changes and improvements would continue and that the changes would be for the better.  However, it was not to be and successive Governments, prompted by narrow-minded establishments, left the island to decline and to die.  That is one of the reasons I welcome this Bill.  By our actions here today we can make some reparation to the memory of the island people &mdash; muintir an Oileáin &mdash; for the neglect of those who sat here before us. We can never forget that though the island was left to moulder and die its soul went marching on and it still lives to inspire our people today.</P>
    <P>In 1930 the famous English travel writer, H.V. Morton, visited Dáil Eireann.  He was impressed by the use of Irish in the House.  Yet this was the beginning of the decade that marked the final decay of the island, that natural repository of lore and learning, the envy of Europe and the mecca of many distinguished scholars.  As George Thompson &mdash; Seoirse Mac Thomáis, as he is known in Irish &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ba chung an saol é, agus bhí eolas doimhin acu air,</P>
    <P>Ba shimplí an cultur é ach bhí sé saor ón suarachas,</P>
    <P>Bhí leann sinseartha dá chuid féin acu.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The day came when one lone child was <Col N="1132" /> left on the island.  To him that hardy community of 20 souls was an extended family.  The day came when this island was deserted, and the waves and the wind were left to mourn the passing of that community, as Seán Ó Luing said: Cén tarraingt taoide a scarann daoine óna dtoil chroí gan fios fatha?</P>
    <P>The islands remained deserted until the Taoiseach came to take the place of Clann Dálaigh on Inis Mhicileán.  I would like to put two points before him now. The first is to remind him that there are other island communities around our shores, both Gaeltacht and Galltacht, as was mentioned by previous speakers.  I would ask him to try, by every means at his disposal, to ensure that the way of life on those islands is preserved and that they should not be thrown on the scrapheap of neglect as the Blaskets were.  I would like to ask him also if he has not heard ceol na pucaí, the spirit music of the island, the music that the Dálaigh family played to mortal ears, the music that Robin Flower, the scholar I have spoken of, described as &ldquo;a lament for a whole world of imagination, banished irrecoverably now, but still faintly visible as in the afterglow of a western sun.&rdquo;  How apt those words are in the context of the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is not enough just to send this Bill through the Oireachtas.  The development of the island will be a challenge to every agency concerned with it.  To give meaningful life to the island will not be easy, but here we have something unique to Ireland, unique in Europe.  As Tomás Crothinn said; &ldquo;If you went all the coasts of Ireland round, it would go hard with you to find anything else so beautiful anywhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would like to refer to that mangnificent film of Muiris Mac Conghail &ldquo;Oileán Eile&rdquo;.  My abiding memory of that film is the interviews with Geroge Thompson &mdash; Seoirse Mac Tomáis &mdash; yet another English scholar who came to love this island and the island of Ireland, a love that marked him out from his fellows.  It was George Thompson who wrote, &ldquo;Níl aon dul siar aran stair&rdquo;, and that is certainly true.  But <Col N="1133" /> he also wrote, &ldquo;Pé céim a thugann an Stair ar Chúl, tugann sí dhá céim ar aghaidh&rdquo;.  Those words should be our motto in this House today.  People like Flower and Thompson were of the island because they possessed the island virtue &mdash; Mórchroí &mdash; greatness of heart.  Bhí siad &ldquo;uasal agus iseal&rdquo;.  I should like to think that in passing this Bill, with the clear support of every party in the House, today at least, we are displaying this virtue.  Again I would like to compliment the Taoiseach on his interest in this Bill. I know from several conversations with him that he has a special grá for this part of the world.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht agus go mór mhór as ucht an fáilte atá siad tar éis a chur roimh an Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>First, I want to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill and especially to thank them for the very generous way in which they have received the legislation and the welcome they have afforded it.  It is one of the more pleasant interludes of our experience in this House that we can get together and agree on legislation of this kind.  I suppose in a way it is typical of the Blaskets that they can unite us all in this way.  It is an extraordinary place and they have, over the years, attracted people from all over the world, people who have been seduced by them, attracted by them and enthralled by them.  I suppose it is only natural that the Blasket Islands would extend that ceo draíochta to this House.  We should all combine to try to ensure that this legislation is passed and also that the necessary follow-up to the legislation will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few very good points have been raised during the discussion and I will deal briefly with them.  The first and perhaps the most important matter is the issue of the acquisition of the property. This has been referred to by a number of speakers.  I want to give the House a very solemn assurance that it is the intention, if at all possible, that the property of <Col N="1134" /> the island will be acquired by amicable agreement.  I know that is the universal wish of Deputies, and indeed the same sentiment was expressed in the Seanad. I assure the House that is the way we will proceed.  I am reasonably confident that is the way we will succeed.  These compulsory powers the Office of Public Works have should be seen as a reserve power which will be kept in the background and, we hope, will never have to be exercised.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of goodwill around.  I know the Fondúireacht will be anxious to act as an honest broker and try to ensure that the property is acquired by agreement and to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.  I am particularly anxious to assure the American lady Deputy Begley mentioned that I am quite certain nobody in this House would wish her to be under any impression that she would ever be unfairly treated by this House or by any Government authority or agency in Ireland.  I assure her that is not the way we do things in this country. Her rights and position will be fully protected and she can be assured we would seek to have an amicable arrangement made with her by the Office of Public Works, the Fondúireacht or anybody else, and under no circumstances would we tolerate a situation where she would have any sort of grievance or any sort of feeling that as an outsider or a foreigner or an American she would not be treated exactly the same in this area as would one of our own citizens, and the same applies to everybody else who has property on the island.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a little correction. I think it was Deputy Begley again who suggested we were creating two classes of people by this legislation.  We are not. We may be creating two classes of property, property which can be compulsorily acquired and property which cannot, but we are not distinguishing between people.  Even in the case of the original island families or their descendants it is only their houses and the land in the immediate vicinity of their houses that are exempt from compulsory acquisition. These families had rights to land which is <Col N="1135" /> held in commonage, and in so far as that commonage and those rights over that commonage are concerned, even though they belonged to the original island families and still are in the possession of descendants of the original island families, they will remain subject to that compulsory acquisition.  To that extent everybody who has property on the island can one way or another be made liable for compulsory acquisition.  It is only the original houses and the holdings around them that we are exempting.  I think there is great justification for that, and perhaps it would not be impossible to envisage that some day the descendants of the original island families, if all goes as we expect it to, would return to the island and live there.  That might be an idyllic vision but at least it cannot be ruled out. I was at pains in the Seanad to assure that House that we would try to make sure that everything in regard to the island would be done on a friendly, amicable agreement basis, and I want to give the same assurance to this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Máirín Quill in a very eloquent and sincere contribution talked about the interpretive centre.  I assure her and other Deputies that that will be one of the first priorities.  We visualise an interpretive centre being provided on the mainland somewhere in the immediate vicinity of Dún Chaoin.  The Office of Public Works have already been looking at the possibilities in that regard.  There is no doubt that the right way to proceed would be to have that interpretive centre on the mainland where visitors can come and see for themselves at first hand exactly what the island, An Blascaod Mór, was and is and be encouraged to make the trip across the turbulent waters of the Blasket Sound to visit the island.  There again I would like to mention the Office of Public Works because a number of Deputies have praised them, and rightly so.  Mind you, the Office of Public Works do not always do everything we want them to do as quickly as we want them to do it, but we all acknowledge that when they undertake an assignment, particularly in the cultural area, they are <Col N="1136" /> unbeatable, they cannot be surpassed, and I invite any Deputy who has not already done so to visit the interpretive centre which has been provided at Gleann dá Loch in County Wicklow, where the Office of Public Works have done a beautiful, sensitive and creative job.  They have provided an interpretive centre there which is a work of art in itself, and that could be an excellent model for what we hope to provide on the mainland opposite the Blasket Islands.  I have every confidence that the interpretive centre on the mainland will be a source of great pleasure and enjoyment for visitors in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of other offshore islands, and that I suppose is relevant to this discussion.  I fully agree that the offshore islands are a very valuable part of our environment, our heritage.  Certainly they make the west coast all that more interesting, if that were possible, just by being there and in many cases being inhabited.  They are an extension of our country in a very unique and interesting way, and I would be firmly committed, in so far as our resources permit, to preserving life on the offshore islands and trying to help those who wish to stay there to do so in reasonable comfort.  It is not too easy to live on an island, and I never cease to marvel at the rugged capacity of the islanders on the Blasket Islands, for instance, who were able to maintain themselves there in very difficult conditions.  Even with all the assistance of modern technology the Blasket Islands can be very difficult places to negotiate, to get access to and to live on.  I often wonder and marvel at the ability of those islanders that they were able to overcome all the natural difficulties and make a reasonable way of life for themselves on An Blascaod Mór in particular.  We are still doing a bit to help the islanders who are still on the islands offshore.  For instance, the Board of Works again did a very good job this year in restoring the quay and the landing facilities at Oileán Cléire.  The same applies to a greater or lesser extent with regard to the other islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> One encouraging thing that is happening is that the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, for instance, have been able to acquire two islands and will preserve them as bird sanctuaries.  One is Puffin Island just off the Kerry coast, out from Valentia, and the other is High Island off the Connemara coast, formerly owned by that very wonderful poet, Richard Murphy.  These two islands are now safely in the hands of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and will be preserved and conserved by that body.  That is a headline we would all like to see followed in other cases as well.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there are any other points of substance to which I would need to reply.  I join with all the Deputies who have paid tribute to the members of Fondúireacht on the work they have done.  We would all agree that if it had not been for the establishment of Fondúireacht and the efforts they have made we would not be able to have this legislation. An important thing about Fondúireacht is that it shows that the people of this area fully understand the value of the Blaskets, how important they are, what they represent and how they are part of our national heritage.  It is important that this Bill provides for the full involvement of Fondúireacht, and thereby the local community, in the future of An Blascaod Mór.</P>
    <P>I pay personal tribute to the Deputies and Senators from Kerry who fully supported Fondúireacht when it was established and gave it their diverse political blessings.  They helped Fondúireacht and me in the preparation of this legislation. Apart from the concept of the excellence of the Kerry football team, I do not think there are many things on which the people of Kerry would unanimously agree.  On this occasion, however, they were very generous, helpful and appreciative of what was being done and they were unstinting in their support of me, the Fondúireacht, the Office of Public Works and Roinn na Gaeltachta in helping to get this legislation to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said quite rightly that this is only the first step, the basis from <Col N="1138" /> which we can proceed, and it will be up to us all to ensure that the Government agencies involved and Fondúireacht get on with the job and do what is necessary to provide a satisfactory and enjoyable national historic park.  We must want the interpretive centre on the mainland and we want good access, which will require some landing facilities on the Blascaod Mór.  Then we will want the houses on the island properly restored with integrity to the way they were.  Many other things of that kind will have to be done.  We will have to monitor the position and ensure that the necessary steps are undertaken to bring this national historic park to reality and to full fruition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have moved into Private Members' time and because I know there is some anxiety on the part of other Deputies to contribute, I will try to truncate what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is nothing more than popular stuff.  It is part of the coin of the political currency which the Progressive Democrats, the sponsoring party, are guilty of circulating.  It is opportunistic.  The Bill is meaningful in itself and the principle which it seeks to establish is a good one, but they have taken a good principle, incorporated it in a meaningless, illogical and wasteful Bill and then presented it <Col N="1140" /> before this House as if it were some great mould-breaking stumble forward.  The reality is that it is nothing more nor less than a crass, cheap, shallow political stunt aimed at the flagging fortunes of that party.  However, there will be another day for judging that issue.</P>
    <P>There are a number of dangerous points about this Bill.  The principle that somehow we should extend the concept of an ombudsman to have an administrative overview on the health service is one that I personally support, but it would be very dangerous if we were to go the route that this Bill proposes.  The creation of an additional ombudsman would create an aditional call on the funds available for the existing Ombudsman's office.  Undoubtedly some of the scarce resources that are at present available to the Ombudsman would have to be diverted into the new office which would create a parallel administrative structure to the current Ombudsman. Deputies should look at the report of the Ombudsman since the extension of his remit to cover health services.  There is very little evidence that this proposal is now necessary nor is there any evidence to suggest that the pressures which undoubtedly exist on that office primarily arise from the fact that the Ombudsman is now charged with overseeing the activities of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The most odious aspect of the Bill is the divisiveness that it would create.  If one reads subsections 3 (1) and (3) together, one can only come to the conclusion that there is to be an extraordinary type of discrimination introduced whereby private patients who do not have VHI cover would find themselves, in some circumstances, without the right of access to the Ombudsman, the common person's complaint agent.  That surely is a ludicrous proposal.  Perhaps I misunderstand the Bill, but I am convinced that is the main thrust if one reads those two subsections together.  I do not think the Bill's proposals are intended to create that odious situation; but that slovenly drafting in a Bill which has quite a few pieces of slovenly drafting simply illustrates the basic thesis I first proposed, <Col N="1141" /> that the Bill is nothing more than populist, opportunistic stuff, not seriously aimed at creating an improvement in the health services.</P>
    <P>Another point about the Bill which is an annoyance, and I know there are other people more eloquent than I am on this issue on the opposite benches, is its slavish adherence to the British model. When the British were adopting the Ombudsman system they decided that they would incrementally approach it; they were fearful of this new concept. They, I suppose, had some reason to be fearful.  In the English speaking world the Ombudsman concept was new in the sixties when they first started to put their legislation into place.  It is no longer new. There are over 80 ombudsman offices in operation in common law countries around the world; they are well tried and tested and only one country, the UK, has come up with this nonsensical suggestion of creating parallel ombudsmen for different areas of public administration in its widest sense.</P>
    <P>What we have in this Bill is an example of this slave mentality that so often exists in our law, the slavish adherence to the British model.  What is particularly worthy of condemnation is that the model the drafters of this legislation are slavishly adhering to is a failed model, because anything that is written on the British health ombudsman comes to the inevitable conclusion that that separated office is a failed office.  That someone should suggest that this is another great stumble forward for the mode breakers of Irish politics stretches credulity.  The facts are that if we wish to extend the Ombudsman's power to clinical judgment issues, we should do so by amending the primary Ombudsman legislation and then by concentrating such resources as we can give to our ombudsman/ ombudspersons to the one office and concentrate them there &mdash; I introduce the concept of ombudspersons as Deputy Barnes has joined us.</P>
    <P>This is not serious legislation, although hidden deep in the murk of the Bill there is a serious concept, the question of how we create a situation where people who <Col N="1142" /> feel they have a grievance against the medical services, against the clinical end of the health administration, will be able to seek support from some public agency in the vindication of their rights, in the pursuit of justice.  In my own constituency the need for some institutional arrangement in this regard is very well illustrated by Willie Dunne's family tragedy.  The fact that a young couple, having suffered the long drama of the dispute, now have to put their house on the market is a tragedy, and we in this House should come up with some serious proposals for addressing that sort of issue; this is not a serious proposal.  In the core of the Bill there is a little gem, it is surrounded by a great deal of murk and mire, including not least the intentions of the people who introduced the Bill to use a circumstance for which there is a great deal of public sympathy to trump up a bit of political support.  The Bill is riddled with weaknesses. The least one can say about some of the provisions is that they are slovenly. The fact is they are unworkable, divisive, uneconomical in their concept and they would certainly be uneconomical if it were sought to put them into effect.  The major provisions in section 3 are really, if the House will excuse the unparliamentary language, no more tarted up versions of what one would find in the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  If we want to improve that Act we should do as the New Zealanders did some years after they brought the primary ombudsman legislation into operation; they reconstituted the parliamentary committee, looked at the office and its weaknesses; and political consensus was reached on where the major weaknesses were and how they could be addressed.  That is how the New Zealanders went on to create a model ombudsman.  One will not create a model anything by simply attempting to use a sad case or occasional sad cases to political advantage.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 4 of the Bill strike me as being particularly undesirable. I agree with what Deputy Yates said last night about laypersons trying to double guess medical opinion and the undesirability of that.  Section 4 provides <Col N="1143" /> that the Ombudsman shall have the power to direct a hospital or health board to provide specified medical or surgical services to a named eligible person.  I may be misreading this, but surely this is most undesirable.  Would this not create an institutionalised queue jumping arrangement, because after all not everybody in the queue for health services will take their case to the Ombudsman?  Occasionally it will be found that some individuals are not treated particularly well, but unless one could have some way, the wisdom of Solomon, to oversee the entire queue for a particular service and to be able to judge between the degrees of misery which every person in that queue is suffering then this is surely institutionalising injustice, and there cannot seriously be the intention to do this.  For example, I do not believe Deputy Walsh, who is going to speak on this next, would wish to see that happen.  That would have the effect of putting into operation the proposals which I presume the Deputy is going to speak in favour of later tonight.</P>
    <P>The facts are that this is ill-advised legislation.  The idea of creating an easily accessible, inexpensive system of ensuring justice for people who feel they have suffered an injustice with regard to the health service is an important idea which we should look at seriously.  My passionate belief is that the only way one can achieve that type of justice is by having a serious look at the existing office of the Ombudsman and considering how we can extend the Ombudsman's remit to cover the issue.</P>
    <P>This Bill would not in any way improve the general wellbeing of people.  It would cause a great deal of expense and duplication and would undoubtedly create a degree of confusion.  If one looks at the cases that go through the health services, one can see that there are administrative elements and clinical elements.  Are we to take the administrative end of the complaint to the Ombudsman in St. Stephen's Green and take the clinical element to another Ombudsman operating somewhere else?  That would not make sense. After all, the party who sponsored this <Col N="1144" /> Bill argue that they came into politics to give sense and realism particularly in economic matters.  That is hardly realistic and it is not sensible.  Although the principles at the centre of the Bill are well worth considering the Bill has nothing whatsoever to commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the introduction of such a Bill in Private Members' time may only mean that the subject is open for discussion, it highlights a need in the community and the unease about our health services.  The principle of appointing an ombudsman in this area is an excellent one.  It is a system that worked effectively in many countries. The need in this regard arises from apparent inequalities and conflicts and from situations where decisions need to be made by an independent forum.  One of the most important dimensions of the debate about appointing an ombudsman on health relates to independence.  We are all aware of the human tendency to defend our own grouping and to begin empire building within organisations. There is also a tremendous amount of politics and power playing within organisations. Given this often true perception within society, citizens in a democratic State feel they must have recourse to an independent forum to voice their fears about apparent injustices in the system. People must know that such an ombudsman would not have a vested interest in defending an organisation, a profession or a grouping, that the ombudsman has been set up to objectively address complaints. That is the real strength in an ombudsman.  Deputy Roche said that it was only in the UK that we have had a proliferation of ombudsmen.  I would point out to Deputy Roche, if he was here, that in Sweden there is an ombudsman for women's affairs which has proved to be extraordinarily effective. There was a real need for an ombudsman there because of the multi-disciplinary and many faceted approach to womens' affairs in dealing with human behaviour and legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about returning health <Col N="1145" /> to where it should be, back into the community, we get the same multi-faceted and sometimes duplicated services and many queries will arise for the attention of an ombudsman.  The ombudsman's office would be objective and independent and would do a lot to alleviate the anxiety and real fears of the community many of whom have found to their cost that the health service has been unequal.  That is a matter of concern to everyone and we should strive to ensure that such inequalities will not occur.  The setting up of an ombudsman's office in this area would ensure that things would be seen to be above board.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman's office could retain a great amount of valuable information which at the moment may not be stored centrally.  Deputy Roche queried the cost of running such an office.  I contend that at the moment we have a certain amount of wasteful duplication in administration, in having eight health boards to serve a community of 3,500,000 people.  A medium sized city in another country would have such a population and the health services would be administered effectively by one authority.  We should have one health board with the very important fall back of an independent professionally run ombudsman's office which deal with queries and which would above all deal with the unease of people when bringing unjust or unfair cases to light.  Surely a country with our population would be better served and at less cost by having such matters dealt with in one location instead of having a proliferation of health boards where similar cases must be dealt with separately in eight different regions.  I am a great believer in extending boundaries and I am not worried if what I envisage breaks boundaries or accepted norms in already established ombudsman's offices.</P>
    <P>In talking about access to information, one advantage in having such an office is that they would be able to gather and analyse information on any register or on any service within the health area and make it available quickly to those who need it.  Such an office would also be able to correlate statistics and information on <Col N="1146" /> the community care area and on intensive care within hospitals.  I know the Minister will agree with me when I say that there is a great need to gather as much information as possible so as to enable us to spend money as efficently as possible and to provide the best treatment possible. There is also a need to centralise statistics from regional areas.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for recognising that there is such a need and for setting up central registers on different forms of cancer.  I wish to take this opportunity to ask the Minister to set up a register which I and many other people would like to see set up.  Unfortunately a high number of parents have experienced stillbirths.  By setting up a register of the neo-natal deaths of infants we would be able to evaluate and analyse the statistics and then draw up preventive measures to reduce the risk.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that we have a very high rate of sickness and disease in society.  The work of a health ombudsman's office and the information it could supply could be of tremendous help in this regard.</P>
    <P>I again express my sense of loss and disappointment that the Health Education Bureau is no longer in existence. I believe it is important that we have an independent and professional office to which community and other interest groups can turn for information and which could highlight preventive measures or treatment in respect of any illness.  It was possible to do this when the Health Education Bureau were in existence. One of the reasons I speak so strongly for the setting up of an ombudsman's office is that I realise there is a need for an independent office who can critically but not in a hostile manner, analyse our health services.  I do not believe that this will happen from within, it has to happen from without.  People would welcome that.</P>
    <P>There is outrage at what is happening in regard to the health services.  People are either being denied treatment or are getting it at huge cost in terms of the time they have to wait for treatment. Obviously there are cases that are crying <Col N="1147" /> out for the services of an office such as an ombudsman's office.  In his contribution Deputy Roche indicated that some people might use an ombudsman's office to jump queues and to gain priority.  If we were running a decent, egalitarian health service there would be no need for such a fear but unfortunately this is not the case at present.  We have had many debates in this House recording the fears which people have, the suffering that is taking place and the delays.</P>
    <P>Each week each of us meets groups of people who feel they are very hard done by, that they are excluded from the health service or are encountering delays in treatment.  They have the perception that there is a two-tier health service and that one cannot afford to get sick or have symptoms which require treatment unless they have insurance.  While some of this may be exaggerated the sooner we create a health service which gives equal access to the most sophisticated treatment the better.  People should not be put in the position of believing they are second class citizens if they do not have private health insurance.  Until that is rectified, people will believe they need an ombudsman's office.  They will be convinced that they are living in a country that is not working towards equality and justice for all, that, in fact, the gap is widening.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the savings we could achieve in the various health areas by having an ombudsman's office would, for instance, highlight the abuse that takes place in certain areas or would highlight those areas where a satisfactory service is not being provided.  This should alert us to the need for reform.  If and when a health ombudsman's office is established I hope there would be an excellent working relationship between it and the health service which should see it as an office from which people can obtain information which it is very difficult to provide through the many offices that the health service is attempting to run.</P>
    <P>The health service should welcome the establishment of a health ombudsman's <Col N="1148" /> office, as they in turn could make their case and clear away some of the myths which surround the health service.  Both sides would be able to make their case through this independent forum.  As long as the health service continues to madly defend itself and those in need of treatment believe they are not getting a fair deal, neither side is being well served. The health service would also have the tremendous advantage of being able to highlight, through such a forum the reforms and actions which may be needed.  When a report from the Ombudsman was presented to this and the other House and publicised we could reply on that kind of clear information and act on it.  I should like to think that the health services would be the first to feel that they could not alone accept the kind of information &mdash; and the criticisms in relation to the cases presented to the Ombudsman during the year &mdash; but ensure that the services they were running would become even more effective which would mean less work for the Ombudsman in the next year.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office could be of great value and give people the satisfaction of being heard.  It would give people an opportunity to have fair play, even if the outcome was a ruling against them.  That kind of information coming from an ombudsman's office would remove a tremendous amount of resentment and might soften the lack of information and knowledge which leads people to feel they have not been treated properly.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office could range over several levels.  For instance, it could be a guide as to how people are treated within the health services.  It could also indicate how they are valued when they go into a hospital or clinic or before a medical consultant.  That is an important aspect because there is a tremendous amount to be done in that area.  In some instances people allow their health to deteriorate, sometimes beyond recovery, because they fear being intimidated, patronised, denied information or made to feel that there is not enough time or <Col N="1149" /> attention for them.  If that kind of complaint was received in an objective central office, it would go a long way towards reforming the treatment of the most important person in the health service, the patient.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office could also be of incredible value and support to the health service, the Minister and his officials in the Department of Health.  Of course, this includes the social welfare area and I know the Minister is well aware of this.  However, it leads to the tremendous amount of resentment and injustice &mdash; and sometimes penalisation &mdash; when there is an arbitrary cut-off point for people in relation to eligibility for health services.  There are circumstances of the most painful sort of which we are all aware where people are on very low incomes, but, because they may own a bit of property or are single people with a small property and savings, are slightly over the rate at which they would receive help, they lose out on everything.</P>
    <P>The poverty traps built into the health and social welfare services are crying out for reform.  I know reforms have been attempted but, no matter what is done, there will still be cases that will need close personal attention.  At the moment some cases are arbitrarily dismissed because they do not comply with the eligibility clause of present legislation.  There will always be the case with special circumstances attached to it that needs to be examined in its own right and an ombudsman could make an objective decision.  It is one of the greatest services which an ombudsman's office could give us.</P>
    <P>We should not rest easy if a service, particularly one fundamental to the life, death and survival of people, is not working in regard to equal care, compassion and urgency of treatment for all.  An ombudsman's office would give the voice, trust and confidence to all our people to know that it was there for those who are vulnerable and have difficulties.  This would justify calling it a caring society. We expend a huge sum on our health budget, we must make sure that all the people who fall into poverty traps are <Col N="1150" /> rescued and the safety net in this regard is an ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>Research and statistics show that people are looking very seriously at whether specialisation, technology and the technocratic method of medicine is the answer to a good, positive health service.  The Minister will be aware of my usual follow through in regard to this.  One of the great services which an ombudsman's office could provide would be to highlight and give positive encouragement to alternative medicine which is still considered to be on the fringe of the health service.  However, in this country it is finally gaining credibility and we now realise that unless we have a holistic and positive approach to health, our health services will never have sufficient funds to meet the kind of unbalanced and diseased negative health problems which can occur.  All areas of treatment that can be professionally proved should be recognised.  We should openly encourage such areas of medicines and, perhaps, get the more established people in medicine to look more positively at them.  There is a role there for Health Ombudsman to play.</P>
    <P>The office of an Ombudsman should be used for the dissemination of information in regard to healthcare.  We should be able to reassure people who are concerned about attacks on their health from pollution of the Environment.  We should tackle such problems as air pollution and water pollution and ensure that our food is not contaminated. According to an EC survey on energy and the condition of food people in Ireland expressed a high level of concern about the danger of nuclear radiation and chemically contaminated fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>Objective and accurate information should be relayed to the public in regard to healthcare.  If it is considered necessary to take action in regard to certain matters that information should be conveyed to the public through a Health Ombudsman. We are all aware of the anxiety among people about health matters, particularly the pollution of the environment. If our environment is not damaging our health we should receive <Col N="1151" /> assurances on that score from the Department. I do not think that our environment is damaging our health.  Indeed, what we eat and breath is not killing us but ensures our survival.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputies Barnes, Harney and Yates I am not convinced that there is a need for a Health Ombudsman. My colleague, Deputy Leyden, and Deputy Roche dealt at length with the details of the Bill and for that reason I intend to deal with the issues raised by Opposition Deputies on the question of a Health Ombudsman.  Deputy Barnes said she could not understand why the Health Education Bureau was transferred to the Department of Health.  She thought it should be left as an independent body.  I should like to tell her that those who worked with the bureau and who are now involved in the health promotion unit agree that the unit is a much better vehicle to promote good health among our people.  I am proud of the initiatives I have taken in that regard in the last two years and of my commitment to health promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time since its establishment, the health promotion unit in my Department have undertaken an extensive work programme.  Among the issues being addressed are smoking, alcohol, drug abuse, AIDS education, cancer education, immunisation programmes, food hygiene, nutrition, safety and exercise. A milestone in the protection of the health of infants and young children was reached in October 1988 when I introduced the measles, mumps and rubella immunisation programme.  That was introduced in conjunction with the DHSS in the Six Counties and, hopefully, it will eradicate these diseases from the island. I am glad to say that we expect to reach a 90 per cent uptake by March 1990.  I also set up an expert group &mdash; Deputy Harney would not agree with that description &mdash; to investigate the best possible means of establishing a national cancer register.  I am pleased to be able to say that we will have such a register in <Col N="1152" /> place in September.  I am grateful to the group for their work because, unlike Deputy Harney, I need the advice of experts from time to time so as to ensure I get the best possible results.</P>
    <P>The advisory council on health promotion which the Government established comprises a wide cross section of interests and has already submitted a number of recommendations to me in relation to priority areas for action.  The Government also decided that a committee of Ministers should be established, reflecting the collective commitment to health promotion and providing a forum at the highest level to discuss and resolve intersectoral issues and to ensure that agreed policies are implemented.  That is in keeping with what Deputy Barnes referred to, the impact on the environment and the impact of radioactivity.</P>
    <P>We also established a Chair in Health Promotion in University College, Galway.  We felt that a strong academic base, both for teaching and research purposes, was essential if health promotion was really to develop as a significant element of health policy.  The importance of these developments should not be underestimated.  The national tendency is to see healthcare in terms of its curative aspects.  However, the steps which we have taken will help to focus attention on preventive strategies and will lead to a healthier, safer society and an improved quality of life for all.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in the delivery of the health services in recent years was the completion of the negotiations between my Department, on the one hand, and the Irish Medical Organisation, on the other, on a new form of contract for doctors participating in the general medical service.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of a report by a joint working party in 1984, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to reach agreement on a new form of GMS contract.  In 1987, I invited the parties together and following lengthy and detailed negotiations agreement was reached on a new form of GMS contract. This agreement came into operation for <Col N="1153" /> the vast majority of GMS doctors on 1 March, 1989.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this new agreement constitutes a sound basis, not only for the future of the GMS on a cost-effective basis, but also for the development of general practice as a whole, enabling it to fulfil its full potential as the core of an integrated and comprehensive health service.  By supporting continuing education and co-operation between doctors, whether through group practice or otherwise, I am satisfied that the continuity of patient care and its quality will be enhanced.  The new payment system is a clear foundation for the important task of ensuring that the GP is able to function as the key figure in the primary health care system, drawing on the whole range of ancillary and support services which his patients require.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns since taking up office as Minister for Health has been the need to review the community drug schemes, particularly the refund of drugs scheme administered by health boards.  I completed my review and Government approved my proposals for the introduction of a revised community drug scheme.  The scheme will be tailored to cater for those in greatest need.  That is, those people who are on continuous and expensive medication.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be made so that the financial outlay by the individual patient on medication will be kept to the minimum. At the moment, a patient can claim a refund in respect of the amount of expenditure in excess of £28 per month. While it will not be possible to reduce this threshold at this stage, the new arrangements will ensure that that amount is the maximum which an individual will have to pay in a month.  I am satisfied that within the present resource constraints, the new scheme will satisfactorily address and resolve the main difficulties inherent in the current schemes.  The new scheme will be ready for implementation in the summer.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised that the problem of AIDS requires special and urgent attention.  Sixty per cent of those who are HIV positive are drug abusers. <Col N="1154" /> The Government invested heavily in the Eastern Health Board's pilot outreach programme which is aimed at making one-to-one contact with drug abusers about the dangers of AIDS, and indeed drug abuse, and encouraged them to come forward for treatment and counselling. We have given numerous grants to voluntary organisations dealing with drug abusers and we approved a special grant of £50,000 to the Irish Haemophilia Society to enable them to develop their services further.  A sum of £250,000 was provided to the AIDS fund to help AIDS sufferers.  Mindful of the role which education plays in this area, I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, on an education programme for second level schools to ensure that all children leaving school are alert to the danger of AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken decisive action on a number of fronts in their short period of office to deal with the most pressing problems facing children who are most in need of care and protection.  I have brought forward a major new Child Care Bill which has gone through second stage in this House.  This Bill, incorporates a wide range of badly needed reforms in our structures and services for children at risk.  This landmark social legislation, which has been welcomed by all interest groups, considerably strengthens the powers of the health boards in the provision of child care and family support services.  Health boards will be required to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family. The main emphasis and underlying philosophy of the Bill is, therfore, on a caring, preventive approach whereby sensitive support and assistance to families in need will enable children to remain at home; only in very exceptional circumstances are children to be taken into care.  This new Bill, together with the Government's new Adoption Act which was passed into law in 1988, represents a solid new legislative foundation and framework for the future development <Col N="1155" /> of services which are both relevant and effective.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is being provided for the development of new and expanded services throughout the country for disadvantaged youth groups, particularly the young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers. Another area which received priority attention from the Government was the need to improve our present services for abused children.  In 1987, I published a comprehensive new set of detailed guidelines on the reporting, assessment and management of suspected cases of child abuse, including child sexual abuse.  I also provided substantial sums for the establishment of new units for the investigation and management of child abuse at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals and also allocated £500,000 between the eight health boards to enable similar type services to be developed in all the health board areas in the country.</P>
    <P>Where other parties have spoken at length over many years about the need to address the problems of children who are at risk, this Government, by contrast, though the series of significant initiatives outlined, have moved decisively in a short period of time to tackle and deal head on with the problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.  Our rationalisation of the acute hospital system must be put in perspective.  The objective of the rationalisation of hospital services is to provide an effective, efficient and caring health service within the limits of the funds allocated for that purpose. Acute hospitals consume over 50 per cent of all health spending and the amount is more than adequate to provide a high quality service, which we have.</P>
      <P>From the mid-sixties on, there has been a very large measure of consensus among all political parties that this country should endeavour to maintain its position as one of the countries with an advanced, modern health system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> It was quite clear as early as the mid-sixties that the increased capacity for better patient care brought about by the new technology, and the cost of supporting such technology, meant, by definition, a reduction in the number of centres at which a first class acute diagnostic and treatment service could be maintained.  The commitment to maintaining a very high level of diagnostic capacity is reflected in, for example, the fact that there are now 12 CT scanners in the country and eight of these are in our public hospital service.  Five of these eight have been brought into operation in the last two years.</P>
    <P>A major building programme got under way over the last number of years; new technology came on stream rapidly; medical practices changed so that less beds and more support facilities were required; and expectations of successful diagnosis and treatment increased as new techniques and procedures became available.</P>
    <P>The first step I took when I came into office was to review the acute hospital system so that we could remove those hospitals which were surplus to requirement, which we have done in a planned way over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell Deputies that the emphasis in recent years has been on transferring service provision away from the hospitals to the community.  Where hospitals have closed arising out of the review, alternative facilities in the community have been built up and some hospital buildings have been used to provide services for the elderly, for example, Baggot Street Hospital.  It was decided by the previous Administration that this hospital should be closed and the services moved to St. James's Hospital.  I decided that it should be maintained for the benefit of the local community and I am glad to say that now it is a most impressive institution.  The hospital now provides a wide range of services, including day care, psychology, psychiatric and counselling services, physiotherapy, X-ray, pathology, childhood developmental clinics, respite beds and most recently the <Col N="1157" /> drop-in centre for persons suffering from the AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>Despite the restrictions on staffing and finance, we have maintained the number of consultants in the hospital system, and the levels of activity have increased.  An indication of the throughput of the six major hospitals in Dublin can be gained from the following information for 1987 and 1988.  The number of admissions in 1987 was 86,840 and in 1988, 89,853, an increase of 3.5 per cent.  The number of outpatient attendances in 1987 was 393,616 and in 1988, 461,670, an increase of 17.3 per cent.  In 1987 there were 24,000 day cases compared to 33,103 in 1988, an increase of 37.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>We now have a clear picture of what we want to achieve in the organisation of the acute hospital services.  The changes which have been made will result in a much more efficient health service which will be more responsive to the needs of our community over the coming years. There has been steady progress in equipping and opening new units.  This year alone, new facilities have come on stream at St. James's, the Mater, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar.  A good start has been made in a number of hospitals, and new facilities will continue to come on stream in the coming years, including Ardkeen, Sligo and Wexford and, of course, the new hospital which is being planned for Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists did not come into being with the arrival of this Government in office.  They are nothing new.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have always existed here and elsewhere.  For the benefit of Deputy Barnes I should like to quote a letter dated 9 November 1983, to a patient.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As your name has been on the waiting list to see the County Surgeon since November, 1982, please let me know if you still need this appointment or if you wish to cancel it.  Please let me <Col N="1158" /> know before Friday, 18 November, 1983.</P>
    <P>There is no hospital in the country at present where a patient has to wait 12 months to see a surgeon at out-patients. That was going on when the Coalition were in Government, yet they come in here and tell us waiting lists are new and were never there before.  Waiting list numbers are a very unreliable measure of the availability of hospital services. Patients may be on more than one doctor's waiting list for the same treatment. In some cases, patients are added to waiting lists when doctors expect that they will require treatment in the future but do not, at that point, need admission to hospital.  Also, crude waiting list statistics do not distinguish between patients presenting for first time treatment and those receiving continuing care.</P>
    <P>The crucial point to be understood in relation to waiting lists is that they must always be put in the context of the actual throughput of the hospitals.  For example, there has been much uninformed comment in the media and elsewhere recently concerning the fact that there were over 22,000 patients awaiting admission to hospital in 1988.  However, that figure is set in proper context when one considers that over 500,000 patients are admitted every year to our acute public hospitals. The number on the waiting lists represents about 4.5 per cent of the total number of patients admitted annually.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the number on the orthopaedic in-patient waiting list on 30 June 1988, was 5,170 &mdash; but a total of 31,542 orthopaedic patients were admitted in 1987.</P>
    <P>This point is even more strikingly made when one looks at figures for outpatient departments.  In December 1987 there were around 67,000 awaiting outpatient treatment while there were over 1.5 million attendances at outpatients that year. Again, the orthopaedic outpatient waiting list numbered 9,205 patients, while over 188,000 such patients were treated. These figures show the real achievements of the health service in meeting the demands placed upon it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> While some problems do exist in specific areas, we are addressing them with a view to having them resolved as soon as possible.  For instance, prompt action was taken in relation to the Southern Health Board to ensure that high level quality services continued to be provided there.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are constantly monitored to ensure that no intractable situations develop.  Indeed, thanks to the caring and efficient staff in our hospitals it is amazing that such large numbers of patients are looked after with as little inconvenience to them as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of developments with regard to the psychiatric services, particularly within the community, over the last two years.  The new facilities include day hospitals, day centres and residential accommodation.  In addition, the acute in-patient component of the service will in future be located at general hospitals.  General hospital psychiatric units have been built in Tralee, Letterkenny and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.  The unit at Roscommon will open in July while that in Cavan will open in the autumn.  I have also approved the construction of a new psychiatric unit at Naas General Hospital which, together with a range of day centres and hostels I have also approved for County Kildare, will enable a comprehensive community based psychiatric service to be established in that county.  The new unit at Naas is expected to be completed and ready to be opened in 1990.  Plans are at an advanced stage for the provision of a new acute psychiatric unit at the Regional Hospital in Ardkeen in Waterford.  At the end of 1988 there were 47 day centres and 32 day hospitals catering for over 7,500 patients while over 1,800 people were living in hostels and community residences.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the mental handicap services in respect of which there have been a number of developments over the past two years.  There has been the transfer of people with a mental handicap from St. Patrick's Hospital, <Col N="1160" /> Castlerea, to the Brothers of Charity services and a similar transfer from the Eastern Health Board's psychiatric service to Cheeverstown House.  These developments have led to a considerable improvement in the service provided to those people.  Following the success of these transfers all health boards are being encouraged to have people with a mental handicap at present in psychiatric hospitals assessed by the mental handicap agencies with a view to providing more appropriately for their needs.</P>
    <P>Major changes are also taking place in the service provided by the Daughters of Charity in Dublin.  For example, 200 residents at St. Vincent's Centre, Navan Road, are being transferred to alternative accommodation, 150 of whom will be based in the community.  A smaller but nonetheless significant development is occurring in the services provided at St. Michael's House.  New residential places for people with a high level of dependency are being opened.</P>
    <P>It is also heartening to see that the initial stage of the commissioning of Aras Attracta in Swinford has now been completed, the first 30 residential places being in use.  That centre will constitute a major contribution to the services for mentally handicapped in the Western Health Board region.  In every region developments are quietly taking place particularly in relation to the provision of community based services for people inappropriately placed in large residential centres.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health spent some £120 million on the care of people with a mental handicap.  That excludes expenditure by the Department of Education on special schools and classes.  Services for the mentally handicapped have received priority status in the allocation of funds over the past three years.  It is my intention that they will continue to be protected.  Also, the welfare of those who are disabled and elderly is of paramount importance.  The Report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>&mdash; launched last winter provides us with <Col N="1161" /> a coherent blueprint for developing services up to the end of this century.</P>
    <P>At present we are preparing legislation to license nursing homes.  For example, new units for dementia came on stream recently run by the Brothers of St. John of God, Stillorgan, a major unit at St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown, and St. James's Hospital.  I have referred already to Baggot Street.  I might add that St. Columcille's and St. James's Hospitals will provide assessment units and rehabilitation of the elderly.  There have been tremendous developments within the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>I might add that those who care for elderly relatives often have no income of their own.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has recently amended legislation to allow the prescribed relative's allowance to be paid directly to the carer.  This will implement the recommendations of the report entitled &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; Policy for the Elderly</i> and represents a major step forward for carers.</P>
    <P>National lottery funding has been made available to my Department.  I am glad to report that a whole range of facilities have been provided for the elderly, mentally handicapped, physically handicapped, for the management and investigation of child abuse, psychiatric services and towards the AIDS programme.</P>
    <P>There are over 55,000 people working in the health services.  I sanctioned the recruitment of 600 student nurses in both the spring and autumn of 1988, leading to a total of 1,200 student nurses intake in that year.  I also sanctioned the recruitment of a further 600 students in the spring of this year.  I expect that sanction for autumn recruitment this year will be at a similar level.  Also in the past few months I approved arrangements for making permanent appointments to almost 2,000 posts which had been filled on a temporary basis in recognition of the need to reduce the reliance of services on an undue number of temporary staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> I have launched many initiatives to eliminate any waste of public moneys in order to ensure that we get better value for money within the health services.  In this regard, my Department are actively supporting the health boards and hospitals in every way possible.  Here I might refer to the work of the cost containment and efficiency unit within my Department.  The work of that unit focuses on promoting cost consciousness and on co-ordinating information between agencies.  The unit has brought about a price information exchange system between agencies so that they are aware of the prices being paid for a range of items.  They are undertaking important work, particularly in the key area of prices of medical and surgical consumables which cost approximately £125 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I am aware that difficulties arise from time to time.  For example, I am aware of the impact which the accident and emergency service is having on hospital admissions in Dublin and also the difficulties some of our agencies are experiencing. I am keeping the position under constant review to ensure that any problems that arise are resolved quickly.  That is basic to our whole health policy which is to ensure that proper and adequate health services are available to those in need of them.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with a few of the points raised by Deputies Barnes and Harney.  Deputy Barnes said there was no forum for critical analysis of the health services contending that constituted one reason there should be an ombudsman for health services.  I agree with Deputy Barnes, but there is no forum because the one established in this State, Dáil Éireann, has been misused by Members on the Opposition side of this House.  For example, Deputy Barnes said it is not safe to be sick tonight unless one is a private patient.  That is not a fact.  The fact is that there are 1.5 million attendances at outpatient departments annually, there are 500,000 admissions to <Col N="1163" /> hospitals and 110,000 day cases &mdash; public patients going into hospital for services. Therefore, it is safe to be sick in Ireland. That type of scare mongering, with Members coming in here, causing relatives and friends of patients unnecessary anxiety and fear has led to the present position.  This House should be used for a critical analysis of the health services. I would welcome that.</P>

      <P>Yes, but why is that the public perception?  The public perception is such because members come in here and say it is not safe to be sick.

      <P>Deputy Harney was even worse than Deputy Barnes.  She referred to the political or medical pull used to get people into hospital.  That is a desperate slur on our health services.  Admission to hospital is based on the clinical decision of consultants.  Family doctors decide who will go to hospital.  For a Deputy to come into this House and say it is done on the basis of political pull&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we wanted to rationalise the 999 service in Dublin we consulted with the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation. Deputy Harney would not do that &mdash; she would go off on her own.  I admit that I do not know enough about how the 999 service works.

I do not apologise for setting up a small working group.  Deputy Harney said she did not hear any of these reports.  Maybe that was because she was not in the House. She will not hear them if she is not in the House.</P>

      <P>I also have a small working group on the audiometry services.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I am not an expert on hearing aids.  I have brought in people who are experts.  They are advising me and I would hope when I have that report, that we will improve the system of hearing aids in Ireland.  The same applies to the accident and emergency service.  We have an ongoing group looking at the accident and emergency service which we all admit is a problem in the Dublin area. I think to have that working group have improved the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney also referred to her national insurance scheme last night and, to use her own words, she said the hospitals would be queuing up for patients.  How would it come about that hospitals would be queuing up for <Col N="1166" /> patients instead of patients being on waiting lists for hospitals?  Waiting lists are a feature of all health services throughout the world, and will continue to be because that is the nature of health services.</P>

      <P>I would like to know how Deputy Harney is going to have hospitals queuing up for patients.  She talked about privatisation, perhaps then patients could not afford to be ill because nobody would be able to go near a hospital and the hospitals might well be queuing up for patients.  She talked about general practitioners and said that because there was a change in the method of payment they would not do their work. That is grossly unfair and unreasonable. Deputy Harney, and Deputy Wyse came in here and voted to keep three hospitals open in Limerick when nobody in the country, except themselves, believed there should be three hospitals in Limerick. I am glad to say that as a result of Barringtons being closed money has been spent now in the Regional Hospital in Limerick.  There is a CT scanner there now which was not there previously, and patients do not have to go to Cork or Dublin.  All these new facilities are available to the people of Limerick.</P>

The main thrust of our policy is to ensure that we have a modern, efficient caring health service both in hospitals and in the community and that is the way we intend to maintain it.  I do not believe it is justifiable to have an ombudsman specifically for the health services.  I <Col N="1167" /> believe the present Ombudsman is capable of dealing with the cases that may arise from day to day or from time to time in the administration of the health services.  It is my view who gets treatment and when must always be a clinical decision by professionals and not political or any other sort of pull.  It is the obligation of the Government &mdash; and I am glad to say we are discharging it &mdash; to ensure that services are available to the people.</P>

      <P>I have five minutes to reply to a lot of what the Minister has said here tonight.  The Minister is very far removed from what is happening in our hospitals and in our health services and I say that with all due respect to him.  As far back as last March I warned the general public in the Southern Health Board area, including the Department of Health, what was happening in the Southern Health Board area.  I told the Minister there and then that they were about to let go 200 staff members and that salary cheques for 6,000 employees were piled up on the desks but could not be signed because they would bounce.  I said there and then that I had to travel the length and breadth of the city and county to find a bed for an unfortunate woman who needed an urgent operation.  I was told I was exaggerating.  Then <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, a national newspaper, verified what I was saying and they were censored.  This is true.  Let us be honest about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I contacted the Minister many months ago about the long waiting list for hip operations.  When I contacted the people responsible for the operations they told me to go to the Department of Health and ask for an extra supply of hip replacements.  There was no extra supply. If there had been the surgeons could, <Col N="1168" /> at least, have reduced the waiting list a little.</P>
      <P>The Minister stood up here tonight and said everything was grand.  I am not doubting his efforts, never did and never will.  I should like to say that he is very far removed from what is happening in some of our hospitals.  I know people &mdash; and I could take the Minister to their houses if he comes back to Cork &mdash; who have been waiting for months to be admitted to a hospital.  What appeal have those people?  They go to politicians and we complain; then we are told we are exaggerating.  Surely, an ombudsman would at least defend those unfortunate people and ensure that they get their rights.  Surely an ombudsman would be of tremendous help to the Minister and his officials in compiling information.</P>
      <P>How many people are discharged within hours after serious operations? How many have died?  How many families have made accusations against hospitals?  What are they told?  They are told to go to a solicitor and to take it up with their legal adviser.  Where on earth are people to get money to employ a legal adviser to prove a certain amount of neglect in hospitals?  I cannot blame hospitals because they will say: they had to perform the operation, that they did their best and that there are other patients waiting for operations.  I am not exaggerating.  I was never one to stand up and exaggerate or accuse anybody of a wrong of that kind.  I am saying with all sincerity that the Minister and his officials must be very far removed from what is happening.</P>

If by chance the medical officer has visited the school, it could be two or three <Col N="1169" /> years later before they get an appointment and the children have moved on to secondary school and are no longer entitled to the school service.  What redress has the unfortunate parent in those circumstances?

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate I agreed to consider whether some sort of control be put on the new regulations made by the Minister specifying the fees to be paid to the Central Bank in respect of supervision.

They will also have a statutory right to make representations regarding that fee and to have those representations taken into consideration before the regulations are made.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 54, lines 8 to 11, to delete &ldquo;, or an associated enterprise (within the meaning of section 17 of the Act of 1971 (inserted by section 36 of this Act), other than subparagraph (v))&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposed to delete the reference to associated enterprise in section 71 (b) and to insert a new provision as subsection (2) of the section to allow the Central Bank to exempt certain share acquisitions by licence holders in other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 71 (b) requires a licence holder who proposes to acquire a 10 per cent or more holding in another company to notify the Central Bank and to secure the bank's approval.  Section 71 (b) also applies this requirement to an associated enterprise of a licence holder.  An associated enterprise means a parent, subsidiary, fellow subsidiary of a licence holder, or a company in which the licence holder owns 20 per cent or more of the shares.  It has been put to me that applying the notification and approval provisions of Chapter VI to these associated <Col N="1172" /> enterprises is a very wide provision and could cause severe problems for the normal commercial operations of the banks in such areas as venture capital, investment management, share underwriting and nominee account companies carried on either by a bank itself or by an associated enterprise of the bank.  I accept that these problems are created. Having examined the matter and looked at a number of possible formulations to minimise the commercial disruption, I have come to the view that the wisest course is to remove associated enterprises of licence holders from section 71.</P>
    <P>However, it is still necessary to provide relief for licence holders themselves from the requirement to notify certain share acquisitions where clearly the licence holder is not making the acquisition as a business venture to secure control or influence of another company but merely as part of a licence holder's ordinary banking business.  The cases I have in mind are underwriting of shares, shares held or acquired as security for loans and shares acquired by a licence holder as a nominee for another.  I propose to provide a power for the Central Bank to exempt such transactions on conditions applied by the bank, if necessary.  I think it is desirable that the bank should have a role to play to prevent any possible abuse of an exemption, rather than by excluding these transactions automatically from the Bill.</P>
    <P>In making these changes I am responding to requests from Deputy Noonan and Deputy McDowell, the banks themselves and the Law Society.  I ask the House to accept these amendments.</P>

    <P>This amendment inserts a standard clause in section 92 limiting the liability of the Central Bank arising out of supervision of International Financial Services Centre companies.  Similar provisions are to be found in section 101 (3) of this Bill in relation to the supervision of future exchanges and in section 110 (7) in relation to the supervision of moneybrokers. The Central Bank Act, 1971, has a corresponding provision for banks &mdash; section 9 (5) &mdash; in fact the approval given to International Financial Services Centre companies qualifying for a certificate under the Finance Act contains a disclaimer in similar terms to that proposed in this section.  Thus we are giving no more than statutory effect to an existing procedure.  This section should have been included at an earlier stage but did not come to notice in time.</P>

      <P>In page 74, line 42, before &ldquo;to write&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than to facilitate a legitimate act of counting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fear in banking circles that the practice of putting a pencil or pen mark on the top note would be illegal under this Act and that what would be the normal procedure on the part of many cashiers when counting notes would now suddenly be an offence.  If the Minister thinks my <Col N="1175" /> amendment does not meet the particular case, is there any other way in which the normal action of a cashier in counting notes would be exempt from the penalties of the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The same point as raised in the amendment by the Deputy opposite was made to me in representations from the banks which wished to mark notes in their counting operations. The section has been explained to the banks and they have accepted the situation.  It is illegal to deface legal tender notes under section 123.  Marking of notes by the bank makes the job of the Central Bank more difficult in preventing others from marking notes.  There have been a number of complaints about the state of the notes in circulation and indeed such complaints were made in this House during the Finance Bill the problem of precedents arises.  If bank tellers can mark notes in the counting process, so can shopkeepers, publicans and everybody else handling notes.  The end result is more defaced notes circulating in public, thus reducing their attractiveness and status.  The provisions in section 123 are re-enactments of sections in the Currency Act, 1927, which seems to have operated satisfactorily for 62 years.  I hope the Deputy appreciates this point, as the banks do, when we explained it in its entirety to them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 79, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  by the deletion in section 6 after &lsquo;legal proceedings&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;to which the bank is not a party&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>by the insertion of the following section after section 7:</P>
      <P>7A. If, on an application made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent, a court or a judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that an indictable offence has been committed; and</P>
      <P>(b)  that there is material in the possession of a bank specified in the application which is likely to be of substantial value (whether by itself or together with other material) to the investigation of the offence;</P>
      <P>a court or judge may make an order that the applicant or another member of the Garda Síochána designated by him be at liberty to inspect and take copies of any entries in a banker's book for the purposes of investigation of the offence.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments to the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, arise from points raised on Second and Committee Stages.  The new sub-paragraph (b) amends sections 6 of the 1879 Act to allow extracts of bankers' books, instead of originals, to be used in court proceedings whether or not a bank is a party <Col N="1177" /> to the proceedings.  The present section only allows this where the bank is not a party, but in practice I am told the courts have facilitated the banks in either case.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (c) is an amendment to section 7 of the 1879 Act.  Section 7 of that Act allows any party to a legal proceeding to apply to the court to inspect and take copies from bankers' books for the purposes of the proceeding.  The DPP has drawn attention to the fact that in criminal cases he would wish to be able to apply for such an order before legal proceedings were commenced in order to obtain the requisite evidence to take proceedings.  I believe Deputy McDowell may have had this in mind in his comments on Second Stage.  This issue has also been examined in the UK in the recent report of the Official Review Committee on Banking Services: Law and Practice.  That committee saw merit in a proposal such as that under consideration here.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (c) is carefully drafted to apply only to criminal cases where the use of the power would aid in pursuing criminal proceedings.  A senior Garda officer must make the application.  The court must be satisfied that the material sought is of substantial relevance and that an indictable offence has been committed. I believe that with these safeguards the amendment should be acceptable to the banks.  It is important to preserve bank confidentially but the needs of the State in prosecuting serious crime must also be taken into account. Section 7 of the 1879 Act already allows for inspection of bankers' books in legal proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): This is a fairly strong power to vest in the first instance in the Garda Síochána and subsequently in the courts.  It certainly has implications for the confidentiality of banking and of records kept by the banks. The particular trigger mechanism whereby the courts would consider an application where a member of the Garda <Col N="1178" /> Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, has reasonable grounds for believing certain facts is the trigger mechanism which was introduced to Irish law originally in the Offences Against the State Act.  Under that Act if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent is of the opinion that certain members are members of an illegal organisation, they can be charged with the offence and the sworn word of the officer in court can be taken as evidence. It seems to be a borrow from legislation which, even though it is part of the normal corpus of our law now, is still a response to emergency-type cases and it does not seem to be the way to deal with the banking institutions.  I am uneasy about the procedure.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo; is no real inhibition on a superintendent, because if a superintendent says he has reasonable grounds for believing, there is no way the court can look behind that and there is no provision in the amendment stating that he would have to bring forward any kind of evidence to support the reasonableness of his grounds for believing.  Effectively, what we are saying is that the word of a superintendent would allow the court to grant an application whereby other members of the Garda Síochána, down to the most recent recruit out of Temple-more, would be empowered to inspect and take copies of bank records.  That is a fairly sweeping power.  On the face of it, there are a number of safeguards implicit in the section but I do not think they are safeguards at all.  Once the superintendent acts, it seems the court has no choice but to grant the application. Once the application is granted, any other garda designated by the superintendent would then be given the right to check books and take copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the professionalism of the Garda Síochána.  I think any member of the Garda Síochána of the rank of superintendent will be reasonable in the exercise of his functions <Col N="1179" /> but this is still a very strong power to invest in one man, with no obligation to bring forward any further evidence.  I suppose it is similar in a way to the issuing of a warrant but it seems to be less rigorous than, for example, the procedure that would have to be gone through if the Garda Síochána wanted a warrant to search a premises.  I have no doubt but that this amendment will be used rarely.</P>
    <P>I also believe there must be some mechanism under law to collect evidence in cases of fraud but I would have two fears: one is that people outside the jurisdiction who would not understand the professionalism of the Garda Síochána would have visions of the confidentiality of banking being broken down by gardaí intruding into the private affairs of companies and individuals; and, secondly, I would be concerned that in certain circumstances where certain crimes were proving very difficult to resolve, there might be a temptation on behalf of the Garda Síochána to go on fishing expeditions through the account books of banks.  I hope I am not making a mountain out of a molehill but this measure is introduced at a late enough stage in the Bill and it seems to be the type of section with which we would be more familiar in other areas of criminal law than in the prevention of the type of activity we are talking about here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's fears in this regard.  However, as I have said, we have had extensive discussions with the banks and they accept that in the public interest a change might be made, provided the safeguards we are talking about here are included. As I have already said, section 7 of the 1879 Act already allows for inspection of bankers' books in legal proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>An application to the court by the party to the proceedings, and the courts decide.  We are only extending this power in certain, clearly defined cases of criminal investigations subject to particular safeguards.  The word of a superintendent will not be accepted in court in this regard because the court has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds.  The word of the superintendent is not enough.  It only applies where the prosecution can show that an indictable criminal offence has been committed.  It is a very tightly drawn section in that regard.  We are not allowing any so-called fishing expeditions in civil cases or anything like that, about which the Deputy expressed fears.  We are not allowing for the type of expedition whereby one can get an order to see what one can dig up just to sustain an action.  If we were, I could understand the fears expressed by the Deputy.  It is as tightly drawn a section as possible and we are very careful of the confidentiality aspect.  The Deputy will appreciate, a worry was expressed only last weekend by ECOFIN about the movement of funds arising out of criminal activities around the world and they said they were wrestling with their own laws to make sure they can deal with this.</P>
      <P>The safeguard is there to avoid any such fishing expeditions and I am sure the Deputy would agree that the court takes a very jaundiced view of anybody trying to use a section like that to produce evidence to prove a case at a later date.  We gave this a great deal of thought.  We had a discussion with the banks and we did not do this lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am still unhappy about it.  As it is drafted, a court does not have to have any modicum of evidence before it or a judge does not have to have any evidence at all.  The procedure is that if a superintendent in the Garda Síochána is satisfied or has reasonable grounds for believing certain things, he goes into the court and tells the judge he has reasonable grounds, and <Col N="1181" /> then the judge has reasonable grounds because the superintendent told him.  If it was drafted so that both the superintendent and the judge had to be satisfied, it would be a safeguard.  The way it is drafted there are alternatives, it says &ldquo;Superintendent, a court or a judge&rdquo;, not &ldquo;and a judge&rdquo; but &ldquo;or a judge&rdquo;, and a judge has no grounds for believing the superintendent has not reasonable grounds once he says it.  Consequently, he must accept that the superintendent had reasonable grounds and he must give the order.</P>
      <P>What the Minister described as safeguards are not safeguards at all; they are window dressing.  If the banks are happy with this they are happy, but I am not happy with it.  I do not think there are any safeguards in that section but it is presented to appear as if there were.  The safeguard is the professionalism of the superintendent or any officer of higher rank, which is a subjective safeguard. There is no objective safeguard in the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister cited an Act which already gave the right to inspect books and records in banks, but it seems the procedure is there that a party to the action would have to go before the court and give grounds for his request to inspect books.  I am not familiar with the Act, but I would be surprised if that is not the procedure &mdash; that a party to the action would have to go into court and have to give grounds.  Certainly if, in the opinion of the party to the action, there was something hooky in the books he would not be given access to them purely on his opinion.  In the final analysis a superintendent of the Garda Síochána having reasonable grounds for anything, ultimately means it is the opinion of a chief superintendent that there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frequently in such cases a superintendent, even if he has evidence, will not be able to present it in court because what we describe as &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; frequently comes to the Garda Síochána as <Col N="1182" /> intelligence information from informers. The Garda superintendent would not be in a position to reveal either the source or nature of the information.  Consequently, all he can say is, &ldquo;I believe such and such is true&rdquo;.  There seems to be no procedure to negative the opinion of the Garda superintendent either.  In the Offences Against the State Act, at least if your local chief superintendent decides you are a member of a subversive organisation, goes into court and swears you are, that is an offence under the law, but if you go into the box and swear you are not, under law your oath is as good as his and one cancels the other.</P>
    <P>However, there is no procedure here for the bank, for example, or a third party to say they have reasonable grounds, because if there is nothing wrong with the books, one opinion or one piece of evidence under oath does not negative the other.  If the banks are happy with this, they are happy with it, but I would like to point out that this procedure goes beyond what is used in the criminal courts under the Offences Against the State Act when the State seeks to convict people for membership of unlawful organisations. Even though the opinion of the superintendent under oath is taken as evidence, if that is contradicted by the word of the accused under oath then the case is dismissed.</P>
    <P>I am not going to hold up the House any longer.  I have made my point and if the banks are happy, they are happy.</P>

      <P>In page 80, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) by the insertion of the following section after section 45:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>45A.  (1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, presentment for payment of a cheque may be made by a banker (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;collecting banker&rdquo;) on his own behalf or on behalf of a customer or any other person to the banker on whom it is drawn (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;drawee banker&rdquo;) by notification to the drawee banker of the essential features of the cheque other than by its physical presentment, whether by <Col N="1184" /> the transmission of an electronic message or by any other means.</P>
    <P>(2)  A drawee banker to whom a cheque is presented by notification in the manner provided for in subsection (1) of this section may, before the close of business on the next business day following receipt of such notification, request the collecting banker that the cheque be physically presented to him.</P>
    <P>(3)  A request by the drawee banker for physical presentment of a cheque in accordance with subsection (2) of this section shall not constitute dishonour of the cheque by non-payment.</P>
    <P>(4)  A cheque paid upon presentment in the manner provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall be deemed to have been paid in the ordinary course of business.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a cheque is presented for payment by notification in the manner provided for in subsection (1) of this section, nothing in this section shall be taken to relieve the collecting banker or the drawee banker from any liability in relation to the collection or payment of the cheque to which the collecting banker or the drawee banker would have been subject if the cheque had been physically presented for payment.</P>
    <P>(6)  This section shall apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any document issued by a customer of a banker which, though not a bill of exchange, is intended to enable a person to obtain payment from that banker of the sum mentioned in the document,</P>
    <P>(b)  any document issued by a public officer which is intended to enable a person to obtain payment from the Paymaster General of the sum mentioned in the document but is not a bill of exchange, and</P>
    <P>(c)  any draft payable on demand drawn by a banker upon himself, <Col N="1185" /> whether payable at the head office or some other office of his bank,</P>
    <P>as it applies to cheques.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section, unless the context otherwise requires&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the essential features of the cheque&rdquo; includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the serial number of the cheque,</P>
    <P>(b)  the identification code number of the drawee banker,</P>
    <P>(c)  the account number of the drawer of the cheque,</P>
    <P>(d)  the amount of the cheque as entered by the drawer of the cheque,</P>
    <P>and any such particulars as may be given in the form of letters or figures or any other code which as between bankers represent those particulars;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;physical presentment&rdquo; means presentment of a cheque for payment in accordance with banking practice other than as provided for in subsection (1).'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, and the presentation of cheques for payment.  Section 45 of the 1882 Act provides, among other things, that a cheque must be duly presented for payment by being presented at the branch on which it is drawn.  Unless the cheque is properly presented the issuer's account cannot be debited.  This requires a collecting bank, where the cheque is cashed, to transmit each cheque physically to the branch on which it is drawn.  The Irish Bankers' Federation have asked that this requirement should be removed and the 1882 Act amended to allow the transmission by electronic means of the &ldquo;essential features&rdquo; of the cheque that is the amount, code, serial number, account number of drawer, etc.</P>
    <P>This request seems reasonable and the proposed new section 45A to be inserted <Col N="1186" /> in the 1882 Act is designed to meet it. &ldquo;Cheque truncation&rdquo;, as the process is called, is already a feature of other EC states notably Belgium, Denmark and West Germany.  In the UK the Banking Review Committee have recommended in favour of amending the 1882 Act to allow its introduction by UK banks. There are clear efficiency gains for Irish banks in such a system, which, given the position in the other member states of the EC, the banks should be allowed to make use of.</P>
    <P>The truncation of cheques in this way does not affect the position of the customer in having his cheques returned, since for some years the banks have discontinued the return of cheques to customers as a matter of routine.  The banks have undertaken, however, to preserve a customer's existing right to get a copy of any cheque for particular purposes, to prove payment where a dispute has arisen, and will continue the arrangements already in place with auditors, who may wish to obtain copies of originals for their particular professional requirements.</P>
    <P>It is not seen as necessary to include provisions to cover these matters in the law.  These are an aspect of bank/customer relationships.  Moreover, the provisions already included in the Bill on the resolution of complaints by a banking ombudsman and on codes of practice to be laid down by the Central Bank can be used to bring about an equitable solution should difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>The banks have indicated to me that they intend to apply cheque truncation initially to cheques under £500.  I will expect any change in this position to be notified to, and discussed with, the Central Bank by the banks.</P>
    <P>The provisions in each subsection are technical and are briefly as follows: Subsection (1) will allow a bank to present a cheque to the bank on which it drawn by notification of the essential features of the cheque rather than by physical presentment of the cheque itself.  Subsection <Col N="1187" /> (2) allows the bank to whom the cheque is presented to look for and get the actual cheque if they request it within one day of notification, if the drawee bank requires this for any reason.  Subsection (3) simply clarifies that the request for physical presentation does not constitute a dishonouring of the cheque.  Subsection (4) is self-explanatory.  Subsection (5) ensures that there is no change in liability in relation to collecting or paying the cheque on the part of the collecting or drawing bank by virtue of the use of electronic or other non-physical means provided for in this section.  Subsection (6) applies the provision of the section to other instruments similar to cheques, but which are not bills of exchange, that is, (a) a document signed by a customer to require funds to be paid by the bank; (b) a document drawn on the Paymaster General and (c) any banker's draft drawn on the bank itself.  Subsection (7) details the essential features of the cheque which must be given under subsection (1) and defines &ldquo;physical presentment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The text was drawn up in consultation with the banks and replaces an earlier proposal by them, which, I believe, formed the basis of Deputy McDowell's amendment on Committee Stage.  I ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising a matter which gives me little pleasure.  It is perhaps inaccurately <Col N="1190" /> described as a dispute; rather it is something which I hope will not become a dispute.  I think the Minister will agree with me in that respect.</P>
    <P>A very considerable amount of distress and confusion has been engendered in the Shannon community because of what appears to be a contradiction between a stated policy of the Minister, both in the formal sense of the rationalisation of schools and school facilities and her suggestions in a letter to one of the trade unions concerned in which she specified levels of recruitment.  On the other hand there has been what has been presented as a <i>de facto</i> alternative to the principles outlined by the Minister both in her stated policy and in her letter.  I am not pleased at having to draw the attention of the House to this issue.  The schools concerned are in the parish in which I spent all of my early life and some of my relatives are attending these schools.  I am very familiar with the case on both sides.  The problem should now be resolved without qualification and without the threat which now exists of job losses before the summer term.</P>
    <P>It is interesting and distressing that both the schools involved are State schools in a sense.  One is Saint Partick's Comprehensive School and the other is Saint Caman's School.  The issue has arisen in terms of there being an acceptance at one point that there was a limitation of resources and that there would be a joint recruitment policy to both schools.  I understand that the Minister in a letter at the end of March to the representative of one of the unions involved in Saint Patrick's Comprehensive School specified a number of points unequivocally.  She stated that there were altogether in the area 1,400 secondary school places, 900 of which would be accommodated in terms of a provision that had already been made in the comprehensive school and 500 in the community school.  The union representative of the teachers in the comprehensive school was assured by the <Col N="1191" /> Minister of her view.  The figure of 1,400 and the ratio of 900 to 500 was not expressed as a desirable level; it was expressed unequivocally as the number of places for which provision had been made.  On that basis, she drew attention to the usual shortage of funds available for financing all sorts of services, including health and education, and referred to her anxiety to avoid costly duplication. The Minister stated that it was her policy to encourage joint enrolment and suggested that the issues should ideally be resolved by local management.  It seemed the Minister in her letter of 31 March was clearly resolving what she felt was the future enrolment policy, the relationship between two schools who share a community, and that she was specifying what would be the correct use of the available facilities.</P>
    <P>Of course there is a background to this. In the case of the comprehensive school they are in a position to take pupils up to the figure specified.  In the case of the other school involved there would be on the Minister's desk, as I think there was on the previous Minister's desk, an application for an extension if they were to go beyond the ratio suggested.  The reality is that far from this ratio holding, there has been a recruitment policy and one of the schools involved has sent out letters of acceptance to 140 additional students for the coming year.  This clearly departs from the Minister's policy.</P>
    <P>Let us summarise the issues.  What is the status of the Minister's letter?  Her letter does not state that she or her Department suggest that this or that would be a desirable ratio; it states &ldquo;the ratio is&rdquo;.  It states that facilities are provided for this and for this; yet 140 students have been accepted by one of the potential partners beyond their facilities. How does the Minister reconcile this with any concept of rationalisation?  On the one hand by changing the ratio she is undermining the recruitment policy of the school which has the capacity and on <Col N="1192" /> the other hand she is creating a demand for additional space and facilities on the other side.  It does not make sense.  The Minister has often stated and debated her policy in relation to staffing.  If this additional complement of students is recruited they will be taught by, I presume, hired part time teachers or some additional recruitment of staff, while on the other side the staff of the school who would have lived within their ratio now face into the summer without any prospect of job security in the autumn.  People will be made redundant by what was a policy suddenly not being a policy and movement from one side of the equation.</P>
    <P>Crucial to what I have said so far is the status of the assurance given by the Minister for Education to the representatives of the Teachers Union of Ireland.  I have no doubt whatsoever as to what the Minister stated and there is no need for me to repeat it.  I am sure she has on her file her own letter.  It begins &ldquo;My Department is satisfied ... It has been made clear&rdquo;.  She went further and stated that she had made her views, as I have outlined them, very clearly known to both boards of management.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that, for a start, we all underestimate situations of potential harmony that turn into ones of tension and conflict; but here is the problem &mdash; there have not been, to my knowledge, joint meetings of the boards of management.  There has not been, as the Minister suggested in her letter of March, a local resolution.  What there is, is a danger to posts in one school, and there is a potential demand looming up for the Minister in flat and total contradiction to her policy of rationalisation in the other.  Into this sorry situation go the officials of the Department of Education who, I understand, visited Shannon last Monday.  It is a reflection of the relationship between two second level institutions which no spokesperson on education, the Minister included, would wish to be taking place.  For a start, no joint meeting took place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The Minister's officials in the first instance interviewed the board of St. Caman's and that school has refused a joint meeting, as I understand it, between the comprehensive, the community and the Minister's officials.  They then went on to meet the representatives of the other party to this unfortunate situation, and I understand that the offer that was made was that, if one likes, the result of recruitment entrepreneurship for the forthcoming season of schooling should stand, that St. Caman's would keep their 140 but that addition to that they would, in subsequent years, recruit up to 120 pupils per annum.  This seems to me to be quite extraordinary, because here we are being lectured, week after week, about the rationalisation of resources. We disagree sometimes about many things, but the Minister and I agree that we must have co-operation, joint use of facilities and so forth.  However, I find it extraordinary that a kind of recruitment and fishing for students on the one hand seems to go with a blessing while on the other side of the equation posts are put into some jeopardy.</P>
    <P>After the meeting with the board of St. Caman's &mdash; and I am sure it was very interesting &mdash; I understand the offer that was made to the comprehensive school and their staff was more or less as I have outlined it, that is, that it was rather like what one might call one of those Palestinian/Israeli clashes where it is said, &ldquo;the territories we have held we will hold for the moment but we will contain our aspirations to a modest level for forthcoming years&rdquo;.  This attitude is in total contradiction to what the Minister has been suggesting.</P>
    <P>I return again to the point at which I opened.  What of those teachers who accepted the letter at the end of March in good faith, where the Minister, without putting a qualification or a quiver in any single condition of it, said this is what is in Shannon; this is what the population which is declining slightly will yield; these <Col N="1194" /> are the resources and this is the disposal of staff?</P>
    <P>I want to end what I have to say because I am anxious that there be an adequate resolution to this.  I want to say that what upset me when my attention was drawn to this, as education spokesperson for the Labour Party, was the fact that both of these schools are as near as one can get to directly State funded schools and what struck me was the absolute incoherence of the policy involved. What also distressed me about it was that one should be really establishing co-operation. Putting myself, in a mythic moment, into the Minister's position, I would say that one could, in the first instance, make a recommendation for co-operation and suggest goodwill and everything, but at the end of the day the Minister is the Minister and when she writes a letter such as the letter that was written, and it is accepted by the partners involved, it is only reasonable to expect that that is what they will live with, unless of course they feel they can in fact get away with what has been a breach of this or that which, on the other hand, the people who had accepted that statement of fact, that reasonable projection for the future, will become the victims, are the ones who will suffer.</P>
    <P>It is my dearest wish that what one would have is a reasonable policy, for example, a joint enrolment policy but can the Minister tell this House if there is the slightest prospect of that?  Is it not a fact that here officials came back from the meeting last Monday with no assurance, that there would be a joint enrolment policy, or that there would ever be joint board meetings and that what one really had was a king of quasi rap on the knuckles and an offer to try to control an open ended recruitment policy but with absolutely nothing whatsoever on offer for the other side, the other school that is involved.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this question is that I would like the Minister to return to the spirit of her letter of the end of <Col N="1195" /> March to the Teachers' Union of Ireland. I would like her to assure the House that there will be an adherence to what is in the letter.  I would like her to tell me that there will be no threat to any of the jobs in the comprehensive school because if these practices result in the comprehensive school going over quota what then does one do in relation to those posts?  Is one to tell these teachers that they go off into the summer at the end of this term with no assurance that they will be within quota but will in fact be in danger of losing their jobs, while over on the other side one will be in fact asked to sanction part time teaching posts?  Is it not time to have reason in this case?  The last thing I want to do is to set one school against another but I have seen it happen in the past, and where one party to what should be a joint operation takes off in an uninhibited fashion it requires the Minister to say that she is not going to allow an established second level facility, in this case the comprehensive school, to be run down in terms of facilities and staff because of the individual action of another school that should ideally be cooperating with it.  I would ask the Minister to tell us that her letter of the end of March does hold and that the reported result of the talks does not hold.  I would also ask her to give an assurance to the staff.  The representatives of County Clare whom I see here, Deputies Carey and Taylor-Quinn and also Deputy Kemmy, who are very interested in this matter would like to see it more happily resolved.  What we would not like to see is irresponsible actions being used to subvert what we have had to suffer as policy in education.</P>
    <P>I understand I have two minutes left. I would like to give that to Deputy Kemmy, with the permission of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, was approached by the parents and teachers at Shannon and <Col N="1196" /> I promised to say a few words in the House on their problem.  I congratulate Deputy Higgins on raising this matter on the adjournment time and I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing the discussion to take place.  While this might be a storm in a teacup to the Minister it is a serious matter so far as I am concerned. Like other towns, Shannon Town had some teething problems and does not need educational conflict.  We must avoid such difficulties at all costs.  What we want is harmony and co-operation, not competition and conflict.</P>
      <P>I have read the Minister's letter and I am anxious that the Minister be involved in resolving this issue if at all possible.  I support what Deputy Higgins has said.  I am with the older comprehensive school in Shannon, which has a very excellent record.  One could hardly get a better school in the country.  I understand that St. Caman's is also a very good school.</P>
      <P>The conflict is unhealthy.  It is unnatural and wrong and it should not have arisen.  It is not good for education, for the children or for Shannon Airport.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that these recruitment policies make no sense at all. Without adding fuel to the fire, I must also say that the way in which those 140 students were recruited appears to be unethical.  It was certainly unusual, and I will not go any further than that.  If we can avert this trouble, let us do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need co-operation.  Both schools must work together in the interests of Shannon and of the country as a whole. I appeal to the Minister to use her good offices to head-off this potential trouble and to resolve the dispute.  If she could arrange a joint meeting between the two boards as suggested by Deputy Higgins with one of the Minister's senior officers presiding, this could provide a way forward. One of the difficulties is that neither school is meeting.  One would think they were miles apart.  This is something I deplore.  One could not fault Deputy Higgins for making an appeal for a solution.  Everything the Deputy has <Col N="1197" /> said is true.  Competition and conflict are wasteful.  We should look for the opposite &mdash; co-operation and a joint recruitment policy.  That is a modest request which I support.  I appeal to the Minister to use her good offices to secure a reasonable settlement to this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter thus giving me an opportunity to bring the House up to date on the situation.  I was aware of this problem.  I met with the TUI on several occasions in formal session about this matter, and last Saturday week I met two of the young women teachers from one of the schools concerned and had a very long discussion with them.  I am very well acquainted with the facts.</P>
      <P>I want to put one canard to rest, that is, a paper circulating in the Shannon area says that we are going to grant an extension to St. Caman's school and that they have it on good authority that there is now going to be a tactic to force an extension.  There is to be no extension to give additional places in St. Caman's school, and there will be no attempt to force the situation.  That will remain the position, and that was very forcefully said at the meeting last Monday by my officials.  The whole thing is unfortunate. I cannot understand why two groups of people cannot get together and work out an amicable solution.  It is ludicrous that a common enrolment policy cannot be sorted out at local level but must be brought onto the Floor of Dáil Éireann. It says something for the situation which must exist down there.  It is quite unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is quite right that my officials went down last Monday.  A joint meeting was vetoed by one school so my officials met with two separate groups and later met with two of the members of one of the unions concerned and then went back and met again with some of the other parties in informal sessions. Despite all those meetings that went on <Col N="1198" /> all day and into the early part of the night the problem was no nearer to resolution.</P>
    <P>The letter of last March is of course my letter and it outlines the Department's line, but in matters like this one expects local intelligence and co-operation.  The enrolment for the academic year beginning in September 1989 commenced and one school, in defiance of my letter, proceeded to enrol more than they should. In good faith parents have enrolled their children in one school and it would be entirely wrong of me to tell parents that they must now enrol the children in another school.  We are devising a plan so that from September 1990 guidelines laid down by the Department will be adhered to.  I am extremely annoyed about this, but I hope that before then, the parties will come together and resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>We are constantly talking about interventionist policies and too much centralisation and so on.  We will give them a few months to resolve the problem and if they do not, then a formal meeting will be arranged with my Department and the Minister to clearly spell out policy and how it is to be implemented from now on. I cannot now remove from one school, children who have been formally enrolled.</P>
    <P>If by the first term of next year the problem is not resolved a meeting will be convened and strict guidelines will be laid down on future enrolment policies.  From the very beginning, there was to be a common enrolment.  It is one catchment area and it was hoped that common sense would prevail.  I can assure the House that money will not be put into an extension to the school as suggested in this circular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When the schools have settled down in September a meeting will be convened between the Minister and the people involved and clear guidelines will be laid down as to future enrolment patterns for those schools.  It will take a few years to phase it in.  Nobody disagrees about the numbers allocated for the area.</P>

    <P>Agriculture officers of my Department have completed the first part of the survey of the Ballyarthur, Mitchelstown, Dangan-Ardagh, Youghal, Water-grasshill-Kildinan-Bartlesny,  Araglen, <Col N="1070" /> Rahan-Kilavullan, Corrin Hill, Fermoy Ballinaglough West, Carrignavar, Glenville, Glashaboy Mountain, Carrignavar, Caherduggan South-Dromdeer-Doneraile, Fiddane Mountains-Mourne Abbey, Croughervoe-Glendull-Skehan-Mitchelstown, Ballygiblin, Mitchelstown, Cloonlough, Mitchelstown, Ballyhooley, Killikane-Kilcronat-Tallow-Caherderdring-Curraghalla (Mitchelstown) areas of County Cork.  Land Commission inspectors will complete the second part of the survey of those areas by October 1989 as planned.</P>
    <P>Part of Glanworth East-Kilworth and Nagle Mountain areas have been surveyed. My Department have difficulty in tracing the areas of Corroghuran, Burntoot and Ballymock.  If the Deputy supplies further information on the areas he has in mind my Department will check the position in those areas.</P>
    <P>The main criteria to be met by an area before it can be designated as disadvantaged are set out in Directive 75/268.</P>
    <P>The survey of all the areas in the country that have asked to be included in the survey will be completed by October. The results of the survey will then be analysed and it is intended that the areas found suitable for reclassification or inclusion in the disadvantaged areas can be submitted to the EC Commission before the end of 1989.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in view of the threatened lockout by a company (details supplied) in Dublin 5 who are in industrial dispute with their workers, the ruling under which workers cannot obtain full social welfare benefits during an industrial dispute will be changed; and whether it is possible for workers to appeal the present inadequate support from his Department's funds to the families of those in dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 35 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act 1987, a person who has lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work which is due to a trade dispute is disqualified from receiving payment of unemployment benefit.  A similar provision for unemployment assistance is contained in section 142 (3) of the 1981 Act, as amended by the 1987 Act.  The provisions do not apply to a worker who is not participating in or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes is to provide an income for persons who find themselves involuntarily unemployed.  This is not the position in the case of a person engaged in a trade dispute and it is considered that the current provisions governing payment of unemployment assistance and benefit to <Col N="1073" /> persons engaged in a trade dispute are not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In this particular case a number of workers have been on strike since 8 April 1989 and have been supported by others who have refused to pass pickets.  A deciding officer has decided that all these workers lost their employment by reason of a stoppage of work which arose as a direct result of a trade dispute and that in accordance with the statutory provisions outlined above, they are disqualified from receiving payment of unemployment assistance or benefit for the duration of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The deciding officer also decided that those workers who were not involved in the dispute but who have been laid off since the commencement of the dispute are entitled to receive payment of unemployment assistance or benefit for the duration of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Any of the workers concerned who claimed but were disqualified from the receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit may appeal the decision of the deciding officer to an appeals officer.  An appeal form for this purpose may be obtained from the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>If the appeal is not successful, the workers may apply to have their case referred for consideration by the Social Welfare Tribunal.  The tribunal, which was set up in 1982, adjudicates on cases where persons who had been disqualified by an appeals officer from receiving unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit on the grounds that they were involved in a trade dispute, contend that they have been unreasonably deprived of employment by their employer.</P>
    <P>The legislative provisions governing the payment of supplementary welfare allowance provide that the needs of a person without employment due to a trade dispute shall be disregarded in determining entitlement to an allowance except in so far as such needs include the need to provide for adult and/or child dependants.  There is a right of appeal under the scheme to the appeals officer of the health board.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department applies to all permanent residents of the State aged 66 years and over and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years of age. The scheme also applies to spouses under 66 years when they accompany the qualified person.</P>
      <P>The extension of the free travel scheme to all unemployed or to the long-term unemployed would have major cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  There are no plans for such an extension at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. In many cases such workers might otherwise be only marginally better off than if they were claiming disability or unemployment benefit and the scheme is intended to provide additional income to families in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social employment scheme is designed to give unemployed people an opportunity of engaging in part-time employment usually on a half-time basis. The rates of payment under that scheme <Col N="1075" /> are determined by reference to the rates of unemployment assistance and have regard to the fact that participants are free to take up other part-time employment for the remainder of the week while they are not on the scheme.  Rates of payment under the scheme are being increased from July next from £60 to £65 for a single person and from £85 to £92 for a person with an adult dependant There are no plans to enable participants to qualify for family income supplement in addition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present position regarding the taking into account for social welfare means assessment purposes income derived from keeping young students who spend short periods in Gaeltacht houses to learn the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by subsequent Social Welfare Acts, provides that all cash income which an applicant for social welfare or his-her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year, other than specific items excluded by the Act, must be assessed as means.</P>
      <P>In the case of applicants receiving income as a result of providing accommodation for language students attending courses in the Gaeltacht, the income is assessable for the purposes of means testing. However, the amount assessed would be the net income accruing to the claimant after deduction of the necessary expenses in providing the accommodation. This net income, in addition to any other income assessable, is divided by 52 to provide the weekly means of the claimant.</P>
