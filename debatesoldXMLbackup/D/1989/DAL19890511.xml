      <P>On behalf of Dáil Eireann I wish to extend a most warm welcome to President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and the other members of his party who are here with us today in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.  I trust they will have a most pleasant and fruitful stay in Ireland and that they will take back with them many happy memories of their visit to us.

      <P>Last week and the previous week I sought to bring the Taoiseach's attention to Item No. 16 on today's Order Paper, without the passing of which the constituency of Kerry North is not included in the Shannon area. Effectively this means there is neither a programme for industrial development <Col N="2050" /> there nor a programme for the development of tourism.  Could that item be included in next week's Order Paper?  It would take about two hours of the time of the House and is urgently needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 65 is the section which introduces self-assessment for capital acquisitions tax and I would like the Minister to outline the procedure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="2054" /> This section of the Bill effectively reenacts section 36 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976.  The existing section 36 provides that a person who is accountable for the payment of gift tax or inheritance tax has to deliver without notification a return on which the tax is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners under the provisions of section 39 of that Act.  The proposed new section 36 provides that an accountable person now has to deliver without notification a return making assessment of tax on that return and pay the amount of such tax when delivering the return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully subscribe to this idea of self-assessment.  It is right to cast the onus on to the taxpayer to make a return in these circumstances, so I have no quibble with the principle of this section.  Would the Minister agree with me that there are a considerable number of lay people who would have no idea whether or not they were liable to make a return in any given year in these circumstances and, therefore, it behoves the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to actually tell people what the law is?</P>
      <P>Some people might believe themselves to be exempt if they received a small inheritance of £5,000 or £10,000.  Others might wonder what gifts they could or could not receive in the course of a year. The Minister is casting the onus on to the taxpayers.  Everyone who has income knows they are liable to make a return for income tax but not everybody knows whether or not they are liable for capital acquisitions tax.  Surely the onus is on the State to inform people what the law is.  It cannot be presumed that everyone knows what the law is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the onus is always on the taxpayer to make a return.  That is the way it has been in every other area. However, we will help taxpayers to become aware of their liabilities in whatever way we can.  I cannot go any further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A return would show every appreciable gift.  It must also show all property comprised in such gift, an estimate of the market value of such property and such particulars as may be relevant to the assessment of tax in respect of such gift.  In regard to the estimated market value of property, what is required?  Is it a valuation by an auctioneer or valuer, or a statement by a solicitor?  What is the nature of the evidence that must be provided there? Could the Minister be more specific about the fourth requirement that such particulars as may be relevant to the assessment of the tax in respect of such gifts should be provided?  What is the intent in that all-embracing condition?  What else could be relevant other than the value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue will normally accept a value whether it is put on by a valuer or a solicitor, so long as it is a reasonable value.  What is involved in the wider context is that the person receiving the inheritance or gift might well have got other gifts, small and large, including property, at earlier stages, and they must all be aggregated over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of people who are beneficiaries under a trust and have a life interest, I understand that the trustee is a secondarily accountable person.  The donee or the person who receives the interest is primarily accountable and should primarily, as I read the section, make a return.  Are trustees of life interests of limited estates bound to make a return as well?  In addition to that could the Minister clarify what is the standing of a holder of a life interest to require the trustee to pay capital acquisitions tax, to make a return and handle the taxation of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I asked previously in regard to capital acquisitions tax what the Revenue Commissioners would expect in terms of documentary evidence to support a particular valuation of a gift.  This section states that penalties in the form of a surcharge are being introduced to penalise accountable persons who underestimate the market value of property in returns for CAT purposes.  There is also a table levying a surcharge of percentages of 10, 20, 30 per cent and so on.  I will go back to the original question.  If such severe penalties of a surcharge nature are being applied in circumstances where a gift is undervalued, what precisely will the Revenue require when the self-assessment returns are made and when a beneficiary values a gift at a certain amount? To what degree will the Revenue look behind the valuation put on the gift by an auctioneer or a solicitor?  Already the Minister replied and said that the Revenue will be reasonable and that if a solicitor or an auctioneer puts in a valuation that will be accepted.</P>

      <P>If I die and leave Deputy Noonan half of my estate and he is primarily accountable for the inheritance tax on that, it is now being said that the money I leave elsewhere and the rest of my estate are liable to pay the tax if he does not pay it.  I wonder if that is right.  Why should my other heirs at law be liable to make up Deputy Noonan's defalcation?  I think we should stop personalising it at this stage.

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  where, at the date of the disposition,</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This section is very near and dear to the hearts and minds of people in rural Ireland.  I would like the Minister to explain in detail the changes it is now proposed to make.  I understand that this section is being proposed following the Circuit <Col N="2073" /> Court decision, south eastern circuit, by Judge Sheridan, in the case of AE versus the Revenue Commissioners in 1983. Effectively, this is an amendment to paragraph 9 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 which deems a nephew or niece to be the child of the disponer for the purposes of computing a gift or inheritance of certain business assets.  Quite frequently, the favourite nephew or niece has been living on the farm for some time or for all of their lives.  In some cases they are either partially, substantially or totally running the farm.  Very often it is a matter of dispute whether the favourite nephew or niece comes within the terms of paragraph 9 of the 1976 Act.</P>
      <P>I presume it is the intention of the Minister to make very clear the circumstances in which a nephew or niece is deemed to be a favourite nephew or niece and is treated in the same way as a son or daughter for capital acquisition tax purposes.  This is not an esoteric area of revenue collection similar to the ones we have been dealing with which are matters for tax experts and accountants but rather one which is a source of concern for many people who know very little about tax.  I would like the Minister to spell it out in the greatest detail possible and to put it on the record so that it will be widely available not only to Deputies in this House but to the many people who find themselves in this position or who envisage finding themselves in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A child of a disponer is subject to less onerous gift tax or inheritance tax than a nephew or niece of the disponer.  Paragraph 9 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, provides that a nephew or niece of a disponer is to be treated as a child of the disponer in respect of a gift or an inheritance comprising business assets, but only if the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full time basis for the disponer in the five years ending on the date of the gift or inheritance.  This concession is being retained, and it is being extended by this section of the Bill to gifts and <Col N="2074" /> inheritances taken by a nephew or niece on the expiration of a limited interest created by the disponer.  The proposed basis now for the relief is that the nephew or niece must have worked for the disponer for the five years ending on the date the disponer ceases to have a beneficial interest in possession in the business assets.  At the same time, the opportunity is being taken, in the context of a self-assessment tax, to set out for the guidiance of a taxpayer the minimum hours of work constituting &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo;, which is 24 hours.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy want me to go through the various technical sections?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 9 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, provides broadly that a nephew or niece, who takes a gift or an inheritance of business assets from a disponer who is his or her uncle or aunt, is to be treated as a child of the disponer, and so have a tax-free threshold of £150,000 instead of £20,000 in relation to those assets.  The nephew or niece must, however, have worked &ldquo;substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo; in carrying on the business of the disponer in the five years ending on the date of the gift or the date of the inheritance.</P>
      <P>This paragraph 9 has been criticised by the appeal commissioners and by the courts for its lack of clarity, and they have tended to construe &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo; on a very liberal basis, equating it with doing all the work that is necessary.  For example, a Garda sergeant has been held to be working substantially on a full time basis in his aunt's licensed premises 30 miles from his home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the relief does not apply to trusts of business assets even though a nephew might have been working for his uncle in the business for many years prior to his uncle settling the business assets on trust.  For example, if an uncle by will settles business assets in <Col N="2075" /> 1975 on trust for his wife for life, with the remainder absolutely to his nephew who has worked in the business since 1965, the nephew takes an inheritance from his uncle of the business assets on the wife's death, in, say, 1985, but the relief does not apply because the nephew has not been working for his uncle, who was dead, in the five years prior to 1985.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill therefore redrafts the relevant paragraph 9, and in redrafting the paragraph, the criterion for the relief is that the nephew or niece must have been working for the disponer in the five years preceding the date on which the disponer's beneficial interest ceases in the business assets.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the Bill sets out the amended paragraph 9.  Subsection (2) of the Bill sets out the date on which the amendment will take effect, that is, as respects gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 May 1989.  With regard to the amended paragraph 9, subparagraph (1) is a definitions provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give the Deputy a bit more information first.  Subparagraph (2) is the substantive provision which uses the more accurate description of &ldquo;a child of a brother or a sister&rdquo; for &ldquo;the nephew or niece&rdquo;.  It also distinguishes between work done by the nephew or niece for the disponer whose business is either unincorporated or corporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of computing tax on a gift or an inheritance, a nephew or niece of a disponer shall be deemed to be the child of that disponer (a)  where the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full time basis for the disponer for the relevent five year period in carrying on, or in assisting in carrying on, the trade, business or profession of the disponer, and the gift or inheritance consists of property which was used in connection with that business, trade or profession, (b) where the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full time basis, for a company &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by <Col N="2076" /> the disponer, for the relevant five year period in carrying on, or in assisting in carrying on, the trade, business or profession of the company, and the gift or inheritance consists of shares in that company.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) sets out minimum conditions which constitute &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo;.  It concentrates on the work done by a nephew or niece for the relevant disponer or company, and ignores any other work of the nephew or niece.  The nephew or niece may well have other employments which are not taken into account.  The subparagraph defines when a person is not working substantially on a full time basis, which under subparagraph (2) refers to the relevant five year period.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is that the nephew or niece must be over 15 years at the start of the relevant five year period.  A child of school-going age cannot in any sense be deemed to be a full time employee.  The second requirement is that, where the business is owned directly by a disponer, the nephew or niece must have worked either a minimum of 24 hours a week for the disponer, at the disponer's place of business, or a minimum of 15 hours a week for the disponer, at the disponer's place of business, where the business of the disponer is carried on exclusively by the disponer, his wife and the nephew or niece involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Many Deputies will have come across favourite nephews and nieces in accordance with the terms of the section.  Usually there is a small business or farm involved and the nephew or niece will have worked more or less without pay running the business or farm for an uncle or aunt.  In the case of a niece quite frequently she is involved in looking after an invalided relative, and aunt or an uncle.  The public perception of &ldquo;favourite nephew or niece&rdquo; is a person who dedicates his or her time and is not rewarded, is not on a wage or salary. What is the Minister's attitude to them? It seems to me that what the Minister is suggesting here, particularly in relation <Col N="2077" /> to companies, is that one need not necessarily be any kind of favourite nephew or niece, one could be an employee of an uncle or aunt for five years, be receiving a very good salary and working 24 hours per week minimum in order to be deemed a favourite nephew of niece.</P>
      <P>The stress of the section seems to be towards the work input which the nephew or niece puts into the farm, the business or the company rather than a special relationship that may exist between the relatives involved.  Is the Minister moving away from the original intent of the concession which was given to nephews and nieces because they were favourite nephews and nieces and had shown favouritism towards the uncle or aunt by, effectively, sacrificing part of their lives to look after the interests of that uncle or aunt, whether that meant looking after a farm, a pub or an invalided relative?</P>

I am talking about the kind of sacrifice which would be normal for a son or daughter to make.  Consequently, for inheritance tax purposes that nephew or niece would be treated as a son or daughter but I do not think it was envisaged that a nephew working full time for a very good salary in the uncle's company for five years prior to the death of his uncle would benefit from this provision.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister justify the 15 years of age commencement date?  The section states that one cannot be deemed to be a favourite nephew or niece until one has reached the age of 15 years.  Consequently, between 15 years and 20 years will be the relevant years.  There are circumstances where it is clear that the uncle and the aunt-in-law will remain childless and they take in a nephew with the full intent of transferring the farm or the small business to the nephew.  An arrangement is put in place with the agreement of the relatives.  It will be very harsh if, on the death of the uncle, when the nephew is 17 years or 18 years, he will not be treated as a favourite nephew.  If the conditions of eligibility are tied firmly into the work contribution made by a nephew or niece &mdash; any person under 15 years of age cannot be deemed to have made a work contribution &mdash; it will be quite harsh.  I should like to ask the Minister to have another look at the age limit.  I accept the explanations the Minister has given.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The public perception of this provision was that this was the human face of the Revenue and bringing Revenue law in accordance with the type of family arrangements which people made in certain circumstances.  Certainly, in rural Ireland bringing in a nephew with the full intent of him succeeding and carrying on the family farm to the next generation is an arrangement that should be caught within the terms of the concession.  The <Col N="2079" /> limitation of 15 years of age should be reconsidered by the Minister between now and Report Stage.  I am sure he understands what I am getting at.

I am aware of cases where children have gone to live with an aunt or uncle from the age of 9 or 10, looked after them very well and ran for messages for them but many aunts and uncles died before those children reached 15 years.  I accept that if a death occurs a few years after the young person reaches 15 years it will distort the intention of the aunt or uncle.  I will look at this provision again.</P>

      <P>Section 60 of the Finance Act, 1985, provides a concession in relation to the use of certain insurance policies, for the payment of inheritance tax arising on the death of a person, by <Col N="2080" /> exempting from such tax the proceeds of a qualifying insurance policy which are payable on his death and which are utilised for the payment of that tax.  The proceeds of any qualifying insurance policy taken out by an insured person are exempt from inheritance tax in so far as such proceeds are used to pay the inheritance tax arising on the insured person's death, or within a year of his death, under dispositions made by him.  Any part of the proceeds not so used is liable to inheritance tax, as an inheritance taken a day later.  The premiums on policies which attract relief under this section 60 do not qualify for income tax relief.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to the Revenue Commissioners that, since inheritances between spouses are exempt from inheritance tax under section 59 of the Finance Act, 1985, and accordingly since often, in the husband and wife situation, inheritance tax effectively arises only on the death of the survivor of them, the section 60 relief should be extended to policies taken out on the joint lives of the husband and wife, and payable on the death of the survivor.  This section of the Bill is intended to accomplish this, and does so by defining &ldquo;insured&rdquo; to mean an individual, or to mean, in the husband and wife situation envisaged, the survivor of the husband and wife.</P>
      <P>However, provision has also to be made, in the case of these policies payable on the death of the survivor, for the event of the simultaneous deaths of both spouses, for example, where both of them die in an accident and it is uncertain which of them survived the other.  The proposed amendment will have effect from the date of the passing of this Bill.</P>

    <P>Section 76 of the Bill introduces a new basis for taxing the income and gains of collective investment undertakings. These undertakings are unit trusts and also undertakings which may be set up in the State under the European Community Undertakings for Collective Investment and Transferable Securities Regulations 1989.  These regulations have been made to give effect to Council Directive 85/611/EEC regarding undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities called UCITS.  This amendment introduces a new section 76 to the Bill which proposes to exempt from gift tax and inheritance tax units in any collective investment undertaking in the International Financial Services Centre and Shannon Customs Free Airport provided broadly that the disponer and the beneficiary in relation to these units are foreigners.</P>

    <P>`tax avoidance transaction' has the meaning assigned to it by subsection (2);</P>

    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section and subject to subsection (3), a transaction is a `tax avoidance transaction' if, having regard to any one or more of the following, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the results of the transaction,</P>
    <P>(b)  its use as a means of achieving those results, and</P>

    <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), a transaction shall not be regarded as a tax avoidance transaction if it appears that it was a bona fide undertaking or arranged other than for the primary purpose of giving rise to a tax advantage.</P>
    <P>Provided that the fact that the primary purpose of the transaction could have been achieved by some other transaction which would have given rise to a greater liability to tax, shall not, by itself, be taken as sufficient grounds for holding that the transaction was a tax avoidance transaction.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the Revenue Commissioners are of the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction within the meaning of this section, it shall be lawful for them to serve on any person who in their opinion has obtained a tax advantage by virtue of the transaction a notice of <Col N="2086" /> claim (in this section referred to as `a notice') setting out their claim.</P>
    <P>A notice served under this section shall also set out:</P>

    <P>(7)  Where a counter-notice is served pursuant to subsection (6) hereof, the notice and counter-notice shall be laid before the Appeal Commissioners for the determination of any issues arising thereon by the person serving the counter-notice.</P>

    <P>Provided that no such amendment, addition or withdrawal may be made so as to set aside or alter any matter which has become final and conclusive on the determination of an issue made with regard to that matter under subsection (8).</P>

    <P>(11)  In determining any issue between the Revenue Commissioners and any person in relation to any matter arising on a notice or counter-notice, the Revenue Commissioners shall have regard to the provisions of this section but the onus shall be on the person who has served the counter-notice to satisfy the Appeal Commissioners that the claim or consequential claim set out in the notice served on him is wrong in any respect.</P>
    <P>(12)  In determining any issue laid <Col N="2088" /> before them pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, the Appeal Commissioners and where appropriate the Circuit Court and the High Court shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the form of that transaction,</P>

    <P>(IV)  the final outcome and result of that transaction and any combination of those other transactions which are so related or connected.</P>
    <P>(13)  Where pursuant to subsection (4) the Revenue Commissioners form the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction and, pursuant to that opinion, notices are to be given under subsection (5) to two or more persons, any obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to maintain secreacy or any other restriction upon the disclosure of information by the Revenue Commissioners shall not apply with respect to the giving of the notices as aforesaid or to the performance of any acts or the discharge of any functions authorised by this section to be performed or discharged by them or to the performance of any act or the discharge of any functions, including any act or function in relation to a determination made under subsection (10), which is directly or indirectly related to the acts or functions so authorised.</P>
    <P>(14)  The Revenue Commissioners may nominate any of their officers to perform any acts and discharge any functions, including the forming of an opinion, authorised by this section to be performed or discharged by the Revenue Commissioners and references in this section to the Revenue <Col N="2089" /> Commissioners shall, with any necessary modifications, be construed as including references to an officer so nominated.</P>
    <P>(15)  This section shall apply as respects any transaction where the whole or any part of the transaction is undertaken or arranged on or after the 25th day of January, 1989, and as respects any transaction undertaken or arranged wholly before that date in so far as it gives rise to, or would, but for this section, give rise to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a reduction, avoidance or deferral of any charge or assessment of tax, or part thereof, where the charge or assessment would otherwise first arise on a date, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a refund or a payment of an amount, or of an increase in an amount, of tax, or part thereof, refundable or otherwise payable to a person where that amount, or increase in the amount, would otherwise become first so refundable or otherwise payable to the person on a date,</P>
    <P>which could not fall earlier than the said 25th day of January, 1989, as the case may be, but no notice shall be served in relation to any transaction which appears to have been undertaken or arranged earlier than 1st January, 1985.</P>
    <P>(16)  The liabilities of any person to pay tax as finally determined by the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions of these sections, or as deemed to have been so determined, shall for all purposes be deemed to be liabilities imposed by law and all remedies, penalties and liabilities for interest shall have application accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been some degree of public controversy about this Part of the Bill but in general terms I would not say there is huge public disquiet with the principle. Maybe there is a degree of complacency about what is in the Minister's proposal <Col N="2090" /> and it deserves close scrutiny by any self-respecting Legislature when the Minister comes before the Dáil in circumstances like this with such a far-reaching change. That is not to say it is a worthwhile change in principle.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to say about tax avoidance generalised provisions of this kind is that I am not against them in principle, but just because we are not against them in principle does not mean we should accept the first one that comes our way.  That is what worries me about the draft put forward by the Minister.  I do not think it is a very well drafted section.  I know, on reflection, that my amendment suffers from a few defects as well but a provision as far-reaching as this should not have been put together and floated as this has been without a considerable degree of public debate on the implications of each individual ingredient in the Minister's scheme.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in context, nobody would disagree with the principle that where it can be shown that any transaction has no independent life of its own and is fundamentally and essentially a tax avoidance transaction, that kind of transaction should be disregarded.  A transaction which conforms to that description should be able to be set aside &mdash; and that is another issue &mdash; to prevent people from simply indulging in totally artificial transactions with a view to tax advantage.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that a section such as this is bound to have a prophylactic effect as opposed to an effect in use.  It is bound to have the consequence that people will go to accountants with schemes and the accountants will say it is not worth the candle to forget about it.  An anti-avoidance section which works as a sword of Damocles hanging over any particular dubious transaction is bound to have a positive effect and to force professional people and advisers to look to the substance of what is going on and not to spend many midnight hours trying to work their way round things, trying to up-end the law and effectively subvert the law by making it mean things which <Col N="2091" /> nobody in their heart of hearts could say it was intended to mean.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for a general provision which has the effect of scaring off tax avoiders from the general area of high artificial transactions which have no independent life of their own.  It is only fair for a Legislature to indicate to the advisory professions involved, taxpayers, businessmen and people who have the time, resources and the motivation to spend a lot of time working out tax avoidance schemes, that they should not waste their time if the essence of the transaction is artificial.  It is a good idea to scare people off that territory and tell them that those efforts will be fiscally in vain.</P>
    <P>That is the principle of putting in place something which has this warning-off effect, and I agree with that.  I also agree with the proposition that where you can demonstrate that a particular transaction had no independent life of its own, was devoid of substance and was entirely a construct for tax avoidance purposes you should be able to set it aside.  But then &mdash; and this is the crunch &mdash; what will be the consequences of such a scheme when it is brought into actual legislative form and how do you actually operate it?  It is on this point that I fundamentally differ from the Minister.</P>
    <P>At first blush my amendment looks very similar to the Minister's section and this is because, to be frank, I have used as much as I can of his phraseology simply in an effort to save myself drafting time. What I propose, instead of the Minister's scheme, is that the Revenue Commissioners should not be put in the position of being judge and jury as far as a tax avoidance transaction is concerned.  I contend that they, who obviously have a huge input into the drafting of this section, as they do in relation to all fiscal legislation &mdash; and obviously they have a huge interest in getting in the maximum amount of tax in any individual circumstance &mdash; should not also be given powers effectively to adjudicate on the meaning of the tax code.  That is where I differ fundamentally from the Minister. I think he has gone too far.  In this regard <Col N="2092" /> it is a predictable excess on the part of the Minister because he is dependent on those who want the law to go too far for the drafting process.  I am afraid it is a defect of our system in this House that we do not have a highly qualified taxation drafting service independent of the Revenue Commissioners available to the Legislature.  They draw up their own laws and the signs are on it in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is wrong with the Minister's amendment and is right in principle with mine &mdash; if I may put it bluntly &mdash; is that the Minister's amendment is based on giving the Revenue Commissioners effectively a power of adjudication.  Both in the Bill, as originally tendered by the Minister to this House, and in the Bill as now proposed to be amended by him, huge efforts have been taken to try to disguise the nature of the Revenue Commissioners' role.  What would be in any other layman's language a determination is cast in this provision, as tendered by the Minister in section 76, as an opinion.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, the opinion &mdash; and I still think it is a rather daft abuse of language &mdash; we are told, in certain circumstances, becomes final and conclusive. What is a final and conclusive opinion?  It is still an opinion.  But when the opinion, in fact, is given the consequence of determination it can be enforced.  Only a determination can become final and conclusive; the opinion cannot.  Everyone can have their opinion but a determination which becomes final and conclusive is something which can be enforced.  One cannot enforce an opinion; one can enforce a determination.</P>
    <P>There would appear to have been huge efforts made by the Attorney General's office in particular to avoid casting the Revenue Commissioners in this matter as a determining body, determining what are the consequences of the law, or adjudicating &mdash; to put the judicial flavour on it &mdash; as to whether a transaction does or does not fall into one category or another, or fall on one side or another of some line which has been devised by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> No matter how the Minister may claim that this Bill is not one which gives the Revenue Commissioners this kind of determination or adjudication function, it still stares out through its provisions, and their substance, as opposed to the exact words used, that that is what was intended and that that is how the thing was originally conceived to be; that the Revenue Commissioners would look at a transaction, would form views about it and that those views themselves would have consequences which become binding. That is the essence of adjudication, that one establishes somebody who looks at a situation, forms intellectual conclusions about it, and that those conclusions have the power of law once they become binding.  That is adjudication.</P>
    <P>That is why I think the scheme, as proposed by the Minister, is defective as far as the law is concerned and runs into constitutional difficulties.  It amounts to a transference of judicial powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed, it amounts to more than judicial powers to the Revenue Commissioners because, if one looks at page 72, lines 19 to 24, one finds there is a power that is never even given to a judge in this country.  It is a legislative power, one that is not given even to the Judiciary.  It is the concept of determining or forming opinions &mdash; if I may use the Minister's language &mdash; that a transaction would result directly in a misuse or an abuse of a provision of the law of the State.  As I understand it, the law of the State is the law as established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The function of deciding what is and what is not an abuse of the law of the State, in my view, is one which is not even given to the Judiciary.  They do not sit in the Supreme Court and say that the law should be this, or the law should be that and that to use the law this way or that way is to abuse it.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of common law is that the law is certain.  People operate under the law as a matter of certainty and a thing is either lawful or unlawful but it is not something which is morally wrong because it amounts to an abuse of the law.  That concept is not known in Irish <Col N="2094" /> law.  To give to anybody, whether by way of statute or the Constitution, the right to determine what the law actually means, what was its purpose at the time of its enactment, and then give that body the right to form conclusions based on judgments of that kind of issue and to change people's rights accordingly is giving them not simply a judicial power but a legislative power.</P>
    <P>We sit in this House and consider laws put forward mainly by the Government of the day.  What we intend is our business. Even if the Revenue Commissioners draft the laws, even if they know very well that they intend to achieve by the laws &mdash; as exemplified yesterday even in regard to that IDA function in relation to certain things &mdash; people have very clear opinions on what they want the law to achieve but they do not have the right, nobody has the right, except this House, to decide what it means and what was its intention. Nobody has the right to say that this House made a law which has a certain effect but that, if a person uses it in a particular way, that amounts to an abuse of the power, the right or whatever conferred by this House.</P>
    <P>That is a function which cannot be delegated to the Revenue Commissioners and could not, even arguably, be given to judges to say what is a misuse or abuse of the law.  Something is lawful or it is not.  The notion that it can have abuse or misused consequences or effects seems to me to be an entirely novel concept as far as this House is concerned.  I know there have been precedents before but it still does not mean that it is right.  Indeed, just because it has not been challenged before does not mean that on this occasion it will not be challenged.</P>
    <P>The alternative view is the one laid out in the amendment I propose as a substitute for the Minister's amendment. It simply describes the process slightly more fairly, that is, that the Revenue Commissioners, as people interested in tax avoidance transactions, can form any view they like.  They can then serve on the person involved a notice claiming that it is a tax avoidance transaction, claiming <Col N="2095" /> that it should be disregarded, claiming that certain consequences should flow from it.  Then it is up to that person to dispute their claim.  The claim can go by default and be admitted by that person if he or she does not lift a finger or dispute the Revenue Commissioners' claim.</P>
    <P>If there is a claim and a dispute of that claim, if you like, if there is an issue which arises from the Revenue Commissioners making a claim in respect of a transaction and the taxpayer, the person affected, disputing that claim, that issue is the one to be determined, that the determination takes place at the Appeal Commissioners' level, or at Circuit Court level, on appeal, and effectively we call a spade a spade.  We say: &ldquo;Here is one set of people who claim something, another person who disputes their claim and the Appeal Commissioners decide that claim&rdquo;.  That was the principle I decided to incorporate in an alternative amendment chiefly because I think that is the constitutional way to achieve more or less the result for which the Minister is going here.</P>
    <P>It is the right way to do it.  Here is one group of people who think this is a tax avoidance transaction and should therefore have following consequences and here is another man who says it is not and that we should have a body, a tribunal of whatever kind &mdash; be it the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court &mdash; to decide which is right and which is wrong. The reason I believe that is the right way to approach it is that it does not involve doing violence to language, it does not involve this notion of opinions becoming final and conclusive, it does not involve restricting the grounds on which an appeal can be made to the Appeal Commissioners, it puts the issue fair and square to be decided by an impartial body &mdash; the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court &mdash; as between the Revenue and the taxpayer.  I think that is the right way to go about this.  I am not being naive, because I have also suggested in my amendment that the onus of proof <Col N="2096" /> in this matter should be cast upon the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>People have talked in this debate and outside this House about the unfairness of casting an onus of proof on the taxpayer in respect of tax avoidance transactions. I believe it is fair to cast an onus of proof on the taxpayer.  The reason I think it is fair to do that is that most of his motivation is his own private knowledge, most of his own affairs or the reasons he might or might not undertake a transaction are within his own private and secret domain, It is entirely improper to ask the Revenue Commissioners to undertake the onus of proving his motivation or proving in respect of any transaction that his motivation was X or Y. Where you have by statute created an issue to be decided as to what someone's motives were you cannot, except in some very strange form of criminal law, ask the other side in the dispute to satisfy the onus of proof.  I think it is fair, where a transaction has the appearance of a tax avoidance transaction, to cast on the person who appears to be the beneficiary of that transaction the onus of explaining it to, say, the Appeal Commissioners or the Revenue Commissioners.  That is one feature of the amendment I have put forward.</P>
    <P>I have also tried to simplify the concept of tax avoidance transactions because the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of section 76 are not only complicated but misleading.  On first reading you might decide that an ordinary transaction which was carried on by somebody and which was not undertaken primarily to give rise to a tax advantage was not to be regarded as a tax avoidance transaction.  If you look at lines 10 to 15 of subsection (3) of the Bill you will notice that it is restricted to people acting in the course of a business with a view to realising profits, and that, therefore, that particular so-called safeguard does not apply in many other areas such as people's private disposal of their own property.  A particular fault with the Minister's draft is that he has restricted his main safeguard to business situations.  I think that is wrong.  The test should be a simple objective test and it <Col N="2097" /> should apply to business and non-business situations completely on the same basis.</P>
    <P>The other safeguard which is set out in paragraph (b) of subsection (3) is one to which I referred earlier.  That does have an entirely legislative concept of deciding what is an abuse or what is a misuse of a relief decided by this House.  To allow the Revenue Commissioners to form a view on that is fine but to make their view &mdash; which is the long term effect of this section &mdash; as to what an abuse or a misuse of the tax code is have the effect of law, which is the bottom line of this transaction, is, in my view, to make them into mini legislators of their own kind.</P>
    <P>I take the view that we could have a far simpler and more straightforward tax avoidance transaction definition.  It appears to me that the one I set out is a better one, that a tax avoidance transaction shall not be regarded as a tax avoidance transaction if it was bona fide undertaken or arranged other than for the primary purpose of giving rise to a tax advantage.  I put in the Minister's proviso after that, the fact that you could have done the same thing in a less tax efficient way would not of itself give rise to the conclusion that it is a tax avoidance transaction.</P>
    <P>The proposal I have is that the Revenue Commissioners, if they believe there is a tax avoidance transaction involved, serve a notice on the person concerned claiming that is so and at the same time that the Minister is giving him 30 days to dispute it.  That dispute is effectively put before the Appeal Commissioners for determination and the Appeal Commissioners go at it without any limitation as to their powers or the issues that they can determine.  They look at the whole transaction and act as judges in relation to it.  They apply a simple statutory test and say that is or is not a tax avoidance transaction.  Contrast that again with what the Minister is proposing, that is, that the grounds for appeal before the Appeal Commissioners are limited and that the Appeal Commissioners are told they can do this or they cannot do that. <Col N="2098" /> Even with the amendments now proposed by the Minister we still have the limitation where the Appeal Commissioners are forced into a particular view and have to adjudicate in a particular blinkered way at the behest of the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that is wrong.  It possibly raises constitutional issues, but that is another day's work, that the Appeal Commissioners could be forced into determining an issue blinkered and disregarding some of the issues which they might otherwise consider relevant to the point in question.</P>
    <P>The other matter I thought should have been dealt with slightly more sensibly is the question of how far back the Revenue Commissioners can go in determining whether a transaction was a tax avoidance transaction.  I do not like using individual names but the McGrath case is sufficiently celebrated for all of us to use it in this House.  The Minister indicated that it was possible and, indeed, likely, that many others had resorted to the McGrath tax avoidance mechanism, presumably on the same advice or having seen the outcome of that High Court case and that it was fair to look at all those transactions and with respect to them to set aside any consequences which arose from them after the date of the budget. I would not cavil with that.  I have never held the view that there is something sacrosanct about retrospection or that the Constitution in some way prevents it.  The Constitution does prevent retrospective criminal sanctions and penalties but I do not think it prohibits the Legislature from viewing a set of past circumstances and deciding future consequences from it.  I do not think it should be interpreted in that way.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should have put some back limit to the period in respect of which transactions were to be subject to the consequences of this Act. I know he will say that the Revenue Commissioners are reasonable men and perhaps they are, but the time may come when an unreasonable inspector of taxes sees some transaction that was undertaken in the mid-seventies and says that that is the kernel of how this man has got <Col N="2099" /> away with so much since and he might decide to set that transaction aside.  There must be some certainty in tax affairs.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is really concerned with the McGrath case and associated activities he should be quite satisfied with the proposed date that I suggest in subsection (15) of my proposed amendment, that is, that no notice shall be served by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to any transaction which appears to have been undertaken or arranged prior to January 1985.  I am not hung up on the date but it struck me that it would bring some certainty into tax laws so that people would be able to say that any transaction after a certain date is open to investigation and those beforehand you can put out of your mind.  You do not need to have &mdash; which may be the case &mdash; extremely scrupulous and worried accountants going back further and examining transactions 15 and 20 years old and advising their clients as to their consequences.  It is unfair to ask people to undertake that now especially since we are effectively changing the law.  I draw the attention of the House to subsection (11) of my proposal which reads:</P>
    <P>In determining any issue between the Revenue Commissioners and any person in relation to any matter arising on a notice or counter-notice, the Appeal Commissioners shall have regard to the provisions of this section but the onus shall be on the person who has served the counter-notice to satisfy the Appeal Commissioners that the claim or consequential claim set out in the notice served on him is wrong in any respect.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be understood that I am not suggesting that tax avoidance transactions should be made easier, nor am I suggesting that it should be made more difficult to prove them.  What I am suggesting is that the process whereby it is determined that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction should be an obviously fair one and not one which is designed to warp language and warp the constitutional functions of Legislature, <Col N="2100" /> Judiciary, the Appeal Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There are a number of comments I should like to make on the Minister's amendments but I would like first to hear him on the issues of principle I am now raising.  These are in summary: it is all right in principle to have an anti-tax avoidance measure; it is all right in principle to cast the onus of proof on the taxpayer; it is not all right to try to disguise the determination process that happens under his scheme with the Revenue Commissioners as, effectively, just an opinion forming process when you, in fact, make those opinions have the force of law unless they are contested.  I am asking the Minister to indicate why, if he is persisting with his own text, it is that he considers it right to limit the grounds of appeal of the Appeal Commissioners in the manner which he is now putting forward even with his proposed amendments. Why is it that he finds himself unwilling to have the Appeal Commissioners, on the basis of their own view of a simple definition of what is a tax avoidance transaction, adjudicate on the issues between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners rather than set them up in a kind of statutory straight-jacket to force them to one conclusion rather than another?</P>
    <P>Lastly, I notice from reading the draft which I have put together that there are a number of printing errors in it.  I hope they are not being held against the principle of what I am talking about and that the Minister will accept that the printing and drafting errors are not matters which should invalidate the principle of what I am talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are sections in Finance Acts, such as section 23 and section 84, the very mention of whose number immediately communicates the meaning and the intent years after the section has been passed and I think section 76 of the 1989 Act will carry the same kind of connotation. Obviously, this section is one which has excited much interest and much argument and led to many submissions.  I have <Col N="2101" /> gone through many submissions I have received.</P>
      <P>Like all sweeping changes, it is quite a complex section, but the intent is simple enough.  Up to now we always used to differentiate between tax evasion and tax avoidance.  Tax evasion was always wrong because it was illegal and the Revenue Commissioners always went after people who evaded tax.  On the other hand, tax avoidance was treated differently. It might not have been considered to be a practice indulged in by better citizens; it might not have been considered to be honourable.  However, because it was in accordance with law, it was legal.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed here is that tax avoidance should be treated like tax evasion and tax avoidance should no longer be in accordance with law because the Revenue Commissioners may now form an opinion, under section 76 of this Bill when it becomes an Act, that tax avoidance transactions are illegal and, therefore, they cannot be indulged in and are subject to penalties.  Therefore, they are out.  That is the change which is being proposed and it is a major, profound change.</P>
      <P>In the course of many submissions, I have been provided with some judicial comments on the rights of taxpayers to avoid tax.  It is interesting to look at some of these judicial opinions, to set the matter in context.  I would like to quote first from Lord Clyde, the Inland Revenue Commissioners <i>versus</i> Ayrshire Bullman Motor Services and Richie (14 TC 754, 1929).  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No man in this country is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his legal relations to his business or to his property as to enable the Inland Revenue to put the largest possible shovel into his stores.  The Inland Revenue is not slow &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; to take every advantage which is open to it under the taxing statute's for the purpose of depleting the taxpayer's pocket.  And the taxpayer is, in like manner, entitled to be <Col N="2102" /> astute to prevent, so far as he honestly can, the depletion of his means by the Inland Revenue.</P>
    <P>Effectively, what is being said is that if one acts in accordance with the law one can arrange one's affairs so that one pays the minimum amount of tax in accordance with law, so that tax avoidance is legitimate.</P>
    <P>Lord Sumner, Inland Revenue Commissioners <i>versus</i> Fisher's Executors (10 TC 302 1926) stated as follows:</P>
    <P>My Lords, the highest authorities have always recognised that the subject is entitled so to arrange his affairs as not to attract taxes imposed by the Crown, so far as he can do so within the law, and that he may legitimately claim the advantage of any express terms or of any omissions that he can find in his favour in taxing Acts.  In doing so, he neither comes under liability not incurs blame.</P>
    <P>This section is putting that on its head and ensuring that, if the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is that the transaction is for tax avoidance purposes, he does incur blame and is liable to penalty.</P>
    <P>Lord Tomlin, Inland Revenue Commissioners <i>versus</i> the Duke of West-minister, (19TC 490, 1936).  I think that these comments are interesting.  I am sure that they have been provided to other people as well as myself.  I am not a legal expert, but they put the matter in its legal context in the development of legal opinion over the years.</P>
    <P>Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attracted under the appropriate Act is less that it otherwise would be.  If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax.</P>
    <P>We come now to 1942.  Lord Greene, Lord Howard de Walden, <i>versus</i> the Inland Revenue Commissioners, (25 TC <Col N="2103" /> 121, 1942).  There is a slight change of mood in this extract:</P>
    <P>The section is a penal one, and, whatever its consequences may be, they are intended to be an effective deterrent to practices which the Legislature considers to be against the public interest.  It scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays with fire to complain of burnt fingers.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister likes that one.  It supports his line of argument.  Later, there is the comment of Lord Simon, Latilla <i>versus</i> the Inland Revenue Commissioners, (25 TC 107, 1943) as follows:</P>
    <P>My Lords, of recent years much ingenuity has been expended in certain quarters to devise methods of disposition of income by which those who were prepared to adopt them might enjoy the benefits of residence in this country while receiving the equivalent of such income without sharing in the appropriate burden of British taxation. Judicial data may be cited which point out that however elaborate and artificial such methods may be, those who adopt them are &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to do so. There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal rights, but that is no reason why their efforts, or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship.</P>
    <P>Again, you can see a change in attitude there.</P>
    <P>Then we come to Lord Upjohn, Revenue Commissioners <i>versus</i> Brebner (43 TC 705, 1967) where it is stated:</P>
    <P>No commercial man in his senses is going to carry out commercial transactions except upon the footing of paying the smallest amount of tax involved.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting one.  It would seem the section envisages that no commercial man in his senses is going to carry out commercial transactions except on foot <Col N="2104" /> of paying the smallest amount of tax involved.  If it is a legitimate business transaction it seems a person could arrange his affairs in that manner but it is not clear whether the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners will allow a person to do that.  Effectively the section proposes that a &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; provision be put in place which will say that if in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners a certain transaction is for the purpose of tax avoidance, that transaction is illegal and no tax benefit will accrue to the person who has put this arrangement in place.  If, on the other hand, the transaction is a legitimate business transaction the primary purpose of which was not tax avoidance even though it reduces tax liability, that is permissible.  However, as is clear from the quotations I have put on the record, the difficulty is that the stress all the time over the years right up to today was that if a taxpayer acted in accordance with the Act, with the section, then, no matter now convoluted or ingenious the activity was, it was legitimate. Now we are shifting ground and saying that if somebody acts in a manner which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is a tax avoidance method of procedure, that is illegal. There is no law really other than this section on which the Revenue Commissioners will base their opinion, and this section does not provide grounds for forming the opinion.</P>
    <P>I remember in my earliest days as Minister for Justice coming into the House where Deputies hopped up and down and said, &ldquo;You cannot do that, Minister, that is unconstitutional&rdquo; and I was intrigued by the concept of constitutionality.  I asked a very wise senior civil servant how we can know whether it is constitutional. He said, &ldquo;Minister, it is very simple. What is constitutional is what the Supreme Court says is constitutional and there is no other test ultimately&rdquo;.  I do not mind having my life guided ultimately by the opinion of the Supreme Court, but I do not want to elevate the Revenue Commissioners to the same status.  I do not think this section as drafted, which effectively says what is legal is what the <Col N="2105" /> Revenue Commissioners consider to be legal, is an appropriate way to proceed in tax law.  I know there are rights of appeal here to the Appeals Commissioners in the first instance and subsequently to the Circuit Court, but the appeal is an appeal within the terms of the section.  If the Revenue Commissioners can illustrate to the Circuit Court that they have acted in accordance with section 76 then they win the case.  It seems they do not have to prove the case on its merits.</P>
    <P>The whole question of tax avoidance has concerned legislators for a long time and is of increasing concern in the House. The returns of the tax amnesty were shocking.  We were delighted at the success of the amnesty, but the fact that £500 million was out there and was collected from people who had evaded their obligations was a cause of great concern and it focused the attention of many people, particularly in this House, on the efficacy of collection methods, and that was only in the evasion area.  We are moving now to the area of avoidance.  I can see what has motivated the Minister and I know the case that probably triggered this off, but I am very uneasy that such a major move is being made and that the law will no longer be clear and one can no longer go to the Finance Act and say, &ldquo;That is legal and that is illegal.  If you do this you are evading tax and you are on the wrong side of the law but if you do that you are simply avoiding tax, you are acting in accordance with law and it is a legitimate transaction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apart from arguments related to the primacy of Parliament and arguments which would suggest the law should be absolutely clear, enshrined in statute and not a matter of opinion, there are arguments on the section itself which are not of principle but of detail.  For example, this could apply to previously non-residential individuals taking up residence here.  It seems possible from the wording of the section for an individual who was not previously resident in Ireland, possibly having no previous connection whatsoever with the country, and while still living in another jurisdiction, to have <Col N="2106" /> dealt with his affairs in some way which could now be regarded as an avoidance transaction.  He could later suffer a charge to Irish taxation arising from the consequences of actions taken in a tax year when he was not even within the scope of Irish taxation.  If you take it to its extreme the outcome seems capable of being applied to such an individual retrospectively in relation to events at a time when this measure was not yet properly promulgated in law here.  That would have created the kind of uncertainty which would make life more difficult for the development agencies and for the IDA in putting propositions to certain individuals.  It would make the task of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in attracting investors to the Custom House Docks site, for example, much more difficult.  That needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I understand that when this section was being drawn up the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister's advisers on finance, looked to Canada rather than to Australia and New Zealand.  It has been pointed out to me that a similar approach is being adopted in Canada and it is on the Canadian experience the Minister is drawing.  It has also been pointed out to me that when the Canadians suggested this they had a two year period of consultation and submissions were made by interested parties; it was not dropped out of the sky on budget night to be implemented a couple of weeks after the publication of a Finance Bill with no consultation whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to this later in the debate, but for the purposes of discussing the matter on the level of principle following Deputy McDowell I have only one thing further to say.  If this were balanced by a procedure where advance rulings were available, and not only available but the Revenue Commissioners were statutorily obliged to give advance rulings, many of my fears would be allayed.  I am really worried about people who conduct what they consider to be a legitimate business transaction being subsequently caught within the terms of section 76 because in the opinion of the <Col N="2107" /> Revenue Commissioners the transaction was primarily a tax avoidance transaction. It is extremely difficult to separate one from the other because it comes down ultimately to the intent of the person who put the transaction in place. The section allows that a person can arrange his affairs in a normal business transaction, one of the consequences of which is a reduction in the liability for tax.  That will be done all the time, but it does not allow for somebody arranging their affairs with the primary purpose of tax avoidance.  Only the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners can adjudicate between one set of circumstances and the other.</P>
    <P>Let us take a hypothetical example for the sake of debate.  Businessman A conducts a transaction the tax effect of which is to reduce his liability by £50,000 but the purpose of which is to put a particular business arrangement in place.  The consequence was a reduction in tax liability of £50,000.  Businessman B feels he is paying too much tax and he puts a similar arrangement in place, not because the exigencies of his business require the transaction but because he wants to reduce his income tax or corporate tax liability.  He ends up in a position where his tax liability is reduced by £50,000. How do the Revenue Commissioners adjudicate between circumstance A and circumstance B?  They look behind the transaction and try to establish the intent of the people who conducted the transaction. It is waving the stick around dramatically and it will slow people down before they put arrangements in place, but it will create havoc if people involved in legitimate business transactions are notified by the Revenue Commissioners that they may be subject to investigation and penalty under section 76 and that they must be called to order.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the position whereby if, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, a person is avoiding tax, then he is avoiding tax regardless of whether the transaction is in accordance with every other section of every Finance Act ever passed.  Because of the opinion <Col N="2108" /> of the Revenue Commissioners that the intent was tax avoidance a person is caught within the provisions of section 76.  The way around this is statutorily to require the Revenue Commissioners to give advance rulings so that if there is a doubt about a particular transaction the professional advisers to the people involved in the transaction can get a ruling from the Revenue in advance of putting the transaction in place.  Then it is a matter of fact rather than opinion. They can act in full knowledge of the consequences.  The advance ruling would allay a lot of the fears I and others have.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say this would be administratively very difficult and that the Revenue would be weighed down by the number of cases presented to them on the passing of this legislation.  A number of cases would be submitted initially but very quickly a type of case law precedent would be established and, once a decision had been made on one category of case, it could be applied administratively to all other similar cases. I do not envisage a situation where in the medium and long term the Revenue Commissioners would have to look behind every proposal put before them to establish its legitimacy so that an advance ruling could be given.  The case law, if I may call it that, would build up very quickly and the Revenue would be able to deal with types of transactions rather than individual transactions.  The administrative burden would not be very heavy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take this on board.  I can see that this section is in line with other sections which have been passed in recent years.  The introduction of Revenue sheriffs and the powers of attachment were two very strong measures which were directed against tax evasion. The amnesty was the carrot to go with those two sticks, again directed towards tax evasion.  Now we have made a great leap forward and we are moving from evasion to avoidance.  We are going after people who are arranging their affairs in accordance with the law to get a tax benefit.  One should proceed with caution.  Once again I ask the Minister to introduce a section which will oblige the <Col N="2109" /> Revenue to give advance rulings in the circumstances of transactions which would be caught by the terms of section 76.  That would remove my principled objection, even though I have some more objections to the detail of the section.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on bringing in legislation dealing with tax avoidance.  Tax evasion has been much talked about and I was amazed to hear Deputy Noonan say how surprised and shocked he was that £500 million came in last September.  I suppose he was surprised that people responded to such an extent to the amnesty but surely he could not have been surprised that that amount of money was out there.  There is a hell of a lot more.  After all, he was a Minister in Government for five years. Admittedly he was not the Minister for Finance but he must have been interested in finance since he is now spokesman on it.</P>

I raised this issue repeatedly when Deputy Noonan was a member of the Government and I was told there was not a crock of gold out there.  Deputy Noonan was then Minister for Justice and it is another indication that Ministers for Justice never really regarded those refusing to pay their taxes as robbers and gangsters.</P>

      <P>The issue of tax avoidance is at last being tackled.  It is even bigger than the tax evasion problem. Tax avoidance has become a booming industry during the past decade.  The number of accountants and tax consultants has increased enormously.  The attractions for civil servants from the Revenue Commission area of the Department of Finance to leave and take up positions in private industry are increasing at a great rate.  They are assisting industry in methods of deliberate avoidance, using every word, every phrase and every comma of the legislation to think up schemes deliberately to avoid tax.  The Minister is tackling that problem simply by making it illegal deliberately to avoid tax.  The tax system is established on the basis of things as they are now and it is being made illegal for companies, businesses or individuals deliberately to put themselves into a position where they might avoid paying tax. It is right that the State should do this. Other countries are well ahead of us since this type of thing is happening all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is entitled when it imposes a tax to pursue and get in that tax without various methods being used to set up avoidance schemes which have nothing to do with the business but are simply separate methods of avoiding taxation. The tax system we have here facilitates this.  With each Finance Bill and each budget the tax system becomes more complicated and complex and it becomes easier to devise schemes to avoid taxes. Therefore, I am glad the Minister is taking up this challenge against people who are avoiding tax on a large scale.  There is every possibility that what the Minister is doing will be challenged on the basis of constitutionality.  I would therefore be anxious that anything in this legislation <Col N="2111" /> that would assist a challenge as to constitutionality would be eliminated, and I would be glad to do anything I can to assist in this.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on the points of difference between Deputy McDowell's amendment and the Minister's section.  I am sure the Minister will clarify some of them in his reply, but I would very much like clarification on Deputy McDowell's points, particularly the one in regard to the Revenue Commissioner's opinion. There seems to be a good argument in regard to opinions which are referred to in a number of places, but I would like to know if there is more than that to Deputy McDowell'a amendment and I would like the Minister to indicate what defects he sees in the amendment before us.</P>
    <P>There are so many ways of tax avoidance that one could have a whole book of legislation on it, but the area of company law is one that I think the Minister should talk to his colleague about.  It has been talked about here for a number of years.  The late Deputy Frank Cluskey, who received accolades from all parties in the House, had this question of company law most at heart when he resigned from the Government and had, I understand, prepared a number of different Bills for company law reform.  This whole area needs reforming because it is of great assistance to tax avoiders and tax evaders in the context of setting up various companies, liquidations and other transactions of that nature.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a first and will be of great help in putting tax avoiders on the same level as tax evaders by recognising that that sort of tax avoidance is illegal. I am glad to see that recognition in the Bill, but I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the amendment put forward by Deputy McDowell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with Deputy McDowell's amendment.  It is only right that we should appreciate the amount of work which Deputy McDowell has obviously put into his amendment.  I am well aware of the effort it requires for <Col N="2112" /> busy Deputies to draft complicated amendments and I believe that this situation clearly gives the lie to certain inferences recently on the part of outside interests that this provision would not be adequately debated in the House.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say how pleased I am to see the Deputy's proposed amendment contain many of the concepts with which he had difficulty in his Second Stage speech.  I am sure this stems from a recognition that I have no desire to put obstacles in the path of genuine business transactions or deny a fair appeal hearing to anybody.  I have a strong desire to put an end to the activities of the tax avoider and I take the Deputy's proposed amendment as evidence of the fact that in this we share a common purpose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposed amendment is long and detailed.  I feel it is not necessary, nor would it be fruitful to go over it in detail or to go into all the technical and other reasons I consider it necessary to proceed with the existing section, subject of course to the amendments which I have tabled myself.  I will therefore address only the main issues at this stage.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism lately about the alleged uncertainty for business and investment in the anti-avoidance provisions. It is somewhat ironic and a little bit hard to take that much of this criticism is coming from the general direction of the people who formulated and, in the absence of remedial action, would continue to formulate the avoidance plans which make this section necessary.  It is a pity they did not have more regard to the consequences of their actions before now.  They have nobody but themselves to blame for bringing that whole area into total disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, I was conscious of the need to ensure there was no uncertainty in the mind of the genuine businessman or the person making legitimate use of the tax reliefs provided by the Oireachtas.  Fot this purpose subsection (3) was inserted in the section.  It is a limiting provision on the actions of the Revenue Commissioners designed to give comfort to the genuine taxpayer and to protect the efficacy of reliefs provided <Col N="2113" /> by the Oireachtas for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy McDowell saw the subsection as conferring some form of wide ranging powers on the Revenue Commissioners.  That was not the intention of the provision and I do not believe that the provision gives such powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Deputy's proposed alternative to subsection (3) may do a disservice to the needs of reassuring genuine taxpayers, and I fear that the unqualified use of words such as &ldquo;appears&rdquo; and &ldquo;bona fide undertaking&rdquo; could be used to drive a hole through the section.</P>
    <P>On the general point, I am satisfied there is nothing in the section to give any cause for uncertainty to genuine businessmen and investors.  The only uncertainty is in the minds of tax planners as to whether their tax avoidance schemes will work.  That is an element of uncertainty that I have no problem with.</P>
    <P>Another area in which it is alleged by commentators that the section in the Bill is deficient is that it is suggested that it contains only limited appeal procedures. Having regard to the amount of detail on appeals in the section and the painstaking opinion procedure which was introduced to protect the taxpayer, I regard that suggestion as ludicrous.  It must be recognised that even in cases of blatant tax avoidance the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from using the section to move against the avoidance until all the appeal processes have been exhausted. Even so, I have had regard to representations and fears in this area and I have tabled amendments to alter the grounds for appealing against the Revenue Commissioners' opinion.  The Deputy's proposed amendment, by dismantling many of the procedural references to the conduct of appeals, would, I believe, make the appeals process more uncertain.  In particular it is not clear how the Appeal Commissioners or the courts would rule on the Revenue Commissioners' opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is supposed to be <Col N="2114" /> the idea; you do not know how they are going to rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion is the mechanism which triggers off the examination of a transaction but nothing happens until it goes through all the procedures including the courts.  Far too much weight is being put on the purpose of the opinion.  It is just the trigger mechanism and until it is either upheld or struck down no action takes place.  I want everybody to be clear about that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposed amendment, by dismantling many of the procedural references to the conduct of appeals, would, I believe, make the appeals process more uncertain.  In particular it is not clear how the Appeal Commissioners or the courts would rule on the Revenue Commissioners' opinion.  It must be remembered that at the time of the hearing of the appeal the Revenue Commissioners would have taken none of the actions described in the notice of the opinion, which they would propose to take to defeat the avoidance.  It is also not clear that a tax avoider would not undertake another round of appeals when the Revenue Commissioners take action following a judgment of the Appeal Commissioners or the courts to the effect that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction.  It is not clear from the amendment whether that appeal mechanism would exist at all.  The use of appeals procedures to frustrate the payment of tax has a long history.  As I have said, I do not propose to dwell on the technical issues in the proposed amendment.  I will confine myself to pointing out to Deputy McDowell that, while I am sure it was an oversight in his draft, he has removed the entitlement to relief to double taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy seeks to impose a limit on the capacity of the section to defeat the effects on future tax payments of tax avoidance schemes completed before budget day.  He proposes to exempt tax avoidance schemes <Col N="2115" /> completed before 1 January 1985 from the section &mdash; I do not know why he picked 1 January 1985.  In practice such a proposal might not greatly impact on the effect of the section unless tax avoiders contrive to back-date their schemes.  Such an eventuality is not beyond the ingenuity of some tax avoiders. Most other avoiders however have probably escaped with the spoils of their schemes already.  What concerns me about the proposal is that it would give the impression that a form of tax avoidance which has consequence for future tax payments is being legitimised by statute.</P>
      <P>For years, tax avoiders and their professional advisers have managed to convince themselves, and have made bold attempts at convincing the public, that their activities were acceptable, that simply because they kept within a literal interpretation of the law in avoiding their due share of tax they were doing no harm. While no-one should require a person to conduct his affairs in a way that attracts the minimum tax, neither can the community at large continue to accept a position in which persons artificially contrive to avoid paying their fair share of taxation. The effects of such activities on the ordinary taxpayer, who has no capacity to indulge in tax avoidance, are scarcely different from tax evasion and the purpose of this section is to make them illegal.  While I do not believe there is any possibility of the Revenue Commissioners going back to re-open transactions completed many years ago, in the manner suggested here, I do not wish to cloak such transactions in any form of respectability.  The sooner the avoider appreciates that his activities are unacceptable the better it will be for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with a few of the other points raised by Deputies.  Everybody knows exactly what is going on.  The McGrath case, which I do not necessarily want to go into in detail here, came before all the different courts.  The Supreme Court ruled on it and quite clearly pointed the finger back to this <Col N="2116" /> House to legislate in the area of tax avoidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not.  Can the Minister quote the passage that refers to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the general interpretation of what they said.  They took the view that it was within the law. In other words, as far as they were concerned, in future in every case that came before them they would take the view that if it was within the law that was fine, but they went on further to state where the responsibility rested in relation to tax avoidance.  In the UK a different philosophy exists.  The matter is before this Legislature so that the House can decide on it.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputy Noonan had to say about the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners. He said that the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is all that matters but that is too fine and too narrow an interpretation. I want to repeat that the opinion is the mechanism that triggers off the hearing at the different stages of appeal of the transaction.  It triggers it off to the Appeal Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners and the courts and no action can be taken by the Revenue Commissioners until that opinion is dealt with at the different stages of appeal.</P>

    <Col N="2117" />

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am suggesting that the Revenue should give advance rulings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy read the recent court comments on advance rulings?  I will come to them later on.  A lot has been made of advance rulings being used in Europe and elsewhere.  In relation to advance rulings and the questions being posed about the uncertainty for business as regards the International Financial Services Centre or indeed Shannon Free Airport, let me explain the matter clearly on the record of the House.  There is a section in the Revenue Commissioners and in the Department of Finance constantly giving advance rulings in relation to the position regarding the Financial Services Centre.  Any certificate that is issued contains ten pages of information.  It is not new to look for advance rulings and to the present day the Revenue will discuss advance rulings with people but to think that there will be all sorts of scams and schemes is a bit much.  People know well what the position is but nevertheless we will deal with advance rulings.</P>
      <P>Much comment has been made here about the alleged finality and status of the opinions of the Revenue Commissioners and what opinions they may form for the purpose of section 76.  It is clear that some Deputies accord the opinions more significance than is warranted.  The opinions to be issued by the Revenue Commissioners are in effect no more than a means of bringing transactions of a doubtful nature into the open and exposing them to scrutiny by the Appeal Commissioners in the courts.  The truth of the matter is that the Revenue Commissioners will not be able to act on an opinion until it has been confirmed by the courts and I want to emphasise that fact. Anyone who is dissatisfied by an opinion will be entitled to appeal to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Circuit Court. An appeal to the High Court on a point of law is also available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Appeal Commissioners <Col N="2118" /> and the Circuit Court must not be understated. Unlike the adversarial role normally taken by the courts, the Appeal Commissioners and the Circuit Court are fact finding tribunals with extensive powers to call witnesses and issue precepts seeking evidence.  An appeal by a taxpayer under section 76(7) of the Bill will result in all the circumstances relating to the case being reviewed and considered by the appeals tribunals and, in the light of all the facts made known to them including information which might not have been available to the Revenue Commissioners when formulating their opinion, they will rule on the correctness of that opinion.  All the facts and evidence will be available in the appeals procedure. It is against this background that the status of the commissioners' opinion must be measured and it must be obvious that the consequences of the making of an opinion are less than what might appear at first glance.</P>
    <P>Claims of uncertainty have been made against the section and there have been claims that it introduces uncertainty.  I should stress that other countries have taken action against tax avoidance either through the courts as in the case of countries like the United Kingdom and the United States or legislatively such as in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. On the Continent of Europe the doctrine of the abuse of right has been developed to counter tax avoidance.  There is no evidence that these countries suffer any business disadvantage by having laws aimed at tax avoidance.  Indeed, it could be said that, by diverting the attention of professional advisers away from tax planning and into more constructive and productive areas, the economies of these countries can only benefit.  Nobody would disagree with that.  Tax avoidance has become a major industry here.  If the amount of expertise and brain power put to work in tax avoidance were diverted to more productive projects, look at the results we could expect.  As for claims that some system of advance ruling helps the law to work in these countries, the truth is that such facilities are not as extensive as some commentators would <Col N="2119" /> have us believe.  There is reason to believe that the facilities are used very little.</P>
    <P>In relation to defining a tax avoidance transaction, the essence of a tax avoidance transaction is defined in subsection (2) of the Deputy's amendment as a transaction that was not undertaken primarily to give rise to a tax advantage. However, the definition of a tax avoidance transaction is subject to a new subsection (3) which contains certain exclusions which exempt transactions from being treated as tax avoidance transaction.  By virtue of these exclusions a transaction will not be a tax avoidance transaction if it appears to be either a bona fide undertaking or to have been arranged other than for the primary purpose of giving rise to a tax advantage. Because both exclusions are expressed as alternatives the implication of the Deputy's subsection (3) is that a transaction may be a bona fide undertaking and, at the same time, be arranged for the primary purpose of giving a tax advantage. This in effect, negatives the whole section.  While I appreciate that the Deputy's amendment may have been drafted in haste and that the scope of the exclusion from section 76 afforded by his proposals may not have been his intention, I must reject the words of the proposed amendment because they are vague and overly loose when read in context.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a fair number of the issues.  I take on board Deputy Noonan's suggestion in relation to looking at this again before next Tuesday but I remain to be convinced that a bona fide business person has anything to fear here.  When I studied this in 1976 I had fears, and certain aspects have been pointed out to me.  I am not in the business of introducing uncertainty into the business environment.  Up to now I am satisfied, although I remain open to persuasion, that there is nothing in the Deputy's amendment which is necessary.  I have a fair idea of the certainty the business environment needs.  It is the tax planners <Col N="2120" /> who have the problem.  The uncertainty is with them.  Up to now they were in a position in which they could sell this type of tax avoidance plan the other way because such plans were working but they are in a different position now and bona fide businesses have nothing to fear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's replies have been very lucid and clear but I do not believe the Minister's heart is in what he said.  Were the roles reversed the Minister would be working himself into a sweat over here on behalf of the people, opposing the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister referred to decisions of the High Court and so on.  If the Minister were on this side of the House he would be putting the opposite viewpoint forcibly on behalf of decent working people trying to earn a living who are being hit for six by a tax regime which is stifling growth.  I assure the Minister that there will be votes this morning on a regular basis on behalf of the people.  I notice that the Minister for the Environment is here, and he too, if our positions were reversed, would be encouraging the Minister and thumping his desk calling for fair play for the hard pressed workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla put his case very well on behalf of the working people.  I agree that the level of taxation is a deterrent to employment.  Employers are not taking on people because of it and there is no incentive for people to work. Recently I listened to Marian Finucane's afternoon programme during which she interviewed a widow who described how her husband had taken his own life due to harassment by the Revenue Commissioners. This man was in arrears in tax.  He had gone to the Revenue Commissioners to try to sort out his problems but he could not sort them out.  His family must carry on without him now.  I do not want to be unkind to the Revenue Commissioners as most of them are helpful but the system runs on statistics.  The system is computerised and it is an ever-growing process.  It reminds me of <i>The Grapes of Warth</i> by John Steinbeck, where the banks and the corporations <Col N="2121" /> take over and any poor devil who happens to get in the way is steamrolled out.</P>
    <P>We are putting on the Statute Book today strong and extensive powers.  There is a great danger in that and it worries me, especially when we hear about one individual dying because of the system in which he could not live.  That is only one we have heard of.  We have all heard of the Sheriff of Nottingham who had wide powers and could take all their property from people.  The Sheriff of Nottingham who was a rough tough man according to the history books would be put in the shade by some of the Revenue sheriffs here.  Deputy Mac Giolla may make the point that they were justified in doing what they did but I know for a fact that people have paid money to the Revenue Commissioners, because of fear and intimidation, money that was not owing in many cases.  People caught in the system were terrified that their hall door would be driven in with a sledge-hammer and what was inside taken out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not exaggerating. We have to have a balance.  Legislation can be too all embracing.  I feel there should have been ongoing consultation for a considerable period on the proposed powers of section 76 because once it is on the Statute Book, the Revenue Commissioners are able to interpret it to suit themselves and they have all the law enforcement agencies to back them up.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked about the growth of the tax avoidance industry.  Let him tell me what sums he is speaking about.  Are they in the region of £10 million or many more millions?</P>

The Deputy is as much a man of the world as I am.  Will he try to convince me &mdash; taking the rate of capital gains to be approximately one-third and no more &mdash; that £50 million to £60 million profitable transactions took place over the past 12 <Col N="2122" /> months?  I do not think he would believe that and neither do I.  That is only the figure in one area of tax avoidance.</P>

      <P>The McGrath case went to court and was decided upon by the Supreme Court, but the same type of scheme was being sold around the country at a commercial rate.  Everybody knew at what price you could buy a similar scheme.  Is Deputy Enright, or any sensible Deputy, going to stand up here and say that this House should do nothing about such a situation?  They had a Supreme Court decision to back them up and they could go around and get £30,000, £40,000, or £50,000 for the scheme.  I do not believe this House would accept we should do nothing about that.</P>
      <P>We had the choice of trying to plug one hole but perhaps opening ten others and the Deputy, as a lawyer, is suggesting that we make that choice.  If the Deputy considers the interests of the ordinary taxpayer, and if he were sitting where I am sitting, he would form the same impressions I have formed &mdash; that we should legislate in the interests of the common good and not alone bring in a general provision but plug all the other schemes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only three weeks ago we came across a scheme of selling reverse annuities in <Col N="2123" /> Molesworth Street.  Two guys who came into the country have set up a tax avoidance system.  They give you a capital sum and then sell you reverse annuities.  For every £50,000 worth of annuities they give you the money to buy, they would get £13,800 from the Exchequer and from the pockets of the taxpayers of this country.  We could not stand back and allow these measures to grow.  I have been in the Department of Finance a very short time, but I read the newspapers and watch the schemes that are being advertised and I am sure I do not catch them all, but I saw a few in recent times.</P>
    <P>It is a question of balancing the resources of the Revenue Commissioners to match this tax avoidance industry.  The Revenue Commissioners only find out long after the event.  They do not have the resources to match the brainpower of this industry.  We are trying to strike a balance between the rights of the taxpayer and the general interests of development while trying to give the Revenue Commissioners sufficient powers, subject to the appeal mechanisms we can build in, to arrest that situation.  The Revenue Commissioners are losing the battle every day of the week and we have a duty to strengthen their position.  However, it is a question of striking the right balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a number of points.  As regards the McGrath case, any measures taken to plug these loopholes are desirable, essential and necessary, and have my full support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever measures are necessary to counteract such schemes would have the support of all on this side of the House.  I am aware of the annuity scheme that the Minister referred to.  I think the Revenue Commissioners are able to zone in on those people relatively quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> On the question of capital gains tax, property values had remained reasonably static and there had not been much upward mobility for a period.  That would explain to some extent why there was not a major increase in the income from capital gains tax, but from here on in we should see a sizeable increase in capital gains tax.  I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners have a very good system of monitoring business transactions through the Valuation Office and the Adjudication Office, and all the information will be documented.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister referred to entering the unknown.  We have paid out high levels of grants to attract industry &mdash; although there may be differences of opinions whether this is desirable.  There is a danger in bringing in provisions of this nature that he will make it more difficult for people to come in and set up industry in Ireland.  I will give an example.  The Minister will remember the questions raised at the time of the takeover of Irish Distillers.  A noted gentleman in the financial world queried the tax liabilities that would fall due and he had to head out to north county Dublin to ascertain the exact tax liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to &ldquo;Dublin Castle North&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that that was a specific narrow liability, but in this instance we are speaking of a broad range of powers over a wide area that the Revenue Commissioners are being given.  This provision would lead to many difficulties for, on the one hand, someone setting up a business and on the other for advisers and accountants in the financial world.  Section 76 (5) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction becomes final and conclusive they may, notwithstanding any other provision of the Acts, make all such adjustments and do all such acts as are just and reasonable ... in order that the tax advantage resulting from a tax avoidance <Col N="2125" /> transaction shall be withdrawn from or denied to any person concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appeals procedure, an appeal will go to the Circuit Court and to the High Court on a point of law only.  I do not think it is right that it cannot go one stage further and be heard in the High Court or in the Supreme Court if necessary.  Let us be honest about it, in the Circuit Court one judge sits alone with no one to advise him.  There are Circuit Court judges who are experts in particular fields, for example, in criminal law, in family law, or on titles.  However, I cannot say that every Circuit Court judge is an expert in tax law.  This is a highly complex field.  While a judge may have a specific interest in this subject, we cannot be certain that every Circuit Court judge has the necessary expertise to make judgments on matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>A High Court judge sitting on his own can hear a point of law.  If someone takes a case to the Supreme Court, the case will be heard by five judges.  A person should have a constitutional right to have his case heard in the High Court or Supreme Court which is the final arbiter. Perhaps the Minister disagrees with me and I will listen to his reply with interest but I think it is a little bit unwise and dangerous to allow a case to go to the High Court on a point of law only.  I do not think it is right that the Revenue Commissioners should have a quasi-legislative function in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that I hope I am putting forward an objective viewpoint on this matter.  Like everybody else I am trying to pay my taxes upfront. I would like to ensure that the ordinary run of the mill taxpayer who works a five day week and pays his tax gets fair play. It is important that this should be the case.  The ordinary taxpayer who pays his bills to the Inspector of Taxes is hard pressed and it is our duty to make sure he gets fair play.  In giving extensive powers to the Revenue Commissioners we have to be careful that we do not go for the overkill.  The danger is that we could run into constitutional problems and provide a disincentive for those who <Col N="2126" /> are trying to set up businesses.  The Minister is a successful businessman who knows what I am talking about and there is a very real danger that we could go for the overkill.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis I ask the Minister to move slowly on this matter.  Those powers will still be on the Statute Book long after he and I have left this House. Once on the Statute Book it will be very hard to get them off it.  When it was proposed to introduce such powers in Canada, the consultation process went on for a number of years.  I am very glad that we are having a debate on this matter this morning but I do not think sufficient thought has gone into this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Enright has just said.  This process is a somewhat artificial one.  The Minister came up with this proposal and gave us less than a month to react to it. We have a very adversarial system.  It is almost like a criminal trial.  It is either guilty or not guilty; and the Minister's text either stands or it does not.  There is a confrontational aspect to the procedure we indulge in in this House.  I come in with my amendment and the Minister picks holes in it and he sticks by his own. I will say here in parenthesis that it struck me on thinking about the process, in response to those who claim that the real opposition in this country is provided by the Labour Party, that it is noteworthy that they have not opened their vociferous mouths on any issue.  I just say that as I am getting lonely over here.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with one or two of the points the Minister raised.  I believe in simple law, not complex law.  The Minister's subsection (3) which is supposed to tighten up a general provision &mdash; the text I suggest did not have the equivalent of subsection (3) &mdash; is a minefield in itself and is not the great safeguard the Minister suggests because, by implication, it would drive a court or a tribunal in another direction.  It is not a great safeguard and I do not think it is half what the Minister makes it out to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's amendments he has <Col N="2127" /> taken some significant steps to roll back from some of the criticism which was addressed to his section.  The chief step he has taken is to take out the references to the Revenue Commissioners being satisfied and he has substituted the Revenue Commissioners considering that X and Y is the case.  This is done on good legal grounds because referring back to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, bits of it were struck down when it became known that Ministers had to be satisfied about things and a different phraseology was inserted.  A less judicial wording was used to try to save the measure from being struck down.</P>
    <P>For reasons I will point out in a few moments, there is a residue of error stuck in this Bill and the Minister has not gone far enough in the concessions he has made.  The most significant change is on page 74, line 50 onwards.  The Minister is now proposing in amendment No. 58b that the grounds of the appeal should be changed.  It is no longer to be the case that the appeal tribunal will have to decide that there are no grounds or insufficient grounds for the Revenue to arrive at their view.  Instead, the appeal tribunal will have to arrive at the simple view that they were wrong.  That is a step in the right direction because it takes away from the opinion a good deal of the judicial or determination quality I argued it had on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with my proposal. I have put the Revenue Commissioners' initiating trip mechanism, which the Minister described as an opinion, in the form of a claim because that is what it is. An opinion does not start a case; a claim starts a case.  That may be described as a lawyer's point but in my view it amounts to a claim made by the Revenue Commissioners because this is a tax avoidance transaction and certain things should follow.  A person against whom the claim is made has a right, in the Minister's view and my proposal, to have that adjudicated on.  However, there are a number of features involved.  There is a large amount of verbiage separating what I have said from the Minister's position, <Col N="2128" /> which I find totally wrong.  &ldquo;Tax&rdquo; is defined as meaning interest or penalty. In other words, a wholly artificial transaction undertaken to avoid interest or a penalty can be a tax avoidance transaction and can be set aside.  It is an extraordinary proposition that people who do something very artificial to avoid a penalty and seem to comply with the law can be told that can be set aside because if they had not done that they would have been liable to a penalty and would have been penalised.</P>
    <P>A penal statute is being construed as meaning virtually nothing and everything in that a penalty is imposed in certain circumstances and somebody can look at it and say: &ldquo;Strictly speaking, on a very tight construction of that section if I do X, Y and Z, even though they are of very little significance or are totally artificial, I will not be liable for that penalty&rdquo;. Counsel will have to say to that person: &ldquo;Sorry, even if you think that on a narrow construction of that section you are out of the woods, you are wrong because what you did to avoid that penalty was a tax avoidance transaction and you are liable for that penalty&rdquo;.  That provision should not be included and I do not think it is necessary for the purposes of the section to have a tax definition including &ldquo;penalty&rdquo;.  It may be necessary to have &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in it although I am not clear about that.  One of the dangers in the drafting of this is that &ldquo;tax&rdquo; where it is used in the term &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; should not have the same wide definition as tax does for other purposes such as purposes of recovery.  In this provision it includes the idea of a penalty.</P>
    <P>It seems wrong in principle to say that a person who goes through an artificial transaction to avoid a penalty should also be told that that can be set aside and that the Revenue propose to penalise him notwithstanding whatever transaction he was involved in to avoid it.  That appears to be going very far in one direction and is, possibly, unconstitutional.  I do not think it is right to say to a person that, although what he or she has done is within the law, and appears to avoid a penalty being imposed, because it was done solely <Col N="2129" /> to avoid the penalty it will be set aside.  I am not attacking the principle of the section but I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider the meaning of &ldquo;tax&rdquo; where it appears in the term &ldquo;tax avoidance transaction&rdquo;, to exclude penalty and interest.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I go along with the proposition that a wholly artificial transaction designed to avoid tax should be set aside but then we come to the next huge hurdle which no Member has spoken about and about which there have been very few remarks in the newspapers or in the criticisms I have read.  It is one we were in danger of blithely ignoring but it represents a major problem in regard to the Bill.  Let us take, for example, the McGrath arrangement, and I cannot do them any harm because they have been mentioned already.  If the McGraths, as seems to be the case, indulged in a wholly artificial transaction of a multi-million pound kind which conferred on them an entirely artificial tax advantage and if Deputy Michael McDowell did the same thing with his millions and his system was set aside, what would be the consequences? That is where the Bill has a big flaw and it is something about which I have major misgivings.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners dream up the consequences of setting aside a transaction.  They may say to the McGrath family, or any Member who has been adjudged to have indulged in a tax avoidance transaction, that it is void, should be set aside and that now they were going to think what the consequences would have been if the person had not got involved in the transaction in terms of tax.  If I have a liability of one kind I may avoid it by one particular mechanism but has it occurred to the Revenue Commissioners that if I was told that that was a tax avoidance transaction the next thing I would do with my money would be something as tax efficient as possible?  I would think up some other way to save on tax.  I may be willing to pay thousands of pounds to accountants in the big seven accountant firms but certainly, I would do something pretty clever with my money to avoid tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> Therefore, the consequences of setting aside a transaction are that the Revenue can now dream up what one would have done with the money or how much tax the money would have avoided if one had not done a certain transaction and that seems to be totally wrong.  The Revenue can nullify the transaction, and the appeal tribunal may agree with them that they were right.  However, then we come to the second and bigger question which is: what would the person have done if that transaction had not been a tax avoidance transaction?  Would that person have invested all the money in Government gilts or in a business transaction scheme? We are left with a major assumption in the Bill that the Revenue Commissioners can think up the consequences of invalidating a tax avoidance transaction and can work out how much tax a person would be liable for under that transaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a system involving annuities, payments and gifts. There is significant public knowledge about to describe it as the Elgar investments scheme.  If that was put to me as a proposition, as indeed it was because they seem to think that every barrister has lots of money swilling round to put into schemes of that type, and I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; although I had the money, surely certain consequences follow for me because I am going to do something else with my money.  If I give Elgar investments my money and I receive an annuity from them, what will the Revenue decide are the tax consequences for me of dismantling that transaction?  What will they do?  Will they say: &ldquo;Let us go back to the day when you gave your money over to Elgar investments.&rdquo;</P>

I can well imagine that one could ask the company for the money back but how can the Revenue Commissioners decide what the consequences of an investment by me in Elgar investments the week before the Bill was published will be for me?  I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If one found somebody who ploughed money into those schemes and was told that was being set aside as a tax avoidance transaction, how does one work out what the consequences of that will be for that person?</P>
      <P>In this connection I should like to ask the Minister to read subsection (5) (a) and (b) of this section which, as Deputy Enright said, are interesting provisions. Section 76 (5) (a) is worth reading.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction becomes final and conclusive [that is, either because it is not challenged or if it goes on appeal they win] they may, notwithstanding any other provision of the Acts, make all such adjustments and do all such acts as are just and reasonable (in so far as those adjustments and acts have been specified or described in a notice of opinion given under subsection (6) and subject to the manner in which any appeal made under subsection (7) against any matter specified or described in the notice of opinion has been finally determined, including any adjustments and acts not so specified or described in the notice of opinion but which form part of a final determination of any appeal as aforesaid) [That suggests that the Appeal Commissioners can take up different consequences, which is to be welcomed] in order that the tax advantage resulting from a tax avoidance <Col N="2132" /> transaction shall be withdrawn from or denied to any person concerned.</P>
    <P>That is okay because they will say they are withdrawing any tax advantage a person has.  However, section 5 (b) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to, but without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a), the Revenue Commissioners may&mdash;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  allow or disallow, in whole or in part, any deduction or other amount which is relevant in computing tax payable ....</P>
    <P>(ii)  allocate or deny to any person any ... abatement, relief, allowance, exemption, income or other amount... or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This amazes me, it is taken directly from the Canadian text.</P>
    <P>(iii)  recharacterize for tax purposes the nature of any payment or other amount.</P>
    <P>I wonder how someone can recharacterise for tax purposes something which you have effectively struck down and choose, as you will, the character you wish for it.  That is a very extensive power and one which I do not think is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 76 (9) (a) determines what the Appeal Commissioners can do.  It says:</P>
    <P>On the hearing of an appeal made under subsection (7) the Appeal Commissioners shall have regard to all the matters to which the Revenue Commissioners may or are required to have regard under the provisions of this section and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) in relation to an appeal made on the grounds referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (7), they shall determine the appeal, in so far as it is made on those grounds, by ordering, if they, or a majority of them&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for the Revenue Commissioners to form the opinion that the transaction specified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> The Minister has now changed that to &ldquo;consider&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;or described in the notice of opinion, or any part of that transaction, is a tax avoidance transaction, that the opinion, or the opinion, in so far as it relates to that part, is to stand good ...</P>
    <P>That is what the Appeal Commissioners are required to do.  If they form the opinion that there are sufficient grounds for the Revenue Commissioners to consider something, is that co-terminous, with forming the opinion that the Revenue Commissioners are correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That section has been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I see what the Minister has done.  That improves the section so I will pass from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am left with what I consider to be two major objections.  I do not like the whole idea of opinions and the Minister should recharacterise them as claims because it is a claim and not an opinion &mdash; it is a claim made against somebody which they must contest.  However, irrespective of that &mdash; and perhaps it is just semantics and not so important &mdash; what is the process of determining the consequences of disallowing a tax avoidance transaction to a taxpayer?  That process is very open-ended and does not take account of the fact that if a person thought for one minute, before he invested in a large public company which offered him a transaction which turned out to be a tax avoidance transaction, that a transaction was suspect he would have done something else tax efficient with his money. What worries me is that the Revenue Commissioners may end up taking the worst possible scenario for a person's tax liability &mdash; it seems to me that they are obliged to do so, and they are certainly <Col N="2134" /> not given any power to think the best of what they might otherwise have done &mdash; rather than looking to what the person most likely would have done if he had not engaged in that particular transaction. If you are looking at a McGrath type transaction alone it is very easy to see that one can just deny a relief but there are some cases where denying a relief will not be the consequence: it will be different because the nature of the transaction will be one which will not simply be able to be set aside by denying a relief. It will be different in principle and the provisions in this section are not sufficient to deal with that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the onus being placed on the taxpayer, the Minister should look at my wording and attempt to put the onus on the taxpayer in a more coherent way.  He should not load the grounds of appeal against the taxpayer but simply say there are no loaded grounds of appeal and there is a simple onus on the taxpayer to show that the transaction is not an anti-avoidance transaction.  That would be a fairer way for the Minister to go about his business.  Instead of simply saying that the grounds shall be X, Y or Z and the appeal commissioners shall determine the appeal in certain ways it would be fairer to say that the appeal commissioners may determine the case as they wish, as appears just, or whatever but that the onus will be on the taxpayer to disprove that the transaction in question was a tax avoidance transaction.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on whether he considers it possible to remove the concept of penalties from the definition of tax for tax avoidance or perhaps include in line 23 of section 76(1) after the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;except where it appears in the phrase `tax avoidance transaction&rdquo;' so that at least there we do not say that somebody who has done something artificial to avoid a penalty can have the transaction set aside and the penalty imposed on them.  I think that is a constitutionally well grounded point.</P>
    <P>If, as I apprehend from looking at the Minister's amendments, it is now the Minister's case that the opinion of the <Col N="2135" /> Revenue Commissioners has no life of its own, apart from a trigger mechanism, and is on a theoretical basis at least interchangeable with my idea of the word &ldquo;claim&rdquo; and is merely just a starting mechanism &mdash; and that seems to be implicit in a number of the Minister's amendments &mdash; many of my worries about the constitutionality of what goes on in the Revenue Commissioners' minds would evaporate.  I should like the Minister to explain to me, for instance, why he is so adamant to cut down on the grounds of appeal in section 7.  He accuses me of being loose but why should somebody not open up every ground of appeal if he or she wants to do so?  I cannot understand why we have to say these are the only grounds on which you can knock down the Revenue Commissioners' starting opinion.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect, I contend the Minister's amendments change this section very dramatically.  The Minister now says an opinion is merely a starting mechanism.  Why then does he have to restrict the grounds of appeal from this opinion if it is only throwing in the ball, like the bishop at the All-Ireland, if it is merely getting the matter started?  Why does the Minister have to restrict the grounds of appeal so closely as is done there?  Why does he have to tell the Appeal Commissioners what conclusions they are to draw, as he does on page 75 of the Bill?  I should like to hear from the Minister why all of that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the restriction of grounds is that no transactions have actually taken place, so one is not appealing against transactions.  If transactions had already taken place, in those circumstances it would be different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might clear up a few points before getting into the meat of it.  Deputy Enright raised a question about a long consultative process that should have taken place.  I have been reading about it in the media, magazines and elsewhere and I am sure Members of this House have had plenty of representations about it because discussion of this has been <Col N="2136" /> going on for a month if not longer, in fact for much longer if one reverts to the time when the Supreme Court decision was given in the McGrath case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was more discussion between the Minister, Deputy Noonan and me on disabled drivers than there has been on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  I took on board very seriously some of the points raised by both Deputies on Second Stage.  I checked out certain safeguards and the changes effected are a response to the legitimate concerns of Members, and mine as well.</P>
      <P>At this stage I think it is a matter of semantics in relation to an opinion, or claiming an opinion because that is quite clearly what I see it to be.  The fact that we use the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; should suggest to Deputy McDowell or indeed to Deputy Enright &mdash; who raised it &mdash; and others that this huge power being vested in the Revenue Commissioners certainly is not quasi-judicial, or judicial in any shape or form.  If it were, we would not be using a word such as &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;.  If one were to give them a judicial function then certainly one would not say that they should form an opinion; one cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We went for all sorts of words.  I have to be guided by the Attorney General.  I knew what we wanted but at the end of the day I have to be guided by the Attorney General in relation to what are the most appropriate words to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the consultative process which Deputy Enright seems to suggest should go on for a couple of years, I should say that, at the rate tax avoidance schemes appear to have been mushrooming, I do not know for how long, but at the rate they have been mushrooming and being sold &mdash; ensuring that <Col N="2137" /> the Revenue Commissioners reap the minimum amount of tax from most transactions &mdash; then one appreciates that one is into big money.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, who is going to pick up the tab if there is to be a two-year consultative process about what Deputies consider to be the huge power vested in the Revenue Commissioners?  I do not consider it to be so at all because there is a safeguard all along the way.  When the Deputy spoke about no appeal on this or that, I have to say that is a contradiction of the reality.  The reality is that the McGrath case went the whole way to the Supreme Court.  The appeals mechanisms within the tax code do make such provision.  The McGrath case proves the contrary to Deputy Enright's suggestion.</P>
    <P>I might clarify the point raised by Deputy McDowell on the consequences aspect.  Consequences are only what are necessary to take away the artificial tax advantage, in a McGrath-type case, to deny any deduction for artificial losses. The McGrath case was based on the creation of artificial losses in one company, of artificial gains in another which are then washed through.  The consequences about which we are talking are also subject to appeal and review by the Revenue Commissioners and the courts as well.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by Deputy McDowell about the question of penalties and interest, which concern has been expressed elsewhere.  The Deputy suggested in his Second Stage remarks, that a general anti-avoidance section should not treat transactions undertaken solely to avoid interest or penalties as avoidance measures.  I welcome the opportunity to explain why I consider a comprehensive definition of tax, which includes charges related to tax, not only perfectly reasonable but very necessary.</P>
    <P>The application of the general anti-avoidance section to a scheme or arrangement could be summarised as follows: it identifies tax that ought to have been paid by the tax avoider, in the first instance, had he been getting on with his commercial or domestic business, paying his fair share of taxes and paying that fair <Col N="2138" /> share on time.  If he seeks to avoid making his appropriate contribution by artificial arrangements and the manipulation of tax law, the general anti-avoidance section will frustrate him in that objective. Section 76 will reinstate his liability to pay his fair share of taxes from the date on which it would have become due had he been getting on with his business in the normal way and paying his fair share of taxes on time.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that old habits die hard.  It must be recognised that avoidance will continue if there is any advantage in it.  There must be nothing to gain from tax avoidance if it is to become a thing of the past.  Therefore, I hope the House will agree that it would be wholly undesirable that section 76 should give the following message to taxpayers: go ahead with your scheme since, at worst, you will have had the use of, or investment income from, your unpaid taxes while you contest the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners through the appeals procedures.  That would be a wrong message to go out from this House.</P>
    <P>If we are to be seen to be on their side, to remain on their side, by all means let us protect the rights of citizens and individuals; by all means let us ensure that the appeals mechanism is sufficiently strong to restrain any over-concentration of power vested in the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore, the last thing we should do is give the message, silently or otherwise, that we are on their side in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;nothing to lose&rdquo; mentality which might exist among potential tax avoiders if interest or penalties were not to be charged by virtue of section 76 must be discouraged.  In addition, it is entirely proper that the Exchequer be reimbursed by tax avoiders for the servicing of the additional debt due to their reluctance to pay their fair share.  The State should not be out of pocket due to interest paid on borrowing in order that a minority can have a go at beating the system by manipulating the rules.</P>
    <P>I might mention specifically that Revenue penalties result from the supply of <Col N="2139" /> false or incomplete information and other serious offences connected with evasion of tax liabilities.  The majority of taxpayers, whether or not they have a choice in the matter, recognise the need to pay their fair share and do so willingly.  The way for anyone to avoid penalties is to pay his or her fair share of taxes when it becomes due.  There can be no question of allowing evaders, who wilfully expose themselves to penalties, to wriggle out of them by manipulating the law.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the majority of compliant taxpayers would not wish evaders legally to be entitled to walk away from penalties which they have brought on themselves. In fact, it is difficult to envisage how evaders could concoct schemes to avoid penalties alone.  However, I am happy that, in that unlikely event, section 76 will not be found wanting for the absence of any reference to interest or penalties.</P>
    <P>I think that clears up any of the other points to which I had not referred and should give the House a fair insight into where we are going.</P>

That is not at issue at all.</P>

Up to now, once the gap was discovered through which the tax avoiders were marching, the Minister of the day came back as quickly as possible and closed the gap.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 76 is not intended to catch the McGrath case and its clones because that is being done specifically in section 77.  He goes on to the investment scam and a third case in section 79 with the result that the three are being taken specifically.  That is the way one would have proceeded.  The Administration was quite tardy in moving on the McGrath case as the decision was made in July of last year.  The Supreme Court put the ball firmly back into this court &mdash; I do not intend to double pun &mdash; and advised the House of its responsibility in this respect.  Either the Minister or his predecessor should have moved in the first days of the autumn session.  I raised the issue one morning on the Order of Business and I asked if it was the intention to introduce legislation to close the particular loophole which was exploited in the McGrath case.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was looked at in wonderment by at least three-quarters of the Cabinet who obviously did not have a clue as to what I was talking about.  It seems to me that no consideration was given to this matter.  A sum of £75 million of tax was foregone as a result of the McGrath case specifically but, more important, all the clones that followed it have been bandied about and I do not think people were very far from the truth.  In excess of £70 million was foregone as a result of this.  That gap should have been closed at the first available opportunity which was around the middle of October.  We should not have waited until today to close it.  There is no reluctance on our part to move.</P>
      <P>The way in which we are moving now in the catch-all section goes beyond the traditional practice of closing the loopholes as they arise, as the Minister is doing in sections 77, 78 and 79.  We now have a catch-all situation.  The mechanism in the catch-all situation is triggered, as the Minister said, by the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; and the Minister claims this is merely an opinion &mdash; so that the case can be adjudicated. I would think that the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; was chosen very carefully on the advice of the Attorney General but it is not merely an opinion in the normal accepted sense of the word.  There is an element of adjudication in it.  One does not appeal against opinions.  If I have an opinion and Deputy McDowell has a different opinion one of us might be right and the other might be wrong but he does not appeal against my opinion and I do not appeal against his.  We may take both our opinions before a particular forum to decide who is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The concept of appealing against an opinion is quite novel.  When you see two appeals against an opinion you begin to wonder <Col N="2142" /> about the nature of the opinion.  Of course, the opinion in effect is the preliminary adjudication by the Revenue Commissioners which says that, because such an such a transaction, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is primarily done for the purpose of avoiding tax, it is more than an opinion; it is more than a claim; it is an adjudication.  The mechanism is in the Bill to appeal against that adjudication.  I am concerned about the manner in which that will proceed.</P>
      <P>In the early stages opinions of the Revenue Commissioners will be appealed with great frequency and they will go to the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court judges are a very worthy body of men. There is much expertise in the Circuit Court.  The judges of the Circuit Court have to deal with different areas of law and they are not specialists.  There are some specialists practising as Circuit Court judges, as Deputy Enright pointed out, but their function is not that of specialists.  I do not know whether there are many Circuit Court judges who are specialists in tax law.  I am of the view that if there are, they are few in number.</P>
      <P>What will happen is that we will have emerging quickly judicial decisions on which everything else will hang.  If the judicial decisions in the early stages go largely in favour of the Revenue Commissioners, we will have a list of black cases and white cases and people will know where they stand.  The only thing about the black cases is that they will be caught under section 76 and, if the Minister does not like the white cases, he can come back with other sections similar to sections 77, 78 and 79 to take them out subsequently.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will have a court where if you lose you lose, and if you win you can lose as well. Nothing in the decision of the Circuit Court finding in favour of a taxpayer that <Col N="2143" /> the transaction in which he was involved was a legitimate business transaction will prevent the Minister from coming in subsequently, as he has done in sections 77, 78 and 79, and closing the loophole if the tax foregone is large enough to justify it.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows exactly what I am saying.  When the appeal goes to the Circuit Court, decisions will be made and people will lose out.  Those transactions will then be black-listed and nobody else will be advised to get involved in those transactions again.  Even in circumstances where the Revenue Commissioners are making a very strong case that this is a tax avoidance transaction and the Circuit Court judge finds against the Revenue, the Revenue will be in a position to advise the Minister in the following Finance Bill to close that gap. There is nothing in section 76 which suggests that a decision of the Circuit Court will tie the hands of the Minister from proceeding, as he is proceeding today, in sections 77, 78 and 79.  Certainly, it is a double-barrelled shot-gun and it is far reaching.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the procedures available to test everything right up to the Supreme Court.  He referred to the McGrath case and said they had their day in court and the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, found in their favour.  Here the appeal mechanism stops with the Circuit Court.  One can go beyond that point on a point of law only. That is restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the difference he sees between an opinion and an adjudication.  If it is merely an opinion, why are the grounds of appeal restricted in subsections (7) and (8)?  In relation to subsection (13) what is the element of retrospection?  It applies as respects any transaction is undertaken or arranged on or after 25 January 1989 and as respects any transaction undertaken or arranged wholly before that date in so far as it gives rise to an advantage subsequent to that date.  Can the Minister explain how he sees the retrospective element working here and what his advice <Col N="2144" /> is on the constitutionality of retrospective legislation in this respect?</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to comment again on the difficulties he sees in enshrining in statute the right to advance rulings in respect of section 76 type cases, not a general statutory right to advance rulings across the tax code but in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, something is for tax avoidance purposes.  In cases where, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, something is for tax avoidance purposes, where is the difficulty with advance ruling there?  It seems that, in the early stages anyway, the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners will be challenged in the Circuit Court, so all the administrative work will have to be done at that point.  There is no point in making a contribution when there is a private conversation going on on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I know what the Deputy is concerned about, advance ruling.  In case he thinks that we do not listen to him when our heads are sideways, we do. As regards advance rulings, I was trying to clarify a few points in my own mind.  I do not purport to have all the answers. The Deputy talks about constitutionality. All I can give him is the advice that I got on the constitutionality of section 76, that it is all right &mdash; no more than that.  That is what the law officer, the Attorney General, is there for, to advise the Government and give his best opinions in relation to constitutionality.  I do not say that that is the position.  Deputy McDowell has an opinion that it may be challenged and successfully challenged in the High Court, parts of it anyway.  There are varying opinions around.  Most people would <Col N="2145" /> say that it will not be knocked down; some will say that at worst there might be a slight section of it knocked down.  I can give the Deputy no more than that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not what I asked.  In so far as subsection (13) is concerned, how far does the Minister see that as being retrospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a clear decision on retrospection in this regard in so far as it is possible to do so.  Take the 1977 McGrath case.  Budget day is traditionally when you announce in the budget that you propose to take certain measures.  That is the date traditionally, as far back as one can go.  If that is not taken, then it is the date of the publication of the Finance Bill.  In the McGrath-type case, relating it to the budget, if somebody has created artificial losses in advance of budget day and in the future intends to create profits in a small sum or large sum, £5 million or £10 million, and to wash these in over the next three, five or ten years, those are out, as far as that transaction is concerned, despite the fact that profits were in place in advance of budget day.  In other situations we try to hold section 76 as close to that as possible.  That is not 100 per cent tight.  There may be situations where cases will have to be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the advance rulings. We are coming near breaktime and I want to get more information for resumption of the debate after lunchtime.  It has been suggested that the anti-avoidance provisions will introduce uncertainty into business transactions and that the Revenue Commissioners should provide an advance ruling service.  I touched on this topic very briefly in my opening speech on Second Stage.  As I said then, the anti-avoidance provisions are aimed at transactions which set out purely and simply to avoid tax.  It is neither necessary nor practicable for businessmen to seek advance rulings before engaging in genuine business activities.  It is not necessary for persons availing of tax relief in a bona fide manner to seek advance <Col N="2146" /> rulings.  Subsection (3) (d) makes that quite clear.</P>
    <P>Within the definition of tax avoidance transactions set out in subsection (2) there is no need for anybody carrying out a business transaction which is not primarily for tax avoidance purposes to seek an advance ruling.  In relation to incentive relief such as 10 per cent corporation tax in the International Financial Services Centre or under the business expansion scheme, the Revenue Commissioners already provide an advance opinion service to reassure investors that they qualify for relief.  In relation to transactions already completed, the Revenue Commissioners endeavour to provide guidance on how they should be returned for tax purposes.  Failing this, the self-assessment rules introduced last year provide a simple mechanism for enabling taxpayers to deal with matters of doubt on the basis of their own opinions as to their tax status and to bring the matters to the attention of the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    <P>In view of the existence of this extensive body of safeguards, it must be asked why and in what area the requested advance ruling procedures are needed.  I feel that their main area of use may be in relation to transactions which involve a large amount of tax planning.  Tax planners obtain large fees for their services and it is important that State agencies do not find themselves doing the tax planners' work for them.</P>
    <P>If, under an advance ruling procedure, the Revenue Commissioners were to say that a proposed transaction amounted to tax avoidance, it is possible that they would be asked further questions about different variations until a favourable response was obtained.  I understand that in Canada the tax authorities charge for their advance ruling services.  However, that approach has its own problems and difficulties and is not a step to be taken lightly.  As I mentioned in my opening speech on Second Stage, it is most important that Revenue officials do not find themselves having to respond to hypothetical or artificial propositions which are aimed at constructing safe tax avoidance schemes.  No tax jurisdiction of <Col N="2147" /> which I am aware imposes such an obligation on its officials.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners, within the limits of their resources and in the context of the development of the self-assessment procedures, will continue to provide and expand upon the assistance that they give to business and other genuine interests where the names of the taxpayers and all the facts are disclosed to them.  It is not reasonable to expect, however, that a general tax advice service will be made available to tax planners.  They should be prepared to stand over their own advice for which, as I have said, they are well paid.  I assure the House that this is an area which I shall keep under review. Within the caveats to which I referred about tax planners and hypothetical questions, it would be my intention to ensure that there is no impediment in the section to the conduct of genuine business activity.  Those were the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Noonan and I am more and more convinced, the more I think about what the Minister is proposing today, that this is one form of section which is turning slowly during the course of this debate into another form of section and that the Minister's amendments have in fact tidied it up and changed its character fairly substantially.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, it is very strange to find people appealing opinions.  It is even more strange to find that opinions become final and conclusive in the ordinary cannot be conclusive in the ordinary sense of the English language.  It means that the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; is being used to describe some other transaction.  This section as originally planned or mapped out, before the word processors got going at it and the Attorney General got out his red pen, was one which provided for, to use Deputy Noonan's phrase, a process of primary adjudication by the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; the Deputy may have used the phrase &ldquo;primary determination&rdquo;. That is what is actually happening. We now see a process which was <Col N="2148" /> built on that kind of foundation being changed as the building process goes on into a different kind of process.  I refer to subparagraph (b) on page 71.  Let us deal with the first part of that subparagraph which says that in subsections (2) and (3), &ldquo;for the purposes of the hearing of an appeal under subsection (7), the reference to the Revenue Commissioners, shall, subject to any necessary modifications, be construed as references to the Appeal Commissioners&rdquo;.  In other words, in subsections (2) and (3) the reference to the Revenue Commissioners will be construed as a reference to the Appeal Commissioners for the hearing of an appeal under section 7.  I should like the Minister to explain if that was not an effort at primary determination and, if it is not the telltale sign of a primary determination being taken out of the section, what is actually means.  In subsection (2) for instance, where would the reference to the Revenue Commissioners be regarded as a reference to the Appeal Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the question the Deputy is asking.  He is asking if changes were made in section 76.  I think I have made it abundantly clear here from the very start that there were certain aspects of it I was not satisfied with and we brought our own amendments into it. Naturally, that is part of the reconstruction the Deputy is talking about.  I never tried to say otherwise.  All we want to do here is try to make sure we strengthen the rights of the individual against the power that is being invested in the Revenue Commissioners.  I have never denied anything like that and do not deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to score points off the Minister or to drive a wedge between him and his advisers.  It now appears that the Revenue Commissioners when they drafted this &mdash; or whoever drafted this section to bring before the House &mdash; originally intended that a primary determination would be done by the Revenue Commissioners, and the Attorney General's staff came along with their red biros and said that could not be done, and have here and there with legal Elastoplast tried to stop this thing from bleeding to death.  Now we have a very badly drafted section because it still bears all the hallmarks and paraphernalia of a section designed to do one job and being slowly reconstructed to do a second job.  If you do not want to call it legal Elastoplast it is legal &ldquo;Isopon&rdquo;.  The whole thing is very rickety and does not stand together as one coherent piece.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  There are a few organs hanging around this body which appear to have no function left.  It would be better to go back to what Deputy Enright said at the end of his contribution: that there should have been from the ground up, construction of a section which was a coherent whole, built on an organic basis, on good foundations.  That is what is wrong with this measure.  I do not know whether the High Court or the Supreme Court ever have regard to happenings in this House in order to find out what happened, but I feel that if they take a look at the record of this House they will realise that the history of this section was that it was transformed from unconstitutionality to as close as possible to its original form but conforming with the Constitution.  That will weaken it if it is brought before a court because the court will see it may not have achieved all it set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I thought it would be better to start from a plain level site and provide, if the Revenue Commissioners claim it is a tax avoidence transaction and someone disputes it, that it is adjudicated on.  If the Revenue Commissioners claim it and someone does not dispute it their claim is deemed to be admitted.  That will get over all this hassle about opinions, grounds of appeal, narrowing down the grounds of appeal, forcing the appeal commissioners to arrive at particular decisions, telling them what they have to have regard to and trying to prevent them from getting off the tracks.  That is what I find mystifying about this Bill.  You have two or three Appeal Commissioners and Circuit Court judges.  They know their business.  They know what the issues laid before them are.  They do not have to be told how they approach something or how they are to conduct their appeal or what they are to have regard to in determining what is or is not a tax avoidance transaction.  The only circumstance in which it would have made sense to tell them how to approach the whole issue <Col N="2152" /> was a primary adjudication which you wanted to copperfasten and make as appeal proof as possible.  That is why I have my misgivings about this section.</P>

      <P>As Deputy McDowell said, we would all love to live in the ideal world and make everything simple, but when you leave it simple all the big industrial tax planners out there get at it and bore 40 holes through it.  Look at where section 84 developed from as an example. It did not start out where it is today.  This is what happens no matter how you look at it.  I heard references to why I went for the cases of the tax avoidance mechanisms I knew about and why I went for the general as well.</P>

      <P>Others might not think it is right to go for both.  I believe I am right.  There is a job of work there to be done and either we do it or do not.  The problem about Deputy Enright's suggestion is that the consultative process he suggested would be a year or two years down the line.  I hate to think what sort of money would be gone out of the Exchequer if we gave them two years' notice of what we might do in relation to tax avoidance.  I have no intention of doing that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in conjunction with the Medical Council, he will ensure that full registration will be made available to a limited <Col N="2153" /> number of foreign doctors under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978; if there are a number of naturalised qualified Irish doctors having completed their five years training here who currently have no income because of the current lack of full registration facilities; the proposals he has in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated recently in response to a question in this House in respect of the recognition of qualifications acquired by an EC national outside the Community, the recognition in Ireland of medical qualifications acquired in a third country is a matter for the Medical Council pursuant to the Medical practitioners Act, 1978.  The Medical Council is an independent statutory body established under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, for the purposes of establishing and maintaining a general register of medical practitioners.  Registration can only be granted by the Medical Council in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the council is obliged to ensure that only suitable qualified persons are registered.</P>
      <P>The doctors to whom the Deputy refers probably obtained their primary qualification in a non-European Community country and obtained temporary registration with the Medical Council in accordance with the terms of section 29 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The purpose of granting temporary registration to foreign doctors, particularly those from Third World countries, is to enable them to gain experience in Irish hospitals which they can apply when they return to their own countries.  Under the provisions of the Act, temporary registration may only be allowed for an aggregate of periods totalling five years.  This period may not be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are a number of doctors in this country whose temporary registration has expired.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act to be eligible for full registration a person must (a) be a national of a member state of the European Community and have been <Col N="2154" /> awarded a qualification in medicine by a competent body or authority designated for that purpose by a member state, pursuant to any directive adopted by the Council of the European Communities or (b) satisfied the council that he has undergone such course of training and passed such examinations as are specified for the purposes of section 27(2)(d) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be glad to hear that in accordance with the provisions of that Act, the Medical Council has now adopted rules establishing a procedure which allows for the registration of a national of any member state who holds qualifications conferred by a third country, subject to individual assessment and compliance with the rules laid down. Any doctor who is a naturalised Irish citizen who wishes to obtain full registration in accordance with the provisions of section 27(2)(d) should contact the Medical Council.  I regret that I have no function in relation to the granting of registration to individual applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are some 30 doctors who have married Irish women and become naturalised Irish citizens but are destitute because they have no income when the five years have been completed?  When will they be allowed full registration under these new regulations laid down by the Medical Council?</P>

There are 366 persons at present awaiting this type of surgery.  I am satisfied that emergency cases always receive priority treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions are all related to the affairs of the Southern Health Board in one specific week.  Let me first of all put the record straight in relation to the management changes.  The changes made in the management structures in the Southern Health Board on Friday, 28 April 1989 were made by the chief executive officer in accordance with the Health Act.  This is what transpired.</P>
      <P>A letter issued by the Southern Health Board management on 24 April 1989 indicating that it was most likely that salary payments would be postponed for periods commencing with the first batch of payments due at the end of April 1989. Concern was expressed in Government at the implications of the issue of that letter for the Government's policy on the public finances and indeed on the stability of the system generally.  I asked the secretary of my Department and two assistant secretaries with responsibility for financial and personnel matters to meet with the chief executive officer of the health board and to advise him of the Government's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CEO who had returned to Ireland from annual leave early on the morning of 28 April met with those officers of my Department in Cork Airport on that day. The CEO who is ill, and in fact has been for some time, indicated on being contacted that he would not be resuming duty as he had planned.  He would be appointing a deputy and consulting with the chairman of the board as he is required to do under the Health Act, 1970, he appointed Mr. Seán Hurley, programme manager, as deputy chief executive officer as from 28 April 1989. I should make the point that Mr. Walsh's <Col N="2160" /> period as Deputy CEO ended with the return of the CEO.</P>
    <P>In relation to the letter issued by the personnel officer of the Southern Health Board on 24 April I should make it clear that on being contacted, when I became aware of the issue of the letter, the Southern Health Board's finance officer indicated that the immediate financial situation did not require the postponement of the April salary payments.</P>
    <P>I must repeat what I said in this House on the Adjournment debate of 25 April that the main culpability for what has transpired in the Southern Health Board rests with the board members who, unlike other boards, did not either adopt or propose viable alternatives to the course of action proposed to them by management to live within allocation.  The fact that this happened and that management did not then submit a cash profile linked to an alternative realistic expenditure profile within budget contributed also to the board's short-term cash difficulties.</P>
    <P>This was the subject of discussions with the then deputy chief executive officer and the finance officer on 18 April and arrangements were made for a senior officer of the Department to visit Cork on 27 ultimo to meet and discuss the requirements of that revised expenditure strategy.  It was incidentally at that meeting that the need for a timing adjustment of £1.55 million in the original cash profile was identified and not at the meeting of the 28 April as inferred by Deputy Wyse's question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board, Mr. Seán Hurley, in consultation as appropriate with departmental officers is undertaking a comprehensive review of the implications of the Southern Health Board revenue allocation for health services in the area and when this review is completed he will be reporting his proposals for living within that allocation to the board.  I will at this stage make only one further comment until that report has been received and considered and that is I have guaranteed, as has the deputy CEO, that the salaries of staff employed <Col N="2161" /> by the board will be met as they are due and on time to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>There is no money available from which additional resource can be made available to the Southern Health Board. The resource made available to me was distributed in an equitable way to all agencies.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputies' questions relate to the travelling arrangements for the meeting of 28 April 1989, circumstances combined to make travel by air the most suitable way of travel.  There were no seats on the Cork commercial flight leaving Dublin Airport in mid-afternoon and so, with the approval of the Minister for Defence, a flight in the Beechcraft was arranged under the ministerial transport arrangements to fly the officers concerned to Cork.  They returned to Dublin on an evening Aer Lingus commercial flight.  The cost of the Army flight was £85.  The aircraft was not diverted from other duties.  Furthermore, there were particular circumstances of urgency in the situation, involving the illness of the CEO and the fact that there was a meeting of the Southern Health Board scheduled for Monday, 30 April.  That meeting would have taken place in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty had the meeting between my officials and the chief executive officer not taken place.</P>
    <P>The question of holding a local inquiry under section 12 of the Health Act, 1970, raised by Deputy Quill would arise only if I contemplated removing the Southern Health Board from office.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Spring's question is concerned, it is my practice to meet with the chairpersons and managements of boards as circumstances require and I will meet with the chairman and management when the deputy CEO's review is completed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Southern Health Board's allocation for 1989 of £132.65 million is sufficient to ensure the delivery of essential health services and I appeal to the members of the board to co-operate fully with management in ensuring the effective delivery of essential health services in the area of their responsibility.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that it was on his instructions and on the instructions of his officials that the CEO of the Southern Health Board, Mr. Dudley, was recalled to Ireland and asked to discharge Mr. Walsh from his duties?  Will the Minister confirm that the Southern Health Board notified his Department of the situation in relation to the cashflow in the Department and, effectively, the contents of the letter before it was issued and, irrespective of whether they notified them about the issuing of the letter, that information was made known to the Department? Because of both of those facts would the Minister not now agree that he has made Mr. Walsh the scapegoat for his own mismanagement in this whole affair?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will put down a question, I shall be only too delighted to answer it.  The substance of the letter was known to officials in my Department before the letter was issued. The acting CEO was in my Department on 18 April and it was agreed that the letter would not be sent out.  As a result of that I presume the letter should have been withdrawn because there was sufficient funding available to ensure that the salaries would be paid at the end of April.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister now acknowledge that the only way the salaries could be safeguarded this year, the <Col N="2163" /> only way the cash crisis could have been averted, was by the decision that was ultimately taken to give the extra £1.5 million within the context of the weekly cashflow allocations from the Department to the health boards?  In view of that will the Minister not now clearly acknowledge that he blamed Mr. Walsh for circumstances of which he was more a victim than the culprit?</P>

    <P>To come back to the important point raised by Deputy Yates, the money was there to pay the staff of the health board and the £1.5 million was not necessary to pay them at the end of April.  The Southern Health Board were asked to send up to my Department a cash profile for the whole year.  That did not come until the Thursday in April when the official of my Department was in Cork <Col N="2164" /> and that is part of the reason they had a problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the British Government have decided to ban the use in food of mineral oils; if such oils are used in Ireland in the making of bread, confectionery, jellies, sausages and some cheeses; if his attention has further been drawn to evidence that these oils accumulated in the liver and the organs of animals are potentially dangerous; and the action he proposes to take in this matter in so far as the Irish market is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the British Government are considering proposals to further limit the use of mineral oils in food.  The new proposals would not, in any event, constitute a total ban on their use in Britain.  In this country the use of mineral oils in foods is prohibited by the Health (Mineral Hydrocarbons in Food) Regulations, 1972, except in certain circumstances and subject to very strict conditions including maximum permitted levels of usage.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the use of mineral hydrocarbons in food is currently being considered by the EC and we will be participating directly in this review. The Department of Health are monitoring the situation closely in the meantime and if a further restriction on the use of mineral oils is considered to be warranted, I will have no hesitation in introducing such controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of people who have been sent abroad for medical treatment in each of the past two years; and the reason and cost involved in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987 the total number of cases referred abroad in accordance with the agreed criteria for such referrals was 102 at a total cost of £505,797.  In 1988 the number of cases referred abroad was 114 and the total cost was £668,170.  I should point out that the costs quoted in many cases are estimated as the final bills have not yet been received.</P>
      <P>The information on the individual cases is set out in tabular form which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  If there is any particular aspect of this matter on which the Deputy requires information I will be glad to supply it to him.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister if people are still being sent abroad for bone marrow transplants and, if so, when will he open the new hospital facilities at St. James's Hospital so that these transplants can be carried out in this country?  We have the staff but we do not have the facilities because the Minister is leaving the hospital lying idle.  When is the Minister <Col N="2178" /> going to open the £130 million worth of hospitals that have been lying idle in this country for up to two years, so that people will not have to be sent abroad?</P>

      <P>A small number of patients have been transferred for bone marrow transplant.  Work on St. James's Hospital is on target.  The hospital must be fully and properly equipped before it is opened.  Last year I provided £10 million for X-ray equipment alone and this year I have provided funding to ensure that the hospital is fully equipped.</P>
      <P>On the question of bone marrow transplants in children, I am glad to say agreement has been reached between myself and my colleague, Richard Needham, the Minister in Belfast so that in future, total body irradiation of many children will be carried out in Belfast rather than having to send them to Glasgow as is the case at present.</P>

Is the Minister aware also that the unit has been lying idle for the past two years, like the Berkeley Court, that it is the second busiest hospital in the Western Health Board region and that it is one of the busiest for its size in the British Isles?  Can the Minister give a guarantee on behalf of the people there that it will actually open in October this year and that the Minister will make available money requested by the health board?</P>

    <P>A total of 24,823 persons have been <Col N="2182" /> tested for the virus and, of this, 814 have tested positive.</P>
    <P>In relation to a projection of the number of cases and deaths over the next ten years, all the indications are that Ireland is heading into an epidemic with a projected doubling of cases of full-blown AIDS every nine months, which is likely to last for the next four to eight years. This growth of cases in Ireland is accepted by the WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS in Paris and it assumes very little impact of intervention programmes such as the Outreach programme or public information-education campaigns. Assuming this rate of growth, by 1995 there could be as many as 12,240 cases but it would not be appropriate to extrapolate beyond that.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in combating the disease and assisting sufferers since the Government's AIDS strategy commenced in 1984.  The strategy has been developed in line with national and international requirements and recommendations and compares very favourably with strategies adopted in other countries.</P>

      <P>The AZT injection prolongs life for AIDS sufferers and it is available.  The major research in which we are involved relates to AIDS in children and infants.  As the Deputy is aware, we have a very high number of children with AIDS, 53 of them throughout the country.  We are involved in research at European level.  Recently a grant of £30,000 was made by my Department to the AIDS fund to further that research.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that in the near future he will introduce a national AIDS plan?  To date the Minister has <Col N="2183" /> referred to the committee that has been sitting.  When will their report on AIDS services be published?  Will the Minister specifically include in that report the caring as well as the medical aspects and welfare allowances for such things as mobility, heating, electricity costs and so on?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister changed his mind on the need to promote the use of condoms and to have a needle exchange programme, as essential measures, as the national AIDS co-ordinator said, in the fight against the spread of AIDS?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not changed my mind.  As stated in this House on previous occasions, my view of the needle exchange and condom programme is that it needs to be very carefully monitored. In the Outreach programme established by the EHB, where a counsellor believes that it is in the interests of a particular intravenous drug abuser to have needles supplied, they will be supplied, but the idea of having needles or condoms freely available all over the place is not a satisfactory way to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply and the alarming real and projected increase in AIDS sufferers and arising from the disappointment which is shared across the House that the report which the Minister of State promised for <Col N="2184" /> last week is still unavailable to the Minister, can the Minister acknowledge that there is an epidemic and that it should be treated as such.  Will the Minister revamp and restart the media education campaign? What plans has the Minister to improve immediately the facilities in St. James's Hospital which were described a few weeks ago as totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>On the question of the mass-media campaign, we are looking at that again.  After the last mass-media campaign an evaluation was carried out and it was found that the vast majority of people in the country know how one gets AIDS and how to avoid it.  Our particular problem is that many AIDS victims are intravenous abusers and a mass-media programme would not have any real impact on them.  What is necessary is one to one counselling.  Because of that we have allocated funds from the lottery to a number of organisations including £150,000 to the Eastern Health Board to establish the Outreach programme so that one to one counselling can be developed in order to do something worth while for drug abusers generally, including AIDS sufferers.  With regard to St. James's Hospital, at the moment we are preparing a plan on AIDS.  St. James's Hospital has one major specialist unit for the treatment of AIDS. However, the present approach, with which I agree, is that persons suffering from AIDS should be treated in a general hospital by a number of specialists depending on the physical symptoms. AIDS sufferers may have a different number of illnesses, it may be something in their lungs, it may be neurological or Kaprosi Sarcoma.  There are many aspects to AIDS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that in line with what is <Col N="2185" /> happening elsewhere, the numbers suffering from AIDS will double every nine months.  Can the Minister say, therefore, that the media campaign was a success? In view of the fact that drug abusers and homosexuals make up the largest proportion of those suffering from the disease, should a more specific campaign have been run?  I realise that the Eastern Health Board are running a scheme which attempts to do that but it is the long term.  Does there not need to be a more specific approach to deal with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asks whether I can seriously say that the public information campaign was a success.  I can, because in the evaluation that was carried out a high percentage of the people knew how one contracted AIDS. On the question of the number of cases doubling, I said in my reply that this was likely to happen over the next four to eight years.  The reason is that the persons who are presenting with AIDS at present would have contracted the disease about eight years ago because the incubation period is anything up to eight years. Therefore, people who contracted the disease at that time are now presenting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information.  In view of the fact that there are 60 children who have been diagnosed as autistic and that there is no specialist unit, good bad or indifferent, to deal with this very specialised area, is it not long overdue that the necessary finance be made available to end the trauma and to provide adequate services for this very special area of illness?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the Western Health Board have no facilities in place, in fact the Brothers of Charity provide a service for some of the children and the Western Care Association also provide a service for children in County Mayo.  On a number of occasions in this House we have dealt with the question of a specific service for autistic children and as to whether they should be seen as separate from mental handicap or not.  In the Eastern Health Board area a small group which includes parents has been formed to try to develop the services in their area.  We will then do an evaluation to see what is the best way to proceed. Where the numbers are small I am not sure that the correct way to go is to have a specific service for autistic children.  If the children had to be in residential care, many parents would like to have them near home where they can go and visit them.  The issue is under continuous <Col N="2187" /> review not alone in this country but in other countries as well.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the proposals he has to ensure that an adequate number of vocational training places in general practice is made available in this country; if he will increase the number of places from the current level of 28 to the required number of 70 places per year; and, if so, when.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently 29 places available annually in vocational training schemes for general practice.  Each scheme involves training over a three year period, two years of which are spent in appropriate hospital posts and the third year in a training practice.  The cost of salaries and overheads, other than in respect of hospital posts which would arise in any event, are met by the relevant health board.  Each scheme is managed by a training committee representative of the various interests involved, while the Irish College of General Practitioners supervises the academic content of training. Information is not available as to the net number of applicants for places on training schemes.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with the Irish College of General Practitioners on the question of expanding the provision of training places.  While the college argue that a provision of 70 places annually is desirable, it is accepted that increases in provision must be phased and that a number of important issues about the future, structure and organisation of vocational training need to be resolved. For that reason, I have arranged to convene a special workshop within the next month involving all of the interests involved to examine the issues raised by the question of expansion of the number of available places.  I am sure that this will provide an opportunity for all of the relevant issues to be explored and I hope to be in a position to make decisions about the future of vocational training when I have had a chance to consider the outcome of that workshop.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that we do not need to commence <Col N="2192" /> another consultative process in order to find out what is needed?  What is required is 70 places per annum.  Is the Minister not aware that many of our potential GPs are having to go to Britain for training and in some cases the circumstances surrounding their training are less than satisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are doctors from this country working in Britain while others are studying for general practice.  I do not accept that we should not hold a one day meeting with all of the various interests involved because there are many factors to be considered. I have met on a number of occasions with representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners and they seem to be very pleased that we are holding this workshop involving all of the other interests, including the health boards.  I hope progress will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons employed in the home help scheme by the Southern Health Board are not paid at an hourly rate.  The question of payment to home helps was considered by a committee of the Southern Health Board established in 1986 to examine services for the elderly in the North Lee-South Lee community care areas.  The report which was adopted by the board recommended <i>inter alia</i> that, because the work element is related to the circumstances of the individual case, is unsupervised and the time element is dependent to a large extent on the person who undertakes the tasks involved, the rate of remuneration should be based on the requirements and type of tasks performed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Because of the closure of some old folks homes in the area there is an escalating demand for the service.  In view of the paltry sums being paid would the Minister consider having this matter reviewed and hold discussions with the health board to ensure that these people are adequately remunerated?  Literally we are talking about pence an hour.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the current dental services available in this country; in particular, the plans he has to provide for an orthodontic service in the entire Eastern Health Board area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, due to my concern about the level of health board dental services generally, I set up a small working group under the chairmanship of Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State at my Department, to review health board dental services and, where appropriate, to make recommendations for their improvement.  The working group's report, which contains details of the current level of services available, was issued in December 1988 and I am arranging to have a copy of it sent on to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the orthodontic service in the Eastern Health Board, I recently agreed to the secondment of the deputy chief dental officer of my Department to the health board for a short time to review the board's arrangements for the delivery of dental services, including the orthodontic service and, where necessary, to make recommendations for their improvement.  The deputy chief dental officer's final report is expected to be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years the Eastern Health Board entered into arrangements with the Dublin Dental Hospital whereby the hospital provides a certain amount of orthodontic treatment on behalf of the health board.  Under these arrangements the health board are funding a post of registrar in the orthodontic department of Dublin Dental Hospital and the hospital is assisting in the training of a number of health board dentists in advanced orthdontic techniques.  These arrangements have led to a considerable <Col N="2196" /> improvement in the availability of orthodontic treatment for eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is extremely disappointing.  I am not interested in receiving a copy of any report.  We have received enough reports since the Minister took office.  It is now time for action.  Is the Minister aware that there are as many as 1,000 children in the Dublin area awaiting essential orthodontic treatment?  Is the Minister aware that many of the parents of those children have contacted Members on all sides of the House seeking those services for their children before they move on to second level education?  Is the Minister aware that there is virtually no orthodontic service available in the Dublin area?  Will he, as a matter of urgency, ensure that sufficient people are appointed, be they ordinary dentists or whatever, to provide treatment for those children?  I am sure there are people qualified to do that work in needy cases.</P>

I should like to <Col N="2197" /> point out, and I am sure the Deputy can recall this, that my predecessor, Deputy Desmond, arranged that the Local Appointments Commission would appoint five orthodontists and that, following a competition, it was only possible to recruit one orthodontist.</P>

Will the Minister accept that he has not done anything to rectify the situation?

The service is not what we want but there are 240 dentists working in the public dental service, it is untrue to say there is no service.

      <P>Information is not available in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, information relating to the numbers on waiting lists is set out in a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  I will communicate with the Deputy at a later date when the information requested in respect of St. James's Hospital becomes available.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are of themselves very unreliable as a gauge of how well a particular service is operating.  Waiting lists for in-patients include (1) patients presenting for first time treatment and those receiving continuing care and (2) patients who may be on one, or more than one, consultant's list for the same condition.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are also distorted by different consultants' policies on whether patients who are unlikely to be operated on, or patients who do not currently but will in the near future require admission, are added to the lists.</P>
      <P>In any event waiting lists should be viewed in terms of the throughput of elective admissions and day cases. Between January and March of this year 23,394 of these patients were treated by the hospitals referred to.  If this level of activity is maintained a total of 93,576 non-emergency patients would be treated this year in these hospitals.  This level of throughput places the number of people on waiting lists for elective procedures in the appropriate context.</P>

The same patient can be treated several times on the revolving door policy which is now in operation.

      <P>May I ask the Minister to comment on the now near universal practice of non-confirming admissions for elective surgery until the day of admission? This is causing trauma for people who have made arrangements in regard to the families and jobs for the day of admission but on the day of admission they find there is no bed for them.

    <P>In page 70, before section 76, but in Part VI, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;76.&mdash;(1)  (a) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`the Acts' means&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  the Tax Acts,</P>

    <P>`business' means any trade, profession or vocation;</P>
    <P>`notice' means a notice of claim given by the Revenue Commissioners under the provisions of subsection (6);</P>
    <P>`tax' means any tax, duty, levy or charge which, in accordance with the provisions of the Acts, is placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners;</P>
    <P>`tax advantage' means&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  a reduction, avoidance or deferral of any charge or assessment to tax, including any potential or prospective charge or assessment, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> (ii)  a refund of or a payment of an amount of tax, or an increase in an amount of tax, refundable or otherwise payable to a person, including any potential or prospective amount so refundable or payable, arising out of, or by reason of, a transaction, including a transaction where another transaction would not have been undertaken or arranged to achieve the results, or any part of the results, achieved or intended to be achieved by the transaction; </P>
    <P>`tax avoidance transaction' has the meaning assigned to it by subsection (2);</P>
    <P>`tax consequences' means, in relation to a tax avoidance transaction, such adjustments and acts as may be made and done by the Revenue Commissioners pursuant to subsection (5) in order to withdraw or deny the tax advantage resulting from the tax avoidance transaction;</P>
    <P>`transaction' means&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  any transaction, action, course of action, course of conduct, scheme, plan or proposal, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether express or implied and whether or not enforceable or intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  any series of or combination of the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii), </P>
    <P>whether entered into or arranged by one person or by two or more persons&mdash;</P>
    <P> (I)  whether acting in consort or not, or</P>
    <P>(II)  whether or not entered into or arranged wholly or partly outside the State, or</P>
    <P>(III)  whether or not entered into or arranged as part of a larger transaction or in conjunction with <Col N="2242" /> any other transaction or transactions.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section and subject to subsection (3), a transaction is a `tax avoidance transaction' if, having regard to any one or more of the following, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the results of the transaction,</P>
    <P>(b)  its use as a means of achieving those results, and</P>
    <P>(c)  any other means by which the results or any part of the results could have been achieved,</P>
    <P>it gives rise to, or, but for this section, would give rise to, a tax advantage, and</P>
    <P>the transaction was not undertaken or arranged primarily for purposes other than to give rise to a tax advantage.</P>
    <P>(3)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), a transaction shall not be regarded as a tax avoidance transaction if it appears that it was a bona fide undertaking or arranged other than for the primary purpose of giving rise to a tax advantage.</P>
    <P>Provided that the fact that the primary purpose of the transaction could have been achieved by some other transaction which would have given rise to a greater liability to tax, shall not, by itself, be taken as sufficient grounds for holding that the transaction was a tax avoidance transaction.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the Revenue Commissioners are of the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction within the meaning of this section, it shall be lawful for them to serve on any person who in their opinion has obtained a tax advantage by virtue of the transaction a notice of claim (in this section referred to as `a notice') setting out their claim.</P>
    <P>A notice served under this section shall also set out:</P>
    <P> (a)  the tax advantage which they <Col N="2243" /> consider arises, or which, but for this section, would arise, from the transaction,</P>
    <P>(b)  the tax consequences which they consider would arise in respect of the transaction if their opinion were to become final and conclusive in accordance with subsection (8), and</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount of any relief from double taxation which they would propose to give to any person in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>The matters set out at (a), (b) and (c) above are referred to in this section as `consequential claims'.</P>
    <P>(5)  A notice served by the Revenue Commissioners under this section shall unless it is contested by the person upon whom it is served, be declared to be admitted by such person.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person is served with a notice under this section, he may by counter-notice in writing contest the claim any or all of the consequential claims set out in the said notice, such counter-notice to be served not later than 30 days after the service of the notice upon such person.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where a counter-notice is served pursuant to subsection (6) hereof, the notice and counter-notice shall be laid before the Appeal Commissioners for the determination of any issues arising thereon by the person serving the counter-notice.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where a notice is served and is deemed to be admitted pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the matter set out in the notice including the claim and any consequential claims shall, as against the person upon whom the notice has been served be deemed to have been adjudicated against such person finally and conclusively.</P>
    <P>(9)  The Revenue Commissioners may, at any time, amend, add to or withdraw any matter specified or described in a notice by giving notice <Col N="2244" /> (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the `notice of amendment') in writing of the amendment, addition or withdrawal to each and every person affected thereby, in so far as the person is so affected, and the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply in all respects as if the notice of amendment were a notice and any matter specified or described in the notice of amendment were specified or described in a notice.</P>
    <P>Provided that no such amendment, addition or withdrawal may be made so as to set aside or alter any matter which has become final and conclusive on the determination of an issue made with regard to that matter under subsection (8).</P>
    <P>(10)  The Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine an issue laid before them under subsection (7) as if it were an appeal against an assessment to income tax and, subject to subsection (9), all the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, relating to the rehearing of an appeal and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>(11)  In determining any issue between the Revenue Commissioners and any person in relation to any matter arising on a notice or counter-notice, the Revenue Commissioners shall have regard to the provisions of this section but the onus shall be on the person who has served the counter-notice to satisfy the Appeal Commissioners that the claim or consequential claim set out in the notice served on him is wrong in any respect.</P>
    <P>(12)  In determining any issue laid before them pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, the Appeal Commissioners and where appropriate the Circuit Court and the High Court shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P> (I)  the form of that transaction,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> (II)  the substance of that transaction,</P>
    <P>(III)  the substance of any other transaction or transactions which that transaction may reasonably be regarded as being directly or indirectly related to or connected with, and</P>
    <P>(IV)  the final outcome and result of that transaction and any combination of those other transactions which are so related or connected.</P>
    <P>(13)  Where pursuant to subsection (4), the Revenue Commissioners form the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction and, pursuant to that opinion, notices are to be given under subsection (5) to two or more persons, any obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to maintain secrecy or any other restriction upon the disclosure of information by the Revenue Commissioners shall not apply with respect to the giving of the notices as aforesaid or to the performance of any acts or the discharge of any functions authorised by this section to be performed or discharged by them or to the performance of any act or the discharge of any functions, including any act or function in relation to a determination made under subsection (10), which is directly or indirectly related to the acts or functions so authorised.</P>
    <P>(14)  The Revenue Commissioners may nominate any of their officers to perform any acts and discharge any functions, including the forming of an opinion, authorised by this section to be performed or discharged by the Revenue Commissioners and references in this section to the Revenue Commissioners shall, with any necessary modifications, be construed as including references to an officer so nominated.</P>
    <P>(15)  This section shall apply as respects any transaction where the whole or any part of the transaction is <Col N="2246" /> undertaken or arranged on or after the 25th day of January, 1989, and as respects any transaction undertaken or arranged wholly before that date in so far as it gives rise to, or would, but for this section, give rise to&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  a reduction, avoidance or deferral of any charge or assessment of tax, or part thereof, where the charge or assessment would otherwise first arise on a date, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a refund or a payment of an amount, or of an increase in an amount, of tax, or part thereof, refundable or otherwise payable to a person where that amount, or increase in the amount, would otherwise become first so refundable or otherwise payable to the person on a date,</P>
    <P>which could not fall earlier than the said 25th day of January, 1989, as the case may be, but no notice shall be served in relation to any transaction which appears to have been undertaken or arranged earlier than 1st January, 1985.</P>
    <P>(16)  The liabilities of any person to pay tax as finally determined by the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions of these sections, or as deemed to have been so determined, shall for all purposes be deemed to be liabilities imposed by law and all remedies, penalties and liabilities for interest shall have application accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance always provokes such a rowdy reception.  Before Question Time we were dealing with the history of this section and a number of points occurred to me during the lunch break.  I do not want to prolong the debate on this section for too long, but I want to put on the record a number of my views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First there are a number of features <Col N="2247" /> which, despite the Minister's amendments, still stick out as wrong with the section.  For instance, the Minister told me earlier that the wording of section 76 (9) (a) (i) (I) would be amended but it will not.  It will only be amended by removing the words &ldquo;are satisfied&rdquo;.  I think the words &ldquo;that there are sufficient grounds for the Revenue Commissioners to form the opinion&rdquo; in that subsection will still stand.  I hope I am not wrong yet again, but I think I am right.  The Minister has tabled a number of amendments to section 76 but the amendments which are tabled to lines 38 and 39 of section 76 (9) (a) (i) (I) will only make one change.  I think the Minister will confirm that I am right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that does cover it.</P>
      <P>Finally we are left with a section which started out as one which proposed to give the Revenue Commissioners determining powers and was modelled closely on the Canadian statute, which has gone through an evolution, and is still going through an evolution even now in this House.  It evolves from one in which the Revenue Commissioners made a primary determination into one in which the Revenue Commissioners simply initiate a process but are required to form an opinion.  If that were the beginning and end of it, nobody could have a huge objection because the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to form opinions and put matters before appeals tribunals. But, as Deputy Noonan said, there is here an appeal from an opinion which is a strange form of language.  That really derives from the fact that there was originally an appeal from a determination but it was changed by the draftsman; wherever &ldquo;determination&rdquo; appeared, the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; was put in its place.</P>
      <P>We now have a very different intention endeavouring to show its way through all the original foundations and brickwork of a very different scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance the section now is very clumsily drafted.  At the very beginning had they said there will be a claim made by the Revenue Commissioners, the person can contest the claim and, if he contests the claim, it is decided by a body, it would amount to a fairly simple basis on which to draft a section and put it before this House.  Instead we have an appeal from something which should not be appealed at all, which is an &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;. As Deputy Noonan said, one only appeals a &ldquo;determination&rdquo;.  The problem with this is that, appealing an &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; is, of its very nature, a contradiction in <Col N="2249" /> terms.  This shows right through the section as it now remains.</P>
    <P>For example, subsection (7) talks about people being aggrieved by an opinion.  If one examines any case law on the meaning of the word &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo;&mdash; it occurs in the trademark law and all the rest of it &mdash; one finds it is somebody who disagrees with it, is damnified by it, who is adversely affected by it.  It cannot be just somebody who disagrees with it; first one has to disagree with it and second, show prejudice as a result of one's disagreement. The phrase &ldquo;aggrieved by an opinion&rdquo; does not mean anything at all. One cannot be aggrieved by somebody elses opinion, nor is one aggrieved by the fact that somebody sets in motion a process to determine an issue against one. One cannot be aggrieved by that.  One can dispute a claim but one cannot be aggrieved by an opinion nor, legally speaking, can one be aggrieved by the fact that somebody starts a process against one.  If I am caught for drunken driving and charged I cannot be described as aggrieved by the process.  It does violence to language to attempt to suggest that this section, in its present form, is well drafted.</P>
    <P>I do not like being arrogant &mdash; and I am not going to be &mdash; but I am going to say this.  What I did last Monday in the space of three hours is more coherent, better worked &mdash; even with the warts and omissions that the Minister pointed out &mdash; than this section which has gone through a long gestation period and has emerged as a mutant of what was originally conceived. As it now stands, it is a very badly drafted section, one which could be improved very substantially.  Indeed, it would not have been presented as an original piece of work in this form had a week been taken to scrutinise it.  It started off as one thing, has turned into another, and is littered with the debris of its first character which gets in the way and obstructs it in its reformed state.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider coming forward with a better section on Report Stage.  I would urge him to sit down and say: I will get all the concepts that are here, which are not that <Col N="2250" /> difficult to work with and I can have the same definition of a tax avoidance transaction.  At least he could put together machinery which the courts will not realise from the very beginning is a warped and distorted procedure, twisted around to try and save it from being held to be unconstitutional, which is what has been done to this section.</P>
    <P>There are other things about it I do not like.  Grabbed holus-bolus from the Canadian statute, in page 71, line 16, there is a new word I have never seen in any tax statute anywhere perhaps the Minister will tell me if there is some precedent for it, but I have never seen it. The phrase is &ldquo;acting in consort&rdquo;.  I have heard of people &ldquo;acting in concert&rdquo; but I have never heard anyone &ldquo;acting in consort&rdquo;.  It may be a North Americanism because I am told it does appear in the Canadian statute, but I have never heard that phrase used &mdash; to &ldquo;act in consort&rdquo; with somebody else.  &ldquo;Concerted action&rdquo; is when two people get together to do something but I have never heard of &ldquo;consorted action&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is somebody who goes along with it in that sense.  Loss of consortium is what husbands used to be able to see.</P>
      <P>For instance, if one looks at lines 39 and 40 on page 71 &mdash; I take it the idea is to delete line 39 and substitute the words &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners form&rdquo;&mdash; why is that there?  The subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section and subject to subsection (3), a transaction is a &ldquo;tax avoidance transaction&rdquo; if, having regard to any one or more of the following, that is to say &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the results of the transaction,</P>
      <P>(b)  its use as a means of achieving those results, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> (c)  any other means by which the results or any part of the results could have been achieved,</P>
    <P>there are reasonable grounds for the Revenue Commissioners to form ...</P>
    <P>which is the present text.  The Minister suggests that should read: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners form the opinion that &mdash; (i) it gives rise to, or, but for this section, would give rise to, a tax advantage ...&rdquo; With the greatest respect, that is not the definition of a &ldquo;tax avoidance transaction,&rdquo; that the Revenue Commissioners have formed an opinion about.  Again, that is badly drafted.  It is not the definition.  It should be that there are reasonable grounds to believe that this and that is the case because the Revenue Commissioners are not given the function, under the statute, of defining what is or is not a &ldquo;tax avoidance transaction&rdquo;. That is badly drafted also.  Now, it will read: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section, having regard to a certain number of matters, a transaction is deemed to be a `tax avoidance transaction' if the Revenue Commissioners form an opinion about it.&rdquo;  That is badly drafted and is wrong.</P>
    <P>The amendment No. 58a, is badly drafted, and ends up saying that a &ldquo;tax avoidance transaction&rdquo; is dependent on the Revenue Commissioners' view of it. I thought we were trying to substitute an objective test about what is and is not a tax avoidance transaction.  If you try and marry the proposal contained in amendment No. 58a to the proposed amendment No. 58b they do not make sense because you can now appeal on the grounds that the transaction specified is not a tax avoidance transaction but the definition still hinges around the Revenue Commissioners opinion of it.  With respect that was not well drafted and it shows the stitching and darning that has been done on this section to try to make it hang together.  If the draftsmen look at it they will appreciate that the definition now offered to the House of a tax avoidance transaction depends on the Revenue <Col N="2252" /> Commissioners' view of it.  That clearly conflicts with what the Minister is attempting to do in relation to subsection (7) (a).</P>
    <P>I believe this section could easily be re-written between now and Tuesday to get rid of the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; parts completely. The word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; only appears as a substitute for &ldquo;determination&rdquo; and as a very threadbare substitute pasted in on &ldquo;Tipp-ex&rdquo; all over the text of this Bill. Between now and Tuesday this section could be re-written.  Even if my efforts of last Monday morning are not considered to be proper the Parliamentary draftsman could, within three hours, produce a coherent constitutional and properly drafted section which would not suffer from all the defects, as in this case, and which would hang together and make sense and would not be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>Look at the definition of tax consequences. The tax consequences are defined to be such adjustments as may be made and done by the Revenue Commissioners pursuant to subsection (5).  In the middle of subsection (5) we see again a highly Revenue Commissioner orientated view of what are the tax consequences of any particular stand.  Again, the Revenue Commissioners are given powers to recharacterise, for tax purposes, the nature of any payment or other amount.  That must be a judicial function. It is not an administrative function.  In the case of Deegan and Hearne which is the leading case on an inspector's function it was held that it was not a judicial function, that it was entirely administrative. If somebody forms opinions which become final and conclusive and if somebody starts to recharacterise one transaction as another, if that is not judicial, it is legislative &mdash; it is certainly not administrative.  On those grounds alone this is a very rickety section.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept from me that all these criticisms are levelled against the section as proposed in the context of my accepting the principle of what he is talking about?  I do not need to have pushed down my throat the <Col N="2253" /> wrongness of tax avoidance and the rightness of a general provision to invalidate tax avoidance transactions but I believe that in attempting to change the law, in a revolutionary manner such as this and in a well merited way, the Revenue Commissioners should not, through the Department of Finance, cobble together something, keep changing it and bring before this House a most inadequate section which is weak in its terms.  The reason I object to this section is that it is so weak, so confused and diffuse and is littered with bits from a previous existence which no longer makes sense.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to indicate to the House that he proposes to redraft his section so as to make it as coherent as possible so as to reflect &mdash; and this is the point I think is of primary importance &mdash; the fact that there is no function of primary determination or adjudication given to the Revenue Commissioners. All they are required to do is initiate a process or a claim and it is up to the taxpayer to dispute that.  There may be a lot of semantics in all of this but there is a grain of truth that a court looking at it will see it littered with the debris of its former unconstitutional manifestation and will leap on any defect in it to strike it down on that account.  Every statute which is passed by this House and by the Seanad has a presumption of constitutionality about it.  On this occasion when we are looking at something which is so weak and so flimsy and which is being amended piecemeal to try to make it conform with the Constitution, when its basic concept was unconstitutional, surely it is within the power of the Minister to come up with a better section on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy McDowell I think we can establish a few things beyond any disagreement or shadow of doubt.  First, he accepts the principle involved in the Bill.  That is fine. Secondly, as he must accept, we had a Second Stage debate in which plenty of points were raised.  I expressed my own views.  Various cases were made in the <Col N="2254" /> discussion that took place.  We have evolved into the sections and the amendments. The Deputy makes the case that the Bill is untidy, that it is badly drafted and that he would not choose some of the words which were chosen.  I can say to him in response that the principles are there.  We set out what we wanted to do, to make the changes we wanted to make. That job was given to a draftsman, it was vetted by the Attorney General's Office and this is what I have ended up with. Views have been expressed here today about bad draftsmanship, loose draftsmanship, etc. &mdash; that is no more than untidiness to say the least.  I can look at the untidy aspects but I do not accept that I should take away the section and have it redrafted by Tuesday.</P>
      <P>There are a few other points I would like to make.  There is no question of the primary function of determination being given to the Revenue Commissioners.  I want to repeat that in case there is any doubt still left in anybody's mind.  The question of an opinion is there, it is a mechanism to trigger it off, to have it go through the Appeals Commissioners and on to the courts.  They will look at the very same ground rules and the first principles on which the Revenue Commissioners formed their opinion on the first day.  Subsection (1) (b) applies the same ground rules and brings them into subsections (2) and (3) which defines and also provides the comforts for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is beyond argument at this stage that any primary function good, bad or indifferent be given to the Revenue Commissioners for determination.  Clearly, it is the mechanism to trigger it off, to have it examined and the same first principles and ground rules under which it was examined by the Revenue Commissioners, in the first instance, would be looked at by the Appeals Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners and finally the courts.  How can anybody clearly assert that any determination function will be given to them in the first place?  It is an opinion, the Deputy may disagree as to the choice of word.  The choice of word was approved by the Attorney <Col N="2255" /> General's office and I could not undertake to provide a new section by Tuesday. However, I will look at some of the untidy aspects which the Deputy referred to.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his intervention.  I am convinced by Deputy McDowell's arguments about his line of approach.  I know his amendment is not perfect but by and large I think it is a better formulation than the Minister's amendment.  We all agree that the Minister has drawn heavily on the Canadian legislation.  Between now and next Tuesday, perhaps we should have another look at it.  There are a couple of sections in it which would improve our understanding of this section, would make it easier and certainly provide more certainty.  It seems that there will be no certainty in this section until the Circuit Court has heard and decided a number of cases.  Effectively, we are buying a bit of a pig in a poke here.  We know the general trend, the general run of it, but in the final analysis, until there is case law coming from the Circuit Court on this section, we will not know how wide this will spread or how narrow the focus will be.</P>
      <P>In the Canadian legislation on the general anti-avoidance provision, first, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a transaction is an avoidance transaction, the tax consequences to a <Col N="2256" /> person shall be determined as is reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny a tax benefit which, but for this section, would result directly or indirectly from the transaction, or from a series of transactions which includes that transaction.</P>
    <P>It goes on to define an avoidance transaction in precise terms:</P>
    <P>An avoidance transaction means any transaction that, but for this section, would result directly or indirectly in a tax benefit unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.</P>
    <P>Another subsection which deals with one of my concerns states:</P>
    <P>For greater certainty, subsection (2) does not apply to a transaction where it may reasonably be considered that the transaction would not result directly or indirectly in a misuse of the provision of this Act, or an abuse having regard to the provision of this Act other than this Section read as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister has this material available to him, so I shall not continue.  It is worth looking at the manner in which Canadian legislation defines an avoidance transaction and the manner in which it makes exceptions of genuine business transactions. It may be worth going over that ground again between now and Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern was expressed that an impossible burden of proof was being placed on taxpayers by section 76. That is not the case.  In the spirit of reassuring taxpayers and making it clear that the section is aimed only at tax avoiders, the approach to appealing against the Revenue Commissioners' opinion has been changed from one of &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo;, about which doubts were raised, to one of &ldquo;correctness&rdquo;.  The Appeal Commissioners and the courts will uphold an opinion of the Revenue Commissioners only if they consider it to be correct.  Because the references to &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient grounds&rdquo; have been removed it is being provided that the Appeal Commissioners and the courts should have to consider that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction.</P>
      <P>It is believed that this represents a fair test, having regard to the nature of tax avoidance and the need to strike a balance between the interests of the general body of taxpayers who wish to see tax avoidance stamped out and the individual taxpayer indulging in tax planning.  To provide that the Appeal Commissioners and the courts must be satisfied might impose on the Appeal Commissioners and the courts an impossible task in areas where the refusal to co-operate in supplying information is part of the practice being adopted by tax avoiders.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to subsection 13 (a) of section 76 to put beyond doubt that the section will apply only to tax avoidance transactions completed before budget day where the tax which the tax avoider is seeking to avoid arose as a result of activities which took place wholly after budget day.  That is the scope of the application of the specific anti-avoidance provision.  While it is considered that the previous wording had the same effect, it is accepted that its rather general nature, springing from the general nature of the section itself, may have given a different impression.  It is not considered that any amendment of paragraph (b) is necessary as a repayment is not dependent on the making of a charge or an assessment.  If the elements entitling a person to a repayment are present before budget day, the repayment will be made even though the actual mechanics of making the repayment are not put into effect until after budget day.</P>

      <P>

      <P>(a)  the repayment of excise duty and value-added tax and the remission of road tax in respect of a motor vehicle used by, and</P>

      <Col N="2265" /> a severely and permanently disabled person&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  as a driver, where the disablement is of such a nature that the person concerned could not drive any vehicle unless it is specially constructed or adapted to take account of that disablement, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  as a passenger, where the vehicle has been specially constructed or adapted to take account of the passenger's disablement, and where the vehicle is adapted, the cost of such adaptation consists of not less than 30 per cent. of the value of the vehicle excluding tax and excise duty, or such lesser percentage in respect of certain cases as may be specified by regulations in respect of the repayment of any tax relating to adaptation costs only.</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulations under this section shall provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  the criteria for eligibility for the remission of the taxes specified in subsection (1), including such further medical criteria in relation to disabilities as may be considered necessary,</P>
    <P>(b)  subject to subsection (3) (b), the procedures to be used in relation to the primary medical certification of a disabled person and to appeals against such certification,</P>
    <P>(c)  the procedures in relation to the certification of vehicles to which the regulations relate,</P>
    <P>(d)  the amount of value-added tax and excise duty repayable in respect of a vehicle to which the regulations relate,</P>

    <P>and the regulations may provide for such other matters as the Minister for Finance considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of giving effect to this section.</P>
    <P>(3) (a)  Upon the first coming into operation of regulations under this section, section 43 (1) of the Finance Act, 1968, shall cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>(b)  Any person who, at the passing of this Act, was the registered owner of a motor vehicle, being a motor vehicle in respect of which such person was entitled to and had received a refund of tax or excise duty by reference to section 43 (1) of the Finance Act, 1968, shall be deemed to be a person who possesses a primary medical certificate which, subject to compliance with the non-medical requirements set out in the regulations, entitles him to a similar repayment of tax or excise duty by reference to this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Regulations made under this section shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may be after they are made, and if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next subsequent 21 days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the regulations have been so laid, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>(5) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`medical practitioner' means a medical practitioner registered under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978;</P>
    <P>`primary medical certification' means medical certification by a medical practitioner who is the holder of a post in a health board, being the post commonly known as the post of Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health, in the area in which the person to whom the certification <Col N="2267" /> relates ordinarily resides and `primary medical certificate' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment represents the outcome of a renewed effort to improve the tax rebate schemes for disabled drivers and passengers.  As arranged during the Second Stage debate, I have had useful and constructive talks with Opposition spokesmen on this sensitive issue and the amendment has been prepared in the light of those discussions.</P>
    <P>The existing scheme based on section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, has proved to be unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  There is no doubt that the present medical criterion &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of one's legs&rdquo; excludes otherwise deserving cases of disabled drivers.  There is also a need from an administrative point of view to bring together the different elements of the existing scheme so that standardised and fairer conditions and procedures will henceforth apply.  The amendment before the House seeks to make good these deficiencies.  It would enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations for remissions of road tax, refunds of VAT and excise duty on vehicles and a refund of excise duty on petrol.</P>
    <P>The general criterion of disability will be that a person must be severely and permanently disabled with the result that he or she would be unable to drive a car unless it was specially constructed or adapted.  The scheme will also apply to disabled persons as passengers where significant car adaptation is needed.  It would be my intention to specify as necessary in more detail what medical conditions might be covered by this.  This will be done in the regulations.  This definition is intended to cover a wider range of disability than that in use at present.</P>
    <P>The whole point is to broaden eligibility to cover cases at present excluded. For example, I envisage that persons of small stature who have mobility problems will be included, as will amputees of foot or leg and amputees of both hands.  In addition to this important broadening of the scope of eligibility, it is proposed that <Col N="2268" /> in future all medical certification will be provided by the director of community care in the health board in whose area the applicant normally resides.  There will be provision for appeal against a decision not to allow eligibility.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also specify a number of controls and limits, the chief of which will relate to the maximum size of vehicle to be assisted, 2,000 cc, and to the total amount of VAT and excise duty to be refunded, £7,500 in respect of a car, and this will be indexed to the increase in car prices.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me assure all those who are at present in receipt of a remission of a refund of tax under the existing scheme, that they will not have to undergo any further process of medical certification to retain eligibility for the particular from of tax refund they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>I trust that the new scheme will provide a much more satisfactory basis for this important form of assistance designed to improve the mobility of the disabled.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First I would like to thank the Minister for his explanation.  I would also like to thank him for arranging to bring the finance spokespersons from the different parties together.  It facilitated us greatly and allowed us to have an input into the drafting of this section which is a procedure which is unusual enough in this House.  I would like to put it on record that my party appreciate very much what the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>There is an amendment down in the name of Deputy Yates, the Fine Gael spokesman on Health.  It is an alternative to the Minister's amendment but it was put down before we had the details of the Minister's amendment.  There is no intention whatsoever to press it as an alternative.  We allowed it to remain on the Order Paper simply for the purposes of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister has said today.  It seems to me that the enabling section which the Minister is putting into this Bill to allow him to subsequently come in with appropriate regulations will <Col N="2269" /> allow him to hang regulations on this section which are sufficient to meet all the reasonable requests that have been made.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to continue the discussion process and, before he places the regulations before the House, perhaps he would again call a very short meeting of the spokespersons on Finance so that we can agree the regulations before they come into the House.  I would not envisage any great difficulty in that respect, but it can get very awkward if there is disagreement about regulations once they are placed before the House, especially if the Minister is adopting the negative procedure of endorsement, with which I agree, rather than a positive endorsement which would allow for a greater level of debate.</P>
    <P>There are two or three minor points which the Minister may take on board. Section 1(b) refers to the repayment of excise duty relating to mineral hydrocarbon light oil used in vehicles.  That seems to me to confine it to petrol.  I do not see why the option of diesel should not be allowed because I think hydrocarbon light oil would be petrol.</P>
    <P>I know that the economics of a diesel car is that one would need to be driving more than 15,000 miles to justify the initial expense, and that is a lot of miles for a disabled person.  On the other hand, the excise rebate goes up to a maximum of 600 gallons of petrol on one aspect of the scheme, so if we are talking in terms of 30 miles to the gallon there is an excise rebate up to 18,000 miles built into the scheme anyway.  It is a minor point but perhaps the Minister might take it on board and include diesel as well especially in circumstances where I understand it is now the Minister's intent to apply this to cars up to 2,000 cc which would have power steering and automatic gear change to facilitate disabled drivers.  In these circumstances there may be a greater range of automatic cars with power steering if the diesel option is allowed in.  I think it is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>The section on the second page of what I have is 1 (b) (ii) and refers to a passenger <Col N="2270" /> where the vehicle has been specially constructed or adapted to take account of the passenger's disablement.  I presume that the remainder of that, about 30 per cent etc., applies to modifications required by a passenger and does not tip back and affect the modifications required by a driver.  I take it it is tied in to passengers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In regard to the maximum engine size to which the regulations relate, again I am pressing for 2,000 cc because it is very hard to get cars with power steering, which would be required by disabled people, at low engine capacity.  There may be a range of automatic cars, but certainly not automatics with power steering, in the lower ranges of engine capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one final point in regard to subsection (5) where the definition of a medical practitioner means a medical practitioner registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 1987.  It goes on to say that primary medical certification means medical certification by a medical practitioner who is the holder of a post in a health board being the post commonly known as director of community care. That ties it in quite a lot and it might make it administratively difficult.  I would like to make a suggestion which the Minister may consider either as a modification of this or subsequently in the regulations. I can understand why the certification could not be done by a disabled person's private doctor because the kind of relationship that builds up between the doctor and the patient in the course of an ongoing illness is such a close relationship that it would put the doctor in an extremely difficult situation if he were asked to certify.  We need third party medical evidence, but to tie it into the director of community care who can be a rather remote figure in certain communities might lead to problems.  I wonder is it the intention that the director of community care would set up a panel of doctors who would actually do the medical examination, and the director of <Col N="2271" /> community care would simply certify on foot of medical evidence provided by other doctors, or is it the intention that the director of community care would do it himself?  If it is the latter, there is a certain amount of work being put on a man who is fairly busy already.  A panel of doctors appointed by the director of community care, the health board, or the Minister for Health, to whom a disabled person could go who would provide certification through the director of community care who would then endorse it might be a better way of proceeding.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister has done. He has approached this in a very considerate and open way and has taken on board all reasonable opinions that have been expressed to him.  I would like him to take these points on board also.  Perhaps he would accept my suggestion that at some stage when the regulations are drafted we could have a quick look at them in private before they become public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the general remarks made by Deputy Noonan.  The approach of the Minister to this has been a very pleasant surprise and it works to the benefit of everybody because it means that nobody is exposed to undue pressure on an issue like this and a consensus can emerge privately much more easily than in a public debate on the issue.  It is perhaps a model for other difficult issues and I want to thank the Minister for taking the initiative of bringing that process about.</P>
      <P>I am operating off a piece of paper the Minister gave me the other day so I do not know whether I am missing anything; I want to be careful, after my experience earlier today, not to get it wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the section I do not see the Minister giving himself the power to revoke or amend the regulations.  It may be in it, but I do not see it and it should be there if the Minister intends to do it. If the Minister does intend to do it, I think it should be an amending power rather than a revoking power because it <Col N="2272" /> would be a bit strange if we gave the Minister the right to scrap the whole system completely whenever the thought came into his head.  It is usual to say that a Minister can make regulations and revoke and amend accordingly.  It may be implicit in it anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe between now and Report Stage it could be made explicit.  I have examined the matters that can be dealt with in regulations.  Paragraph (e) refers to the maximum engine size to which the regulations relate.  The Minister should give himself a little more flexibility in that regard and perhaps he would do that on Report Stage.  He should make the wording plural to read the maximum engine sizes for classes of vehicles.  He may find that for some vehicles he can fix a lower engine size than for others.  I am thinking in terms of cars that require to be automatic or require power steering.  These may require a larger engine size than others and the Minister may find himself spancelled if he has to fix one engine size for all cars, so a little flexibility in that area would do no harm.</P>
      <P>I was surprised but pleased also that present beneficiaries of the scheme are <i>en bloc</i> transferred past the first hurdle in this scheme.  In view of the fact that there had been allegations of abuse and over-generous determination by doctors under the existing scheme, it was both generous and wise of the Minister to avoid the business of actually removing people from the scope of the new scheme. In retrospect it would have been a mistake to do that.  It is a point that had not occurred to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also endorse what Deputy Noonan said about the desirability of some consultative process in relation to the regulations, that they could be circulated in draft form.  I appreciate that the Minister received advice about the phraseology in relation to the annulment of regulations.  Small matters will have to be changed from time to time and it probably would be too much to bring <Col N="2273" /> before the Dáil.  On reflection, I think the Minister is right and I was wrong in that regard.  With those words, I indicate support for the change.</P>

      <P>Following the meeting, I sent a brief note to the Minister in which I referred to a few of the matters that had been raised.  One of the matters I was happy with was the lower cc's of vehicles.  It was brought to my attention that power steering is probably not available in cars of less than 2000 cc's. I mentioned in the note to the Minister that power steering is essential in some cases of handicap.  I take it that the size of the vehicle is not really the worry but rather the expense.  Some vehicles, even of lower cc's, can be very expensive.  The type of vehicle that is required for the handicapped person is the main issue. Some people might want a bigger vehicle, some might want power steering and so on.  I suggested that we should include in the provision current provisional licence in addition to current driver's licence. There was a suggestion of the renewal period being three years but when I examined the position I found that cars lose their value very rapidly in the third year and it would be much better to renew them after one or two years.  It might be unfair to stipulate a three-year renewal period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I put down the amendment is that I understood from the meeting that the draft regulations before us would be put in the affirmative rather than in the negative and I wanted to draw attention to that.  Deputy Noonan made a suggestion of a possible consultation before the regulations are issued &mdash; it was basically on the regulations that we had the discussion &mdash; and I would certainly <Col N="2274" /> go along with that.  I would not push the amendment if there was some consultative process before the regulations were actually issued.  I do not think there will be any difficulty about them because they are all fairly straightforward and I think there is general agreement on them but we would like to see them before they are issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with previous Opposition speakers in thanking the Minister for his open attitude on this matter.  I think it is now generally agreed that there was an urgent need for law reform in this area because a few cases came to light including the most highlighted one of Mr. Gerry O'Brien, who has no arms, one normal leg and a prosthesis in his other leg.  He was considered to be an able driver and therefore he was not entitled to the refund of excise duty.  I have to say that he still has not got that refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of features of the matter which I am glad have been extended.  The amendment in my name, 59 (d) &mdash; and Deputy Noonan has already referred to this &mdash; sought to deal with the position of people who are in wheelchairs. It proposes to remove the very unfair position whereby both legs have to be disabled.  In fairness to the Taoiseach who was Minister for Finance in 1968, it was never intended that it would be interpreted in such a way that both legs would have to be disabled.  That was the first aim of my amendment.  Secondly, it has come to my attention that where persons are so severely disabled that they cannot be drivers but are passengers, there is some lack of uniformity across the country in the interpretations.  It can be very expensive to modify a car, and the 30 per cent condition applied in those <Col N="2275" /> cases.  I proposed to delete the words &ldquo;as driver&rdquo; so as to make the provision watertight.  Since then the provision has been expanded to deal with other cases that have come to light such as persons of small stature or dwarfs, hand amputees and people who have difficulties with or have no upper limbs.  I very much favour the definition &ldquo;a severely and permanently disabled person&rdquo;.  It is preferable to the one I put forward.</P>
    <P>There are a few small aspects that I would like to take up with the Minister. First, in relation to the regulations, the health boards could not cope in the adjudication of cases because there would be waiting lists in existence and the position would vary from board to board.  To set up a panel of doctors on a fee per item basis, which would only be a once a year occurrence, for a small number of people, would be a better way of dealing with the matter.  There is need for a doctor other than the person's GP to be involved and I would very much favour that.  I would also favour a limitation of the engine size to 2,000 cc's because if there is abuse &mdash; and I have doubts about this abuse &mdash; that would be the best way to deal with it.  I would prefer that the UK definition would have been accepted because it works there and in Northern Ireland.  Finally, I have been advised that under section 12 of Statutory Instrument No. 57 of 1979 the Minister has power to grant an excise duty refund in certain cases.  Perhaps he would communicate with me on that matter.  In conclusion, I would ask him to give Mr. Gerry O'Brien his refund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The UK definition could not possibly be accepted.  If it was applied here <i>pro rata</i> as it is applied in the UK it would cost the Exchequer £80 million.  It is a wide definition which spans a big area and we discussed it at the meeting between Finance Ministers. What we have here today is a compassionate response in relation to this area from a collective effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quickly refer to a few points that <Col N="2276" /> have been raised.  I will include diesel in the provision.  The reason I was in favour of the 2,000 cc's is that there is only one make of car under that size &mdash; at 1,800 cc's &mdash; which has power steering and I understand power steering is important for many disabled drivers.  On the question just raised by Deputy Yates about the health boards not being in a position to handle it, the figure in question is about 500 a year and about seven health boards. Surely they can handle it.  However, I will look at the practicalities of the suggestion made by Deputy Noonan and there will be consultation before the regulations are drafted.  I opted for the two year replacement period on the basis that it could be very expensive if we let it go to three years because of depreciation.  In relation to the question of Mr. O'Brien's situation, as soon as the Bill is enacted, we will make immediate arrangements to have his refund put in place.  We are tied by legislation at the moment.</P>
    <P>I thank all the spokesmen for their co-operation. There will be a consultative process before this comes in and I will look at any of the other points raised, between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House on this matter.  I had a Priority Question down for answer last Tuesday but regrettably for a reason with which the House is familiar I was unable to be here.  I appreciate the opportunity to explore this question now.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as spokesman for the Environment with responsibility for the construction industry, I am aware of a growing problem in areas of economic growth in the construction industry that is being compounded by the delays in processing appeals in An Bord Pleanála. This is a problem within the direct control of the Minister and which can be resolved if the Minister is prepared to take effective action.</P>
      <P>The manifesto on which the Government were elected proposed among other things that An Bord Pleanála &ldquo;shall be required to decide on appeals within four months.&rdquo;  The House will be aware that there is no fixed time limit within which An Bord Pleanála must respond to an appeal in contrast to the two month period which prevails with local authorities. The Fianna Fáil manifesto also stated that the period needed to make planning decisions should not be unnecessarily protracted and that delays in granting planning permission and decisions involving unnecessarily complicated conditions were a costly hindrance to development and often involved the postponement of desirable projects which had a high employment content.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was negotiated with the social partners the Government said on page 23 at paragraph 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry will benefit from the recovery of demand from <Col N="2278" /> investment in the private sector.  The Programme will improve the climate for private sector investment which will support the construction industry.  The development of the Custom House Docks site which will commence shortly exemplifies this.</P>
    <P>It has come to my attention from representations made to me by people who have suffered from long inexplicable delays, from documents published in the newspapers and by the CIF, the most recent one being in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i>, that builders' costs have been increased due to the planning backlog.  I will refer later to that interview given by Mr. Michael Greene one of the directors of the CIF which is headlined &ldquo;Builders' Costs Increase Due to Planning Backlog.&rdquo; These references indicate that there has been a recovery in demand in the construction industry over the last nine to 12 months due to a combination of factors including the reduction in interest rates, the existence of the designated areas and an improved economic climate world-wide as well as the fact that a lot of British financial institutions looking somewhat warily at their own overheated market in the UK are looking at an Irish construction market that for one reason or another has not had a lot of activity over the past five to six years.  Fortunately for all concerned the industry is beginning to move again.</P>
    <P>It is essential, if the Government are to give effect to their election manifesto, to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to the tone of the reply which the Minister gave to the priority question on Tuesday last, that certain steps be taken. The Minister should fix a time limit by regulation.  My understanding is that existing legislation enables the Minister for the Environment to fix time limits for decision making in An Bord Pleanála, subject to certain safeguards.  The right of a third party or a disappointed applicant to appeal a decision to An Bord Pleanála is sacrosanct and is not in question nor is the need to have that right properly guaranteed.  However, the need for a concerned third party or a disappointed applicant to get a speedy and <Col N="2279" /> effective response to an application to An Bord Pleanála is extremely important. Because of staff levels in An Bord Pleanála at the moment decisions which might otherwise be made and transmitted to third parties are being delayed.  The Minister in his reply last Tuesday said that certain steps had been taken and that he has asked An Bord Pleanála to improve their procedures internally.  The Minister said in his reply:</P>
    <P>Time targets set at my request by the Board in 1988 to reduce a backlog from 1987 have been met.  In this regard comparison between the figures for 1987 and 1988 are significant.  The overall volume of appeals received in 1988 at 2257 was somewhat less than the 1987 figure of 2439 while at the same time the actual number of appeals disposed of by the Board in 1988 was higher at 2369 than the 1987 figure of 2237.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply while factually accurate misses the intention of my question. We are not at the level of construction activity of 1987 or 1988.  We have moved on from that for the reasons I have already referred to.  There is now a serious delay within An Bord Pleanála. If, as that question and answer exchange implies there was a backlog in 1987 when the construction industry was still in a period of recession, then the present level of activity which by all accounts has increased considerably, means that if staff levels have not been adequately increased in the meantime the problem of the backlog and delay as described by Mr. Michael Greene in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, is becoming more acute. Whatever explanation the Minister is getting from his officials and from An Bord Pleanála, I suggest that he contact and talk to various sectors of the construction industry &mdash; the professionals &mdash; the developers, CIF or the construction committee of the ICTU.  In those areas where there is intensive economic activity, the experience on the ground is different from what the overall figures might suggest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2280" /> Let me go into this in some detail.  In the Minister's reply the national figures quoted include appeals in relation to household extensions in any part of the country &mdash; which is clearly important to the person directly involved &mdash; and major development proposals in those parts of urban areas that have received designated status.  It is my view &mdash; and I have experience at professional as well as political level &mdash; that not all of the local authorities in whose areas there are designated areas are facilitating planning applications or proposals.  Naturally some local authorities are exemplary but others treat such applications for privately owned property in designated areas without any distinction to applications from any other part of their functional area.  If the decision on the application is subsequently appealed to An Bord Pleanála there is no fast tracking available to ensure that the application will be processed effectively.</P>
    <P>I am saying there is a contradiction in Government policy if a deliberate policy of reducing public expenditure was brought about to reduce interest rates and thus induce confidence which results in increased levels of construction investment. The increased investment manifests itself in increased applications for planning permission in designated areas and elsewhere, and at the end of this long process, which has been very painful because the health and education services paid for the creation of confidence by massive reductions in their own areas, it does not make sense and it is not smart management to have an administrative bottleneck within An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The Minister could reply that my special plea for a fast track for the designated areas benefiting from tax incentives and other inducements, is discriminatory.  I would agree and it is for that reason that I am asking him to introduce a fixed time limit for planning appeals and by way of regulation to set down very clear criteria as to the method of communication and the time limits for third party responses when providing additional information and so on.</P>
    <P>In the relevant legislation passed by <Col N="2281" /> this House we have referred to vexatious appeals.  However, I do not believe that that section has been adequately or courageously used by An Bord Pleanála.  In fact, in some cases there have been vexatious refusals by the local authorities, but I know this is not covered by the planning legislation.  In addition to dealing with An Bord Pleanála, I would ask the Minister to consider writing to local authorities and asking them to respond effectively and efficiently to planning development applications and where possible to give a constructive response, in other words, a permission with a series of conditions, rather than a refusal with a series of reasons.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the overall merits of the development plan and the rights of the local authority to exercise it, if the Government are to reduce public expenditure and aim at creating a climate of investment geared, as is stated in their own manifesto and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to get the construction industry moving again, it will create enormous frustration if they do not move to resolve what is now a planning backlog.  This is not just my word, but the CIF which is not exactly a paid up member of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a great deal of employment in the construction industry both direct and indirect, and inadvertently, though certainly not maliciously but nevertheless inevitably, it is being frustrated and delayed in a manner I believe is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has within his own power, as I understand it, the right and authority first to make extra resources available to An Bord Pleanála, because that is fundamentally part of the problem, second, to make new regulations within the framework of the planning legislation <Col N="2282" /> including the legislation which established and amended An Bord Pleanála, and third, to streamline the operation of that board and the rights of third party appellants and aggrieved parties without in any way undermining or taking away the fundamental rights of citizens in relation to the planning process.</P>
    <P>I put down this question and the Minister answered on Tuesday and I have now made the points I would have raised by way of supplementary question had I been present.  I conclude by asking the Minister to bear in mind the constructive manner in which this query is raised.  It is not a negative criticism of the operation of his Department.  I am simply drawing to his attention what has been reported to me at political and professional levels, as to what exists in the real world in areas where there is a high level of economic demand and where unnecessary delays are being caused.</P>

      <P>First, I fully understand and appreciate why Deputy Quinn could not be here on Tuesday afternoon.  I want to put on record that I know the Deputy had personal business to attend to.  I fully appreciate why the Deputy has raised this matter; he wants a better system put in place if we can do so.</P>
      <P>The need for the speedy determination of planning appeals is accepted by everybody, and I have conveyed to An Bord Pleanála my earnest desire that there should be no unnecessary delay in the appeal process.  I have given time to this over the past two years, and I do not accept that any failures on my part have led to delays in the planning appeals process. I have been actively engaged trying to speed up the process.  Notwithstanding that, I am conscious of the needs of the board and detailed proposals submitted by the board are carefully examined having regard to such matters as the volume of work, existing staff numbers and the Government policy relating to staffing in the public service.  If a sustainable case is made by the board for extra staff, it will be sympathetically considered within those constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2283" /> I might add that my Department authorised the board to instal a sophisticated computer system in recent years to enhance their capacity to discharge their public duties effectively and efficiently. The board took the view that the installation of this system would provide for a significant improvement in the efficiency of internal operational procedures and contribute towards a reduction in the backlog of outstanding appeals.  It was envisaged by the board that the advantages and benefits would accrue in the area of achieving more and better results from the staff and from other resources. Therefore, the board have available to them the best modern technology to ensure that the job in hand is discharged properly and efficiently.  I have to state that there is no shortage of money as far as technology is concerned.  It is the board's stated policy that procedures and systems for handling appeals are kept under ongoing assessment and reviewed to ensure that all appeals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and all avoidable delays are eliminated.  The board also have a policy of ensuring that all cases where there is job creation potential are given priority and dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>I have met with the chairman and officials of An Bord Pleanála and conveyed my concern to them that there should be no unnecessary delays in the processing of planning appeals.  I put it to them that they should refine their procedures within their existing powers under the law.  The board's performance is constantly monitored by the Department and me in this regard.  Following a review last year of their procedures the board indicated to me that priority was being given to disposing of time consuming appeals involving larger developments. A specific programme for the disposal of all long term cases was also undertaken by the board with the objective of eliminating all cases over six months old by the end of last year.  This was met in large measure.</P>
    <P>The board have also taken other measures which should reduce delays in the <Col N="2284" /> appeals system generally.  Following the recent review of their procedures the board informed my Department that procedures under sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of the 1983 Planning and Development Act, relating to vexatious appeals and time limits imposed by the board for the submission of grounds of appeal and documentation, have been tightened up to eliminate unnecessary delays.  I personally brought that matter to their attention. Procedures are now in place which allow for the immediate dismissal of appeals if the appropriate grounds of appeal are not submitted in the first instance.  Time allowed to appellants and planning authorities for the submission of appropriate grounds of appeal and documentation is being curtailed to the minimum possible.  The board are also taking more time-effective measures in dealing with appeals against conditions as they are empowered to do under section 19 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>I have written to the chairman of the board emphasising that I expect their targets to be met and improved on in view of the effect that delays in the appeals procedure can have in holding up, as the Deputy quite rightly says, worthwhile development projects adversely affecting job creation.  The position has improved to the extent that by the end of 1988 over 95 per cent of appeals were less than six months old, the comparable figure for the end of 1987 being 89 per cent.  In global terms, the total number of appeals disposed of in 1988 at 2,369 was higher than the previous year at 2,237.  Naturally I expect the board to maintain constant vigilance to ensure that their performance holds up and continues to improve.</P>
    <P>The public perception of the problems caused by the appeals system appears to be somewhat distorted.  The statistics indicate that the appeals process is now being used less frequently in relative terms.  In 1987, the number of appeals was 7.6 per cent of decisions made by planning authorities in that year while it was close to 10 per cent in 1982.  Of the appeals lodged, third party appeals represented only between 20 per cent and <Col N="2285" /> 25 per cent of all appeals leaving a net third party appeal rate of only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of all planning authority decisions.  This is a very low rate of third party dissatisfaction with planning authority decisions and accordingly the board cannot be seen to be a major stumbling block in the development process.</P>
    <P>While the board can have tightened up procedures there will always be a small number of appeals which are delayed, for example, there is a need to hold oral hearings in certain cases.  The board have indicated also that developers themselves have asked in certain cases that appeals be held in abeyance pending the outcome of discussion or negotiation at local level. Very often this is the reason for appeals being delayed.  As a result of the steps taken by the board at my instigation last year the position at the end of March this year was that 56 per cent of all appeals were being dealt with within three months and 94 per cent were being dealt within six months.  I expect the board to make every effort to ensure that these performances are improved upon.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Quinn say that there is a recovery in demand in the construction industry.  It might be fair to say that increased activity in construction does not necessarily mean an increase in the number of appeals or increased delays.  It might very well do but if the trend is as I suggest only a very small percentage of applications are appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  I am hoping that this percentage can be reduced further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn also referred to vexatious appeals.  This is one of the issues I raised with the board.  They have taken steps to improve the position and are now dealing with this matter much more expeditiously than in the past.  I was surprised to hear the Deputy say that applications or appeals in respect of developments in designated areas should be fast tracked.  I would be disappointed to hear that planning authorities had not dealt with them as expeditiously as possible as developments in designated areas have contributed enormously to the recovery in the construction industry.  I <Col N="2286" /> am going to follow this matter up personally to see what exactly is going on in relation to the designated areas.  This will help me in another way in that at present I am drawing up a progress report, both for my own benefit and that of anybody else who may wish to see it, on what has been happening in the 14 designated areas outside of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no separate system to enable planning applications for developments in the designated areas to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that we should impose a time limit by way of legislation. I would be happy to do that for the Deputy if I could.  I think this would have been done by previous Ministers if it had been possible to do so.  The Deputy is privy to the advice given by the law officers.  It is not seen to be possible from a legal point of view.  I regret this.  The advice I have received is the same as that tendered by other law officers to previous Ministers and Governments, including one closer to the Deputy.  Everybody would like to do this.  I would, too.  I give the Deputy an undertaking that I will take another look at this matter to see if there is some way it can be done.  If we could do so the matter would be settled. It would be the easiest and most simplest thing to do.  I am stating here and now that I am willing to do so but I have been advised that it is not legally possible for me to do so as things stand at present. However, it is worth taking another look <Col N="2287" /> at it and I know I would have the support of the House in doing so.</P>

I will look into the few matters the Deputy has raised and pay particular <Col N="2288" /> attention to the possibility of fixing a time limit.  If there is any way I can do this I will.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am anxious that we get the best possible response from the appeals system.  It is in all our interests that there be as few delays as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the current uptake of the NMMR vaccination campaign to date throughout the country; the cost of this campaign in total; if stocks of the vaccine ran out within a few weeks of the launch in October 1988 and supplies from the manufacturer were unavailable; what he considers as an acceptable level of uptake for the vaccination when the campaign is complete; and if this target is not reached, the alternative arrangements which will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would refer the Deputy to my written responses to his questions of 6 December 1988 and 21 February 1989 relating to the MMR vaccination programme.</P>
      <P>To date the campaign has resulted in an uptake of in excess of 50 per cent nationally.  However, I must point out that in relation to children reaching 15 months since the commencement of the campaign, the uptake is in excess of 60 per cent.  As this group must be considered the priority group, the uptake is most satisfactory and augurs well for the success of the campaign.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total cost of the campaign will be approximately £4 million.  This includes the cost of the vaccine, the general practitioner fees and the cost of the publicity campaign run by the health promotion unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that sufficient supplies of MMR vaccine are available to all health boards to meet the demand for vaccination from the identified target groups of children.  However, due to the unprecedented success of the Department's media campaign there was a significant <Col N="2209" /> demand for vaccination among children over five years in some areas in the weeks following the launch of the campaign and this resulted in some local shortages. Steps were taken to alleviate those shortages and I am satisfied that adequate supplies of vaccine are now available.</P>
    <P>It is the objective of this campaign to achieve an uptake of 90 per cent within the target population.  Anything less than this would be regarded by me as being unacceptable.  In the unlikely event of this target not being reached, the situation will be thoroughly examined and whatever action necessary to achieve the desired level of uptake will be taken.  I would say, however, that the situation is under constant review within my Department, in consultation with health boards and the Irish College of General Practitioners. This continuous monitoring will enable any likely shortfall or decline in uptake to be foreseen and remedial action to be promptly taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Altranais exercised its powers under section 35(2) of the Nurses Act, 1985, when it decided to establish a Central Applications Bureau to process applications from persons wishing to undertake training in nursing.  The subsequent decisions, on (i) the method of operation of the CAB and (ii) to suspend that operation, were taken by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latter decision was taken because agreement on the nature of the operation of the bureau could not be reached with some of the health boards and a large number of voluntary hospitals.  As Minister, I did not wish to see a legal battle involving a State board under my aegis and a voluntary hospital funded totally <Col N="2210" /> by taxpayers' money.  I attended a meeting of An Bord Altranais and suggested that they allow the training schools to interview the candidates with a representative of An Bord Altranais on the selection board.  I made it clear that if the board were dissatisfied with the manner of selection in any individual case I would rigorously investigate it.  It is a matter of disappointment to me that An Bord Altranais decided not to accept this compromise and subsequently suspended the operation of the Central Applications Bureau for this year.  It was, however, in the final analysis their decision to take.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the consequences for the finances of An Bord Altranais, the setting up of various administrative structures to operate the Central Applications Bureau consequent to the board's initial decision resulted in certain operational costs being incurred by the board.  Additionally, the board is not at present benefiting from the fees which would have been payable by applicants had the CAB, been in operation.</P>

    <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the provision of new specialties at Cavan on the opening of the new hospital which represents a substantial upgrading of the hospital service for the area.  A paediatric service will be established at Cavan and in addition a new acute psychiatric unit of 32 beds will be opened later this year.</P>
    <P>The hospital will also have enhanced facilities in the area of coronary and intensive care which will significantly improve the standard of service available for patients.</P>
    <P>In addition hostel accommodation will be provided for families of very ill patients.</P>

      <P>The position is that up to 31 December 1987 the Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Baggot Street, was a voluntary hospital, managed by the hospital board.  On 1 January 1988 the Eastern Health Board, under licence from the hospital board, assumed responsibility for the provision of services at Baggot Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since January 1988, the facilities available at this hospital can be categorised under three headings: (a) Institutional Care &mdash; This comprises 35 long-stay geriatric beds, 15 respite beds and 13 GP access beds which were opened in March 1989; (b) Day Care Centre &mdash; The centre has 20 places and is fully operational.  It is orientated towards rehabilitation of the elderly and contains physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities; (c) Community Health Centre &mdash; A wide range of community services is now available at Baggot Street and the local office for Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages is also located there.  OPD, X-rays, speech therapy, an AIDS Drop-in Unit and a Child Psychiatric Clinic have been <Col N="2214" /> established this year and a unit for treatment of alcoholism is expected to commence in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with great interest the series of articles on the elderly by Kathryn Holmquist, health corespondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> last week.  The articles drew attention generally, in a very human way, to the problems faced by dependent elderly people and their carers, problems which were addressed in more detail in a report which I published last year entitled <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i></P>
      <P>I regret, however, that the articles were at times unbalanced and contained factual inaccuracies.  The North Western Health Board has already drawn attention in <i>The Irish Times</i> to the unbalanced account of the services provided for the elderly lady from Riverstown, County Sligo, profiled in the first article.  She is a regular attender at a day centre in Riverstown Health Centre and according to information provided by the board, has not had to pay for any medical supplies at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> A most misleading impression of the elderly's entitlements to health services was given in the final article in the profile of the elderly couple from Sligo.  I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of the elderly have medical cards &mdash; 69 per cent of those aged 65 years and over and 85 per cent of those aged 80 years and over.  The income limits administered by health boards are particularly generous to the elderly.  In addition, 21 per cent of the elderly are insured with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The number of elderly without a medical card and without VHI cover is, therefore, extremely small.  I understand that the couple referred to have appealed the decision of the North Western Health Board not to grant them a medical card and that the board is considering this appeal at present.</P>
    <P>The message of the final article was that the elderly couple in question could not afford to go to hospital because they could not pay the hospital charges and in particular could not afford a hip operation. I have made it clear on a number of occasions that health boards have discretion to waive hospital charges in cases of hardship.  With regard to hip operations in the North Western Health Board, there were only 37 people awaiting operations in Sligo at the end of 1988. I understand, however, that the elderly lady in question has not been referred for a hip operation.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the families of those caring for elderly relatives with dementia.  It may appear to them that health board services are unable to help them with their problems.  However, the impression given in the second and third articles that no services are available to people caring for those with dementia is inaccurate.  On the days that these articles appeared, I met two of the persons referred to in the article on a visit to Baggot Street Hospital where they are resident receiving respite care.  Respite facilities for persons with dementia have just been opened at St. John of God's, Stillorgan and others are planned.  Two physicians in geriatric medicine with an <Col N="2220" /> interest in the care of the elderly mentally ill and with dementia have been appointed in Dublin with a remit to develop services for this particular group of patients.  A new facility at St. James's Hospital, providing medical and psychiatric care for the elderly, opened last year.  Baggot Street Hospital, referred to above, is now a community hospital providing a range of services to the elderly and their carers in its catchment area. Last week I opened a new department of medicine of the elderly at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown which will greatly expand services available to the elderly and their carers.  While much remains to be done, progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Those who care for elderly relatives often have no income of their own.  The third article drew attention to their condition but failed to mention that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has recently amended legislation to allow the prescribed relatives allowance to be paid to the carer directly.  This will implement the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> and represents a major step forward for carers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to correct a misrepresentation of what I said to the Dáil about funding to implement the recommendations of the <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  I did not say that there was no money to implement the report.  On that occasion, I outlined the progress which had already been made in implementing its recommendations.  I said that other recommendations would be implemented as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I regret that these misrepresentations and factual inaccuracies marred this series of articles on the very important topic of the care required by our elderly citizens.</P>

    <P>In addition to a new purpose built theatre and recovery room, sanction was given for the purchase of equipment to update and improve ENT services for patients from Cork and Kerry.

      <P>The report of the working party on services to the elderly &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> recognised the importance of caring for elderly persons with dementia and recommendations were made to improve the service.</P>
      <P>Although much attention has been given in recent years to the increased incidence of dementia among the elderly, a closer analysis of the figures does not suggest that the problem will be unmanageable. The projected elderly population suggests that in the year 2001 about 20,000 elderly people will be suffering from a significant form of dementia.  Only a small proportion of these will develop a severe form of the condition.  Provided a continuum of care exists to support the elderly person with dementia at home for as long as possible, institutional requirements for those with this condition can be kept reasonably small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the immense strain on families caring for elderly relatives suffering from severe forms of dementia.  I accept the need for assistance at home from the health services and the need for <Col N="2223" /> respite care and institutional care during a crisis or when the affected person becomes unmanageable at home.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board recently appointed this country's first psycho-geriatrician with responsibility for the care of elderly persons with dementia to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.  There is also a locum consultant psycho-geriatrician serving St. James's Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital.  Respite facilities for elderly patients suffering from dementia are available in Baggot Street Hospital and in St. John of God's Hospital, Stillorgan. In other health board areas, patients suffering from dementia are cared for in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted in principle the recommendations of the <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  The report provides a blueprint for improving services for the elderly, including those suffering from dementia, in coming years.  Some of the recommendations of the report, particularly those concerning improved co-ordination of services can be implemented and are being implemented without additional resources.  Others, involving new services and facilities will be implemented as resources permit.</P>

      <P>am satisfied that the legislation concerned has served its purpose.  Under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984, no person may place a medical preparation on the market in this country except in accordance with a product authorisation issued by me.</P>
      <P>These regulations were intended to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of products on the market and in this regard the products were divided into two categories: (1) new products which required authorisation before being placed on the market, and (2) products which were previously on the market and which were to be reviewed on a phased basis leading up to 1 April 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the EC Directive concerned this review was intended to be completed by 20 April 1990.  In the regulations of 1984 it was decided to set a deadline one year earlier than that required by the EC Directive to allow sufficient time for <Col N="2225" /> application to be processed.  The current position is that in so far as prescription medicines are concerned, the review is almost complete.  However, in the case of the other products the review continues. These other products consist mainly of over-the-counter medicines including vitimin, mineral and herbal medicines in respect of which applications have been slow in coming forward.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed the position in regard to the availability generally of all unauthorised medicines and (1) have established a firm deadline by which applications for authorisations must be made, this date will not be later than 1 November 1989; (2) propose and extend the powers of enforcement under the regulations and (3) propose to impose on wholesalers an obligation to check whether the products kept, or offered for sale, by them, are the subject of product authorisations or, as the case may be, of product authorisation applications.</P>

The comments also reflect, quite correctly, the situation whereby Irish hoteliers face competition for tourist business not only from other holiday destinations but also from a range of visitor accommodation establishments in Ireland, particularly the highly competitive bed and breakfast sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following ten hospitals provide orthopaedic services which are solely or significantly of an elective nature: St. Mary's, Cappagh, County Dublin; St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cork; St. Nessan's Hospital, Croom, County Limerick; Adelaide Hospital, Dublin; Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway; Our Lady of Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene, County Kilkenny; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, County Meath; Tralee Regional Hospital, County Kerry; Tullamore General Hospital, County Offaly and Sligo General Hospital, Sligo.</P>
      <P>In addition, orthopaedic services for patients in trauma are available in all general hospitals providing accident and emergency services, or in the adjacent specialist orthopaedic hospitals.</P>
      <P>The approved number of consultant orthopaedic surgeon posts is 46, of which 44 are filled.  This level of staffing is in line with the manpower norms recommended by Comhairle na nOspidéal of one orthopaedic surgeon per 70,000 of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is sufficient theatre capacity to support the existing level of activity.  Two new additional operating theatres are being provided at Cappagh and will be completed later this year.  Approval has been given to the planning of additional <Col N="2232" /> theatres at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny: the provision of these theatres will create additional capacity for elective work at Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  However, in relation to waiting lists my Department are undertaking a detailed survey of elective orthopaedic services and the type of information sought by the Deputy is being collected and analysed.</P>
    <P>The preliminary results indicate that the number of hip operations nationally increased by about 10 per cent between 1985 and 1988.  The number of knee operations remained steady and the waiting lists for these operations decreased. Because of increased demand both for first and replacement operations, the waiting list for hip operations has increased.  It will be necessary to carry out a detailed analysis of the initial results before a precise figure can be supplied as there are some indications that there is duplication between lists and differing criteria with regard to the inclusion of patients on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of the new operating theatres already mentioned, new and additional equipment will be made available this year at the Adelaide and Meath Hospitals; an additional consultant post has been approved in respect of south-east Dublin; and additional funding of £200,000 has been made available to Cappagh to support a higher level of activity during 1989.  Purchasing procedures have been streamlined to enable additional prostheses to be acquired out of existing resources.  Discussions are taking place with the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland to explore possibilities for future co-operation which would further enhance the services available to patients.</P>
    <P>I regard the expansion of elective orthopaedic facilities as a priority and I will continue to have that priority reflected in the allocation of resources.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day running costs of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of State grants and contributions from local sources. The State capitation grant is not intended to meet operating costs in full. Each board of management is responsible, under the Rules for National Schools, for making arrangements for the collection of such funds locally, in supplement of the State grant, as will ensure that the school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in proper decorative condition.</P>
      <P>The payment of the capitation grant is regulated by the published conditions, which are of general application.  I am not authorised to make additional grants to individual schools.  The only provision for supplementary State assistance for running expenses is through the special fund allocated for schools serving areas of severe disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the appointment of a caretaker I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 33 on 15 February 1989.</P>
