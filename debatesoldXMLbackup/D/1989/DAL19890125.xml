      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of occasions on which the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have met since October 1988; if he will outline the main topics discussed at the meetings <Col N="2" /> and any decisions reached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for my statement in this House on 16 December last that the job creation targets of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will continue to be met was information on jobs actually created in 1988, on project approvals for 1989 and 1990 and on the pattern of job recoveries supplied by the State agencies and Government Departments responsible. It is the same evidence as was available to the Central Review Committee of the programme in their end-year review of progress on job creation on the basis of which the committee accepted that the programme's job creation targets would <Col N="3" /> be met in 1989 and 1990 as they were in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have met on three occasions since October last.  Two of those meetings on 26 October and on 30 November 1988, dealt with the committee's review of progress on job creation.  The committee published their report on progress in job creation under the programme on 10 December 1988, and copies of that report were made available to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>At their meeting on 11 January 1989, the committee discussed the basic elements of the national development plan being prepared for submission to the European Commission as the framework for Structural Funds financing in 1989 to 1993.  The committee agreed the basic elements, including the specific programmes, to be covered in the plan as was made clear in the statement issued after the meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm the basis for his statement that the 20,000 target in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> includes a figure of 5,000 jobs in tourism and can he tell the House in what way these 5,000 jobs have been identified, whether this is simply an estimate of 5,000 jobs or whether there is actual evidence that these jobs exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, nobody is in a better position to decide whether these jobs were in fact created than the trade unions and they were quite satisfied with the figures put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach if the trade unions were satisfied with the figures.  I was asking the Taoiseach if he could indicate what evidence there is that these jobs exist.  Does the Taoiseach regard the reaching of the target of 20,000 as an adequate response to unemployment in view also of the massive redundancies that took place in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be careful there because redundancies notified are not always reached in practice. The figure of 20,000 is our commitment. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> always adverted to the creation of jobs so the target in that regard was reached. Of course, with 240,000 people unemployed no figure really is adequate but there was a satisfactory reaching of the target set in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only assume that the target is met if there is evidence that these jobs exist on the ground.  May I ask the Taoiseach again what evidence there is to suggest that these 5,000 jobs in tourism specifically exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main source of that figures is Bord Fáilte who do an actual survey but we also have our own system of monitoring these figures; also that figure is generally agreed by all those in the industry who are responsible for the statistics concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that it is pointed out in the latest report that some of those jobs that are supposed to have been created on the tourism side are put in on the basis of a rule of thumb as to how many jobs there are in the retail sector for a given amount of expenditure or employment in tourism?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that those are estimates, guesses, and for them to be true we would have to assume that there was no spare capacity at all in any of these retail sectors and to that extent these jobs are only fiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  These <Col N="5" /> estimates are based on surveys, on investigations and calculations carried out by reputable agencies, organisations and economists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of reports issued by the Law Reform Commission since they were established; the number which have been implemented in full or in part; if any timetable has been agreed for the implementation of the remainder; if his attention has been drawn to the concern expressed by the president of the Law Reform Commission at the slow rate of progress and his expressed belief that the work of the commission could become irrelevant if new measures are not introduced to ensure that their reports stand some realistic prospect of implementation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy to the first part of the question is contained in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The numerous reports produced by the Law Reform Commission cover extensive and often highly complex areas of law.  Many of their proposals are already incorporated in legislation or in Bills before the House.  It would not, however, be practicable to fix, in advance, dates for the conclusion of the legislative process in every case.  The Law Reform Commission Act recognised this and did not embody any requirement of time limits, either for the production by the commission of their reports or for the taking of decisions on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of the commission are most valuable and useful and are carefully <Col N="6" /> studied by the Government Departments concerned.  The Government must, however, accord them the priority in their legislative programme which they consider appropriate taking into account the demand for other measures in fields not covered by the commission, such as initiatives concerning economic development and job creation, as well as financial, tax, health and social welfare matters.</P>

    <P>The Family Law Act, 1981 abolished the actions for criminal conversation, the enticement and harbouring of a spouse and breach of promise of marriage. It also provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the regulation of various questions in relation to the property of engaged and formerly engaged persons.</P>

    <P>The Building Control Bill, 1984, which lapsed at the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, has been restored to the Dáil Order Paper at Committee Stage.  When the Bill is enacted and the Building Regulations and the Building Control system provided for in the Bill are in operation further consideration can be given to the proposals contained in the report.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(d)  Report on Illegitimacy</P>
    <P>The Status of Children Act, 1987, which is fully in effect since 14 June 1988, provides comprehensively for the matters dealt with in this report.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(e)  Report on Age of Majority</P>
    <P>The Age of Majority Act, 1985, <Col N="9" /> which lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18 years (or earlier in marriage) came into effect on 1 March 1985.</P>

    <P>and</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(j)  Report on Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations</P>
    <P>The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, which came into effect on 2 October 1986, abolished the domicile of dependency of married women and provided that a foreign divorce would be recognised if it was granted in a country where either spouse was domiciled or if it was recognised in the country or countries where the spouses are domiciled.  It also included some consequential provisions related to these changes.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(h)  Report on Divorce <i>a Mensa et Thora</i> and Related Matters</P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987 which deals with matters contained in the report, was introduced as a Private Member's Bill in December 1987.  It was recommitted to a Dáil Special Committee on 29 November 1988.  The Government supports the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(k)  Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences</P>
    <P>The offence of &ldquo;wandering abroad&rdquo; in section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824 was repealed by section 28 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" />&nbsp;(l)  Report on The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Some Related Matters Proposals for legislation to give effect to this Convention are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(n)  Report on Offences Under the Dublin Police Acts</P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendations in relation to the repeal of a number of obsolete provisions governing offences of a road traffic nature and their replacement where necessary by more modern provisions under the Road Traffic Code are being considered for inclusion in the next Road Traffic Bill.  The Commission's recommendation regarding registration and plating of new vehicles prior to delivery is being considered in context of proposals for legislation to deter motor tax evasion.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(u)  Report on the Statute of Limitations</P>
    <P>A Private Member's Bill was introduced by Deputy George Birmingham on 3 March 1988 which is modelled on a draft scheme proposed by the Law Reform Commission in their report.  The Government have decided to support the Bill in principle subject to certain amendments, mainly of a technical or drafting nature, which the Minister for Justice will propose.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(v)  Report on The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters</P>
    <P>Consultations are in progress with a view to agreeing the administrative procedures to be followed for the implementation of The Hague Convention. When these are agreed and the <Col N="11" /> appropriate changes to the Rules of Court have been effected, the Convention will be ratified.</P>

    <P>The recommendations in these reports will be considered as soon as practicable by the appropriate Minister as a preliminary to consideration by the Government of the recommendations.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of the Government's current term of office, I instructed each member of the Government to advance the position and status of women in all aspects of their responsibilities.

      <P>In fact, on two occasions recently we have achieved the target of 50 per cent representation, and I am sure the Deputy would like to give us credit for that.  Unfortunately the limiting factor &mdash; which the Deputy should know &mdash; is the availability of suitably qualified women with the necessary level of expertise for particular appointments.  I want to assure the Deputy that every time this Government are making appointments we search assiduously to find suitable <Col N="15" /> women for such appointments.

I would not insult the Taoiseach or this House by suggesting that the experience and expertise of women as consumers would not be seen as suitable to allow them to be represented on boards.

They are not the responsibility of any individual Minister.  The general ethos of this Government is, if at all possible, to improve the situation.  As I said at the beginning, on every case that comes before us we spend a great deal of time trying to identify and find suitable women in every part of the country for appointment to State boards and for other appointments.</P>

Tá siadsan i mbun forbartha don Ghaeltacht, agus má theastaíonn uathu na cumhachtaí breise sin a fháil caithfidh siad cás a chur os comhair an Rialtais ag iarraidh céard iad na cumhachtaí breise a theastaíonn uathu.  Níl aon chás mar sin curtha os comhair an Rialtais.</P>

      <P>This is an important point for me and for the House.  The <Col N="24" /> 1979 Act clearly makes it possible, as the Minister of State said, for Údarás na Gaeltachta to request extension or changes in powers.  Is the Minister of State telling me that it is impossible under the 1979 Act for the Taoiseach, as Minister for the Gaeltacht, to bring forward his proposals to change the terms of that Act?  Has he any such proposals, yes or no?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11 and 56 together.  In order to determine the actual numbers of inward and outward migrants in any period it would be necessary to have comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State.  As such procedures are not in force the only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration, i.e. the difference between the inward and outward flows between successive Censuses of Population.</P>
      <P>Annual population estimates (which are subject to revision when the results of the next Census become available) are made in respect of mid-April of each year from which estimates of net migration can be derived for the 12 months to mid-April. The estimates of net migration for the 12 months periods to mid-April 1987 and 1988 are net outward flows of 27,000 and 32,000 respectively.  The estimate for the 12 months to mid-April 1989 is expected to be available during August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>When I appointed the new Authority in September, I requested the submission of its programme for 1989 with a view to bringing about the maximum degree of rationalisation.  I said the aim in formulating the programme should be to provide those services which are crucial to the development of the agriculture and food industry on the most cost-effective basis and to ensure an integrated research, education and advisory service for the agri-food industry with particular emphasis on expanding market opportunities internationally.</P>
      <P>Teagasc, which submitted its programme to me in December, carried out its examination against the background of the following key objectives after detailed consideration over a period of three months.  The objectives were the necessity to achieve the maximum integration of research, advisory and training services and ensure the long-term viability of Teagasc is secured; the need to ensure that all services are delivered in the most cost-effective manner and the importance of allocating resources and manpower in a manner which reflects programme priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> The main features of Teagasc's programme for 1989 are: the re-organisation and the refocusing of the agricultural advisory training and research services; special emphasis on education and training for young farmers and on food research as required under the legislation; a special advisory service for small producers; the establishment of six regional centres with enhanced capacity to promote special programmes of regional and national importance; concentration of administration in a single headquarters and a review of local advisory-training centres; the funding of capital works such as the new Food Centre through the sale of assets; the transfer of the research being done at present at Creagh and Beclare stations to Athenry with specific provision to set up a reserve fund from the economies achieved for designated western projects; retention of Lullymore and Ballinamore stations for use as transmission farms and advisory centres; more commercial orientation of research at Johnstown Castle; rationalisation of the Rural Economics centre, and recruitment of some additional staff in key areas and a reduction of staff in other areas, to be achieved by voluntary retirement.</P>
    <P>The programme represents the first phase of the Authority's plans for rationalisation of existing services over a three-year period so as to achieve maximum integration and delivery of the most relevant services in the most cost-effective manner.  The State grant provided for Teagasc for 1989 is £27.5 million.  I have indicated to the Authority my acceptance of the broad thrust of the programme for 1989.  Some elements such as extra staffing in key areas have to be considered fully and in detail, and the financial implications of the implementation of the programme will be reviewed later in the light of the progress achieved.</P>
    <P>The board of Teagasc is representative of all the farming organisations, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited, the trade union and staff associations, universities and educational institutions and is presided over by Mr. <Col N="32" /> Joe Rea, former President of the IFA and the Director is Dr. P. Ryan, former Director of An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the nub of the problem with which we are dealing is that he left Teagasc £11 million short of the required budget to carry out even the reduced programme he intended them to do?  Arising from that, would the Minister not agree that he is getting rid of 200 jobs in key expert areas within Teagasc, and would he further agree that arising from the cutbacks that have already taken place in this area, 60,000 farmers in the deprived areas mostly in the west as far as research and advice is concerned will effectively be abandoned by the Department because the Minister is closing Creagh and Beclare?  Will the Minister further agree that the research level now possible in Johnstown Castle will be below the base level necessary for research to be effective?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked me if I would agree, and I am just indicating that I do not agree.  In the first instance, the figures represented by the Deputy are incorrect.  There is not a shortfall of £11 million in the budget.  The Deputy will be aware that at the end of last year this House introduced a Supplementary Estimate of £8 million in respect of 1988 and there could not possibly be a shortfall of the magnitude suggested by the Deputy.  The Deputy, in his question, implied that I am getting rid of people.  The Deputy misunderstands the position.  Any redundancies in accordance with the Government's commitment to the partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be on a voluntary <Col N="33" /> basis only.  On that basis there is no justification for the suggestion that the board of Teagasc or the Minister, who is not directly involved, is getting rid of people. The Deputy will be aware that the staff can be reassured of that fact in the light of last year's experience.  In relation to the questions as to the capacity of Teagasc to deliver the service, it has long been an aim of successive Governments to have an integrated research and advisory service.  I feel privileged that the Government afforded me an opportunity to achieve that.  I am particularly satisfied that, for the first time, the board and staff of Teagasc have the capacity to do so. There is no question of their being incapable of discharging a service.  The only question that arises is how much they can expand on what they have already done.</P>

Would he also inform the House whether he has examined the position in Teagasc arising from health risks, lack of policy co-ordination, staff morale levels, and whether this constitutes the final cut in this area? Is the Minister aware &mdash; and will he confirm to the House &mdash; that the trade unions representing the workers in that area have stated publicly that the Minister, particularly the Government, and the management of Teagasc are in breach of the national understanding, in that regard as a result of the action they are now taking?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the serious problems facing grain growers as a result of the price proposals; and the plans he and the Council of Ministers have to change EC cereal policies to ensure a livelihood for our grain growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the price proposals for 1989-90 as put forward by the Commission would reduce the intervention support available to cereal growers.  I have recently had discussions with grower and grain trade representatives on the situation in the cereals sector.  During Council discussions over the coming months, I will, of course, do my utmost to ensure that the interests of Irish cereal producers are taken into account when decisions are made.</P>
      <P>The proposed green rate devaluation of 1.511 per cent at 1 July 1989 would help to offset the effects of the price proposals.  Of course, the refund of the co-responsibility levies to small scale producers will continue to mitigate their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present low inflation and interest <Col N="36" /> rates serve to keep input costs under control. It is now clear that maintaining cereal growers' incomes will depend largely on producing crops to meet the demands of the marketplace.  This would mean developing the already valuable malting barley export trade and expanding the production of quality milling wheat.</P>
    <P>All cereal growers will receive a refund of IR£2.09 per tonne because the guaranteed threshold of 160 million tonnes was not exceeded by 3 per cent, while up to 90 per cent of growers in Ireland will receive the full refund of £8.95 per tonne on the first 25 tonnes of grain sold under the scheme of aid for small producers of cereals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister appears to be fully rested after what must have been a difficult week.  The importation of cereal substitutes appears to be the single largest problem facing our producers who are not subject to quota or co-responsibility.  Has the Minister made any proposals to the EC delegation negotiating at the GATT talks to alleviate the great problems cereal substitutes are causing Irish cereal growers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is a separate matter I do acknowledge that it is one of the major issues that arises constantly in the course of the régime for cereals within the EC.  I want to assure the Deputy that I have been active, with some colleagues, in constantly raising this issue.  However, the Deputy will appreciate also that there are implications for the GATT negotiations in that issue and that we have brought to the attention of the Commissioners most directly concerned the need to achieve a proper balance between our obligations under the GATT and to protect &mdash; within the obligations of trade &mdash; the interests of our cereal producers. The Deputy will have noted the exceptional arrangements I negotiated last year for Irish producers, which were that 90 per cent of our growers are accepted as small producers for refund purposes which, to say the least, has mitigated the impact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The package which was proposed by the Commission to the Council of Ministers included proposals for a new permanent beef regime, New Zealand butter imports, Mulder applicants and other issues.  A package containing six measures, but excluding New Zealand butter, was finally passed on a Presidency proposal adopted by the Commission by a qualified majority of the Council after lengthy negotiations over four months on the morning of 24 January.  Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands voted against the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> While I voted against the final proposals, a number of significant improvements on the original beef proposals had been introduced at my request because of the unique importance of the beef sector in our economy.  These included:</P>
    <P>1. The increase of the 200,000 tonnes general intervention ceiling to 220,000 tonnes at an extra Community cost of £37 million in the event of activation;</P>
    <P>2. Two additional safety net clauses to take account of the price levels and trade patterns in Ireland.  Together with the original general safety net proposal, the new regime will now operate on the basis of safety nets with specific safeguards where only one general provision existed previously.  Purchases under these provisions will not reckon against the 220,000 tonnes ceiling;</P>
    <P>3. Producer premium payments in Ireland will increase by £7.5 million to a total of £48 million;</P>
    <P>4. A specific commitment by the EC Commission by way of formal declaration that the special dependence of Irish agriculture on beef production will be borne in mind in the various EC support arrangements in the beef sector;</P>
    <P>5.  A general undertaking by the EC Commission to operate the new system to maintain prices above the trigger levels and</P>
    <P>6.  A review of the new system after two years as distinct from the permanent régime originally proposed.  Under an earlier agreement of the Council of Ministers the adoption of the beef proposals will automatically involve a Green Pound devaluation next month with the abolition of Irish MCA's and an increase of institutional prices by about 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Together with the premia increases this will involve an extra £25 million benefit per annum to Irish producers.</P>
    <P>On New Zealand butter imports the Council did not consider this issue on 23/24 January in view of the decision taken at the Council in December 1988 to extend existing arrangements for imports <Col N="39" /> of New Zealand butter for a three month period after 1 January 1989.  The import arrangement to apply after 1 April 1989 will be considered further by the Council at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On Mulder applicants the agreement in principle reached at the Council on 23/24 January 1989 for SLOM producers provided for the allocation of quotas of 60 per cent of the eligible amount to applicants from an increase in the Community reserve of 600,000 tonnes.  This increase will be allocated through national reserves without any obligation from existing national reserves.  The main elements of the agreement are as follows: &mdash;applicants' non-marketing period must have ended after 31 December 1983 generally but because of our particular pattern of milk production, I obtained Council agreement to a date of 1 October 1983 specifically for Ireland; applicants must have complied with all requirements of the non-marketing schemes and applications must be submitted within three months of publication of the regulation; any allocations under existing arrangements will be deducted from quotas granted; applicants must satisfy conditions that their holdings can produce the total quantities of milk allocated and allocations may be withdrawn if 80 per cent of the quota is not produced in the second year; quotas will be granted on an <i>ad personam</i> basis and while they may not be disposed of, they may be transferred by inheritance; producers will not be liable for super levy payments for quantities up to the level of quotas allocated and will be refunded such payments as they may have paid since 1984; the milk co-responsibility levy for producers who delivered less than 60,000 kilogrammes in 1987/88 will be reduced by 0.5 per cent and the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 2 per cent from the beginning of the next marketing year.</P>
    <P>In my view, the agreement reached represents a reasonable compromise between the rights of SLOM producers and the protection of existing producers.</P>
    <P>The House will also wish to know that <Col N="40" /> the package agreed included an outline of income aid measures to assist Community producers to adopt to reforms of the CAP.  Under the arrangements envisaged, a Community contribution of 70 per cent will be payable in Ireland in respect of part of the aid proposed.  The devaluation of the green rate which I secured for the pigmeat sector will abolish MCAs from 30 January next.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 33 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by Teagasc in this matter and the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>In November 1985, An Foras Talúntais requested the Medico-Social Research Board to carry out a study of the appearently high number of cancer deaths among its staff.  Dr. Geoffrey Dean undertook a preliminary study and reported to An Foras Talúntais in April 1986 that, among the 28 staff who died between 1958 and 1986, 11 died from cancer.  Three of these deaths were from leukaemia, one from Hodgkin's Disease and four from primary brain cancer.  The report did not establish any link between the cancer deaths and working conditions in An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>In August 1986, Dr. Dean proposed a further study of the problem and An Foras Talúntais established a committee, which included three medical research experts to determine how best to proceed with the proposed study.  One of these experts reported in April 1987 that he could not then find a common thread within the Hodgkin's leukaemia group or the brain tumour group.  The committee recommended that An Foras Talúntais should await the results of related US research and that contact be made with European research bodies.  As a consequence, contact was made with agricultural research organisations in France, The Netherlands, Denmark and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of these contacts, and on the committee's advice, An Foras Talúntais decided that the best way of progressing the study was to link up formally with a proposed UK study of cancer incidences among research staff in laboratories.  The An Foras Talúntais data on the subject <Col N="44" /> were made available for the UK study. Teagasc intend to act on whatever relevant findings emerge from the US and UK studies following full consultation with the staff interests.</P>
    <P>In relation to disclosure of information, An Foras Talúntais took the view that, as Dr. Dean's findings simply established the causes of death of the staff concerned, detailed discussions with staff should await the outcome of the studies being undertaken elsewhere.  Meanwhile, Teagasc is taking all necessary steps to ensure that proper health and safety standards continue to be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is deplorable that the findings of this study, which was made available in 1986, were not made available to the workers, who were not made aware of the possible risks to their own safety? Would the Minister use his good offices to insist that the findings of this study be made available by Teagasc?  The view has been expressed that the base is too narrow and in view of this I ask the Minister to see to it, following the request made by the Academy of Medical Laboratory Sciences that the 1,000 workers which they represent also be included? The safety and confidence of the workers is at stake and it is important to act swiftly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the safety and confidence of the workers has to be the top, if not exclusive, priority for us. It is for this reason that consultations were held with all of the most reputable research organisations and the report was linked with studies carried out in other countries such as France, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom.  There was a need for Teagasc to gather all of the available information and data from the most reputable and professional organisations and to consult with them.  It was for that reason that no conclusive decision was called for at the time the report emerged, as at that time, no direct link had been established. Having said that, let us acknowledge, as <Col N="45" /> Teagasc do, that this matter requires the most detailed examination by Teagasc. There is constant medical supervision and analysis and I can assure the Deputy that the health and safety of the workers is of top priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice for bodies such as this to make the Department aware of all studies they conduct or of all issues affecting their staff. As soon as any apprehension was expressed I sought a full report from the director of Teagasc.  I have had a very detailed report and I am satisfied that the director and the chairman of Teagasc will keep me fully briefed on the programme to ensure the health and safety of their staff.  I am equally satisfied that the precautions they are taking meet the highest standards of any country.</P>

      <P>The inference I draw from the Minister's response is that Teagasc or its predecessor did not advise the Department and that the Department were not aware until this House became aware of what was developing.  Would the Minister accept, with hindsight, that such an investigation should have been brought to the attention of the Minister and the Department at the time?  Also, given the broad concerns and worries particularly for staff in Teagasc, would the Minister agree that the time has come to have an urgent meeting to discuss what new procedures and safety precautions might be taken on an interim basis while this matter is being fully investigated?</P>

I am glad to tell the Deputy that having had full consultation with the board and directors of Teagasc I am satisfied that the most extensive surveys are being conducted with international organisations, and that the health and safety standards being implemented in Teagasc are in line with or better than those applied in any other research area in the world.  I assure the Deputy, and particularly the members of the staff of Teagasc, that I will continue to liaise with the staff and directors of Teagasc to ensure that those standards are maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 19 and 43 together. The Commission's proposals for prices and related measures for agricultural products for 1989-90 were formally presented to the Council of Ministers yesterday. In general terms, the proposals represent a continuation of the restrictive approach which has been adopted towards CAP expenditure over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Apart from sugar where a price reduction of 5 per cent is proposed, common prices would be maintained at existing levels, but actual support prices would be reduced for a number of products due to the operation of stabilisation measures.  An Irish Green Pound adjustment is proposed which would eliminate remaining Irish MCAs and increase prices or offset price reductions by 1.5 per cent in the case of milk, cereals and sugar and by 3.25 per cent in the case of sheepmeat.</P>
      <P>The periods during which cereals, oilseeds and protein products can be offered to intervention would be reduced as would the amount and number of monthly increments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals provide for implementation of the recent Council agreement in principle to reduce the milk co-responsibility levy by 0.5 per cent for farmers who delivered less than 60,000 kg. in 1987-88. I do not accept that the proposals will <Col N="48" /> cost Irish farmers £45 million.  In fact, the proposed green pound devaluation will be worth at least £20 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The question of the Mulder case applicants does not arise under the price proposals.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals will be considered further by the Council of Ministers over the next few months and if adopted by the Council would apply from the next marketing year.  The proposals have only just been published and will, of course, require detailed study before a full negotiating strategy is developed.  My belief that farm incomes will be reasonably buoyant in 1989 is based on an expectation that market prices will remain strong and this view should not be invalidated by the Commission price proposals even if they were to be adopted as they stand.  In that regard, I will, of course, be endeavouring to see that they are improved.  My overall objective will be to seek to ensure that Community support arrangements continue to underpin producer income levels to the maximum possible extent and that conditions are created to allow the food industry to continue to develop.</P>

      <P>There will be no deviation from the overall strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> That strategy was aimed at the closely related objectives of bringing order to the public finances and of building up the economy.  It has been crucial to all the progress we have made to date.  The programme will continue to provide the framework for economic and social development.</P>
      <P>The problems that had accumulated in the public finances over so many years have been reduced but by no means eliminated. We are still faced with excessive levels of borrowing and debt.  We cannot afford to relax in our efforts to reduce them to more manageable proportions; we must further underpin the renewed confidence in the economy.</P>
      <P>Within this constraint, we will this year be strengthening the emphasis on the developmental and employment aspects of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We will be greatly helped in this task by the new resources that will be available from the European Community Structural Funds as part of the preparations for 1992.  This new opportunity must not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> We must also continue to make progress in improving the circumstances of the poorer sections or our community and in reforming the tax system so as to achieve greater equity and reduce the disincentive effects on initiative and work.  The creation of the conditions for increased employment is, of course, the most effective way to tackle the root causes of poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>In accordance with the practice initiated last year, I am publishing today, with the other budget documents, my Department's latest assessment of recent economic developments and an outline of prospects for the coming year.  This takes into account the effects of the measures I will be announcing later.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1988</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year saw a continuation of the economic recovery which began in 1987. The improvement in many of the key economic variables was better than anyone had predicted at the start of the year.  Output continued to rise, export growth was again very strong and the balance of payments surplus increased. Inflation fell to its lowest figure in nearly three decades.  Irish interest rates fell in the first half of the year and remained stable subsequently despite upward pressure on interest rates abroad.  With the help of the low interest rates and greater confidence in the economy, the volume of both consumer expenditure and private investment recovered and strengthened as the year advanced.</P>
    <P>Real GNP is estimated to have grown by 1½ per cent in 1988 and real GDP by 2¾ per cent.  The average annual GNP growth rate achieved over the past two years was 3 per cent.  This represents a remarkable performance against the background of the budgetary measures that the Government have had to take. Clearly, the economy is responding to the Government's strategy even more positively than we had expected.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty eight was a watershed <Col N="212" /> in terms of the economy's recent employment performance.  The preliminary results of the April 1988 Labour Force Survey, released last October, showed that the total number of jobs in the economy had increased appreciably for the first time since 1980.  Later indicators suggest that the improving trend continued during the course of the year.  For the first time this decade there was a reduction in unemployment, with the live register at the end of 1988 down some 7,000 on its level a year earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>The outlook is for stronger economic growth and an improved employment performance this year.  The international environment continues to be broadly favourable for exports.  Consumer demand is likely to rise faster than in 1988.  Investment is set to turn in the best performance of the decade, boosted by the extra resources from the European Structural Funds which will be received this year.  I shall be returning to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>Overall, growth of domestic output is likely to accelerate in 1989 to around 3½ per cent, while real GNP should rise by about 3 per cent.  This stronger growth should lead to a rate of job creation appreciably faster than in 1988 and facilitate a further reduction in unemployment over the coming 12 months.  Although more buoyant domestic conditions will result in higher imports the balance of payments will remain in significant surplus.</P>
    <P>Continuing restraint on domestic cost, despite the pick-up in inflation internationally, should ensure that the increase in consumer prices this year will not be appreciably different from the end-1988 rate of 2¾ per cent.  The more competitive we can make the economy, the quicker and better will be the results for employment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> together with Government policy generally, has turned around the economy's performance. <Col N="213" /> Everybody in the country has benefited in some way from the policies pursued. Low interest rates have helped firms, businesses, farmers and householders and have given a major boost to investment and employment.  The tax reform measures introduced by my predecessor in last year's budget, going well beyond the undertakings given in the programme, benefited all income tax payers. When combined with the pay agreements associated with the programme, they resulted in a real increase in take home pay for all workers last year.  While paying particular attention to the position of the lower paid, the programme's pay provisions were of considerable importance in securing an improvement in competitiveness and a further moderation in the inflation rate.  Most importantly, there was a reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government also went beyond the programme's commitments on social welfare benefits last year.  The increase of over 11 per cent in payments to the long term unemployed was an exceptional improvement to help deal with the difficulties of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Against the dismal employment performance of the earlier years of the decade, the programme's targets for job creation presented a searching test for the capacity of the economy and of the job promotion agencies.  It is highly encouraging that the target set for 1988, the creation of 20,000 jobs in manufacturing and international services, has been met.  A repetition of this achievement is in prospect for each of the next two years.  Outside the industrial area, more jobs are being created in tourism, horticulture, forestry and marine activities in response to the various sectoral initiatives taken.  Fears that the Government's essential action on the public finances was incompatible with job creation on the scale envisaged have been dispelled by the events of the past year. The Government have been able to bring forward, under the programme, specific measures to help promote the development of important sectors.  I will be announcing a number of additional measures today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> All in all, as the half way stage of the programme approaches, it can be seen to be working satisfactorily.  In conjuction with overall Government policy, it is contributing significantly to the recovery process aimed at restoring the economy to a sustainable growth path.  I am confident that 1989 will see a further advance.  The programme will continue to provide the vital framework for economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Budget 1988 Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>1988 proved to be an exceptional year from a budgetary viewpoint, with Exchequer borrowing falling to its lowest level since 1958-59.  The actual outturn for the Exchequer borrowing requirement was £619 million, or 3.3 per cent of GNP, as against a budget estimate of £1,457 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP. This reflects the success of the Government's economic and financial policies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>For the second year in succession the Government set ambitious spending targets in 1988 and have again brought expenditure in below target.  The end-year Exchequer returns showed that issues from the Exchequer in respect of non-capital supply services were some £84 million down on target, £5,576 million as compared with a budget target of £5,660 million.  This was due in the main to net savings on social welfare because of lower expenditure on unemployment, tighter control measures and higher social insurance fund receipts.</P>
    <P>The capital budget, too, came in below target.  Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes at £302 million was £30 million below budget, reflecting lower than anticipated spending and higher capital receipts.  On the non-Exchequer side, expenditure was a net £30 million below target with savings on house purchase and improvement loans and on the ESB's capital programme, partly offset by increased spending by Aer Lingus on fleet replacement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Special tax factors were also at work in <Col N="215" /> 1988.  Prime among these was the tax amnesty.  By the end of the amnesty period some £500 million in additional revenue had come in to the Revenue Commissioners.  This was indeed a remarkable outcome which contributed to the Exchequer's dramatically reduced level of borrowing last year.</P>
    <P>Welcome as it was, the amnesty benefited only the 1988 budgetary position. Favourable carry-over effects on this year's revenues, arising from some widening of the tax base and a general improvement in timeliness of payment, will be small.  Indeed, a considerable amount of arrears, estimated at between £150 million and £200 million, which would have been expected to come in this year, came in last year under the amnesty and is not available again this year.</P>
    <P>The other major innovation in 1988 was the introduction of self assessment for the self employed.  The results so far have been excellent.  Again the remarkable response brought in some £70 million more in income tax receipts than had been expected.  Unlike the amnesty, the improved revenue flow from self assessment can be expected to continue in 1989 and therefore can be taken into account in framing this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Some observers have attributed all the success of last year's budget to the improved efficiency in tax collection resulting from the amnesty and self assessment and have suggested that no real progress was being made in the fight to restore order to the public finances.  I want to refute this absolutely.  The figures prove otherwise.  Even when looked at separately from the once-off factors, the figures show that in 1988 we not only achieved the targets set in the budget but bettered them significantly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Borrowing and Debt/GNP Ratio</i>
    </P>
    <P>When allowance is made for once-off receipts of about £500 million from the tax amnesty and improved tax collection generally, the underlying Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1988 came out at 6 per cent of GNP.  This compares with a projection of 8.2 per cent in the budget. <Col N="216" /> The factors which brought about this result may be traced directly to the improved economic and business climate and to the continuing tight control of public expenditure.  Savings in our borrowing costs, directly attributable to the last two budgets, are one factor.  The recovery in indirect tax receipts, on foot of stronger economic activity and more spending power in the hands of consumers, is another.  The sizeable expenditure savings, including those from the reduced numbers on the live register, are a third.  I could give many more examples of developments that helped in the production of these good results.  Even allowing for the once-off effects of the amnesty and other measures, therefore, the 1988 outturn secured a further major advance in the Government's strategy on the public finances.  This advance will be continued this year.</P>
    <P>The debt-GNP ratio remained unchanged in 1988, partly because of the exceptional tax receipts during the year. The lower borrowing last year will, through reducing interest payments, have a positive impact on 1989 and future years.  Overall, during 1988, significant further progress was made towards the goal of reducing the underlying level of borrowing to a point consistent with a stable debt-GNP ratio.  However, the basic facts remain that the national debt rose by over £900 million last year and its associated interest costs remain a major burden on the Exchequer and the economy.</P>
    <P>BUDGET POLICY 1989 AND OPENING POSITION</P>
    <P>The underlying level of Exchequer borrowing has now been reduced by nearly 7 percentage points of GNP in the past two years.  This represents excellent progress. Nevertheless, it will be clear from what I have said that we cannot relax in our efforts to bring the public finances under better control.  The exceptional overhang of debt and the continuing large addition to borrowing each year, impose major constraints on the economy.  The cost of servicing the debt severely limits our ability to allocate resources for social <Col N="217" /> services or economic development.  Our foreign debt exposes us to the effects of adverse interest rate movements abroad.</P>
    <P>There is thus an overriding need to continue resolutely with the process of reducing borrowing and debt.  The action taken to date is the key to the current improvement in the economy.  Although the underlying level of borrowing in 1988, at 6 per cent of GNP, was even lower than we had in mind in the 1988 budget &mdash; by over 2 percentage points of GNP &mdash;the Government would not be satisfied to hold it at that level this year.  We are determined to reduce it further.</P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit, based on the published 1989 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, is £716 million, after allowing for the deduction of £40 million of estimated departmental balances.  The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement is £933 million.</P>
    <P>EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now turn to expenditure.  This year the estimate of expenditure on central fund services is £2,555 million of which £2,244 million relates to debt service payments. The latter figures shows an increase of £103 million on the outturn for 1988.  This underlines the point I have just been making about the continuing necessity to reduce our dependence on borrowing.</P>
    <P>During 1988, conditions for funding the Exchequer borrowing requirement were very favourable.  In addition, the unexpectedly high yield from the tax amnesty allowed us to reduce considerably the amount we needed to borrow.  For the first time in many years we were in a position to reduce our foreign debt and a total of £443 million was repaid.  This is a major advance.  The domestic funding programme was very successful, too.  The new confidence in the economy was reflected in a fall in gilt yields to their lowest level for many years.  We are entering 1989 with a funding credit balance of £527 million and with a high proportion of the 1989 <Col N="218" /> redemption programme for domestic national loans already completed.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in improving the overall process of debt management.  The programme of refinancing foreign loans at lower cost through swaps and other arrangements has been sustained aggressively with considerable success and the improving financial position here is, in turn, improving our standing in international markets. On the domestic side some further new instruments have been introduced and, as foreshadowed in last year's budget statement, the contribution from small savings has been brought back to a more appropriate level.  I expect that receipts from small savings will continue to make a similar contribution during the course of 1989.  Overall, the most satisfactory development has been the lowering of domestic borrowing costs, mainly as a result of the evident improvement in the management of the economy.</P>
    <P>The international interest rate climate is not as favourable as it was some months ago.  During 1989, however, there will be a continuing emphasis on minimising Exchequer costs through better debt management techniques and I am confident that further progress will be made in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Departmental Spending 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>The assertion by this Government of control over public spending has been the single most significant factor in the restoration of confidence in our ability to manage our affairs and the resumption of growth in economic activity.  This disciplined approach is apparent, not just in the very satisfactory outturn for 1988 to which I have already referred but also in the 1989 capital and non-capital allocations for Departments published in October 1988.  The Government continued with the two stage approach to settling the Estimates which proved so successful in 1987.  A policy based review of spending programmes was carried out in early summer, followed by a more detailed examination of all subheads in the autumn to eliminate over estimation and waste.  We succeeded in reducing <Col N="219" /> public spending plans by more than £300 million.</P>
    <P>In determining the Estimates for 1989 the Government were conscious of the need to ensure that the less well off should not be penalised.  We, therefore, concentrated our efforts on the elimination of waste and over provision, on getting value for money for State expenditure, and on ensuring that unwarranted and fraudulent recourse to services supplied by the State should be further reduced.  The result of this approach has been a further significant reduction in expenditure without adversely affecting the less fortunate sections of society and without undermining the general development thrust of our expenditure policies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Capital Supply Services Expenditure 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>The figure for net-capital supply services published recently in the 1989 White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure is £5,565 million, the same figure as appeared in the 1989 Abridged Estimates Volume in October last year.  In the light, however, of the end-year Exchequer returns for 1988 and developments since the publication of the Abridged Estimates, I am making some further adjustments to the published 1989 allocations. The result of the adjustments is to reduce the published figure by almost £26 million. Details of these adjustments are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> which is being circulated separately.</P>
    <P>The adjusted opening figure for non-capital supply services is therefore £5,539 million, or £5,499 million on a budgetary basis when estimated departmental balances of £40 million are allowed for.</P>
    <P>I now propose to make the following additions to expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Welfare Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>All commentators agree that a major cause of poverty is high unemployment. However, it needs to be borne in mind that, despite the sustained rise in unemployment over the years to 1987, the <Col N="220" /> value of social welfare payments to unemployed persons has improved very significantly, both in real terms and in comparison with take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The Government have already given, and will continue to give, priority to both unemployment and social welfare.  They are acutely aware of the plight of the underprivileged in our society, especially those who have little realistic alternative to dependence on social welfare &mdash; that is, the long-term unemployed.  A major priority of the budget will be to assist those persons who may not benefit, for reasons beyond their control, from the considerable opportunities which exist for growth and employment in the economy. The Government will ensure that those who must depend on social welfare &mdash; especially those with large families &mdash; are not denied a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>During the past two years, we have not only preserved the real value of social welfare entitlements generally but have increased some of the lowest social welfare rates by amounts well above inflation.  These substantial improvements were made during a period which required very difficult decisions on the allocation of Exchequer resources.  An example will illustrate this improvement: even before to-day's budget, a married person on the long-term urban rate of unemployment assistance with four children is better off by £10 per week now than in March, 1987 and I intend today to improve his or her position significantly. However, a balance must be kept between the level of social welfare payments and that of take-home pay of those at work.  It would be undesirable if the combined effect of the social welfare and tax systems was to create an incentive for people to rely on social welfare payments rather than to work.  It is socially and economically better that people are employed rather than remain unemployed indefinitely.  For this reason and because the Government recognise that relative poverty can exist at low incomes for those in employment, I am introducing in this budget an innovative and integrated package covering both the <Col N="221" /> social welfare and taxation systems, which will aid considerably those on low incomes whatever the source.  A primary focus of the package is low-income families with children.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the improvements which will be implemented.</P>
    <P>First we will ensure that the real value of weekly welfare payments generally and health allowances will be fully protected by means of an increase of 3 per cent which will come into effect in July. This will mean, for instance, that the rate of old age contributory pension will increase from £56.80 to £58.50 per week for a single person and from £99.20 to £102.20 for a married couple of pension age.  The old age non-contributory pension is being increased by £1.50 to £50.00. The widow's contributory pension will also rise by £1.50 from £51.00 to £52.50 in the case of a recipient under the age of 66 years and the non-contributory counterpart will rise from £47.60 to £49.00.</P>
    <P>In addition, there will once again this year be special increases for the long-term unemployed of some 9 per cent over and above the general increase.  This will give a total increase of 12 per cent or £5 per week, that is from £42.00 to £47.00 a week for a single man or woman on the long-term urban rate of unemployment assistance and from £40.70 to £45.70 for his or her rural counterpart.  I might mention that the Government are reviewing the definition of what constitutes an urban area or a rural area, as appropriate, for the purposes of the unemployment assistance scheme so as to extend, where warranted, coverage of the urban rate. The precise details of the revision will be worked out by the Minister for Social Welfare and the new definition will come into effect with the budget increases in unemployment assistance rates in July.</P>
    <P>The four different rates of allowances in respect of the spouses of unemployment assistance claimants are being rationalised to two rates, one for long term and one for short term.</P>
    <P>Last year we made significant progress in tackling the wide range of different <Col N="222" /> rates payable in respect of child dependants; we reduced the number of rates by half.  Further significant progress is again being made this year in this area.  The minimum weekly child dependant allowance is being increased to £10 a week. This will mean increases of up to £2 per week each in respect of the third and subsequent children of those on short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  This is a very significant increase amounting up to 25 per cent in the case of such child dependants.</P>
    <P>The special difficulties of larger families have also been identified as being in need of attention in the context of tackling poverty.  Accordingly, the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75, which is currently payable in respect of sixth and subsequent children, will from next October be payable in respect of the fifth and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widowers and Deserted Husbands with Dependent Children</i>
    </P>
    <P>The plight of widowers and deserted husbands who are bringing up their children on their own has been represented as being in need of particular attention. The Government recognise that many such persons require additional financial assistance.  Therefore, a new social assistance allowance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children, along the lines of the current non-contributory schemes for widows and deserted wives, will be introduced from next October.  This new measure will redress a long-standing anomaly in the welfare system.  The full details will be announced later by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Eighteen-Year-Olds in Full-Time Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a general rule, weekly child dependant allowances are only payable up to the age of 18 years.  This can cause some hardship, especially for long-term recipients. To resolve this difficulty, increases for long-term recipients in respect of their child dependants will, from September, be payable in respect of children up to <Col N="223" /> the age of 19 years who are in full-time education.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have also decided to address certain anomalies in the free schemes.  It is proposed to allow pensioners to carry over unused units from their free electricity allowance from one billing period to subsequent periods, subject to an overall ceiling.  This measure will be introduced as soon as possible, following discussion with the ESB on the precise mechanism for implementation.  From April next, certain EC pensioners living in Ireland will be entitled to the free electricity and other free concessions.  Certain occupational injuries categories of recipients are also being brought within the scope of the schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Fuel Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>Some anomalies in the free fuel allowance scheme are also being resolved. Heretofore, a recipient of long-term unemployment assistance could not qualify for the allowance if there was another unemployment assistance recipient or a pensioner in the household &mdash; on the basis that he was not living alone.  The presence of such fellow welfare recipients will not in future debar him from qualifying for the allowance.  This will come into effect from the beginning of the next heating season in October.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following a review of the family income supplement scheme undertaken pursuant to the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, improvements will be made in the scheme this year.  These improvements will be designed to induce greater use of the scheme and to improve further the incentive which it provides for persons with families to remain in employment.  The improvements will cost £1 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the social welfare measures will be £57.5 million in 1989 and £135 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" />
      <i>Special Income Tax Assistance for those on Low Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am also introducing an important set of changes in income tax, designed to help those on low incomes, which will play a major part in our co-ordinated drive against poverty.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I have decided to increase the general exemption limits from £5,500 to £6,000 for a married couple and from £2,750 to £3,000 for a single person.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low income families, the Government have decided in a major innovation to introduce a special addition of £200 per child to the exemption limits. This will apply to all those with qualifying incomes, whether workers, small shopkeepers, farmers or other self employed. This child element, which will apply exclusively to qualifying low-income families, is intended to target tax relief specifically at a group who have been identified as particularly in need of State support.  It will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on low-income families and towards restoring the reward for work among parents of such families. I should emphasise that the child element is not a reintroduction of the general child tax allowance which was abolished in 1986.  It is, rather, a means of increasing exemption limits so as to take many low-income families out of the tax net, or significantly reduce their tax liability.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I am increasing the age exemption limits by £300 for a married couple and £150 for a single person in the case of those aged 65 years or over and by £400 for a married couple and £200 for a single person in the case of those aged 75 years or over.</P>
    <P>The effect of these increases in the general and age exemption limits and the introduction of an exemption element for children will be to exempt 24,000 taxpayers with 46,000 children from tax altogether, while a further 41,000 taxpayers with 90,000 children will benefit from the marginal relief that applies where income does not greatly exceed the relevant exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Full details of this major innovation will be set out in advertisements which <Col N="225" /> will shortly be placed by the Revenue Commissioners in the national media.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of what these changes will mean for different categories of taxpayers.  A married couple on PAYE with two children, with an income of £6,400, will have their current tax liability of up to £425 eliminated while a married couple with four children and an income of £6,800 will have their current liability of up to £565 eliminated.</P>
    <P>These tax measures will cost £11.9 million in 1989 and £19.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Grant to the Society of St Vincent de Paul</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have approved a grant of a further £0.5 million to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in 1989. This money will be used to allow the society to undertake, in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare, a major development programme which will involve continuing the programme of home management and other courses and allow the society to expand their work employment projects scheme.  The payment will be made as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Samaritans</i>
    </P>
    <P>We are also making a special once-off provision in 1989 of £100,000 for the Samaritans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Housing for Homeless</i>
    </P>
    <P>Homelessness is the most acute and tragic form of poverty afflicting modern societies.  Last year the Government approved a special additional allocation of £3 million over three years to finance the provision of accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary bodies, of which £1 million was spent in 1988. Activity last year increased in response to the Government's encouragement and I have therefore decided to provide an extra £1 million this year for accommodation for homeless persons, making a total provision of £2.5 million in 1989 for housing the homeless.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Welfare Provision</i>
    </P>
    <P>This brings the total amount of money <Col N="226" /> being devoted to welfare measures to £71 million in 1989.  The full year cost of the social welfare and tax measures is of course much higher, as I have already indicated.  The Government are confident that this major initiative will go a considerable distance towards easing the problems of the most needy in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rape Crisis Centre</i>
    </P>
    <P>We have decided to provide £100,000 towards the restructuring of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Equal Treatment Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Special alleviating payments were introduced in November 1986 in order to ensure that the implementation of equal treatment did not result in hardship for certain categories of beneficiary.  These payments have been continued since then.  In 1988, the payments were continued for the whole of the year with some reduction in their level applicable from the same date as the implementation of general budget increases in rates.  The number of persons benefiting from these special payments has fallen significantly since their introduction. However, in order to continue to avoid hardship for the remaining beneficiaries, the payments will be continued again this year.  There will be reductions in the amounts of these payments on similar lines to the reductions which were applied last year; however, this will be done in such a way as to ensure that none of those affected will suffer a reduction in their overall benefit level.  The 1989 Estimates have already made an appropriate provision for this continuation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The current rates of social insurance contributions for employers and employees will continue to apply for the contribution year 1989-90.  As already provided for in legislation, the contribution rate for self-employed contributors will rise to 4 per cent in 1989-90. The earnings ceiling for contributions will rise in 1989-90 from £16,200 to <Col N="227" /> £16,700 for employees and for self-employed contributors.  As regards employers, the Government have reconsidered their decision, announced on publication of the 1989 Estimates last year, to increase the ceiling for employers' social insurance contributions to £20,000 in 1989-90.  In the light of representations made in regard to the likely impact of such an increase on industrial costs and, in particular, on employment, the Government have decided to increase the employers' ceiling to £18,000 rather than £20,000.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for the health contribution will be increased from £15,500 to £16,000.  The increase in the income limits for a hospital services card will, as usual, be announced by the Minister for Health at a later date.</P>
    <P>As is normal, the new ceiling for employers' social insurance contributions will also apply for purposes of their contributions to the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund and to the Occupational Injuries Fund.  The rate of contribution to the Occupational Injuries Fund is currently 0.5 per cent and this is not being changed.  The Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund is funded solely by contributions from employers. In view of the satisfactory state of the fund at present, the Government have decided to reduce the employers' contribution from 0.6 per cent of PRSI to 0.4 per cent with effect from April 1989.  It is estimated that the saving to employers will be around £10 million in the contribution year 1989-1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI for Public Servants</i>
    </P>
    <P>Finally, the Government have decided in principle to extend the social insurance cover of public servants and public sector workers currently on the modified rate of PRSI.  These contributors, who number about 160,000 and are in the public service and certain semi-State bodies, qualify at present for widow's and orphans' contributory pensions and deserted wife's benefit.  It is the Government's intention, in keeping with the approach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to raise <Col N="228" /> their proposals in the matter with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with a view to implementation on an agreed basis from April 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have been concerned for some time that the present child benefit scheme is entirely unselective.  In order to introduce a measure of targeting of resources under the scheme, the Government propose that, as from early next year, child benefit would be confined to families with incomes below a certain level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is disgraceful.  It is a shame.  It is typical of Fianna Fáil.  The Minister is talking about women at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This level will be decided so as to ensure that those higher income families who, by reasonable standards, do not need a State subsidy towards the cost of rearing children do not receive child benefit.  The date of introduction of these new arrangements is being set for next year so that the necessary administrative preparations, in particular the matching of child benefit and income tax records, will have been completed before implementation of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will reconsider that too.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Employment Scheme-FÁS Training Allowances</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme run by FÁS is intended to help older, long term unemployed persons by giving them work on projects of benefit to the community.  To ensure that the scheme continues to be attractive, the Government have decided that there should be an increase of £5 a week in the allowance paid on the scheme for single people and £7 a week for married people. In keeping with the usual practice, those FÁS training allowances which are linked to social welfare rates will rise in step with the general increase in social welfare <Col N="229" /> rates.  The cost of these increases, amounting to £1.805 million in 1989, will be met from savings elsewhere in the FÁS budget.</P>
      <P>
        <i>DION &mdash; Committee on Welfare Services Abroad</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Government are very aware of the needs of Irish emigrants abroad.  They have therefore decided to double this year the allocation to DION &mdash; the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, which works under the aegis of the Minister for Labour.  This will give a total allocation of £500,000 which will permit a substantial expansion in the work of the various organisations assisted by DION.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Education</i>
      </P>
      <P>It has been decided to increase the basic capitation grant for national schools from the current rate of £24 per pupil to £26.50 per pupil from 1 January 1989. This is the area of greatest need in the education sector.  The increase, which is over 10 per cent, will cost £1.5 million per annum.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Special Pay Increases</i>
      </P>
      <P>An allocation of £30 million will be made for 1989 in a Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions in respect of special pay increases.  This is in addition to the £12.5 million cost of the package of increases agreed for the Defence Force which is already reflected in the adjusted position for non-capital supply services which I referred to earlier.  I will return to the question of special pay increases later in my speech.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Sectoral Initiatives</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier I propose to build on our success to date in developing various sectors of the economy by announcing a number of new, carefully targeted, initiatives.  They will give a further stimulus to economic activity and job creation, and will complement the broad sectoral strategies already in place. In particular, they will complement the development impact to come from the major expansion of programmes aided by <Col N="230" /> the European Structural Funds which I will deal with later in my speech.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Environment and Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>The preservation and enhancement of the natural environment we live in, and the encouragement of our highly important tourism industry, are interlinked objectives.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was the first budget to make real provision for the solving of environmental problems.  I have decided to include in this year's budget a number of additional measures which will assist in the improvement of our environment, as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am setting aside £500,000 for a special programme of major amenity and environmental improvement works by local authorities at some of our larger beaches.</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am making available £250,000 as a major boost to schemes for the recycling of materials such as glass, cans, paper and plastics.</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am providing £2 million so that private sector works generated by the urban renewal programme can be complemented by a modest scheme of public works directed at upgrading the general environment in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>&mdash;When I come to the main taxation changes, I will be announcing a further measure to encourage the use of unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>With tourism specifically in mind, I am announcing the following initiatives. These are in addition to the measures already announced last week in relation to Cork-Swansea Car Ferries for the development of tourism in the south and south-west.</P>
    <P>
      <i>King John's Castle, Limerick</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing £100,000 to allow a start to be made on the restoration of King John's Castle and the surrounding &ldquo;medieval quarter&rdquo; in Limerick.  The total cost of the project is put at £3.6 million and most of the funding will come through <Col N="231" /> the European Structural Funds &mdash; £1.2 million of aid has already been announced &mdash; and the national lottery. The project is expected to be a major tourism attraction and a boost to business activity and employment in Limerick.  It is envisaged that it will be completed by 1991, the 300th anniversary of the Siege of Limerick.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Tourism Data Base</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Still in the tourism area, I am providing an additional £250,000 to enable Bord Fáilte to develop a data base on tourists coming to Ireland, including details of type of holiday taken.  The intention is to boost tourist numbers by increasing the number of return visits. Tourism businesses will be able to use the data base in order to target their marketing, thus making part of their promotional efforts cheaper and more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much for tourism in that.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Racing Facilities</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year a special allocation of £500,000 was made to the Racing Board to assist in the on-going programme of refurbishing certain race-courses. The investment programme is designed to improve facilities at race-courses for the general public and tourists. The Government have decided to make a further special allocation of £500,000 to the Racing Board this year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Sectoral Initiatives</i>
      </P>
      <P>While on the subject of sectoral initiatives I want to mention certain measures I am taking to help growth and development in the areas of industry and agriculture.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Merging of Firms</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, Irish firms have been small family owned concerns.  In order to <Col N="232" /> meet the challenges facing Irish industry, particularly in the post-1992 era, many firms will have to develop in scale so as to complete successfully on the export and domestic markets.  To this end, the relevant State agencies are being directed to pursue actively all opportunities towards encouraging the merging of existing businesses where this will help create units which can achieve increased competitiveness by economies of scale. Existing legislation already contains incentives in this regard.  Progress will be monitored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bank Loans for Young Entrepreneurs</i>
    </P>
    <P>At my request, the main banks have agreed to make available about £10 million at preferential rates to support the development of business opportunities by young entrepreneurs.  Details will be announced by the banks shortly.</P>
    <P>While the precise lending and eligibility criteria will be determined by the individual banks, the loans will incorporate the following features:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the banks will not seek personal guarantees or security over private residences,</P>
    <P>&mdash;suitable moratorium arrangements will be made for repayments,</P>
    <P>&mdash;while allocations will be at the discretion of the banks, each application will be considered sympathetically,</P>
    <P>&mdash;funding will be advanced at AA rates, which are normally available only to established business, and are below what would otherwise be charged.</P>
    <P>The principal objective will be to select projects which have a reasonable chance of success and, in addition to funding, advice and expertise will be provided to the recipients to maximise their prospects for survival and growth.  Loans will be targeted towards those projects which have the best chance of creating sustainable employment.  Special arrangements will be put in place in the banks <Col N="233" /> for the promotion and management of this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Community Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the Government are intensifying their efforts to alleviate poverty and increase employment, it is important that the business community who are early beneficiaries from the recovery in the economy should themselves demonstrate a direct concern for the most deprived amongst us.  With that in mind, I am today inviting the business sector to launch an initiative which would promote community development projects so as to help create jobs in areas of particular need.  I am already aware of a number of indications of significant support for such a move.  I look forward to learning of early developments with the proposed initiative which will be organised and operated by the business community themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Technology in Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following difficult years in 1985 and 1986 the agriculture sector enjoyed a marked improvement in incomes in the last two years.  The Government expect that with the improved confidence and increased resources farmers now have, they will increase the rate of investment in their enterprises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must not be listening to the two farming organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A pilot scheme designed to encourage farmers to use the calf-twinning techniques available under new technology is to be introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Under the scheme a subsidy of £20 per cow treated, up to a maximum of 1,000 cows in 1989, will be available to farmers approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The scheme will enable an assessment to be made of the feasibility of applying the technology at farm level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new measures I have announced today are indicative of the Government's continuing commitment to the development of the economy and its key sectors, <Col N="234" /> with the fundamental aim of increasing employment.  The creation of sustainable jobs is at the centre of this budget and indeed of all our economic policies.  The Government remain alert to all new opportunities for development.  I will be returning to this theme shortly when I am dealing with the European Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Adjustments to Non-Capital Supply Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net effect of these various changes and initiatives, in so far as non-capital expenditure is concerned, is to add almost £93 million to non-capital supply services, bringing the total to £5,592 million. I will be making one further addition at a later stage which will add £3 million to this figure.  Details of the adjustments to the allocations for individual Votes as published in the Abridged Estimates Volume are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i> These changes will be incorporated in the revised post-budget Estimates Volume which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Administration Costs in the Public Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The sheer size of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill at almost £3 billion and the significant extra costs which arise in relation to such items as travel and subsistence, accommodation, office machinery and computers require the Government to exercise strict control over the administrative or running costs of the public service.  They have been successful in keeping these costs down by determined action to reduce staff numbers, by measures to achieve greater efficiency and to end overlapping and duplication between agencies, and by negotiating a public service pay agreement which recognises the realities of the Exchequer's position.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Staff Numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The embargo on recruitment to the public service, which was originally announced in 1987 and repeated in 1988, will continue in force in 1989.  Only key vacancies may be filled and the filling of any vacancies requires the consent of the <Col N="235" /> Minister for Finance and the Minister responsible for the area concerned.</P>
    <P>The scheme of voluntary redundancy and early retirement, which was introduced by the Government in July 1987, has been highly successful.  Over 1,100 people left the public service, including the local authorities, in 1987 and about 7,500 more availed of the terms during 1988.  The offer of early retirement to certain public service employees over the age of 50 has now been terminated, and the voluntary redundancy package will be available in 1989 only in those specific areas where a surplus of staff has been identified or where further significant reductions in numbers are required to meet savings decided on in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Public service numbers fell by an estimated 9,500 during 1988, in large measure because of the impact of the voluntary early retirement scheme and I expect that they will fall by a futher 3,000 during 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Efficiency</i>
    </P>
    <P>The significant reductions in staff necessitated by our financial constraints make it imperative that the public service be organised and managed in the most efficient way.  For the foreseeable future, the public service must, like all other sectors of the economy, &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo; by continuously raising its standards of performance.  The key role in this process has to be played by management.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Adjournment, the Taoiseach referred to the contribution being made by the Efficiency Audit Group to the development of an efficiency strategy for the public service. I believe that a crucial element in any such strategy will be to find imaginative ways of getting organisations and individuals to manage better and of rewarding those who do.  I am proposing fundamental changes in the financial procedures governing administrative and running costs.  My aim is to try to find the right balance between, on the one hand, ensuring that expenditure does not begin to creep upwards and, on the other, <Col N="236" /> allowing greater delegation of responsibility to, and encouraging greater cost consciousness on the part of, Departments and managers.  I am examining the possibility of fixing administrative budgets on the three year cycle at a level which would involve a real reduction in funding each year because of greater efficiency but which would allow greater managerial flexibility within those budgets.  I believe that this could lead to greater motivation and release some of the dynamic talent that is widespread throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>The published Estimates for 1989 include £70 million in respect of the cost of the second phase of the 1987 Public Service Pay Agreement which was negotiated in association with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In broad terms the agreement provides for general increases of around 2.5 per cent per annum, with a minimum increase of £4 a week.  It also provides for the phasing of any special increases.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office in 1987 they were extremely concerned, as indeed were the previous Government, with the growing cost of special pay increases in the public service.  In his 1987 Budget Statement, my predecessor said:</P>
    <P>What happens to the (Exchequer) pay bill over the next few years will have a crucial bearing on the scope for re-orienting the balance of public expenditure more towards promoting growth.  The greater the share of State resources that the pay bill absorbs the less will be available, against the background of the overall budget constraint, for other purposes.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Public Service Pay Agreement recognised the Government's concern to ensure that the evolution of public service pay did not put at risk the budgetary and financial targets underpinning the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Since the agreement was negotiated, significant increases in pay have been recommended for key groups in the Civil Service, local authority and health services to take <Col N="237" /> effect on a phased basis in accordance with the agreement, and other major claims are in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>While the processing of claims such as these is in accordance with the provisions of the pay agreement, the Government are nonetheless increasingly concerned about the build up of additional special pay costs and the resultant burden on scarce Exchequer resources, immediately and in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The £30 million allocation for special pay increases, to which I have already referred, will meet the cost in 1989 of settlements which, however, could ultimately cost £150 million a year.</P>
    <P>A situation cannot be allowed to develop where there would be an unrealistic roll-up of increases both generally and for particular groups.  I have decided, therefore, to invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet me to discuss the whole issue of special increases with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the cost in 1989 of the package of increases for the Defence Forces recommended by the inter-departmental committee, whose report was adopted in full by the Government with one small adjustment, will be £12.5 million and that the annual cost of the package when fully implemented will be £25.7 million.  These costs are in addition to the costs I have already mentioned and are so substantial that offsetting savings including the closure and disposal of military barracks have to be made.  It should be clear to all that, in the general context of public service pay, the Defence Foreces have been treated as a special case.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, however, that containing the public service pay bill remains a key element in the overall strategy on public expenditure.  It would be in nobody's interest to allow a return to a situation where the amount of resources going on pay inhibited growth and made it impossible for the Government to achieve the necessary improvements in social welfare and taxation to help those most in need and create opportunities for employment.  We cannot throw away all <Col N="238" /> the gains we have made over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The provisions for the Defence Forces pay increase and other special increases, together with some minor adjustments to certain pay allocations which underpinned the published Abridged Estimates Volume, result in an increase in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1989 from £2,948 million as published last October to £2,995 million.</P>
    <P>I must refer here to the national discussions which have commenced on the proposed reduction of one hour where the working week is 40 hours or more. This proposal could affect upwards of 65,000 people in the public service and its implementation would have major implications for public organisations, particularly in the health area.</P>
    <P>The group examining this issue are continuing their work and I would hope that a resolution of this matter can be found which will be in accord with the budgetary and other constraints that have to apply in all areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL BUDGET</P>
    <P>The 1989 Summary Public Capital Programme published last October set PCP expenditure at £1,319 million.  As in the case of non-capital expenditure, developments since the publication of the summary PCP require an upward revision to be made to the published figure.  The net impact, including those capital expenditure items in the initiatives I outlined earlier, is to add £15 million to the published figure, bringing the opening 1989 public capital programme position to £1,334 million.  Details of these changes are also set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>County and Regional Roads</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government consider that county and regional roads are extremely important for all aspects of rural development, including tourism, industry, agriculture and forestry.  For this reason, I am announcing a targeted three year programme totalling £150 million for works on these roads.  The published Estimate <Col N="239" /> includes £37.4 million Exchequer funding for the improvement, management and maintenance of these roads and I am adding £10 million to this for additional capital funding, making a total of £47.4 million in 1989.  We will explore with the EC Commission the question of the extent to which Structural Fund moneys will be available to assist these programmes.</P>
    <P>This change adds a further £10 million to the opening position, and the revised PCP is, therefore, set at £1,344 million, excluding the additional European Structural Fund measures which I am about to outline.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>For 1989 I have decided to make a provision of £30 million to cover non-programme outlays.  This allocation will allow the Government to meet essential financial restructuring costs of State-sponsored bodies where these prove necessary, as well as other miscellaneous capital payments.  The reduced need to provide for financial restructuring of State enterprises is clear evidence of the improved financial management and performance of the State sector in recent years.</P>
    <P>DEVELOPMENT PLAN</P>
    <P>The preparation of a development plan designed to enable us to accelerate the development of our economy in partnership with the European Community is nearing completion.  The plan will set out the Government's strategy for maximising use of the increased funding which will result from the decision to increase the resources of the Structural Funds.  It will play a pivotal part in the building up of the economy over the next five years.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is classified as a single region for European Structural Fund purposes, the Government decided to set up an extensive local consultative process on the preparation of the sub-national programmes which will set out the <Col N="240" /> detailed implementation of the development strategy adopted in the plan.  The purpose of this is to ensure that local interests will have an input into the programmes. Through the Department of Finance, who provide the chairmanship and secretariat for the seven working groups that are drawing up the sub-national programmes, the local interests have a direct line of communication to the Government.</P>
    <P>The national plan will be formally submitted to the European Commission not later than 31 March next.  The proposals in it will then have to be examined by Commission staff to ensure that they comply with the regulations governing the three Structural Funds.  The Commission will then establish what is known as the Community Support Framework which will set out the priorities for Community assistance and an indicative financing plan.</P>
    <P>Given the need to avoid any delay in the commencement of the development measures to be undertaken, the Government have had consultations with the Commission in advance of the completion of the development plan.  These discussions were held under the special procedures agreed between the Taoiseach and President Delors last October. The general approach proposed was outlined to the Commission and their agreement obtained to it, including the objectives to be set and the particular sectors on which the development measures would concentrate.  The Commission also welcomed the arrangements for the preparation of sub-national programmes which I have already described.</P>
    <P>The Commission, understandably, could not give any formal commitment to the level of funding which will be available to Ireland in 1989 or future years in advance of consideration of the full plan. However, the increased resources which have been provided in the Community budget for 1989 for the Structural Funds, and the commitment to greater concentration of these resources on the less developed regions, including Ireland, provide a basis on which we can prudently expect an increase of not less than £75 <Col N="241" /> million in commitments for Ireland for 1989 from the European Regional Development Fund.  This will bring our total commitments this year from that fund to about £200 million.</P>
    <P>This expected increase in commitments was not taken into account in the Estimates and Public Capital Programme published last October, since the Community budget and the new regulations governing the Structural Funds had not been finalised at that stage.  I am, therefore, making the necessary financial provision in this budget to enable additional development measures which we propose to undertake this year under the plan to go ahead.  The additional expenditures relate to measures which come under the Regional Fund.  It would not be appropriate this year to provide for additional resources coming from the Social Fund or FEOGA Guidance Fund, since these two funds will not be changed over in full to the new regime until 1990.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, providing for additional direct Exchequer expenditure of £60.5 million this year on measures which we are confident will obtain approval for increased aid from the European Regional Development Fund, as follows; £34 million for road improvements; £10 million for sanitary services; £11.5 million for industrial promotion and for marketing support for industry and technology development; this includes a special development programme for the Tallaght area; £3.5 million for tourism projects and £1.5 million for fishery harbour development.  Of the additional expenditure of £60.5 million, a sum of £3 million, relating to marketing support for industry, is non-capital.</P>
    <P>In addition to the tourism measures which I referred to earlier, it is proposed that a new scheme of grant assistance for the tourism sector will receive funding of £14.5 million direct from the ERDF without involving the Exchequer.  This will help the development of new tourism products, such as outdoor pursuit and activity centres, recreational facilities in resorts, marine facilities and cultural centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> This allocation of additional resources in 1989 constitutes a mixture of infrastructural and directly productive measures. The additional expenditure on roads will meet a widely perceived need to improve our road network and will facilitate the movement of goods within Ireland and to destinations abroad.  The expenditure on sanitary services will support industrial development as well as improving the environment.  The tourism measures are an indication of the importance which the Government attach to this growth area and their determination to achieve the job creation potential of this sector.  In the case of industry most of the additional funds will be devoted to marketing and technology development. This will enable deficiencies of Irish industry in these two vital areas to be tackled, with major beneficial effects on job creation and exports.  The allocation for fishery harbours will enable necessary development works to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Further details are set out in a separate table in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  The necessary provisions will also be made in the Revised Estimates and Public Capital Programme to be published in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The development plan will give a major impetus to employment over the next few years.  The implementation of the Structural Fund measures announced today will, in itself, provide a considerable stimulus to employment in the near term.  Taking account of the spin-off benefits to domestic activity at large, the increased expenditure should result in the creation of an extra 3,000 jobs in 1989.</P>
    <P>Even when support from the Structural Funds has been committed, some timelag is inevitable before the full European contribution is received.  It is, therefore, necessary, in allocating funds from the Exchequer, to assess for budgetary purposes the future pattern of Community payments.  I am satisfied that, on the basis of the new Structural Funds Regulations now adopted and the additional expenditures being undertaken, Exchequer receipts from the ERDF will increase by £48 million as compared with the pre-budget estimate.  I have also allowed, in <Col N="243" /> the current budget, for revenue bouyancy effects.  The estimated impact of the expanded activities of the ERDF in 1989 on the budgetary arithmetic is, therefore, neutral.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of the resources of the Structural Funds we are now embarking on an exceptional new phase which will greatly assist the Government in their efforts to increase growth and sustainable job creation in the economy, and to prepare it for the completion of the internal market in 1992.  The Government are determined to make maximum use of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>TAXATION</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the overall thrust of tax policy.  Considerable restructuring and reform of the tax system have taken place in the past year.  Tax administration and collection have been greatly imporved.  We were also able to make significant progress, in line with the commitments given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, in reducing the burden of personal taxation.  More, however, needs to be done.  There is now widespread agreement, both within this House and outside it, that the level of income tax is acting as a major disincentive to initiative and hampering the drive to increase employment.  It is also a definite cause of emigration for many of our young skilled people who, if they remained here, might be able to create jobs for others at home.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to think that we can solve this problem quickly.  The money is simply not available to do so.  The progress we have made in reducing borrowing and stabilising the debt burden has been hard-won.  The Government will not contemplate any reversal of this progress. Nevertheless, in the interest of employment and of equity we must move now to ease the tax burden.  The room for manoeuvre is narrow and, therefore, some of the cost must be met by offsetting changes within the income tax area.  The balanced package of changes that I am announcing today represents substantial progress within the overall context of <Col N="244" /> reducing the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement again this year.</P>
    <P>INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the significant changes we are making to help those on low incomes.  The Government have decided also that the time has come to start reducing our excessive rates of personal taxation.  The changes we are making are as follows:</P>
    <P>the standard rate of income tax, which has stood unchanged at 35 per cent for more than 20 years, is being reduced to 32 per cent.  This reduced rate will also apply to the withholding tax on professional fees and deposit interest retention tax;</P>
    <P>the standard rate tax band is being widened from £11,400 to £12,200 for a married couple and from £5,700 to £6,100 for a single person;</P>
    <P>the 48 per cent tax band being widened from £5,800 to £6,200 for a married couple and from £2,900 to £3,100 for a single person;</P>
    <P>the 58 per cent tax rate is being reduced to 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of what these changes will mean for different categories of taxpayers:</P>
    <P>a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £235;</P>
    <P>a married couple with an income of £16,000 will gain up to £324;</P>
    <P>a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £470.</P>
    <P>Further details of the income tax changes, showing the impact on different income categories, are contained in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These income tax measures are expensive and I have had to look to specific reliefs in the income tax code for a contribution to their cost.  Mortgage interest relief is estimated to cost some £165 million in terms of tax revenue foregone in the 1989-90 tax year.  When the 90 per cent limit was introduced into this <Col N="245" /> relief in 1987, the mortgage interest rate was 12.5 per cent.  It is now 8.25 per cent.  I, therefore, propose a further small reduction in the cost of the relief by reducing the limit from 90 to 80 per cent. This will mean a small reduction in the relief available to all claimants; the greatest reduction will be for those who are currently benefiting most.  The relief will still be very generous and at the present mortgage rate will be, at maximum, the equivalent of full relief on a loan of nearly £39,000.</P>
    <P>The relief on life assurance premiums is also expensive.  It is estimated to cost some £48 million in the coming tax year, despite a number of existing restrictions on it.  The tax treatment of life assurance is generous and I propose to curtail the current income tax relief to 80 per cent of its existing level in respect of premiums paid on or after 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The specified interest rate, currently 12 per cent, used to calculate the benefit-in-kind from loans at preferential rates of interest, is being reduced to 10 per cent for mortgage loans to take account of the reduction in commercial interest rates.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the income tax measures I have just announced is estimated at £109.7 million in 1989 and £182.9 million in a full year.  I should add that the PRSI tax allowance is being renewed at an estimated cost of £51.1 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>The impact of this package of income tax reliefs will be dramatic.  All taxpayers will benefit.  There will be a particular benefit to lower income taxpayers with family responsibilities.  The percentage of taxpayers on the standard rate will be maintained at nearly 63 per cent.  Most important of all, the marginal tax rate faced by over 600,000 taxpayers will fall. It will support the income moderation measures agreed in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, will increase the reward for initiative and effort and will put more people at work.</P>
    <P>INDIRECT TAXATION</P>
    <P>I have had many representations about <Col N="246" /> the 1992 indirect tax harmonisation proposals put forward by the European Commission.  These proposals have received considerable publicity and many trade interests as well as members of the general public are naturally wondering how they should begin to accommodate to the expected changes in their future planning.  In particular the need for phasing-in any changes has been stressed to me, in the interests of orderly planning and marketing, particularly in such areas as car sales and leasing.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully conscious of these concerns and will be anxious to do everything possible to facilitate planning for 1992.  The fact remains, however, that there is no agreement at this stage at Community level even on the degree of harmonisation needed to enable the internal market to function effectively, never mind on the specific rates or bands to apply to particular taxes.  Discussions are to resume shortly but it is clear that we have a considerable distance to go before agreed proposals for indirect tax harmonisation emerge.  It would be premature, therefore, for us to commence any general restructuring of our VAT and excise regimes on the basis of the existing proposals.  The likelihood is that considerable change will occur in the present proposals in order to accommodate the difficulties and problems of the various member states.  As is well known, any move in the context of 1992 to rates of VAT and excise based on EC averages will entail for the Irish Exchequer very substantial revenue losses.  The excise proposals create particular problems for us.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming discussions we will expect the Commission to put forward suggestions as to how the difficult transition to a new regime can be eased for us. Contrary to suggestions that have been made, the Government are not basing their approach to this problem on seeking long term derogations from the proposals. We do not want to opt out of Europe or fall behind in the opening up of the internal market.  The internal market presents great opportunities for this <Col N="247" /> country and some degree of tax harmonisation or approximation is an essential part of it.</P>
    <P>We will be anxious to secure early settlement of the package.  I would like, however, to emphasise that any changes to our indirect tax regime arising from these proposals will be made so as to minimise disruption to producers, distributors, consumers and the public finances.  There will be no overnight changes. I envisage in particular that any substantial fall in excise duties finally agreed upon will not be precipitate but will have to be phased in over a number of years along with any offsetting measures to replace lost revenue.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General approach this year</i>
    </P>
    <P>Given the priority we are according to reducing further the burden of income tax, there is an obvious temptation to meet part of the cost by imposing substantial increases in indirect taxes.  I have, however, resisted this because of the implications for 1992 and for the general level of costs in the economy.  The approach I have adopted is to minimise the increases, which in fact will apply mainly to excise rates.</P>
    <P>EXCISE</P>
    <P>In two successive budgets there have been no increases in the excise duties applicable to alcoholic beverages.  This has been a very positive contribution by the Government to the holding down of prices.  Nevertheless, prices have continued to rise as a result of trade increases, including some quite recently. I have decided that the time has come to increase the duty on these items but to confine the increase to what is required to index the duty in line with the current rate of inflation.  The adjustments which I propose, inclusive of the consequential VAT element, are as follows:</P>

      <P>A price reduction that would otherwise be warranted by price movements in the oil market will offset the duty increase on petrol.

Accordingly, I am taking this opportunity to inform the House that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will be announcing measures designed to bring about a substantial reduction in the amount of evasion of road tax and car insurance.

This year, as a complementary step to the measures being taken by the Minister for the Environment, to increase awareness among the public generally of the advantages of this fuel, I have decided to go further. The increase of 5p I have announced in the excise duty applicable to petrol will not apply to lead free petrol.  This will enable unleaded petrol to enjoy a favourable price differential <i>vis-á-vis</i> leaded petrol and will, I hope, encourage a further stepping-up by the industry of its programme of expanding outlets for this fuel.</P>

      <P>VAT</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, value-added tax has proved a highly successful means of levying tax and it now forms, after income tax, the biggest generator of revenue for the Exchequer.  The existing rate structure, which has remained virtually intact for four years now, is, I am satisfied, a well-balanced one and, for the reasons already explainaed, I do not propose today to make any major changes to it.  I have, however, a couple of amendments to the existing scheme.</P>

    <P>There has been considerable concern expressed in recent years about the steady outflow of works of art for sale abroad and particular mention has been made of the impediment which VAT at 25 per cent represents to their reimportation. In order to facilitate the retention and relocation in Ireland of works of art over 100 years old I propose to reduce the VAT rate on their sale and importation to 10 per cent.  A new zero rate is not possible under EC rules.  The reduction to 10 per cent will take effect from 1 July next and will cost the Exchequer £0.3 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has again been discussion in recent weeks about the type of taxation system that should apply to farmers.  The Government considered this question at length prior to the 1987 budget and decided that the only equitable solution was to treat farmers in the same manner as other sections of the community, that is by taxing them on actual income.  This is now settled policy.  The Government are satisfied that it is the correct approach and there will be no departure from it. We have taken steps to extend the income tax system to all farmers who are likely to have taxable incomes, to simplify the procedures for farmers as much as possible and to improve the assessment and collection arrangements. In 1988 the yield from income tax on farmers was about £80 million.  This is more than double the amount for 1987. A large part of the increase in yield over the 1988 budget estimate of £42 million is a result of the clearance of arrears under the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>In the last two budgets the Government reduced the level of flat-rate VAT refund paid to unregistered farmers on their sales.  The rate is now 1.4 per cent as against 2.4 per cent in 1986.  The reduction in the 1988 budget was made because of the amounts of arrears of health contributions and levies outstanding from farmers.  My predecessor promised to review this reduction in the light of performance through the year <Col N="251" /> on the payment of these arrears.  I am satisfied that as a result of the amnesty and improved tax collection generally a significant improvement has occurred in this area.  Following the promise made by my predecessor to review the position, I am increasing the flat-rate refund to 2 per cent with effect from 1 March.  This will cost £12 million this year.</P>

      <P>Stock relief for farmers is being renewed for a further two years and the clawback period in respect of destocking is being reduced from ten to seven years in respect of increases in stock values which occur after 5 April 1989.  I am taking these measures to give a stimulus to the increase already under way in the size of the national beef-cattle herd.  This will both increase farm output and help the meat processing industry. The cost of the renewal of stock relief is estimated as £0.8 million in 1989.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Corporation Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>Major changes were made in 1988 in the corporation tax system involving in particular the reduction in the standard rate of tax to 43 per cent from 1 April next and a parallel reduction in the rate of first year accelerated capital allowances from 100 per cent to 50 per cent.  No further changes in the tax rates and accelerated capital allowances are at present envisaged but I will review the position in the 1990 budget.</P>
      <P>The threshold for capital allowances and for allowable running expenses in respect of motor cars used for business purposes is being increased from £6,000 to £7,000.  This increase will apply to capital allowances for cars provided after today and, in the case of running expenses, to expenses incurred after today.  The cost of the change in 1989 will be £0.3 million and the full year cost, which will not arise until 1991, will be £7 million.  The change will be of benefit to the motor industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost all the corporation tax from <Col N="252" /> life assurance companies is paid at a special rate of 35 per cent, which rate has been linked in legislation to the standard rate of income tax.  This is 8 per cent lower than the rate of corporation tax that will apply to banks and building societies from 1 April next.  This 35 per cent rate was not increased in the reform of the corporation tax system carried out last year in recognition of the special circumstances of life assurance business. There will, therefore, be no change in the 35 per cent rate for life assurance companies as a result of the reduction in the standard rate of income tax to 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>The bank levy is being continued for 1989 at its 1988 level of £36 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Administration and Enforcement</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1988 there were dramatic improvements in tax administration and enforcement. For many years there has been a widespread perception of the tax assessment and collection system as being ineffective. Decisive action was needed.  The two pivotal measures introduced in 1988 &mdash; the tax amnesty and self-assessment for self-employed taxpayers&mdash;have been dramatically successful.  The overall effect has been to clear huge amounts of tax arrears, improve the timeliness of payments and generally to place the tax assessment and collection system on a much sounder footing.</P>
    <P>The Government are intent on further development of the self-assessment system.  It has been decided, therefore, that self-assessment, which at present applies only to the self-employed, will be extended to companies this year.  The effective date of this extension will be announced later; it is likely to be towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As things stand, self-computation of final tax liability is optional rather than mandatory for the self-employed under the self-assessment system, and this will also be the case for companies in the first instance.  In a fully developed system self-computation of final liability would be mandatory for all taxpayers.  The Government hope to move towards such a system in 1990.  In the meantime, to <Col N="253" /> facilitate voluntary self-assessment; the annual tax return form will be redesigned to have a section for self-computation built into it: the objective is that the new form will be in use for the 1989-90 tax year.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, of course, that the complexity of the tax system makes self-computation difficult for many taxpayers at present.  The absense of a single year basis of assessment of all income and reliefs means, in particular, that more than one tax return is nearly always required to settle one year's tax liability. By contrast, a single year basis of assessment would generally allow liability to be settled each year in one return.  This would greatly facilitate the operation of a mandatory self-assessment system.  A move to a single year basis of assessment could, of course, have significant implications for taxpayers and their agents as well as the Exchequer.  Discussions will, therefore, be held with interested groups to explore the possibilities for further development of the self-assessment system.</P>
    <P>The success of last year's measures in clearing arrears of tax now gives a great opportunity to individuals and firms to keep their tax affairs up to date.  I appeal to all concerned to keep up to date with their payments.  Timely payment of taxes will avoid trouble and expense later and can only help the long term viability of any business.</P>
    <P>As for those who try to exploit the rest of the community by defaulting on tax payment, they can expect to be confronted with the full rigours of the much tougher enforcement measures now available to the Revenue Commissioners. The clearance of arrears in 1988 and the freeing of resources as a result of self-assessment will enable the Revenue to devote more time and effort to this task.  Those who meet their liabilities in a timely fashion need have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record in this House the Government's appreciation of the efforts of all those who contributed to last year's historic breakthrough in tax collection.  The Revenue Commissioners <Col N="254" /> and their staff are deserving of special congratulations.</P>
    <P>I will now indicate a number of changes I am making in regard to tax administration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Remittance of PAYE/PRSI and VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present employers are required to remit PAYE/PRSI deducted from employees' wages on a monthly basis. Traders are required to remit VAT on a two-monthly basis.  Concern has been expressed at the compliance burden which this imposes on very small-scale business.  The Government have, therefore, decided to relieve the burden in such cases by permitting small scale employers and traders to opt for an annual remittance basis for PAYE/PRSI and VAT.  This change will operate from 6 April next in the case of PAYE/PRSI and from 1 September next in the case of VAT.  This facility will greatly ease the administrative burden on the small traders and employers concerned.  It will also lead to administrative saving in the Revenue and will release resources in the Office of the Collector General and thus lead to more efficient tax collection.</P>
    <P>Application of the new procedures will be at the discretion of the Collector General of the Revenue Commissioners. They will not, however, be mandatory and employers or traders may opt to remain within the existing system if they so wish.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that some 43,000 employers on the PAYE/PRSI register and 35,000 traders on the VAT register will be eligible for the new procedures.  Many concerns will, of course, benefit on both counts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the middle of 1987, a pilot scheme has been in operation for the self-assessment of capital acquisitions tax.  In view of the success of this scheme and the potential gains in terms of additional yield and greater administrative efficiency, the Government have decided to introduce self-assessment of capital acquisitions tax on a mandatory basis. Provision will also be made for increased penalties and powers of enforcement.  It <Col N="255" /> is expected that the introduction of mandatory self-assessment will lead eventually to an annual increase of £2 million in the yield from capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Anti-avoidance provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the light of a decision of the Supreme Court in July of last year, it is clear that the means to counter tax avoidance schemes must be fundamentally reviewed.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the potential loss of revenue to the Exchequer because of such schemes is sufficiently large to warrant action being taken in the overriding interests of preserving equity in the tax system and ensuring that the expected yield of revenue each year is realised.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided to introduce, in the 1989 Finance Bill, measures to counter the avoidance of tax.  The precise scope and the effective date of the measures are being actively considered.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGET TARGETS</P>
    <P>Following the various expenditure and tax changes which I have announced today, the target for 1989 for the Exchequer borrowing requirement is £1,057 million or 5.3 per cent of GNP. This is a reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point of GNP on the underlying level of Exchequer borrowing in 1988 and a reduction of 4.7 percentage points on 1987.  The estimated current budget deficit for this year is £819 million, which at 4.1 per cent of GNP represents a reduction of 2.5 percentage points on 1987.</P>
    <P>These targets will ensure a continuation of the significant progress made in the past two years in controlling borrowing and debt and provide a firm basis for the achievement of a lasting improvement in the economy and the public finances.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The past two years have been great progress towards resolving the economic <Col N="256" /> and financial problems which confront this country.  Difficult decisions have had to be made &mdash; and accepted.  Attitudes have changed.  As a nation we have come to grips with the reality that the old ways of spending and borrowing excessively were wrong, and that a new direction was needed.  That new direction is embodied in the policies and partnership agreed between the Government and the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> An essential element is continuing tight control of the public finances and prudent management of the economy.</P>
    <P>Recovery is in train&mdash;of that there is no doubt.  The evidence is there for all to see in higher output, increased investment and the long awaited improvement in employment.  The spirit of the nation has been rekindled.  The national effort is succeeding.  We have emerged from the past two years leaner but fitter for the challenges ahead.</P>

      <P>It is essential that we continue to act in a mature way.  The problems have not gone away.  The borrowing and debt, which brought us into such difficulty, are still far too high.  They will need continuing and resolute attention.</P>

      <P>We must also redouble our efforts to improve competitiveness if we are to create the sustained increase in employment that we all so badly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's budget has been focused on three dominant priorities; the alleviation of poverty, the maximisation of employment and relieving the burden of personal taxation.  Far from there being a conflict between these priorities, there is a close <Col N="257" /> identity of interest.  It is beyond dispute that unemployment is the major factor in poverty, and it is primarily through protecting and increasing viable employment that the Government can hope to alleviate poverty.  All the main features of today's budget focus on one or other of these priorities:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the major improvement in social welfare provisions,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the major innovation with the income tax exemption limits which will reduce hardship and improve the incentive to work,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the income tax improvements in marginal rates and income bands, which will begin to improve the incentive to work and will reduce pay pressures,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" />&mdash;the major increase in development programmes aided by the Structural Funds,</P>
    <P>&mdash;and above all, the further reduction in Exchequer borrowing which will consolidate and enhance confidence in the economy, underpin interest rates and improve the overall climate for investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>This budget should encourage all sections to persevere in the programme we have laid out.  It shows that, if we all exercise control and restraint, we can make progress towards our national objectives for greater social equity, fairer taxes and more jobs, while still reducing borrowing.  We have a successful formula for future progress.  We must not be deflected.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister for Finance has had the opportunity which no other Minister for Finance has had in recent years.  Unlike all his predecessors in recent times his opening position not only allowed him to take further corrective action on the debt but left him with money to spend as he saw fit.  I am afraid the Minister in front of an open goal has kicked the ball wide.  The budget is strong on presentation, as we would expect from this Minister, but I am afraid it is very weak in performance.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think the Minister is suffering from the same fatal flaw that bedevilled the actions of the present Taoiseach in the late seventies. The overpowering desire to be popular has put him on the wrong side of the argument once again.  He has attempted to be all things to all men.  He has made every target a desirable aim. He is like the man who jumped up on his horse and rode off in all directions at once.  He has missed most targets here. It is a budget of lost opportunities and it is certainly a budget of lost jobs.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Just wait, you will hear a few things before you face your constituents.  Fine Gael believe that this budget should continue the adjustment of the national debt which we began and which Fianna Fáil have belatedly adopted as their policy.  Fine Gael believe that the twin scandals of unemployment and emigration are not only our greatest economic problem but also our greatest social problem.  We believe that these problems are not susceptible to easy solutions.  We believe there is a solution and that we should <Col N="272" /> all work together to put that solution in place.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believe that our tax code and our social welfare system must be reformed radically and fundamentally if we are to make any progress in putting our people back to work.  We are not talking simply about a tax code which puts more money in people's pockets, even though that is desirable.  We are not talking simply about a social welfare code that puts more money in people's pockets and that is desirable, we are talking about fundamental and radical restructuring of the tax code and the social welfare system to encourage jobs and put our people back to work.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fine Gael believe that this economy is out of kilter with most of our partners in western Europe.  There is no doubt but that costs in our economy, particularly transport costs, are out of line with our main trading partners.  Fine Gael will not accept a divided society, we stand for social justice and equality of opportunity.  There is no justice if significant numbers of our people are condemned to continue in poverty.  We expect any and every Government in this country to address this problem both directly and indirectly. Fine Gael expect detailed sectoral policies which contribute to growth and development.  We expect explicit and detailed policies especially for agriculture, tourism and manufacturing industry.  Fine Gael believe that preparation for 1992 should have begun today, if not earlier.  We need a statement of intent on tariff harmonisation from the Minister for Finance, but we did not get it today.  We need a proper integrated plan to ensure that the doubling of the EC Structural Funds is not wasted, as the money that became available in 1973 was wasted and as the money that was borrowed in the late seventies and early eighties was wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to measure this budget against those criteria but first I want to draw attention to the increasing trend in <Col N="273" /> Government speeches &mdash; a trend which the Minister for Finance indulged in today &mdash; to put forward the idea that economic life began in this country two years ago.  The Minister for Finance has again recited a litany of successful economic statistics with which we are all now familiar.  Again, as in the past, the pretence that all these improvements originated with the change of Government in 1987 is trotted out.  I appreciate that the change of heart and mind in Fianna Fáil was of such cataclysmic proportions that, as is common in such occurrences, there is a tendency for them to date all time from the commencement of that great event so that in effect the year of the Fianna Fáil conversion becomes year one of the new calendar.  We are now coming into, as we might say, year two of ADC. I want to refer to those years, however, which I will refer to as BCFF, that is before the conversion of Fianna Fáil.  We had brought inflation down from 17 per cent to 3 per cent.  We had turned a massive trade deficit of £1.8 billion to a huge surplus of £1.6 billion in 1987.  When Fine Gael came to Government in 1981 the level of Exchequer borrowing facing the new Government for 1982, on the basis of Fianna Fáil policies, represented 23 per cent of national output.  When Fianna Fáil took over in 1987 and adopted our budget the figure they were facing was 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We had halted the drop in unemployment in the manufacturing industry by 1986.  Cost competitiveness in Irish industry had leaped in our period of Government and manufacturing output had gone up by 45 per cent so let us have no further talk about economic life beginning in this country when this Fianna Fáil Government came into power.  The propaganda and presentation is very good indeed but it does not correspond with the facts.  I would like to say to those whose position depends on the Government that they should have no fear of going on television <Col N="274" /> programmes and saying that and not pretend the contrary.</P>
      <P>When I add to this, the Government's opening position when they came to power, the fact that the Minister had money to spend when he came into this House today and that this party in Opposition and the Progressive Democrats have constantly over the two years supported the main trust of Government policy for the corrections that were necessary, the budget is a very poor performance.</P>
      <P>We know that over the past two years real progress had been made by the Government.  Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, but especially Fine Gael, have openly supported the action necessary to correct the debt problem, but the problem we face now, as we reach a threshold when the debt and GNP ratio has been stablised, is that the progress is being confined to the economic statistics.  The progress is being confined to debt control and the filtering down effect into the real lives of the people in terms of jobs and reducing emigration has not occurred.  There was an average number of 243,000 on the live register for 1988 while 32,000 people emigrated &mdash; or at least that many &mdash; in each of the past three years.  The real rate of unemployment, if we include emigration, is in excess of 30 per cent and that problem has not been addressed directly in this budget.</P>
      <P>The Government claim they have created jobs in the past year.  These are dubious enough claims.  The final quarterly report of the Central Bank states as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Identification of the trend in employment in 1988 is subject to considerable uncertainty because of difficulties in reconciling data from the labour force survey with those from quarterly employment series and because of the paucity of data on the services sector. Recent labour force estimates for April 1987 and April 1988 suggest a stronger employment performance than was indicated by quarterly employment data for these periods.  The extent to <Col N="275" /> which the higher employment numbers in the labour force survey represent the increasing incidence of part-time employment and/or the influence of Government temporary employment schemes is unclear.  As a result, estimates of employment for 1988 and forecasts for 1989 must be seen as tentative.</P>
    <P>We know the way the Central Bank write their reports.  We know the diplomatic language they use when they are criticising the Government.  What they are saying to the Government in this instance is, &ldquo;we do not believe your figures for job achievement targets&rdquo;.  If we look at the live register, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Central Bank's suspicions are absolutely correct. If we look at the live register and divide it into those who are under 25 years of age and those who are over 25 years of age, you will find that in the past two years the rate of unemployment in the over 25 age group has gone up by 6,900, but it certainly has gone down in the under 25 age group.  Of course we know why it has gone down in the under 25 age group.  They are in Camden Town, Manchester, Boston, Australia and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They are not here and those commentators &mdash; good commentators who were friends of the Taoiseach &mdash; who in the past talked about the death of Irish towns, should have a look at Kiltimagh and some of the towns in the west.  They should also look at some of the suburbs of Dublin city and of all of our cities from where our young people are leaving in droves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Question Time today there was an oral question about the levels of jobs created by the Government and the Taoiseach gave a fudged answer.  However, together with Deputy Jim Mitchell I took the precaution of putting down a question for written answer about the number of redundancies notified to the Department of Labour in the past 12 months.  There <Col N="276" /> were 23,037 redundancies notified to the Department of Labour.  The Minister for Labour gave us that answer.  The reply goes on to say that not all of the redundancies eventually ended up in people being unemployed but if we adjust the figure downwards there were 21,400 people who actually took redundancy.  It further says that the Department have no information on non-notifiable redundancies so we cannot take account of that in the figure.  The Government are claiming to have fulfilled the targets in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that 20,000 extra jobs would be created when the figure for the redundancies is somewhere between 21,000 and 25,000.</P>
    <P>I put down another interesting question today asking for the numbers of departures and arrivals by all means of transport.  In the figure for 1987, the difference between the number of departures and arrivals was 30,000.  That is in line with the estimate, as we all said emigration was between 30,000 and 32,000 but when we take the figure for 1988, we find that the difference between departures and arrivals is 73,000.  I appreciate that that is not meant to be an accurate statistic on emigration but it is the best we have in the absence of anything else.  If it was accurate in 1987 maybe it is accurate today.  From those figures we can see that 73,000 people left the country and did not come back.  Now where are we going?  Is that budget an adequate response to those levels of unemployment and emigration?  Spreading money around thinly throughout all the constituencies that demanded action before the budget is no answer to the fundamental problems facing this economy.</P>
    <P>Everthing I say from now on I want to measure against the criterion of job creation.  I will start with the progress that has been made on the national debt. We know progress was made in the past, but even on the figures presented by the Minister the progress today is small enough.  It has come down three-quarters of 1 per cent.  He started with 6.1 and is down to 5.4.  Three-quarters of one per <Col N="277" /> cent is not a big drop in Exchequer borrowing requirement, but it is the kind that could easily be eroded if the Minister has not got his figures right and there is any kind of overrun at the end of the year.  I am not interested in controlling the debt <i>per se</i> but I am interested in controlling it because we cannot afford it.  It costs over £2 billion in interest charges to service it and we will never create jobs or keep the young people at home while the level of debt continues.</P>
    <P>On the totality of the figure the Minister goes just over £1 billion on the debt &mdash; £1,057 million is the figure he has come in with.  I know the sentiment in this city among the people who will be funding this deficit, who were saying during the week that if the Minister passed £1,050 million they were going to get very uneasy and if he passed £1,100 million the game was over.  The Minister is very close to the fringe particularly when we look at the balance sheet at the back of his Budget Statement and see the figures for buoyancy he has put in from unknown sources.  We will give him the benefit of the doubt.  Some progress was made on the debt and while we are still paying over £2 billion in interest we will have to continue controlling that debt.  However, now we have arrived at a threshold: sometime in 1989 the debt-GNP ratio will be stabilised, we need medium-term targets and the Minister should have provided us with them today.  Unless targets and objectives are set and the means to arrive at those targets is spelled out, the consensus in the community at large, who are stuck with hard measures to eliminate the problems of the debt, will not be maintained and the consensus which exists in and outside this House will crumble.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have come into this House today and said he was going back to traditional budgeting.  He should have said he was going to separate the capital budget from the current budget in real terms and to eliminate the current budget deficit over a set period; I suggest three years.  The current budget deficit is £819 million with a reduction of around <Col N="278" /> £250 million a year, he could have eliminated the current budget deficit.  The public, financiers, politicians, we in this House, do not know the Minister's intent for the next three or four years regarding debt control, and that creates the kind of uncertainty that causes problems.  The Minister should mend his fences and when the Taoiseach comes in tomorrow he should set medium-term targets for the control of the debt and see if he can get general agreement on them.  In the absence of targets the consensus will crumble and we will be going nowhere, stuck dead in the road, and we will make no further progress.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised the Minister is not making much progress on the debt.  We said when the Estimates were brought in last year that not much progress had been made and the Minister would not be able to make much progress on debt control in this budget.  I see he has included £26 million of further cuts unspecified, which he says he will specify subsequently, because his Department's balances were high when he came in so he thinks another £26 million is there.  Maybe it is, maybe not.  Maybe he spent £26 million and had no other way of finding it so he said we would knock another £26 million off the general Estimate and it can be spread over Departments subsequently.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have argued consistently that there is a relationship between the high level of marginal taxes and jobs.  We have pointed out consistently that we have one of the most benign tax régimes in the world as far as capital, machines and plant are concerned but when it comes to people and jobs we are taxing jobs out of existence. We are not talking just about the overall burden but about marginal rates. I am glad the Minister has taken some of the message on board and has moved on the marginal rates but, again, he had far more scope and he seemed to be responding to the political pressure to deliver lower tax rates rather than concentrating on the kind of reform which will deliver jobs.  He can do the two together and I suggest he has done less than half the job.  We have pointed out on previous <Col N="279" /> occasions in this House that in manufacturing industry to give an extra £1 to an employee paying the top rate of tax costs the employer £3.30.  If an employer in manufacturing industry wants to give £1,000 to a key worker, it costs him £3,300.  The Minister has changed that only marginally; he has taken 2p off the top rate, 2p off the middle rate and moved the marginal rate down to 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not dealt at all with our young graduates who are emigrating and being sucked out of the economy because of a more benign tax régime not only in the UK but in West Germany. They will have very little benefit from the changes the Minister has made.  The rates which affect them most are the 58 per cent and principally the 48 per cent rate, and we are talking about these rates with no reference at all to PRSI.  Of course, you must add 7.75 per cent to all these rates, so we are talking about percentages of 65.75, 55.75 and 39.75 and the Minister has raised the ceiling again.  I do not know whether the Minister realises it, but not only are our young graduates leaving who could get jobs but shortages of skilled people are beginning to emerge in certain areas of the economy.  There is a shortage of electronic and mechanical engineers, key computing people and, when we move to the factory floor, of toolmakers. There is a shortage of a range of skills and they are moving to more benign tax régimes.  I claim that the mobility of the bright young Irish graduate is faster than the international capital is coming back to create jobs in this country.  The Minister has not done enough for people like that.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, key industries in this economy find it impossible to get suitable management and pay them commensurate with their skills.  Again, we are talking about the 58 per cent rate. However, you have moved in that direction. We welcome your move.  It is in line with what we have been saying.  You have moved on the marginal rates, but you have done so rather like someone who is responding to the mood of the moment <Col N="280" /> and in a fashion which suggests you may or may not know where you are going because you have given no indication whatsoever of where you are going to go next year, what your ultimate target is, whether you are going to continue with marginal rate decreases or go back to increases in allowances and what not.</P>
    <P>Now we must look at the benefit to taxpayers.  Naturally, when tax is changed in this fashion it has to be paid for.  You are reducing the mortgage interest benefit and the benefit on life insurance.  You have threatened to tax child benefit even though you have not said at what level the tax imposition will commence.  You say you are going to put full PRSI on all public servants, 160,000 of them.  Therefore, there is a price tag on this.  You gave the raw figure for the mythical man who has nothing except tax deducted from his salary.  The figures you gave are for the man with no mortgage, no children.  He cannot be a public servant and he had better not have life insurance.  In the total sum those figures begin to come down dramatically and the benefit given has not been very real at all.  I notice that in the case of child benefit you put your toe in the water, you said it would be next year and you did not know at what level.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to move to another serious point about child benefit.  In any treatment of families, and in any treatment of children, we must look at horizontal equity as well as vertical equity.  It is not enough to put an income table on one side and families with children on the other.  I would argue that no matter what the gross income is, whether it is £20,000, £25,000 or £30,000, if a family have many children, four, five, six or seven children, that family have very little disposable income.  Certainly, they do not have much disposable income while those children are teenagers and moving on to college. I should like to ask the Minister, who has only made a suggestion without spelling out his proposal, to look at the concept of horizontal equity between families as well as the idea of vertical equity.  To advert to that type of equity might change the Minister's mind.  I should like to ask him to have a look at it because it is my belief that he will get into extreme difficulty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that he will be taxing the misfortunate public servants by imposing full rate PRSI on them. Public servants have taken things fairly hard from the Government.  The Minister has given very little credit to them for the good work they do and, secondly, he has treated them as a species that should be eradicated with various embargoes and early retirement schemes.  There are sections of the public service where there <Col N="282" /> is a very low feeling of self worth.  On top of that, and without any preliminary discussion, the Minister is saying that he will put full rate PRSI on public servants. Public servants, with all their levies included, pay a rate of 3.15 per cent while the full rate is 7.75 per cent.  If the Minister follows up what he has announced there will not be much left in the houses of the civil servants, teachers, gardaí, nurses, county council workers or members of the Army.  There will not be much left out of the tax package when the full rate of PRSI is introduced.  How will they benefit?  They cannot be dismissed and, therefore, the idea of redundancy and pay-related does not arise. They qualify for pensions, whether they are contributory or not and, therefore, the idea of further contributory pensions does not seem to arise.  They already have widows and orphans benefits from the 3.15 per cent they pay.  Where is the benefit for them?  Are we suggesting that the much maligned public service should again pay for the Minister's largess on this occasion?</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with social welfare. We are all familiar with the arguments that there is a lot of poverty in our community, and I accept there is.  The ESRI report on poverty suggested that there are three areas where poverty is heaviest. The first is households where the head of the house is unemployed.  The second is households where there are many children and the third is the category of rural households which are well below the poverty line.  The Minister's response to that report is to give an increase of 3 per cent on all social welfare benefits and to top that up with a further 9 per cent for the long-term unemployed, those on the live register for a long time.  Percentages are great, especially if we do not know the rates.  Let us take the contributory old age pension which is £56.80 from last July and which the Minister proposes to increase by 3 per cent.  That means that the Minister intends to give £1.68 to an old age pensioner to relieve poverty. Does the Minister know what one can buy for £1.68 on my check list?  One will get ½lb of Barry's tea for 95p and a bag <Col N="283" /> of sugar for 70p.  That will be the effect of the increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Government put the minimum rent up by £3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They put the minimum rent up £3 last year after giving the misfortunate old age pensioners less.  Unemployment benefit stands at £43.60 and the 3 per cent increase on that will mean an extra £1.40. Let us see what a person will get for that amount of money.  If the man smokes he will not be able to afford an extra 20 cigarettes because, before the Minister added a further 4p, the 20 packet of Benson and Hedges cost £1.95.  He may be able to afford 15 cigarettes from the Minister's major attack on poverty.  He would not make the fourth packet of soup because at 39p each four packets of soup will cost him £1.56.  A litre of milk costs 52p and the best a person can do with this increase is to buy an additional two litres of milk and one tin of beans.</P>
      <P>To be producing a package, talking in millions of pounds on the macro side and in percentages on the micro side and suggesting that that is a response to poverty in our community is cod.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone beyond the 3 per cent for the long-term unemployed and that it will be increased by 12 per cent.  That increase will amount to about £5 per week but then the Minister, as he did in many parts of his speech, fudged the information given to the House.  It is not clear from the paragraph which followed the announcement of that increase whether it will apply to the dependent spouse or not.  It looks to me as if it will not.  One could read into it that it was 12 per cent across the board and applies to the children, but to my mind it is part of the con job.  The issue is fudged in several parts of the Minister's speech.  What the Minister is talking about is a £5 note whether the man is single, married or has children.  There are some marginal benefits at the other end of the scale for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is adequate.  It is misdirected and it does what we warned <Col N="284" /> about on previous occasions, it throws money at the problem.  That is being done by people who have not analysed the problem.  Far be it from me to say that £5 will not make a difference to a person who is in receipt of £40 but I know that the filtered down effect will not reach certain sections of the community, no matter what economic growth we have. It is a lie to say that rising tides lift all boats.  They do not lift boats with holes in them and there are a lot of boats around, representing families, with holes in them. Poverty has to be addressed directly along the lines we have advocated.  What the Minister has done, while it may be good when one talks about £70 million or 12 per cent, when it is reduced to pounds, shillings and pence and applied to a list of items from any supermarket, much less the small shops where many of the unemployed and the old have to shop, it amounts to very marginal relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell, our spokesman on Labour, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week pointed to one of the problems when one seeks to reform the social welfare system.  He referred to poverty traps and put a table together which showed that a person on the average industrial wage of £201.88 was very little better off than a person on long-term unemployment assistance of £107.  By the time one reached the bottom line there was about £2 between them.  The Minister's £5 will erode that.  The person with four children on long-term unemployment benefit will be about £3 a week better off than the person on the average industrial wage.  That cries out for reform.  The Taoiseach is shaking his head at that statement but I will supply him with the table I am referring to. Some of his Cabinet colleagues have been discussing it and telling us privately that we have illustrated very well one of the main anomalies in the social welfare system.  It is not enough to go after poverty directly or to try to organise a system to alleviate poverty; we must look at the poverty traps.  The Minister has tried to do that in one small measure, by giving an extra child allowance to people on very low levels of income.  I do not understand <Col N="285" /> why the Minister is taking that road to achieve a particular end when the family income supplement scheme is in place and could have been used.  The Minister has made minor changes in family income supplements, to the total value of £1 million, but he did not specify what they are in his speech.  We do not know to what category of low pay they will apply, what the cut-off point will be or whether they will be graduated.  The Minister should explain why he did not use the vehicle which is in place to eliminate poverty traps.</P>
    <P>In my league table of the factors which inhibit jobs, closely following on the PAYE/PRSI scandal, is the problem of undirected social welfare and the system under which it is impossible for certain people to go back to work, even if their job is available, because social welfare is worth more to them than their net pay when all other deductions are taken into account.  The OECD has said that Ireland has a tax-cum-social welfare system most biased against labour.  The Minister did not address that problem.  He gave money to certain categories but it will have no structural effect on the economy and will not contribute one iota to job creation.  There is a very good chance that we will lose rather than create jobs.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty will not be eliminated by direct application.  Those that are poorest are in houses where the head of the house is unemployed and any moves which make it more difficult for the heads of households to get back to work is going counter to what the Minister intends.  I suggest that, like in many other areas, it is because the Minister does not understand the difficulties of the system.  That is one of the great tragedies of this budget.  In budget after budget the Opposition parties have openly offered to back the Minister and his predecessor if they took the radical steps necessary to restructure our economy, to get the 30 per cent levels of unemployment and emigration down to the levels that are the hallmark of modern west European economies.  Yet, the Minister has spread himself so thinly over three constituency <Col N="286" /> targets here that he has ended up by doing very little.</P>
    <P>Cost factors in our economy are causing job losses.  We know that on average the cost of energy here is higher than for our European neighbours and that the cost of telecommunications is higher here.  In those areas, improvements have been made over the last four or five years but one area which is totally out of kilter relates to transport, whether it be internal lorry transport or access transport. Because we are the peripheral nation in the EC, the only island nation after the completion of the Channel Tunnel, this problem should have been addressed in this budget and it has not been.  It costs 40 per cent more to move a metric tonne in this country than it does in the UK. The cost factors are simple to identify. First, there is excise duty on the article, then there is the cost of fuel and it is mostly the excise duty on auto diesel and, thirdly, there is the state of the roads. The Minister today has put another 4p on petrol and he has allowed the 6p which was put on auto diesel a week ago to remain.</P>
    <P>We all knew since 1 January that there was going to be a reduction in the price of petrol.  Did not the Minister for Industry and Commerce instruct the oil companies not to bring in an increase on 1 January so that he could do the trick-o'-the-loop effort in the budget today and cancel out an excise increase with this increase at the pumps?  The Minister delayed a reduction for a month so that he could balance things today and come in and announce that he was taking 4p but that there would be no increase at the pump.</P>
    <P>In taking that 4p, the Minister indicated that he does not appreciate what a problem transport costs are in this country and the Minister is also making it harder for himself when it comes to harmonising export duties.  If the Minister was going to hoover up the 4p reduction in excise duty, he should have given it back on auto diesel.  The Minister could have reduced the price of auto diesel by 25p or 30p.  That would make a big difference in all distributive trades.  It <Col N="287" /> would make a big difference in any company exporting and a big difference in any company transferring goods or services by road in this country.  That would have made a difference to employment, but, of course, the Minister did not do that because it was easier to come into the House and tell the people that he was taking it with one hand but giving it back with the other.</P>
    <P>That is the second time that has happened. Last year it happened in relation to the 5 per cent VAT on electricity.  We were told that there would be no increase in our ESB bills because there was a reduction of 5 per cent in electricity anyway.  We have been getting our bills since then with the 5p itemised as a separate item and now we have a 5p VAT rate on the cost of electricity.</P>
    <P>I will move on now to some other sectors, because macro-economic policies alone will not solve our problems.  We should have strong sectoral policies.  In one of the primary areas, the area of agriculture, we have no policy at all. Nothing is being done and we have no plan.  I wonder if we even have a Minister. The new Commissioner went to Europe and went native.  The present Minister said before Christmas that he was going to exercise the veto if the events which occurred yesterday occurred.  They occurred and the Minister came home and he was there smiling today.</P>

    <P>I came across an interesting piece of paper which minutes a decision taken at the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris in May 1987.  I presume the Minister for Finance was there in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In my time it was always nice to get the weekend in Paris and the OECD Council was a nice place to go.  I presume the Minister for Finance was there and perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Food returning from Brussels.  Part of the minute says that in the immediate future the most pressing need is to avoid any future deterioration of the present market imbalances, that action must be taken to influence demand and supply, on the demand side by improving prospects as much as possible inside as well as outside the OECD area and on the supply side by implementing measures which would prevent any increase in excessive supply, and that such measures may include reducing guaranteed prices and other types of reduction incentives by imposing quantitative production restrictions or by other means.  That was <Col N="289" /> a minute of May 1987 talking about agriculture in the OECD when our Minister was present.  Yet, the Minister for Agriculture and Food expressed amazement at the dirty carry-on in Brussels and he was going to veto it before Christmas. The Minister was at that meeting in May 1987 so who is codding who?  Is it any wonder that the farmers are on the streets marching?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The family farm in Ireland is under threat and there is little in this budget to withstand that threat.  I welcome the fact that the Minister restored the VAT rate from 1.3 per cent to 2 per cent.  The Minister should have gone higher.  Independent surveys communicated to the Department of Finance and agreed by the Minister's officials would suggest that the appropriate rate is 2.6 per cent.  Even if the Minister brought it back to 2.4 per cent, we would have been happy.  It was reduced in the first instance on the basis that farmers were not paying their youth employment and training levy and the second tranche of the reduction was tied into the payment of the health levy.  The Minister's figures show that the farmers availed of the tax amnesty not only to pay tax but to pay their levies as well, including the health levy.  They are up to date now and the Minister got more from both those levies than he expected when he reduced the VAT rebate.  That VAT rebate should be at least 2.4 per cent and I will put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to make sure of it because fair play is fair play and the Government made a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the tourist industry.  The Taoiseach will remember when he went to the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham in 1987, when the Government were about to produce a major strategy document on tourism showing how the targets of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> could be achieved; I am sure people up there remember it as <Col N="290" /> well.  What has happened since?  There has been no programme, no strategy and no tourists.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is the best asset of the Minister for Tourism.  He spends most of his time in America endeavouring to get extra visas for Irish immigrants so that the Minister for Tourism can take account of them in the tourism statistics when they return for Christmas.  The same people coming into Shannon Airport are being counted as tourists nine times in the one year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and a fiver collected from them going out. What is the response of the Minister for Tourism?  Where is the sectoral policy on tourism to create jobs, to distribute income from tourism throughout the country &mdash; probably the most efficient distributor of income of any industry because it goes to the four corners of the country?  Frequently the most desirable tourist attractions are in places where the productivity of the land is very low.  Those constitute great opportunities, all of which have been lost.</P>
      <P>For the first time in years tourism has had a negative effect on our balance of payments.  According to the Central Bank Report, Fourth Quarter 1987, the balance of payments position on tourism is plus £13 million, in other words, £13 million was the net contribution of tourism to our economy.  In 1988 with all the bogus tourist statistics, all the emigrants counted, the net contribution of the tourist industry was minus £61 million.  What kind of sectoral policy is that when there are more people leaving this country as tourists than there are coming in, and that includes all the emigrants?  The Taoiseach would need to call aside his Minister for Tourism and tell him that, if he is fooling him, he is not fooling the remainder of us and it is about time that position was redressed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have a fundamental belief that there is no better injector of investment, no better distributor of income, than the tourist industry. Nonetheless it has been grossly neglected.</P>
      <P>All of us in this House last year agreed to extend the provisions of the business expansion scheme to the tourist industry. We thought it was a good idea and backed the Minister.  We asked him for the details.  The Minister replied: we cannot give you the details, they will have to be arranged between the Minister for Tourism, Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry.  They were arranged all right; it is an absolutely disgraceful scam.  I will be putting down amendments to the Finance Bill to have that scheme removed from the tourist industry.  The business expansion scheme was introduced to encourage people to put their savings in risky investment. They put their money into manufacturing industry when all they received was paper representing shares in that business.  For example, if one invested £25,000 &mdash; the maximum for any one individual &mdash; in effect one's exposure amounted to something over £10,000 because if one's top rate of tax was 58 per cent one got a tax rebate on that amount.  That was fair enough because one could lose the whole lot, including the £10,000, starting up in manufacturing industry because it is a high risk.  The provisions of that scheme were directed at the creation of jobs.  That was the scheme introduced by Deputy John Bruton.</P>
      <P>What happened when its provisions were extended to the tourist industry? Its provisions were applied effectively on extensions to hotels but immediately the scam merchants came in and now the provisions are being applied to holiday villages which must consist of a minimum of nine houses.  I do not mind if such villages are located in Deputy Sheehan's constituency, in Connemara, in Donegal, or anywhere else in rural Ireland where there is a tourist industry, but there are now tourist villages in Dublin 4 being advertised openly.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> There is no risk whatever involved. One invests £25,000, one receives a tax credit of approximately £15,000, and the whole operation is backed up by bricks and mortar in the most valuable property zone in the entire country.  Is it any wonder that there are people marching on the streets?  Is it any wonder that income tax payers are upset when this ready-up is allowed to continue?  In our foolishness we trusted that the Minister for Tourism would do the right thing.  I do not blame the Minister for Finance's predecessor; he took the scheme on the basis on which it was offered as well. But it is a scam and should be changed. Indeed, it is worse than a scam because any available funds which would have been put into manufacturing industry are being diverted into the tourist industry. Some builders have said to me recently: we have no problem now because the last nine houses of any scheme cannot sell we will call a tourist village and we are home on a boat.  Mind you, this, in circumstances in which job creation is supposed to be an absolute priority.  There is not a sectoral policy in place in any of the key sectors which would make any difference to jobs.</P>
    <P>If we look at manufacturing industry we see that we have reverted to the old practice of releasing bogus figures.  I saw the new Minister for Industry and Commerce on television recently; I think he was in Midleton in Deputy Hegarty's constituency. He made a great announcement and everybody was happy.  But I noticed one significant detail, that the job figures had reverted to the old five-year projection.  When we were in Government we told the IDA we would not accept job projections over a period of five years.  We told them they must revert to a three-year period.  In modern manufacturing industry, with changing technology, it is difficult enough to go down to the third year, once one goes beyond the third year, inflates the figures and shoves the large numbers into the back year of the programme, such projections became bogus and are a waste of money. If the people in charge of the IDA have convinced the new Minister for Industry <Col N="293" /> and Commerce that this is a way to behave, then he has been sold a pup again.</P>
    <P>I have dealt already with the number of jobs promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and how they match the figures for emigration and notified redundancies.  There is now huge interest being shown by the United States in Europe, massive interest; they know there is something extraordinary happening in Europe.  On the one hand, the business community fear it because they are afraid a fortress Europe mentality is about to break out while, on the other hand, they perceive it as affording a huge potential for investment.  Anybody I meet from the United States who is connected with business says it constitutes a huge interest that we should not miss.  I predict that there could be a bigger influx of American investment here in manufacturing and service industries than there was in the years from 1973 onwards when we first joined the EC.  Is there any word of that in the Minister's speech today?  Not one iota.</P>
    <P>There was nothing about health in the Minister's speech either.  I had not expected very much because the Minister for Health is one of the most obstinate people in Ireland.  He is like the boy who stood on the burning deck, he will go down with the service; the ship will sink but he will still be roaring: everything is all right, lads, do not panic, the health service is grand, everybody is being treated, there is no problem.  We all know the reality of the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the health service now and we shall have an opportunity to debate it next week.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the issue of pay.  There is not much scope to comment on this subject because that pay scheme is in place &mdash; apart from special awards &mdash; resulting from the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I should like to talk about one aspect of Government pay policy, that is Army pay.  The Army has served this country since the foundation of the State in 1922 and its members have served with distinction at home and abroad.  The Army has remained loyal to <Col N="294" /> the State and its Constitution through many changes of Government.  That was very easy in recent times but was not so in the twenties.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the Army underpins the Constitution and the democratic institutions of the State.  It is now being treated in a disgraceful fashion.  The widespread dissatisfaction within its ranks arising from inadequate pay and long hours of duty, especially on the Border, is turning to open anger and resentment resulting from the decision of the Minister for Defence to dramatically increase the cost to soldiers of buying themselves out of the Army.  Having failed to deal with the Army pay crisis, having eroded to a great extent the affection of all soldiers for their uniforms, and the pride in the Army in which they serve, the Minister endeavours now by compulsion, to do what he cannot achieve voluntarily.  In effect he is attempting to commit unwilling soldiers to periods of service in the Army by rendering it impossible for many to buy themselves out.  They are effectively prisoners of peace, not prisoners of war, prisoners of an inept Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I say to the Taoiseach that he should not damage the Army by act or omission. He should instruct his Minister for Defence to mend his fences fairly quickly.  The Taoiseach should intervene personally &mdash; there are a lot of politics abounding on budget day, but this is not a political appeal &mdash; in the embarrassment of the Army who are left with no option but to send out their womenfolk to fight their battles for them.  It would be dangerous to let it continue. The Taoiseach is much better briefed on security than anyone on this side of the House and he should not endanger our last line of defence by allowing a hamfisted Minister for Defence, in his inept fashion, to make a bad problem worse.  The Taoiseach should take this matter up &mdash; I know he can do so if he puts his mind to it &mdash; and sort it out before the weekend.</P>
    <P>One of the purple passages of the Minister's speech related to the problems we will face in 1992.  It was very hard to make <Col N="295" /> sense of it.  I am aware that the officials in the Department of Finance can write very clearly when they are instructed to do so.  I do not believe the Minister knows where he is going.  He referred very briefly to the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties but did not refer to the harmonisation of banking taxes.  When DIRT is removed there will be a big hole in the balance sheet.  What will the Minister do then, as no reference was made to this matter.  What we needed was a statement of intent.  Before the effects of 1992 hit us we will have three more budgets in this House.  I am not calling on the Minister to put VAT on food or clothes or to reduce the price or cars by 30 per cent but he should have made a statement of intent.  One of the main problems is that the Minister has not reached a watershed where he has stabilised the debt-GNP ratio.  We were expecting a three year plan and for the Minister to face up to the real problems confronting this country but he has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Structural Funds I do not know where the Minister is going.  I do not want to be unkind to the civil servants who went out to Brussels with the best possible intentions to meet their contacts there and who came back and made promises to Ministers which did not work out subsequently, but when five ministers and 26 civil servants come home from Brussels with their tails between their legs, we know that something went wrong.  I do not like to name names in the House but I could do so if I wished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think I am wise to what is going on.  The intention was for the Minister to come into the House today to announce a list of schemes under the Structural Funds.  Of course such an announcement would <Col N="296" /> have far more effect in March in advance of the European elections.  Therefore, that cannot be the reason.  The question that has been bothering me is why did he do it and suddenly make an ass of himself? What was the point?  We found the answer in the middle of the Minister's speech.  For every £1 the Minister will make available an extra £3 will be made available from Europe.  The buoyancy effect as a result of capital expenditure is one quarter.  Therefore this will allow the Minister to spend money which is off the balance sheet.  The net effect on tax revenue of expenditure and tax changes and supplementary development budget is £60 million.  About £12 million of this figure is legitimate with about £48 million readied up.  If the money is spent there will be buoyancy.  If the Minister receives a commitment from Europe, which he has not got to date, there will be buoyancy. If the councils and agencies around the country gear up and make sure that this money is spent there will be buoyancy by the end of the year but at this late stage, because of the inadequacy of the planning the spending agencies are not so geared up.  That figure of £48 million will drive the Minister over the figure of £1.1 billion and once we pass that figure we are in dangerous territory.  I hope this does not happen but the Minister has given us no reason to be confident in his treatment of the Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister claimed he never read his party's 1977 election manifesto. He should read it or else consult with some of those who wrote it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They are also sitting on this side of the House.  I am not being facetious when I say that he should read it, as there is one important reason for doing so.  The key economic Ministers then were the former Deputies Colley and O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Malley and the economic policy was encapsulated in the phrase, arising out of a total misinterpretation of Keynesian economics, &ldquo;digging holes and filling <Col N="297" /> them up again&rdquo;.  The theory was that it did not matter how one spent the money. One could dig holes and fill them up again with the result that the economy would take off.  This is a theory the Taoiseach did not agree with.  He never believed that the country could be pulled up by its own boot straps but others did.  The Taoiseach should get his Minister for Finance to read the manifesto as I believe the approach being adopted towards the Structural Funds is along those lines.  The theory that if one spends money on a capital project there will be a bang off it in the economy and the quality of the product does not matter is false.  Unless a proper integrated plan is put in place we will not receive our fair share of the cake.  If the Greeks, Spanish or Germans put forward a better plan for their disadvantaged regions we will not receive the full amount we are entitled to.  The promise is that projects will be funded up to 75 per cent of the cost but this does not mean that this percentage will be paid in respect of each project.  The Minister's approach should be programme-based rather than project-based.  The amount of money we will receive will depend on the quality of the projects and their value to the economy will also depend on their quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times we have twice failed to spend money properly.  Following our entry into the EC in 1973 a lot of money was made available to this country.  This money was used to raise our standard of living but very little was done to encourage investment and the children of that era are now feeling the effects.  There should have been investment in the early seventies in order to provide jobs for those young people who are now emigrating in the late eighties.  Towards the end of the seventies money was borrowed but it was distributed to the winds.  Does the Taoiseach remember the time when he was in a position to announce a 45 per cent pay increase for nurses and a 36 per cent pay increase for teachers while at the same time issuing an instruction to the public service to increase the numbers on the payroll?  I am sure Deputy Desmond <Col N="298" /> would be able to regale the Taoiseach quoting letters which were sent to the health boards and the replies thereto such as &ldquo;dear programme manager, why have you not taken on the extra 50 staff as instructed?&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Dear Minister, we cannot take on staff as, first of all, we have no office space for them; secondly, we have no chairs or tables or desks at which they can sit; and, thirdly, we do not want them any way&rdquo;; and a further letter &ldquo;dear programme manager, take them on anyway&rdquo;.  That is what happened and we wasted money we borrowed on those schemes.</P>
    <P>I have gone on for a long time but not as long as the Minister.  The point I am making is a serious one.  This is our last chance this century to encourage a level of investment which will result in the creation of jobs.  When the integrated plan is published I will have only one question to ask; what economic disadvantage in this country will have been removed at the end of the period of the plan which will make us more like other parts of Europe?  That will be the test.  It will not be the provision of a road up the side of the mountain or a lighthouse in another bog but rather can we make permanent changes in the structure of our economy and can the money be used to remove disadvantages.  If that can be done I will be happy.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by sounding one note of caution.  The Minister may remember that during the last election campaign both he and I appeared on television together.  At that time the model economy was that of Denmark.  One could not go out to RTE because they had discovered Denmark.  One needed to be able to speak Danish before one could go out there.  Even the little girls who would take you to hospitality were on about Denmark.  The Danes managed to get their debt problem under control very quickly and they did so by hard action. They faced down a public service strike which went on for about three months. They got the debt under control through very harsh measures.  Following this, consumer spending began to pick up.  As it <Col N="299" /> did so, confidence began to rise and there was a consumer boom with the result that imports got sucked in.  As imports got sucked in pressure was applied on the Danish kroner and interest rates went up. I would have a small worry about the Minister's budget in that respect and also when one adds what the Minister has done today to the expectations from Europe.  Fair play is good sport and we all like to see people spending a bit of money.  We are all in favour of extra consumer spending around and about.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of factors.  First there is the feeling that people have a bit of money to spend. The Minister has encouraged that today. Second is the fact that our savings ratios have been extraordinarily high.  They ran up to about 20 per cent and they are around 18 per cent now.  As people feel better about the economy they will reduce their savings and start to spend. There is a third factor.  As property prices go up people's collateral increases so their borrowing capacity increases enormously. That happened in the south-east of England.  One can look at certain States in America, and the Massachusetts miracle, as it was called.  When they halved property taxes there was a boom in the property market and everybody began to borrow against the value of their house which was enormously inflated and this transferred itself into consumer spending.</P>
    <P>There are three things at the moment pointing towards greater consumer spending in 1989.  The projections from the Central Bank and ESRI would suggest that even conservative estimates of consumer spending &mdash; we are talking about increases of 6 per cent or 7 per cent gross &mdash; would not take a whole lot to switch the emphasis from a debt problem which was beginning to come under control to a balance of payments problem which would run interest rates up as pressure came on the pound.  Ireland's economy and our influence on world events is like a cork bobbing around on the ocean.  We have to be very careful indeed.  I do not want to over stress it, but I want it on the record that there is <Col N="300" /> a problem ahead and the Government should certainly be aware of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister faced three political constituencies when he was preparing this budget.  First there was the financial rectitude constituency.  A lot of people think that the debt is still the most important thing and that is where the Minister should have spent the money to reduce it more and more.  There is the tax reform constituency; a lot of people thought that the Minister should have concentrated his resources there.  Then there is a very strong constituency which says there are disgraceful levels of poverty in the community and that resources should have been put in there.</P>
    <P>The Minister, being a very astute politician, sought to satisfy the three constituencies. I suggest that by doing so and the manner in which he has done so, he has missed the main targets which should have been job creation, the elimination of unemployment and the reduction of emigration.</P>
    <P>We are at a point where it is still not too late.  When we move all the detail aside from every sector and look at the economy, the problem is on the supply side of the economy.  We need to put together a strategy that will enable us to produce more and sell it more competitively. If we do that there will be extra jobs.  That is what this budget should have been about.  It should have been a plan, over the next three years, to enable Irish people at home to produce more and to enable them to go abroad and sell it more competitively.  If the Minister had done that, in the area of macro economic policy and in the area of sectoral policy, this would be a very significant budget indeed.  As it stands it will pass into history as the budget which massaged three major problems and made some people feel better temporarily but did nothing to address the fundamentals of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first budget of the Minister for Finance, and he is to be congratulated on that account; but it is also the third budget of this Government. It marks more than the half way <Col N="301" /> stage in the life of this Government set out in budgets.  Now is the time to evaluate where they have gone in terms of budgetary policy.  This is the moment at which this House can look fairly and squarely at this Government and ask if it is a Government of potential, of recovery, of growth, of economic hope for the country, or a Government of disappointment, rudderlessness and lack of cohesive strategic intent.  It appears more and more obvious to those who are looking at this Government that on this occasion they have finally let loose their hand from the economic tiller.</P>
      <P>There is talk in this House and in the media of consensus, that three of the parties in this House belong to a broad consensus.  That consensus, as I understand it, was one in which it was agreed by all parties to the consensus that the national debt had to be got under control. That consensus does not go any further than that and it is wrong to speak in terms of an economic consensus of which this budget forms part.  It most certainly does not.  This budget is auto-pilot politics.  It is a reflection of the complacency that is afflicting the country now, the feeling that things are better, that recovery has arrived, that we are now on the threshold of a great economic leap forward.  The simple fact is that this country is under-performing by comparison with any OECD country; we are doing worse than all of them.  The simple fact is that this country in terms of consumer spending last year went down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the real economy where ordinary people live and work failure is confronting us every day.  It confronts us in the form of 600 people leaving to go abroad.  They do not go for better social welfare benefits.  They go for the opportunity to work, because they want to provide their services in an economy which has the capacity to absorb them and because they have to go.  We live in a country where there are 240,000 people on the dole and, in the last three years about 120,000 people have left our shores.  There are 50,000 people on training schemes in a kind of economic <Col N="302" /> limbo.  That means there are 400,000 people that our economy has failed in the last three years.  It is an enormous number, an enormous index of failure, and the responsibility for that failure lies four square with this Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, they may indicate that they have had to take on board very difficult financial constraints.  That is true but, as they were sick and tired of saying to the Government who were in power from 1982 to 1987, bookkeeping is not what it is all about.  There is a second half to the agenda which every Government take on board, that is, the agenda of growth, of employment, of wealth creation.  The simple fact is that in the real economy &mdash; as opposed to the paper economy the hothouse of the Financial Services Centre and places like that &mdash; where ordinary people are trying to live, work, bring up their children, save, invest and employ others, things are getting worse.  The burden of taxation is growing not shrinking.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency about our situation too, because although the debt/GNP ratio has been stabilised that, of itself, does not switch off the alarm bells; it does not avert a crisis.  There is nothing in this budget which suggests that the Government have any long-term goal in relation to the debt/GNP ratio.  Serious-minded economists are asking whether by 1995 they will have reduced it to one and a quarter times our annual GNP.  Others suggest that that could be achieved by 1990 and that by 1995 we could have a debt GNP ratio of one.  The one thing that is absent in the Minister for Finance's first budget, on the occasion on which he came in here to put his stamp on the style of Government that will prevail while he remains Minister for Finance, is long-term thinking.  There is none apparent in this budget or even implicit in any of the terms of the budget.</P>
    <P>Look at 1992: that requires planning now.  The Minister's approach to 1992 and indirect taxation is weak to the point of total flaccidity.  There was not a single statement of intent or of policy in the budget.  There is a political reason for that.  His advisers have told him that if <Col N="303" /> we start to put in train any of the measures which would be required to equalise and harmonise the VAT régime in this country with that of other member states, we will weaken our leverage with the European Community.  No planning or preparation is being made for 1992.</P>
    <P>In regard to 1992 &mdash; I make this point with a good deal of hesitation &mdash; no one is more committed to the process of European integration and achievement of the Single European Market than the Progressive Democrats, but the simple fact is if we approach 1992 without preparation in the area of tax reform, industrial policy or indirect tax harmonisation, it could turn out to be a great disaster for this country because there are many dangers inherent in it which only planning done well in advance can obviate and minimise.</P>
    <P>When the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was first implemented it was described as a major economic plan. Many of us on the Opposition benches described it at the time as a public sector pay deal to buy this Government breathing space.  The truth of that is now coming home to roost.  The Minister for Finance said that £150 million of special pay awards have accumulated during the lifetime of this agreement.  We prefer not to talk about that or even to think about it. The fact is the Government are sailing into a huge confrontation with the public sector unions on the question of special pay.  All these special pay awards were put in abeyance and this is now coming home to roost.  The Government face a crisis on the public sector pay front.</P>
    <P>The job targets which were trumpeted in that document are illusory and propagandist in nature.  The number of reported redundancies seems to equate with the jobs created under that document. Of course, it suited the public sector unions and the Government at the time to talk in terms of 20,000 jobs a year, but when that turned out to be 20,000 gross jobs, nothing when compared to the extent of redundancies and job losses in the economy, the truth began to emerge.  In the recurrent war between the Government, who are busily <Col N="304" /> trying to create a sense of confidence in the economy &mdash; I salute them for that &mdash; and those who criticise what is happening, who are aware of the extent of deprivation and misery in the economy, truth has been the first casualty.  On all sides there is exaggeration but none so much as on the Government side when they exaggerate their achievements and their targets and they underestimate the extent to which they are failing to achieve many of the things they promised.</P>
    <P>This budget in particular must be one which holds out no hope for those who are excluded from the economy.  I am talking about those who went into economic exile &mdash; the emigrants.  They have been economically extradited.  I am talking also about those who are frozen into ghettoes of unemployment, who are in internal economic exile, those who are the occupants of our own internal economic gulag.  There is nothing for those people in the budget.  There is the illusion of tax reform and of a comprehensive attack on poverty but there is none of the substance of these matters.</P>
    <P>If we look at the glossy pink tables which accompany this budget we will find that a person on £3,000 per annum, as a result of the whiff of tax reform which Deputy Reynolds has passed under their nose, will be better off to the extent of £10.92 a year.  That is what somebody on the lowest rung of taxable income will get from tax relief under this budget.  That is pathetic.  It is an insult.  It is most unfair when compared with the £648 this document promises to somebody on an income of £30,000 a year.  It is outrageous that a Government who say they are concerned about getting those 240,000 people off the dole and into work give somebody at the most abject and slave rate of labour &mdash; £3,000 per annum &mdash; an incentive of £10 extra a year to get into the workforce.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Taoiseach conceded over a year ago was that PRSI is a form of taxation on work.  If PRSI and income tax are both taken as taxes on work, obviously it would have been much better for any Government, faced with tackling the problem of such a large <Col N="305" /> number of people who are excluded from the economic life of our country and confined to the misery and injustice of poverty on the dole, to tackle PRSI.  The people on £3,000 and the people who can avail of the upper income limits for income tax, which the Minister has broadened in the budget, are still paying PRSI at 7.75 per cent.  They are paying tax when they do not have a living wage. It is about time we focused our reforming zeal where it really would have an effect, that is, people on low incomes paying PRSI.</P>
    <P>Another curious feature in the budget speech delivered by the Minister is that finally the great old propaganda lie on which the 1987 election was fought, that this Government would put two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate, has finally been abandoned for the rubbish it always was.  When it was first promised it could have been achieved by changing the marginal tax rate of one taxpayer in ten. It could have been achieved today by changing the marginal tax rate of three taxpayers in 100.  It was so insubstantial and so stupid a goal that at least I have to commend this Minister for abandoning the propaganda on which an election was won.  It is worthwhile to stitch into the record that the Government finally agreed that it is not a worthwhile target, that it has had no effect, that it was what I would call candy floss economics thrown at the electorate with the appearance of substance, with the taste of sweetness, but which amounted to nothing when it came to consumption.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that this is a tax reform budget, few words have to be addressed to the whole area of tax reform.  Firstly, tax reform of a radical kind cannot be achieved in one budget.  One thing is absolutely certain; tax reform of a worthwhile kind cannot be achieved unless and until there is an accepted strategy which a Minister for Finance is willing to set out in his budget speech.  The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, has come to this House, spoken about tax reform and accepted finally that the diagnosis that tax is a major inhibition to economic <Col N="306" /> participation, and therefore to economic growth, is correct and I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not spelt out his intentions regarding tax rates over a three to five year period.  That would be too difficult and too politically fraught.  He has not specified in any way any intention to widen the tax base because there is a political downside to that.  He has indulged in what I believe is the somewhat self-serving and slightly less than politically honest device of suggesting that this budget contains radical tax reform, when it most certainly does not.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position of a family on £15,000.  When the so-called tax savings in this budget resulting from the widening of the tax bands and the changing of some of the tax rates are put side by side with what will be lost in relation to budget and life assurance payments, normal to a family of that size, the family will be worse off.  An average family will be worse off under this budget rather than better off.  There is no incentive for a man in those circumstances to work harder.</P>
    <P>For a civil servant, for instance, who will be liable for PRSI and who will have a higher VHI bill this budget will prove a disaster.  Let us suppose that such a person has one or two children.  When the truth is revealed of the Government's intention in this regard, if he suffers a clawback of any substance he could be £500 or £600 worse off.  That is the extent of tax reform, it is giving tax reform a bad name.  There is no point in incremental, gradualist tax reform which burns up people's goodwill.  Real tax reform requires consensus.  However, it requires a sense of determination, a plan that people understand, the willingness of people to concede a widening of the tax base which in one sense will adversely affect them if, on the other hand, they can see tangible benefits for the economy in another direction.</P>
    <P>An ordinary, average family, at the end of Deputy Reynolds' ministrations arising out of this budget when encapsulated in the Finance Act, will be far <Col N="307" /> worse off and that is the very antithesis of tax reform.  It is designed to discredit the whole process.  This is illusion without substance, a whiff of radical policy without any reality.  It is dangerous on that account because it discredits those who come forward with proposals designed fundamentally to change the way in which our economy is run.</P>
    <P>It should be said in that context that it is easy to talk about a consensus in relation to the need for tax reform but consensus means different things to different people in this House.  To The Workers' Party it seems to mean somebody else paying, except anybody likely to vote for them.  To the Labour Party it means that you can talk in terms of a 25 per cent tax band but that that is only in relation to taxable income covered by their standard tax credit.  To Fine Gael it appears to mean &mdash; and I say this without any rancour &mdash; that there should be radical tax reform but that others must pay the political price for that, not Fine Gael. To the Government it appears that you can talk about consensus in favour of tax reform but on this occasion all they will sell is the packaging.  When the voters tear off the tinsel, pull away the ribbons so neatly stuck on in the Minister's speech, they will find the package empty and themselves worse off.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the budget speech &mdash; this is an echo of what this party have been saying in the three years since their foundation &mdash; that employment is the key to social justice.  If that is the case and if poverty is to be fought through employment &mdash; and I believe that it must be &mdash; then we must have a very different response from this Government if they accept that diagnosis.  They must lump together employment taxes such as they are and do something about remedying the situation of Ireland having the highest initial tax rate and the most anti-work biased tax system of any of the OECD countries.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reality of what is left in place if the budget measures announced here by Deputy Reynolds are implemented.</P>

      <P>With standard allowances of £3,136 which is the PAYE allowance, the PRSI allowance and the standard personal allowance, a person who earns £9,236, which is significantly less than the average industrial wage, hits a marginal tax rate not, as Deputy Noonan said, of 53 per cent but of 55.75 per cent, including PRSI.  The 48 per cent rate has not been reduced.  This represents a viciously anti-work tax system. The marginal alterations in bands and allowances cannot disguise those facts if the result is that somebody earning, say, £15,000 or £16,000 and married is slightly worse off and, when taking into account the additional PRSI payment liability because of the raised ceiling at £16,700, the single person is a couple of pence better off except for some of the clawbacks, for example, in relation to mortgages and the like.  This budget turns out to be a puff of smoke, an illusion.</P>
      <P>We have proposed as an alternative two rates of taxation, a 25 per cent and a 40 per cent rate.  We have accepted that PRSI must be brought into the equation if one is to do justice to those at the lower end of the scale, those to whom the Minister is giving a tenner to get into the labour market.  It is nonsense and also insulting.  Talk about Norman Tebbitt and his bicycle.  We have acknowledged that the financing of local government must be faced up to.  As long as it remains to be financed by the general tax fund, and particularly out of income tax, it is a huge imposition on work.  There must be a regime of a radically different kind in relation to corporate taxation and corporate Ireland must assume a greater share of the burden.  We have accepted that tax credits as opposed to tax allowances are the way forward.  Where on any of these issues is there any indication on the part of the Government that they accept any of those propositions, or any view or philosophy as to whether we are right or wrong on those strategic options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was long on irrelevancies <Col N="309" /> such as the suggestion that the banks had agreed with the Minister to make favourable loans available to young entrepreneurs.  I do not know what budgetary significance that has, except as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the banks not having to pay more by way of stamp duty.  It is not a proper part of a budget speech but of illusory showmanship, thought up more by a PR department than as a serious minded part of a budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>One of the huge areas where this budget and the Minister's expansive dilation on the economy totally goes silent is that of privatisation.  No programme is set out for the management of State assets which must be a significant portion of any strategy to get out of the present difficulties.  Why is that?  It is because privatisation has implications for the role of Government, for economic costs and, above all, for creating an entreprise environment which is the engine of growth.  In terms of the role of the Government it is worthwhile noting that the Government at the moment act as banker through ACC, ICI, and Irish Life; they act as a transport concern through Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, CIE and B &amp; I; they act as communications invester through An Post and Telecom Éireann and are now encouraging Telecom Éireann to purchase assets from another State monopoly, RTE's Cablelink network, in order to consolidate this monopoly.  They act as a broadcasting proprietor, although in a diminishing and competitive environment; they act as an energy monopolist in relation to electricity, gas, peat and oil.  They act as an insurance invester through ICI, PMPA and the VHI and as a primary production investor through forestry, sugar, steel, fertiliser, mining and many other areas.</P>
    <P>Those are functions which the Government over a period of 30 to 50 years have accreted about themselves but which are seen in this day and age as obsolete so far as the Government is concerned.  They distract Government because they require that Government should capitalise, supervise, rescue, co-ordinate and <Col N="310" /> direct all these agencies.  Now is the time for some Government Minister to spell out clearly the Government's intention in relation to this huge area of State industry and State investment which requires to be used and pruned, where necessary, and also directed, where necessary, not only to create an enterprise environment but also to get off the back of the Government and allow Government to do the real business of Government, which is addressing the competitive and enterprise environment that must be created.</P>
    <P>In addition there are State assets and State support services such as the Office of Public Works and the services provided by local government.  Apart from the role of Government, there are the economic costs of holding such assets. They involve capitalising loss-making concerns but there is also the opportunity lost of applying the money which is tied up in these enterprises.  Those moneys and the interest debt on them could be well used in other places.  If £400 million can be realised by disposing of Irish Life, that amounts to approximately £400 million saved in annual interests outgoings. If a five-year programme of sustained privatisation of assets and of semi-State concerns were embarked upon now, this Government could very simply and easily put in place an annual saving of at least £150 million in debt costs.  That £150 million could be very significant in giving the Government the leeway to tackle some of the more difficult problems on other fronts.</P>
    <P>Much more important is the third role of privatisation, this creation of a competitive environment.  We need a sustained programme for competition and enterprise.  We need to reach the stage where monopoly power is, wherever possible, dismantled, where competitive forces are, wherever possible, unleashed, where restrictive practices in the professions, the labour market or wherever else are tackled.  Above all the creation of a competitive environment must be built into our laws.  That is why the Progressive Democrats will be putting forward a radical proposal to incorporate <Col N="311" /> into Irish law competition laws and principles such as exist in America and in the European Community to give Irish business men and workers who are adversely affected by uncompetitive, anti-competition action on the part of others the right of recourse to our courts to prevent those factors from doing economic damage.</P>
    <P>A number of other factors are inhibiting the creation of employment: transport costs, energy costs, employment costs in the form of taxation to which I have adverted, communication costs, the cost of capital and the cost of risk taking.  In all those areas we need to plan for 1992.  The Ministers response in budgetary terms to the implications of VAT harmonisation seems to be abjectly inadequate bearing in mind the possible consequences for this country of failure to meet the challenge of 1992.</P>
    <P>This is a budget, or so it seems.  With a great fanfare of publicity we have Ministers with briefcases posing for cameras. We have secrecy about a document and a build-up in public anticipation lasting for days and weeks.  We have a huge panoply of press, politicians and ordinary punters all concerned about how today's events will affect them.  They will get a land this evening when they realise that tax reform means more tax bills for some and more hopelessness for those who are really excluded from the economy.  This House is not just at the races when it comes to its constitutional role as a budgetary and financial controlling agency.  The whole principle of Parliament is that this House is supposed to be in a position to reflect on, think about and control the disbursement of public moneys in a coherent and competent manner.  We come to this House every year in the most extraordinary circumstances where the Minister presents his plan to ambush the Opposition. Nobody can know what he is about to say and people must make an instant response to it.  Why should that be?  Why all the secrecy surrounding what has been announced in this budget?  I do not see any great secret.  If it had been put in a <Col N="312" /> big advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> the day before yesterday there would have been no difference in terms of implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Constitution requires that the Estimates, on which one leg of this budget rests, should be presented to the Dáil and considered as soon as possible after presentation.  It is noteworthy that Deputy Bruton put forward a White Paper, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i> which contemplated the introduction of Estimates in October of any given year.  There is a perfunctory weeklong debate nothing those Estimates in bulk while the implications of most of them still ramain obscure.  Let us take one small example.  It is proposed to take £6 million off the allocation for school transport.  We are told by the Minister for Education that this will not affect the provision of school transport for the rest of the school year.  This seems to imply that half of the £12 million left for the second half of the school year will not be expended by the Government.  It appears that half the costs in the next academic year will be borne by some other source. We were asked to note that Estimate without any of those implications being made clear to us.  By the time the Estimate has effect, this House will not have contemplated or considered the Estimate itself.  It will never have been explained and no responsibility will attach to any Member of this House because, like all Estimates, it will be implemented before it is even considered.  That flies in the face of the Constitution and it is wrong.  It was never contemplated that the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act would allow in any given year the Government to go on auto pilot and dispense 80 per cent of total expenditure last year on the same things.  It was never contemplated that the Act would permit this House lazily during the summer months to rubber stamp in retrospect the decisions of the Executive.  It is about time this House took its budgetary role seriously and had a budgetary committee to deal with, for instance, the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in circumstances which would give rise to the possibility <Col N="313" /> of dealing with it in a responsible and accountable fashion.</P>
    <P>I noted in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation that the commission asked the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners whether the Finance Bill in each year got proper and sufficient examination by the Dáil.  Both announced that it certainly did and both discounted the criticism made by others that on many occasions by a series of guillotines the provisions of the Finance Bill go unconsidered and undebated.  The Estimates process suffers the same fate. Is it not remarkable that this suits the Department of Finance because they are the Executive?  It suits them to have the House forced into the position of approving the nod what has already been done. Is it not strange too that the Commission on Taxation, a fairminded group of people by any standards, rejected the view of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on that matter and said the evidence pointed the other way.  They said they were wrong on these matters and that there should be a fiscal affairs committee of this Parliament to enable the Finance Bill to be properly considered.  What applies to the Finance Bill also applies to the Estimates.  It is quite absurd, as Deputy Bruton's White Paper pointed out, to suggest that a long rambling debate held in the dog days of the summer months on the Estimate for the Department of Education, in which every Deputy is given free rein to expatiate on every irrelevance that comes in to his mind, as long as it has some vague connection with education, amounts to a proper exercise of this House's democratic constitutional, not only right, but duty to take an active part in the budgetary process.</P>
    <P>It is about time that this House had available to it &mdash; and not to the Executive &mdash; expert economic advice.  It is great to have independent economists &mdash; whatever that phrase means &mdash; depending on what letters you read in <i>The Irish Times</i> available as consultants to the Executive but why are they not available to this House and to a committee of it?  Why <Col N="314" /> are the Revenue Commissioners immune from being brought before this House to explain why they have fallen down in this or that area in relation to tax collection? Why does this House have to take on faith, in the form of a speech which is kept under wraps in the most absurd Gilbert and Sullivan style until budget day, that the options the Minister puts before us are the best in the circumstances?  It amounts to an abdication of constitutional function and the encouragement of irresponsible politics in which the Opposition are effectively excluded from any meaningful role.  I need hardly dwell on the ridiculous rule of the House, which is not required by the Constitution, that you cannot even propose from an Opposition bench any measure which might have the effect of moving the tax burden from one person to another because that is the sole prerogative, under the Standing Orders of the House, of the Government.  That also makes for irresponsible politics and forces the Opposition merely to propose tax alleviation without costing or how the difference could be made up.</P>
    <P>The Dáil needs to take itself seriously as a financial and budgetary body.  It should stop delegating its functions to the Government and to the Executive, it should stop taking from the Government and the Executive holy writ as if it was unchallengable and infallible.  The High Court has shot one volley across the bows of the Government saying that they cannot impose customs and excise duties without reference to this House.  I hope that is the beginning of considerable judicial activism to put manners on the Executive and to force this House to live up to its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act should be struck down next and the Act which apparently we intend to employ this evening &mdash; the 1927 Act &mdash; which also amounts to an impermissible delegation by the whole of the Oireachtas to one of its Chambers as a function of temporary legislation, should follow suit so that this House will stop the business of ambush budgets and surprises being sprung on it like rabbits out of a had by <Col N="315" /> Ministers.  I remember the withholding sections introduced under the 1927 Act and what was most apparent about the debate was that the measure which this House approved was more complicated than any of the Members of this House could understand on the night it was put before them.  No effort was made to explain it to them and that kind of rubber stamp legislation has no part in a democratic and accountable parliament.</P>
    <P>Today's budget is the third introduced by this Government and the first by this Minister.  It marks the first steps in a process of abandoning any perceived strategy on their part.  There is no strategy apparent or implicit in it.  Nobody could guess, looking at this budget, what the shape of next year's budget will be. Nobody who has to plan, one way or another, for three or five years hence can see any clear message as to how the Government see taxation changing or how our debt-GNP ratio will alter with the passage of the next few years.  This lack of strategic intent is a huge weakness in the budget.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister may claim &mdash; as his predecessor did on one occasion at least &mdash; that he had very little time in which to form his own strategic views and that, in effect, he had to carry out decisions which had already been made. However, I do not see the mark of a reforming Government in the budget, I do not see the mark of a Government which have a sense of purpose.  I see all the sings of confusion, I see all the signs of a lack of stated priorities, I see all the signs of trying to please everyone in every possible way instead of a coherent strategy which may have some downsides to it but which will also have political and economic benefits for the community.</P>
    <P>The major economic problem is &mdash; and will be the same for the next five years &mdash; the question of involving people through employment in the real economic life of the country but this budget marks nothing except standing still.  It is a marking time budget, it has not done what is claimed for it, it is not a pro-employment budget. At the very lowest margins of earnings &mdash; at the figure of £3,000 to which I <Col N="316" /> referred &mdash; it has nothing to offer.  At the average salary of £15,000, a family will be worse off as a result of the budget. Those are the realities which fly from the pages of the budget speech.  There is no point in fooling ourselves that this is the stuff of radical tax reform, directional economics or the kind of budget which spells out a better future for the community. It does none of those things, it is much more concerned with appearance than substance and will be judged as that as time goes by.</P>
    <P>The people who run into higher PRSI payments, lower mortgage and life assurance relief and higher VHI liabilities over the next few months and who see the children's allowances clawed back &mdash; although it cannot be revealed in what way this will be implemented &mdash; will realise that the price of the first budget of this Minister for Finance is that they are worse off.  They will realise that, despite all the bluster, like so much of what this Government do &mdash; the propaganda is effective &mdash; the gesture to the Samaritans, St. Vincent de Paul and all the other things in the budget lard it with a veneer of concern.  However, veneer cracks very rapidly and what is left is another monument to what is becoming increasingly apparent, that the Government have no plan, do not know where they are going and are incapable of bringing the country where it should go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the introduction of his first budget.  I appreciate that he had very little time to work himself, so to speak, into it.  It is akin to the match last Saturday between Ireland and France.  The Irish team were playing on their home ground and they had the crowd well and truly behind them.  They had plenty of fire and passion and the wind behind them in the first half. Indeed they were a bit shocked by the score they achieved in the first half.  We had a lingering suspicion that perhaps they did not have the stamina to last the whole match.  Creative opportunities were missed very near the touch line.  In the second half they were in the frozen grip of the French as distinct from the <Col N="317" /> frozen grip of the Deparment of Finance. They lost the match after a heroic effort.</P>
      <P>This budget is also a chance that has been missed.  It is the third lost opportunity. I know, in charity, that that can happen.  The Taoiseach has not had an opportunity of putting all his creative ability into the budget, which is a matter of regret but quite understandable.  He lost a Minister for Finance who was a one track Minister, a person who cut but who was not creative.  The incoming Minister and the Taoiseach suffered from that but there are yardsticks by which we must judge the budget.  Is there creativity by way of tax reforms?  I know from bitter experience it is easy to say those words and difficult to put them into practice. While one Government abolished child tax allowances, they are back again under basic exemption limits, contrary to the particular admonition of the Commission on Taxation and contrary to the determination of everybody to simplify the tax system.  They are back and they will start drifting in again.  It is like giving Swansea Car Ferrry £500,000 and another £500,000 later and before you know where you are, you are running another State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no effort at harmonisation of VAT in this budget.  I will be going to the launching of the manifesto of socialist parties of the European Community on 9 and 10 February.  I can see my socialist colleagues looking at me saying:  You are going to get £3 billion between now and 1992 and what have you done on harmonisation? We have a minority Government. Ministers will be going back and forth.  Any reductions in taxes, or changes in tax rates in this budget, should have been introduced as the first stage in a major reform of the entire indirect taxation system.  That should have happened. The Taoiseach, has a unique budgetary strength in this Dáil whereby he could virtually do anything and not cause a General Election.  In some extraordinary stupidity last Sunday Deputy Dukes gave leeway whereby you could have ten forwards on the line scoring a try and the full back would not be in <Col N="318" /> sight.  That was the leeway given to the Taoiseach.  Therefore, on tax harmonisation, the bullet should have been bitten.  The achievement of a Single European Community Market requires greater harmonisation of indirect taxation. We all know that and if we are to get our £3,000 million a price has to be paid.  The price is not just that which was given to Jacques Delors when the Taoiseach met him and said we would get rid of exchange controls.  That is fair enough.  There was a <i>quid pro quo</i> on that too.  There is the other <i>quid pro quo</i> that we are going to be asked in the Community for the years 1990 up to the end of 1992 what we are doing on harmonisation. There is a need for that and nothing has been done.  There has been no reciprocation.  It will be noted in the Community and it will make it more difficult in 1990, 1991 and 1992.</P>
    <P>There is no fundamental reform of capital taxation in this budget and the dogs in the street are saying that the imbalance lies there.  There is a huge imbalance on capital taxation.  I do not want to weary this House with capital taxation as a percentage of GNP.  We all know how minuscule it is but there is no reform. There is no fundamental reform of corporation tax, other than the implementation of the 43 per cent rate proposed last year, and beyond that there is nothing very much in tax changes in the budget. Therefore, I want to comment &mdash; I do not want to delay the House unduly &mdash; this evening on some of the proposals being made here.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is an obligation and a direct responsibility on the Government to show their hand on child benefit.  If the Government have decided to clawback child benefit from persons above a certain income level from early next year, then that Government decision should be disclosed. There are 475,000 families in this country, I happen to be one of them. There are 1.163 million children in the country.  We paid £205 million in 1988 on child benefit.  If child benefit is clawed back from people with an income of over £17,500 a year there will be a saving of £38 million; if the money is clawed back <Col N="319" /> from people with an income of over £15,000 a year, child benefit will be cut by £54 million.  I had the figures riveted in my brain for four years as I tried to convince the former Government not to do it.  I passionately believe that this is about the only social transfer expenditure which we give to women in Ireland.  There are women of substantial means whose husbands would not give them the price of a pair of stockings, a bar of soap or money to buy a bar of chocolate for their children, therefore there is a social policy decision to be taken.  I am sick and tired of the Tony O'Reilly editorials in the <i>Irish Independent</i> saying the Labour Party are not being responsible in refusing to have child benefit taxed.  Why should we, the rich get child benefit?  Rich is a very relative term as regards the distribution of family income and it is something which the Government should re-examine. They made the announcement today, presumably on food of a Government decision, because the budget arithmetic for 1990 involves a huge input of a minimum of £35 million to £40 million and we need clarification in that regard because I am worried about that decision and it requires clarification by the Government. The figures I have given are ones which I am well aware of and which are available to the Government.  Presumably they had a special working document in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other aspect I would stress is social welfare.  It is not correct to say that we are giving the long term unemployed 12 per cent, no more than it was correct last year.  We are giving single adults 12 per cent.  I thank the Taoiseach who took the decision last year, which was 11 per cent. Presumably, and with no disrespect to the Minister for Finance, he took the same decision this year and I commend it.  For a husband and wife it was 7 per cent last year and it has risen to 8.6 per cent this year.  We should put the record straight.  I am pleased that a £70 benefit in 1988 is being increased by £6 for a husband and wife in 1989.  I welcome that increase and it is the least we might do. In that regard the Government are to be commended.  I would also make the point <Col N="320" /> that the carryover cost is not substantial. I remember having that argument way back in 1983 when I did it first as Minister for Social Welfare.  We did it again in 1984 and 1985 and we had the rates higher than the general level of inflation at the time.  While I do not have the working papers and the exact costs now, I remember the carryover effect was substantial but the individual cost per annum was not that great.  I do not cavil, I am very pleased that that has happened.  My own party, and individual Deputies in the House from other parties, and many social organisations, have stressed in trenchant terms the need for increases of that nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with a number of other aspects of the budget. On the taxation side, I cannot understand the Government's decision to increase the flat rate refund to farmers to 2 per cent with effect from 1 March, and at a cost of £12 million.  Frankly, I do not know where in God's name we are going on that issue.  In 1986 this refund stood at 2.4 per cent as I well remember but the Government decided in their wisdom to bring it down to 1.7 per cent in the 1987 budget and in the 1988 budget it was brought down to 1.4 per cent.  The then Minister, Mr. MacSharry, waved the stick at the farming community and said it they did not pay up, we would abolish it altogether and they would get nothing. The income tax take from farmers in 1987 was £35 million and £9 million was clawed back on the tax refund scheme.  In 1988 the income tax take from farmers went up a little to £42 million and £7 million was clawed back in the tax refund.  I had thought that in 1989 with farmer's incomes up 17 per cent on last year and 13 per cent on the previous year that a handback of £12 million in 1989 would be totally unexpected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not unexpected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The farming community are voting for the Government because they have had two years of extraordinarily good weather and of extraordinarily good prices, particularly for <Col N="321" /> sheep and milk, the two basic high earners. The farmers have done extraordinarily well so we are in a situation where the Government should say, &ldquo;even if you did pay up £60 million, including tax collected during the amnesty, so what, you have had magnificent increases in income over the past two years, you are voting for us now and are not going to desert us on the basis of the decision not to touch the refund&rdquo;.  It could have been left as it was at 1.4 per cent and indeed that would have been important. I appreciate that from next April farmers will be paying 4 per cent PRSI, plus employment and health contributions of 2¼ per cent for their social welfare pensions, but those rates are relatively low. I pay 6½ per cent as a voluntary contributor up to the ceiling maximum, but I have to pay it if I want to get cover for my wife and children and to have a death benefit in the event of my departing from the scene in an explosion of rhetoric.</P>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with the supplementary EC programme.  Again, and I do not want to be unctuous about the matter, I think the Taoiseach has not had the opportunity of lashing about in an effective way on the question of Community aid.  He probably made a fundamental error in embroiling the Minister for the Environment in that particular exercise in the first instance.  He should have left it to the Minister for Finance. If I had been Minister for Finance, I would have had a very trenchant argument with the Taoiseach of the day on the line that as Minister for Finance I was going to Brussels, that I would not mind if he sent a few altar boys or Ministers of State or perhaps altar women with me, but that I was not going to have this plethora of other Ministers, particularly the Minister for the Environment who, incidentally, has subsumed some vague, ambitious, undefined overlordship of community activity.  I expect that was a way of keeping him quiet when he wanted to be Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent ministerial delegation that went to Brussels was designed, as we know, to put pressure on the Commission <Col N="322" /> to make extra funds available but the result was one of confusion, a slight degree of humiliation which the Taoiseach can rectify at a summit meeting because his relationship with Mr. Delors and presumably with the current Irish Commissioner, <i>et al</i> is excellent.  I have no doubt that he can rescue the situation. However, it was a dangerous exercise, and one which did not do us any good, particularly when we are £3 billion supplicants to the Community between now and 1992.  Equally it does not do any good to walk into the House and state that the Government are putting an extra £10 million back into sanitary services from Community funds, when we all know and anybody in the Commission can read in the Government's abridged Book of Estimates that £7.5 million was taken from the Estimates for 1989.  That kind of sleight of hand does not cod anybody.</P>
    <P>Equally there has been massive reduction in expenditure on roads in terms of the provision for 1989 in the Book of Estimates and we are reinstating Community money to jack the figures back up for 1989 on the basis that the Community might not be particularly cognisant of the fact.  The Community is well and truly aware of what we are doing.  That sleight of hand might have worked from 1974 to 1979 when we would have got away with it in the earlier days of the Community, but not now.  The codology of an automatic transfer of 70 to 75 per cent to this country is not a correct analysis of the overall position.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the <i>Principal Features of 1989 Budget</i> and the item on health.  There is another sleight of hand here.  The Government have reinstated &mdash; and I am delighted to see it &mdash; £8.1 million of an additional allocation to health.  After all the argument the money is put back again.  It is like last year. Deputies may remember the abolition of the long term illness scheme and also the community drugs scheme which cost £11 million but which was reinstated on budget day.  Fair dues, the trick has been done again.  There is the straight disclosure of the deferment of measures to increase income for agencies in the health <Col N="323" /> sector.  The £8 million involved was to come from charges such as the charge of £5 to make an application for a refund of drugs, or £10 to apply for a form F111 to go abroad or the increases from £10 to £12.50 for each day in a public bed or for out-patient services.  All this has gone.  In fairness, my colleague, the Labour Party spokesman on health, Deputy Howlin, highlighted this and the Government had enough sense not to create more trouble for themselves in the health sector, where they are in dire difficulty already.  I commend the Minister for Health for reinstating the £8 million.  It is difficult enough at times to decipher what precisely he is up to but I commend his effective style in camouflaging what exactly he may be up to.  However, he has got the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education should follow his example because all she got out of the totality of the relationship with the Cabinet and the Taoiseach is £1.1 million &mdash; a miserly couple of pounds in capitation fees.  The Taoiseach would spend that in an afternoon meeting delegations. He would throw them a few bob.  He would give the St. Vincent de Paul Society £.5 million and the Federation of Emigrant Organisations would get £.25 million to keep them quiet.  The Irish Embassy in Britain is doing a good job.  In fairness I am glad that the Taoiseach has made that allocation.  I am also delighted that he has made an allocation to the Rape Crisis Centre but these should not be budget matters and should not even require an announcement from the Minister for Finance.  They are matters for individual Ministers.</P>
    <P>In relation to education, it is not just £1.2 million, it is a cut of £5.8 million in school transport, and all hell will break loose, as the Taoiseach knows well.  He has received the correspondence from the transport union, my union, and I have received copies of it.  Although I am not quite sure of the name of the new union I will be joining, I welcome warmly the decision of both unions to amalgamate, to the betterment of the country. Unquestionably, the Government will run into dire trouble because 150 people <Col N="324" /> are to be laid off throughout the country on the school transport scene and many of the 6,500 routes will have to be slashed unless the £5.8 million is reinstated.  It is time Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, got up on her bicycle and rode from Marlborough Street to the Taoiseach's office and put in her spoke to get the money, because this is going to be a major issue.  It is a serious cut in education which cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>Public service pay, a delicate subject, is the Achilles' heel of every Government &mdash; I am not sure whether it includes the remuneration Vote for early retirement. I presume the £25 million is subsumed and it now hits the historic £3 billion mark.  We recall only too well that we in Government had several confrontations on special pay, but now £47 million, not £30 million, is lashed into the budget, as much as is given in social welfare, to meet the exigencies of special pay.</P>
    <P>A <i>quid pro quo</i> is put up that 160,000 modified PRSI public servants, if I may classify them as such, will be called upon to pay a higher rate &mdash; we know that is only a blind &mdash; subject to agreement with the ICTU.  If congress does not agree, has the Taoiseach ever said &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  Congress will not agree unless the Taoiseach provides full contributory pensions on top of public service pensions.  I do not believe the terms of that decision will be implemented because all sorts of pressures will be brought to bear.  Not only are the Government now confronted with £3 billion, but they have decided &mdash; for what reason I am not sure &mdash; that another 3,000 public servants have to go in 1989. From which area are they going?  Mostly health but presumably some will go from the education area too.  There is talk about a second round in education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Admittedly it will never reach the level of lunacy suggested by a former Minister for Finance &mdash; that people leave at 45 years of age.  He was brought back from the brink of that farcical cut.  From which area will these <Col N="325" /> 3,000 people go?  Will they be from local authorities, health?</P>

      <P>There will be only 400 or 500 there at the most, but the Government will lash out another £25 million for early retirements.  Last year we spent £96 million, tax free, between accelerated pensions and lump sum payments on early retirement.  We now have 52 year old civil servants walking in the Dublin Mountains wondering what in the name of God they are going to do next as they contemplate their early retirement.  We even have the ludicrous example of a former officer of the Department of Finance, with full pension and lump sum, taking up a position in a public service organisation, wholly State funded, because somebody forgot to include an abatement provision in such a decision. If another 3,000 public servants are to go, the Minister for Finance might consider at least including an abatement provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is unique among Ministers for the Public Service in Europe in that respect.  Recently at a meeting in Spain &mdash; admittedly dealing with tobacco, and the Taoiseach was warmly complimented on the work he had done from 1978 onwards &mdash; I explained to some Ministers there the kind of provisions we had for early retirement, public service lump sum payments and the way we were dealing with them, and they found it incredible.  They assumed we had a GNP and GDP availability of resources which, to judge from our submissions, was never in evidence to them.  The Government should review the decision to let another 3,000 public servants go because in the health services it means more bed closures in public wards, the VHI will have more pressure brought to bear on them, we will have another increase in contributions at the end of 1989, and the current chaos with accelerating increases in the non-elective and elective waiting lists will only get worse.  I do not propose to elaborate further on that because the <Col N="326" /> House is only too well aware of the overall crisis in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to support the increase in the price of cigarettes as proposed in the Budget Statement.  In Government I managed to convince the Government in 1983 to increase the price of cigarettes by 10p, in 1984 by another 10p, in 1985 by another 10p, and in 1986 when finally they got sick of me I made it 7p, but it is a matter of record that in the past three budgets, 1987, 1988 and 1989 it was 4p. The Taoiseach knows from the mayhem caused on public health by the appalling habit of smoking and the need to curb the extension of that habit among our young people, particularly young women of fertile age, that there is an urgent need to ensure that the price of cigarettes is as penal and punitive as possible.  If the increase was doubled today I would not cavil at that as one who knows only too well the harm cigarettes can cause.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work in bringing in his first budget.  If I am being critical, perhaps the Minister can be excused because he did not have a full year's run at it.  I hope he will not suffer the occupational disease of the Department of Finance of a frozen elbow in terms of the ability to sit down and write out the basic reforms that are necessary. We will receive from the Revenue Commissioners 55,000 reasons why it cannot be done.  When we wanted to bring in a standard rate for mortgage interest of 35 per cent, a standard rate for VHI of 35 per cent and a standard rate for life assurance of 35 per cent, we were told it could not be done.  We would have to recast completely the PRSI system, and after a short, cryptic note from the Revenue Commissioners it was dropped.  It should not be dropped.</P>
    <P>Admittedly mortgage interest relief has been tailored downwards today.  It may sober up some of those in my constituency who are paying £120,000 for houses which, in some cases, are a load of rubbish.  I would not pay £50,000 for some of them but the people concerned have money.  In some cases it is hot money from the UK which is being sent home.  The Minister's move may dampen <Col N="327" /> some of the excess demand at the top end of the market from which the only people to benefit are the auctioneers.  Their percentages are increased as the market is hyped up.  To that extent I do not cavil with the Minister's move although it will hit some people.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation have argued that such allowances should be phased out, or at least brought down to the standard rate.  The same could have been done in relation to VHI premiums. The £10 million or £12 million saved in that exercise could have been used to reopen beds in public hospitals which are being crucified by the cuts. They will not receive any help from the budget.  I understand that some of them are reduced to charging visitors 50p to park a car in the grounds of the hospital from which they hope to raise £40,000 or £50,000 annually.  They are doing that in desperation to try to run some wards.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Taoiseach that the budget exercise has somewhat depressed me.  There are many reasons why that is so.  The budget does not have creativity, reform or flair and above all, does not have courage to take difficult decisions.  The Minister gets this opportunity once a year and once he passes it up the problems become more difficult to deal with.</P>

      <P>After four hours of speeches on the budget I am sure Members, and those listening on the radio, do not have the stomach for much more.  However, there are a number of points that need to be repeated.  It is clear that the budget is fairly big on illusion, on giving the impression that it is dealing with major issues such as unemployment, poverty and tax reform, which the Minister declared as his objectives when he opened his speech today.  If one looks closely at what is in the budget one will find that while it may be big and colourful it is somewhat like a stick of candy floss, when one bites into it there is virtually nothing there.  In my view it is more of an exercise in public and political relations then a real attempt to come to grips with <Col N="328" /> the major social and economic problems facing the country, problems like poverty, low pay, emigration and unemployment. It is a budget drafted with the specific objective of protecting Fianna Fáil's position in the opinion polls and ensuring the continued support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats in the Dáil.  In that regard it would appear to have been quite successful because, despite strong speeches from the spokespersons of those parties, they indicated that they do not propose to oppose the budget.</P>
      <P>I should like to advise people to examine the small print of the budget.  If they do they will find that virtually nothing has been done to improve the plight of those most in need.  They will see that many features of the budget will worsen their position.  Those who take the trouble to examine the budget will find that inside the velvet glove of the ministerial scriptwriter is the iron fist of the new Minister for Finance.  The most disappointing aspect of the budget must be its failure to make any attempt to tackle the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>After speaking for more than 90 minutes the best the Minister could offer was that the money we hope to get from the EC just might create an additional 3,000 jobs.  Later in his statement he outlined his policy in relation to the public service and it will ensure that at least 3,000 more jobs will be lost.  Effectively, we have one effort at proposed job creation being cancelled out by the Government's policy in relation to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the money from the European Community creates 3,000 jobs it will represent a decrease in the live register of 0.1 per cent.  What the unemployed want more than increases in social welfare benefits, welcome as they are, are jobs but the Government have not given them anything to hope for.  As a result many more will have to take the emigrant boat. It is interesting to note that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach indicated today that on the basis of figures available to date it was expected that emigration will increase during the <Col N="329" /> year 1988-89.  Deputy Michael Noonan indicated that emigration may have been as high as 73,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare are not adequate given the level of poverty.  In many cases a big portion of the increase will be clawed back by rises in such items as differential rents.  The implementation of the increases have been pushed back to July and people will lose a part of their mortgage interest relief and relief on their insurance policies.  That may not be a big problem for those on high incomes but there are many people on incomes which may seem substantial in terms of what those on social welfare have to exist on who have to pay for virtually everything they seek, whether it is education or health, and such a loss in mortgage interest relief for them is significant.</P>
    <P>There is not anything in the budget to help mortgage holders who become unemployed.  No effort is made to ensure that the mortgage relief they had while employed is converted into a form of subsidy so that they can remain in the house they are trying to buy.  A significant number of houses are being repossessed at present because people cannot maintain the repayments as a result of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation there is the impression of much activity but the benefit for most taxpayers will be negligible. Looking at some of the figures issued with the budget one will see that a single person on an income of £80 per week will gain an extra 50p in tax relief while a person on £600 per week will gain £17 per week in tax relief.  There are grave anomalies in the way our tax system works.  Clearly, the way those reliefs work in the budget, the more one earns the better off one will be in terms of relief.  The PAYE sector will continue to bear roughly the same share of the overall tax burden.  Farmers, despite paying virtually no income tax, have been given additional reliefs and no attempt has been made to increase the rate of tax take from the business sector despite massive increases in their profitability.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have consistently <Col N="330" /> opposed the economic policies of the Government from their first budget when it became clear that they had betrayed every commitment made to the electorate while in Opposition and during the 1987 general election campaign.  We are opposing this budget as it represents a continuation of that economic policy which can be summarised as simply a philosophy of making the poor bear the cost of balancing the books.  There is no dispute about the need to bring order to the financial affairs of the State, and particularly to the cost of servicing the huge levels of borrowings.  We have never believed, however, that it was acceptable to deal with that problem by increasing the poverty of the poor or intensifying the disadvantage of the disadvantaged. The policy of cutbacks at any price, cleverly referred to these days as savings, has wreaked havoc on our health, education and welfare services, all areas of vital importance to those surviving on middle and low incomes, whether they are on social welfare or in poorly paid jobs.</P>
    <P>The objective of any reasonable Government should be a more even distribution of wealth and resources but the impact of Fianna Fáil has been to accentuate the gap between the rich and the rest and to create a two tiered society. Given the appalling levels of poverty which have been widely documented by a wide range of independent groups over the past 12 months, the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments is particularly cruel.  The practice of increasing social welfare in line with inflation, as the Minister has done today except in so far as he gave an extra increase to the long term unemployed, can only be acceptable where the levels of social welfare are already adequate. This is clearly not the case and is a fact recognised by many organisations, including the Commission on Social Welfare, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Combat Poverty Agency and by an increasing number of church bodies such as the Catholic Social Services Council, the Council for Major Religious Superiors and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  There is also <Col N="331" /> a host of other organisations dealing with the homeless who agree that social welfare is not adequate.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Commission on Social Welfare recommended a basic minimum income level of between £50 and £60 a week for a single person.  In 1989 terms that would be the equivalent of between £55 and £65 a week.  Yet, a recent report of the Combat Poverty Agency revealed that one-third of the population are living on incomes below £48 a week per adult. That is an average figure.  There are many unemployed people, particularly young unemployed people, who have no income whatsoever because they are means tested out of the system.  Even with the increases announced by the Minister, welcome as they are, an adult on long term social assistance will still be asked to survive on less than 80 per cent of the amount the Commission on Social Welfare identified as the basic minimum requirement.  We must keep in mind that minimum means are just that.  In most cases such income will do no more than keep people in a kind of twilight zone life of never being able to do more than live quietly in frugal misery.  Any budget which fails to address the problems of poverty in all its guises cannot be accepted by The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>It is surely a savage indictment of almost 70 years of self-Government under successive conservative Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Administrations that so little progress has been made towards eliminating poverty and achieving the sort of social equity envisaged by leaders like James Connolly or envisaged in the democratic programme of the First Dáil. In many respects the situation seems to be getting worse.  The Combat Poverty Agency found that more than three-quarters of a million people were now living in some degree of poverty, that children currently made up a higher proportion of the poor than they did 15 years ago and that the top 20 per cent of Irish families still enjoy 44 per cent of gross income in the State while the bottom 20 per cent have to do with less than 5 per cent of the gross income of the State.</P>
    <P>Poverty is more than simply the <Col N="332" /> absence of adequate income.  Many with a reasonable income are impoverished because of the absence of access to adequate health and educational facilities. This has been worsened in recent years due to the policy of cutbacks pursued by this Government and indeed by a previous Coalition administration.  The two tiered nature of our health system has never been more obvious, with those who can afford luxurious private hospitals receiving prompt and effective treatment while all others must face longer and longer queues and rapidly deteriorating facilities.</P>
    <P>This budget has made no reference to the question of the VHI and whether the drug refund scheme for VHI subscribers who suffer from long term illnesses will be retained or whether the Minister intends to push ahead with abolishing it. The budget does not refer either to the fact that there is tax relief for schemes D and E in the VHI which effectively are schemes for luxury private hospitals.  The taxpayer is subsidising those who avail of hospitals like the Blackrock Clinic, the Mater Private and other private hospitals around the country.  Taxpayers are subsiding these, and the Government have made no attempt to eliminate that anomaly.</P>
    <P>The advances made in the sixties and seventies in first and second level education which were a potent force for progress towards social equity have been whittled away by cutbacks.  The Minister will expect that the extra £2.50 capitation grant to primary schools will be welcomed and I have no doubt that it is welcome, but when compared with the fact that the pupil/teacher ratio has been increased, that many schools simply do not have adequate buildings in which to teach children and that some schools do not have adequate teaching staffs, the nod in the direction of education in this budget is more of an insult than an advance.  Third level education in the universities in particular has remained virtually inaccessible to persons from low income families, with only 1 per cent of children from low income families in <Col N="333" /> some areas making it to third level education while 44 per cent of children from more affluent parents make it to third level education.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have always urged that one of the principal causes of poverty was long term unemployment and that a major part of the solution was therefore a massive job creation programme.  Fianna Fáil came into power promising to put the country back to work but have made no serious effort to deliver on their promise. In fact, they have put many more on the emigrant boat than they have put into jobs.  When Fianna Fáil came into office in March 1987 unemployment was at 249,000 or 19 per cent.  Two years later the number on the live register was 243,000 or 18.7 per cent.  In the same period an estimated 60,000 people have been forced to emigrate and tens of thousands more have been taken off the register and forced to participate in pointless training programmes, pointless and demoralising programmes, because those participating know that they are being trained for jobs that do not exist.  The real level of unemployment is clearly very much higher than the official figures suggest.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Estimates and from this budget that this Government are not going to do anything serious about unemployment or emigration.  The Government will do less this year about unemployment than last year and even less than was done eight years ago when unemployment was at less than half its present level and emigration was quite low.  This was revealed by the shocking cuts in capital spending.  They are shocking because with capital spending one could directly reduce unemployment, particularly for the most vulnerable and less skilled and because reductions in capital spending are extremely short-sighted. In 1989 the nominal amount of Exchequer funded capital spending will be less than in 1980.  Unemployment was far lower then, yet £660 million was invested by the State in the economy compared to the mere £617 million spent this year, a year in which every economic <Col N="334" /> indicator except employment is at its most favourable for decades.</P>
    <P>Surely now is the time to invest for those who believe in what I choose to call economic witchcraft, the people who believe in climates for enterprise, in atmospheres for enterprise and in environments for enterprise and other nebulous concepts, who seem to think that if one uses these as the guiding lines for progress, all will be well.  If real capital spending in 1989 is to be maintained at the same level as in 1980 then it should be at the level of £1,393 million, more than twice the level planned.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party do not believe that investment policy should be determined by so-called climates but must be active and planned, particularly in a small, peripheral and late-developing economy such as ours.  However, one cannot but be struck by the very favourable so-called climate for investment here.  Growth is at 2 per cent, having been a minus figure for several years, manufacturing output is soaring, productivity is high, industrial disputes are rare, exports are booming, imports down and we have the highest balance of payments surplus within the EC.  The Government say the national debt is under control, largely, let it be said, as a result of tax dodgers having availed of the amnesty.  Farmers' incomes are rising speedily, interest rates are down and profits are booming.  Yet, despite those factors &mdash; all the things Governments and business interests have told us year in, year out were necessary for job creation &mdash; there is no significant increase in investment by private enterprise here, certainly nothing like the level necessary to make any serious impact on unemployment.  In fact the most successful Irish companies are investing in jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>Surely, when interest rates are low, profits booming and the so-called climate is right for enterprise, the Government should be taking the lead in investment, particularly when so much needs to be done?  One cannot create jobs merely with climates; one has to do something; one has to invest.  The forecasted level of investment this year is up on last year <Col N="335" /> when it was almost nil.  Nevertheless it is much lower than in the seventies when double figure percentage increases were the norm.  The Government are making a grave mistake in effectively making savage cuts in the most job-creating area of our economy.  Much investment will have to take place eventually and these cuts constitute merely postponements; roads, sewers, drainage and local authority housing along with new school buildings are needed.  Why not build them now when work is so desperately needed, when interest rates are low, when the debt is more manageable and when such work would boost the economy?</P>
    <P>The miserly tax concessions announced by the Minister are quite inadequate given the disproportionate share of the tax burden the PAYE sector has borne for so long.  Despite the tax marches many years ago there has been no real progress made in this area of tax reform. In the past five years the position of PAYE workers has deteriorated significantly, especially when compared with farmers and other business interests.</P>
    <P>An analysis of official figures shows that in the period 1983 to 1987 the average tax paid by PAYE workers increased from £1,911 to £2,920, representing an increase of £1,049 or 55 per cent.  In the same period the average tax paid by farmers decreased from £705 to £585, a decrease of 17 per cent.  What this means is that the average PAYE worker was paying £56 per week in tax in 1987 while the average farmer was paying £11.25. Incredibly the average tax paid by farmers has actually decreased in each of the past five years.  Last year we are told that £42 million was received by way of farmers' income tax while unregistered farmers received something like £80 million in VAT refunds.  Now we are told that the refund to unregistered farmers will be increased which will mean an additional £12 million to them.</P>
    <P>There has been no significant improvement in the position of the self employed. In 1983 the average PAYE worker payed £401 per annum more than his average self-employed counterpart.  In 1987 the <Col N="336" /> gap remained at £394.  Given that the self-employed category includes so many high-earning professions, such as medical consultants, engineers, lawyers and accountants, it is an outrage that the average return from this sector should be £2,526 only compared with £2,920 from the PAYE sector.  Let it be said that the budgetary provisions do not change these figures at all.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to farmer taxation has reached the stage of being a scandal of enormous proportions.  The Workers' Party accept that many farmers are living on or below the poverty line but there are also many large scale, intensive farmers making very substantial profits who clearly are not meeting their tax obligations to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments, Fianna Fáil and Coalition, have paid lip service to the principle of tax reform while they have continued to lift more and more from the pockets of PAYE workers.  The tax concessions granted under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have made no impact on the position and much more drastic action is needed in order to give PAYE workers a fair deal.  A start should have been made in this budget by transferring a substantial portion of the burden &mdash; at least 10 per cent &mdash; from wage and salary earners to farmers, the self-employed and companies.  That would not have meant an overall reduction in the tax take but would have meant that the burden would have been more evenly shared.</P>
    <P>We must ask why this Government have failed yet again to make progress towards ensuring that the business and corporate sectors are required to pay a reasonable share of taxation?  For example, taxes on corporate income as a percentage of total taxation fell from more than 9 per cent in 1965 to 3.6 per cent in 1987 and increased marginally only last year to just over 4 per cent.  It must be remembered that four out of five companies pay no tax at all; in other words, one company in every five only pay any tax.  Irish business has the best tax environment in Europe.  Employers' PRSI is the third lowest within the EC <Col N="337" /> and the European OECD countries.  Yet we continue to hear demands for a reduction on tax in business.  It is virtually impossible to give further tax concessions to business without formally exempting them from payment of any form of taxation. Despite the softest tax regime in Europe the business sector has failed dismally to create any form of real employment. There is scope to increase rather than decrease tax on business.</P>
    <P>We must ask also why this Government have made no progress in eliminating the sort of tax avoidance schemes highlighted by the Supreme Court decision in the McGrath case.  We heard the Minister promise, in the course of his speech, to do something about it in the Finance Bill, contending that such proposal is being actively considered.  I would pose the question as to why the Minister has chosen to signal to those engaged in tax dodging in this way that he intends taking action.  It is outrageous that, at a time when people on relatively modest incomes are paying up to 58p &mdash; to be decreased to 56p &mdash; in the pound by way of PAYE, a small, wealthy élite should be permitted to avail of artificial devices to avoid payment of tax on very substantial gains.  The fact that it is admitted by those involved that these schemes are designed specifically for the purpose of tax avoidance infuriates worker who see their paypackets decimated by tax deductions each week.  The fact that &mdash; as a result of the McGrath case &mdash; these extremely wealthy individuals not alone had the tax refunded but also had interest paid on it by the State, simply adds insult to injury.  Tax avoidance has become almost an industry in its own right, with those who have the wealth to employ accountants and tax consultants availing of every possible device and loophole to limit or totally eliminate their tax liability while the overall tax burden on workers grows each year.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance schemes are in total conflict with the commitments given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to the effect that greater tax equity should <Col N="338" /> be achieved.  The Government give a specific commitment in that programme that, in the tax area, they would make whatever changes were considered necessary whether administrative or legal.  I regard the Minister's statement today that he intends introducing some from of restriction in the Finance Bill as a clear signal to those people who are using the law to avoid legitimate tax liability to get their act in order or they will be caught. The Workers' Party now insist on action in this area to close off these loopholes and we insist that the relevant legislation be retrospective.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed to tackle in any serious manner the issues of unemployment, emigration, poverty, low pay or tax reform, the crises in our public health service, or indeed the issue of equal access of all our children to quality education or of proper funding of local government.  All of those issues have been dodged.  The provisions of this budget condemn hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to continue living on the edge of desperation.  The Workers' Party will continue their vigorous opposition to this Government and will do everything possible to mobilise public opinion in support of an alternative approach to the economy.</P>
    <P>In that regard I have sought to bring together all those agencies concerned with the quality of people's lives and who have come to conclusions similar to ours. There has been a positive response to my invitation to those groups to consider a rainbow coalition to oppose the current Right wing consensus and to mobilise people into constructive, coherent support for an alternative political strategy. A rainbow coalition, consisting of The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, the trade unions and the various groups concerned about the levels of poverty in our society in all its forms, could create a demand for radical political change.  The limited objectives of such a rainbow coalition could include the implementation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, the genuine tax reform needed, a statutory minimum wage, <Col N="339" /> which has been dodged by all the conservative parties in this House, a genuine job creation programme based on our resources and investment by Government in job creation, the protection of part-time workers and guaranteed access &mdash; it has to be equal access &mdash; to high quality health and education services.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will be voting against this budget tonight.  It is notable, despite strong speeches made by their spokesmen, that the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats have indicated they will not be voting against it.  I urge them to reconsider and to follow us into the opposition lobby tonight to defeat the Government and to let people speak about how they feel about the policies of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

    <P>Resolution No. 1 deals with the proposal to increase the excise duty on beer. The effect of the resolution will be to <Col N="344" /> increase by 1p, including VAT, the price of a pint of beer.  This will bring in £5.7 million in 1989 and £6.9 million in a full year.  The effect of the change on the CPI will be 0.05 per cent.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Resolution No. 2 is to give effect to an excise duty increase of 2p, including VAT, on a glass of spirits. This will bring in £3.2 million in 1989 and £3.5 million in a full year.  The effect on the CPI is estimated to be 0.04 per cent.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Resolution No. 3 is to give effect to an excise duty increase of 4p, including VAT, on a 75 cl bottle of table wine or made wine and will provide for a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the case of stronger wines and sparkling wines.  It will bring in £600,000 in 1989 and £700,000 in a full year and the estimated effect on the CPI is 0.004 per cent.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 4 will give effect to an excise duty increase of 25p, including VAT, per gallon of ordinary strength cider or perry with <i>pro rata</i> increases for cider and perry in the middle and higher alcoholic strength ranges.  It will bring in £500,000 in 1989 and £600,000 in a full year and it will have no effect on the CPI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing which strikes me on looking at the information which the Taoiseach has given us is why have the Government gone to all the bother of putting another 4p on a bottle of wine and 25p a gallon on cider and perry for £1.1 million this year and £1.3 million in a full year.  I am sure that if the Government had put their minds to it really seriously they could have squeezed at least that amount from this fictional revenue buoyancy they are going to have from this European money they think they might get, if they ever get around to having a plan.  It seems to me that these are just more irritations than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why there is such a disproportionate increase in the duty on cider and perry, that is if there is going to be one in the first place.  There is a penny on a pint, 2p on a glass of spirits, 4p on a bottle of wine and <i>pro rata</i> for stronger wines but 3p on a pint of cider.  I wonder why an increase of that magnitude has <Col N="345" /> been put forward for cider?  Is it because there is a feeling that cider is in some way less desirable or less tolerable or is it because cider is supposed to be a more dangerous drink in some respects than spirits or wine?</P>
    <P>I should also like the Taoiseach to tell us the total increases in the prices of each of these commodities in the past year.  In relation to beer, for example, it is only a very short while since there was a substantial increase in the brewers' price, and unless I am mistaken I think there was another increase imposed by the brewers sometime during the past 12 months.  I stand open to correction on that but I should like the Taoiseach to tell us what the increases have been during the past 12 months.  If one takes all of these increases together the total revenue in 1989 will be £10 million and not an awful lot more than that in a full year.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to us what effects the Government expects these changes to have on the consumption of each of these products and how that compares with what has been happening to consumption during the past 12 months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, with regard to wine and cider, I think the increase is just in the interests of fair play; if we are going to increase the cost of beer and spirits it is only fair that the duty on wine and cider should be increased also.  One of the principal reasons for the increase on cider, and I think it owes its origin to history, is that because cider was very much an infant industry and a native industry it was always very gently treated by successive Ministers for Finance at budget time.  The situation has changed very considerably and there has been a very considerable increase in the consumption of cider.  The consumption of cider and perry increased by 5 per cent in 1983 and has more than doubled since 1980 so the feeling is that it is only fair that the duty on cider should be brought somewhat into line with the other alcoholic beverages.  The excise duty on beer is more than four times that on cider <Col N="346" /> and perry although beer is generally considered to be of a slightly lower alcoholic strength.  So the present increase is really a step in the direction of correcting this imbalance in view of the very considerable increase there is in the consumption of cider.  The increase on wine is simply on the basis of keeping a balance between the different forms of alcoholic beverages.  If the duty on beer and cider is going up, it is only fair that the duty on wine should go up also even though the return is very small by comparison.</P>
      <P>In regard to price increases by the trade, these increases represent a 26 per cent increase in the trade price of the pint since March 1986, which is almost three times the rate of inflation over the same period.  I hope that information will suffice for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with what the Taoiseach has just said because it strikes me that the increases under these four headings are very small indeed.  In view of the very substantial non-tax increases in the last two years, and the figure given by the Taoiseach of 26 per cent in a little over two years is certainly very substantial, I would have thought that the small duty increases could have been absorbed.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the increase proposed under Financial Resolution No. 6 is being absorbed in the sense that there were increases that would otherwise have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I am not terribly concerned about the duty increases here which are small and are not of much consequence one way or the other.  What I am concerned about is a matter I raised here earlier today in relation to the use of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which was mentioned in each one of these four resolutions. The last part of Financial Resolution No. 1 reads:</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution should have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>There is considerable doubt as to whether that Act is now constitutional.  In fact, among lawyers there seems to be general agreement that the probability is that it is not constitutional and if any of these resolutions which are passed tonight are challenged before the Finance Act is passed, it may well be that they will be set aside.  In this respect, I would like to refer to an article in the Dublin University Law Journal, 1985, by Mr. G. W. Hogan, one of the many brilliant people within our&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather think he does.  If the Deputy read some of his work, he would agree that he puts his brains to very good use, not least in this article where he argues very strongly that the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, is unconstitutional and sets out the reasons, and he has been held to be right.  The High Court has agreed with him in the recent case &mdash; McDaid <i>v.</i> Sheehy which was decided last week.  He goes on then to argue that if the 1957 Act is unconstitutional, the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, must also be unconstitutional for the same reasons which apply in this case.</P>
      <P>I would like to read a short extract from what he has to say on page 139 of that journal:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> The Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 is not the only statute in this area which appears to be vulnerable to challenge. The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 permits the raising of existing taxes by Dáil resolution.  This statutory mechanism is used to cover the interim period between the Budget and the enactment of the Finance Act for that fiscal year.  Although certain safe-guards are built into this procedure &mdash; including a provision that such resolutions lapse after four months of the date of their taking effect unless reenacted by the subsequent Finance Act &mdash; it would nonetheless appear that this legislation does not conform to the requirement of Article 15.2.1º that legislation must be enacted by Act of the Oireachtas.  A decision to raise taxes &mdash; even on a provisional basis &mdash; necessarily involves the &ldquo;cancelling, repeal or alteration&rdquo; of earlier financial legislation, and the 1927 Act thus appears to contemplate an unconstitutional delegation of power.  The Government's decision to take steps to curb such tax avoidance schemes is in itself unobjectionable.  However, the use of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 is the wrong way to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Unlike the 1957 Act which has been found unconstitutional and which is a post-Constitution Act, the 1927 Act is a pre-Constitution Act and there is no presumption of constitutionality about it. The onus is on the State to prove its constitutionality if and when it is challenged. I think they will have grave difficulty in the light of Mr. Justice Blayney's decision in the McDaid case on the 1957 Act.  Therefore, I would ask this House to consider at this stage whether it is largely wasting its time on this procedure. If the challenge takes place before the confirming Finance Act, there is a very strong likelihood, to put it mildly, of its being found unconstitutional.</P>

In this case we are following the time-honoured procedure and are having the taxes imposed by resolution of the Dáil <Col N="350" /> and subsequently confirmed in the Finance Act.  The advice of the Attorney General is that these resolutions are quite in order and will have the force of law. He considers that the constitutional reference to Financial Resolutions in article 17.1.2º re-enforces their legality.  That sub-article of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Save in so far as may be provided by specific enactment in each case, the legislation required to give effect to the Finance Resolutions of each year shall be enacted within that year.</P>
      <P>The practice of enacting the Financial Resolutions each year in the following Finance Act arises from that sub-article. Of all the procedures we engage in here, few of them have this very solid constitutional support.  The provision is that the resolutions must be enacted into legislation within four months.  We intend to do that but in the meantime there can be no doubt in any reasonable person's mind that these Financial Resolutions will be fully effective.  As I have said, they are in a completely different category from the sort of Government orders dealt with in the High Court judgment.  It seems they derive their strength directly from the Constitution.  As long as they are enacted into legislation within the year, certainly within the four months laid down, there can be no problem about them.</P>

      <P>The issue in relation to these orders is not the minutiae advanced by Deputy Dukes in raising the cause of the discriminative cider gallon nor the almost daily worry of the Progressive Democrats with regard to constitutionality. The question is whether we in this House give support to the budget as advanced by Fianna Fáil in the Minister's speech here today.  Deputy De Rossa has already signalled that we oppose fundamentally and on principle the thrust of this budget.  We intend, at the very first opportunity when a vote is allowed, under Resolutions 1 and 4 which are now tabled for discussion, to oppose as best we can the proposals of this budget.  Consequently, we will be calling <Col N="351" /> for a vote on these resolutions and will be opposing the Government.  We would ask all other Deputies in the House to consider doing likewise.  We have indicated that Fianna Fáil have shirked on the major issues that face the economy, that face any Government &mdash; the issues of unemployment, job creation, poverty and a fair tax system.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy McCartan but he knows full well that we are dealing now with specific matters in respect of Financial Resolution 1 to 4.  Members may elaborate at some great length when we come to deal with the Finance Bill and the date on the budget proper but this is not the opportune time to do so.  I must insist that the Deputy confine his remarks to the resolutions under discussion, Resolutions 1 to 4, which are very specific.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle.  We hold the view that the increases as represented here and conveniently converted into percentage representations of the impact on the consumer price index are insignificant but they represent a significant gesture as being an integral part of the overall strategy of Government budget and for that reason we cannot support them.  I would say to the other two parties in opposition who have contributed that it is not in any way honourable to approach a debate, even on something as incidental as the increases represented here, by raising issues about the discrimination of the cider gallon on the one hand or by what appears to be the Progressive Democrats' position whenever they are afraid to say they are supporting the Government in their budgetary process of cutbacks, raising problems of constitutionality, relying on that great coterie of legal academics that Deputy O'Malley has so ably lauded here tonight.  It is time for the Opposition in this House to take their proper positions and challenge on principle what is being advanced and not stand up half-heartedly, attempting to window-dress a position they are not prepared to <Col N="352" /> take.  The Workers' Party have indicated that they are prepared to take that position and will be attempting to translate it into a vote of protest against this budget.</P>

We are doing no more than bringing excise duty on these old reliables into line with the increase in the rate of inflation or the cost of living, whichever way you like to put it.  Whether the Deputy likes it or not they go to help finance increases in social welfare for the poorest and weakest sections of the community.  The Deputy is forcing himself into a silly, ridiculous corner by voting against them.  Does he think any decent man in a pub would object to paying one penny more for his pint of beer on the basis that it will go to help finance increases for social welfare recipients.  The Deputy is really just posturing in this matter.  If he wants to oppose the budget by all means oppose the general resolution but by opposing these minimal taxes which will have hardly any effect on spending by the general public and which will have minimal effect on the CPI the Deputy is marginalising his party.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Dukes proceeds I wish to say that we are dealing with these Financial Resolutions under the provisions of Standing Order <Col N="353" /> No. 41.  Accordingly, a Member other than the Minister or the Taoiseach who is in possession is entitled to speak once only on each resolution.  The Chair, however, on these occasions is prepared to allow a certain amount of informal intervention to enable Members to seek elucidation on each resolution.  I trust that any reference would be quite relevant but detailed discussion should be reserved for the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want most informally to seek some elucidation from the Taoiseach. I asked him what he expected would be the effects of each of these changes on consumption of the taxed items here.  If I may be permitted a brief intervention, I cannot really see why everybody including the Taoiseach is getting into such a terrible paddy about these matters, if Deputy McCartan will allow me to use that word.  It seems to me that with regard to at least two of these cases the increases are hardly worth the bother of imposing.  I do not accept the Taoiseach's idea that fair play demands that because he is putting 1p on the pint and 2p on the glass of spirits he should proceed the rest of the way and put another 4p on a bottle of wine and 25p on a gallon of cider.  That is a funny idea of fair play. What the Taoiseach is really saying is that he has allowed himself to be swayed by the argument that there must be an equality of misery.  You cannot equate these things because, although I know that the Taoiseach may not personally be well acquainted with this, drinking a pint of beer is very different in many ways from drinking a glass of wine, even for somebody like myself who occasionally likes to do each of these.  They are not drinks that compete directly with each other. Therefore it is not necessary, in the name of fair play or equality of treatment, to put up the tax on all simultaneously.</P>
      <P>As far as making a contribution to social welfare increases is concerned, the £10 million mentioned will more than cover the actual net increase in social welfare expenditure that the Government have proposed, compared with their Estimates of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> We saw a very interesting thing in the <i>Principle Features of the 1989 Budget</i> about social welfare.  You will find there that the Government say today that they are handing out £59 million in social welfare increases.  How are they funding that?  These increases are almost totally offset by £52 million worth of savings that the Government say they will make by comparison with the Estimates produced towards the end of last year.  The Government have today decided to make £7 million more available for social welfare than had been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes has asked me about alcohol consumption. There is a good deal of information that I could give him about that, but the net effect of it all is that these duties will provide the amounts of revenue which I gave at the start.  Let us look at beer consumption.  That grew by nearly 3 per cent in 1988 over 1987.  It is estimated that there will be a further growth of about 1½ per cent in 1989.  The budget increase of 1p on the pint should have a negligible effect on consumption.  Consumption of spirits grew by 6.6 per cent in 1988 over 1987 and a further growth of over 7 per cent is expected in 1989, after taking account of the budget increase of 2p on the glass.  The effect of the budget increase is put at less than 0.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Consumption of cigarettes has been steadily declining in recent years due in part to public concern about the health risk imposed by cigarette smoking and partly to relatively high taxation.  My own campaign as Minister for Health had, I am sure, an enormous impact on the situation when I introduced, for the first time in this country, statutory control and restrictions on the advertising of tobacco.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a pioneer in the world in my day.  It is anticipated that 1989 will show a fall of over 1 per cent. The effect on consumption of the 4p increase in today's budget is estimated at less than .5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Petrol consumption has been declining since 1982.  In 1988 consumption fell by 0.5 per cent.  The 1989 consumption will be similar to that of 1988.  The budget increase should have little or no effect on consumption as the price at the pumps is not expected to change &mdash; in fact it will <Col N="356" /> not change &mdash; nor will it have any effect on the CPI, I trust that that information will be sufficient for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>To deal with Deputy Duke's point about the different types of alcoholic beverages, my own feeling is that, by and large, wine is consumed by the better off classes in our society whereas the pint of beer is generally regarded as the working man's drink.  We would be subject to criticism if we increased the excise duty on beer and did not increase it on wine. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

The duty will provide £9 million to the Exchequer in 1989 and £10.4 million in a full year.  The effect on the CPI is 0.8 per cent.

      <P>I imagine that some of the Deputies who are leaving will now have a smoke.  I am not sure when the proposed increases come into effect, I imagine it is at midnight.  I note that the effect of this increase in duty is to produce £9 million for the Exchequer this year &mdash; not a large amount of money &mdash; and just over £10 million in a full year.  The Government have taken the course of having a number of different little ways of raising revenue and, in doing that, they have shown they are not inclined to go for any real reordering or reform of the tax system.</P>
      <P>How far will this increase bring the Irish excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco products away from the kind of targets that are involved in indirect tax harmonisation in the European Community? The other increases which we talked about on beer, spirits, wine, cider and perry and so on, while small enough in themselves, also bring us further away from the kind of target levels we are looking at for harmonisation in the European Community.  I hope you will allow me to refer occasionally to other excisable products because the point applies to them all.  As we go along with this type of activity we are getting further from the point at which will be aiming when we seriously start to harmonise indirect tax rates in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Taoiseach and the Government have a short-term interest in covering a gap in revenue during the course of this year but they are not looking at the longer term implications.  The references which the Minister for Finance <Col N="360" /> made in the course of his financial statement this afternoon to tax harmonisation in the Community were a good deal less than complete and did not give anything like a full picture of what is facing us.  He said &mdash; if I remember correctly &mdash; that there had been no negotiations or discussions about how the Community will go about this kind of tax harmonisation. That may well be true and, if so, there should be at least one voice, in addition to that of the Commission, that would seek to start these discussions.</P>

      <P>We will see.  The Minister said this afternoon that there were difficulties in the process of tax harmonisation and that is certainly the case but we will get there eventually.  We should not be making it more difficult for ourselves by going along with this kind of increase.  Sooner or later, the Commission will propose &mdash; and the Council of Ministers will agree &mdash; some form of a preliminary standstill agreement which will require member states not to get any further away from the harmonised position.  What moves are now being made in that connection?</P>
      <P>I can quite understand that a Commission which has been in office for only a couple of weeks will not have made any moves in this regard and will not even have developed its own doctrine as to how it will go about it, but we saw all through last year &mdash; and indeed since 1985 when the proposal was first made by the Commission &mdash; a fair deal of work by working parties and at various other official levels on the question of tax harmonisation. In the context of the increase now proposed, at what stage is that work in the Community?  What does the Taoiseach believe the course of the discussion will be and when can we expect decisions to take shape?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that same context, will the Taoiseach give a rough indication of the target level of excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco products if we were to implement <Col N="362" /> the kind of general proposals the Commission has made so far and how it compares with the excise duties we now have?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that the tax harmonisation changes in the Community will be of no significance.  As the Deputy knows, all we are doing here is keeping our excise duties in line with the rate of inflation and the effect, from the point of view of harmonisation, will be marginal.  There is an aspect to which I should like to draw the Deputy's attention, the EC Commission admitted that in framing its proposals, it had confined its objections to meeting purely fiscal considerations and that there is a case to be made because of general concern about the health consequences of smoking and drinking for &ldquo;aiming towards generally high rates of taxation on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products&rdquo;.  The Commission would seem to be a little ambivalent about the level at which harmonisation on drink and tobacco should take place.  In any event, what we are doing here will have a very marginal effect and will have a very marginal impact.  In so far as it could be looked at from the point of view of ultimate harmonisation, it is not really a significant factor.  I think that was the principal point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Resolution No. 5, there are few dutiable items which have such obvious potential for harm as tobacco products.  We spent some considerable time in the last session of this House debating the Tobacco Bill.  A raft of evidence was produced during the course of that debate from all sides of the House on how damaging the various manifestations of tobacco can be to the health of the individual and not only that but the cost factor for the public health system of the consumption of tobacco in all its various forms.  For these reasons the Labour Party consider that the increase proposed in this resolution is a modest one and, as the Taoiseach has indicated, it is barely in line with inflation.  We support the notion that there should be a reasonably high level <Col N="363" /> of duty on a product such as this, which is in the luxury bracket and which should be regarded as something that can pose a potential threat to the population and, therefore, should have a high duty.  The price factor is obviously a crucial one in determining the level of consumption. We will have no difficulty in allowing this level of duty to go unopposed.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the Labour Party oppose the entire thrust of the budget delivered to this House this evening, regarding it as grossly inadequate to address the grave problems of unemployment and poverty that beset this country.  We will reserve that opposition for the real issues and we will not try to frustrate the efforts of the Government to level duties on a few items, such as tobacco, which pose a threat to the population as a whole and, indeed, have a very serious cost factor for the public health service in treating the casualties of tobacco consumption.</P>

      <P>In relation to this particular resolution we have no objections. I am sure the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, will be pleased to know that as he became upset at our opposition to Resolution No. 1, when he asked whether there could ever be a budget which would be brought in by himself or his party which we would support.  The likelihood of the Fianna Fáil Party ever introducing a budget which we could support is very slight; I would not even put a figure on it.  Nevertheless, this resolution is one which we have no problem in supporting as we have, in fact, supported individual items which that Government have introduced in the past.  I am sure there will be occasional items in the future which he will introduce which we can support.  In relation to the general question of the budget, we simply do not support it and that is the reason we voted against the first resolution tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think 4p on the package of cigarettes was expected and it is only logical to have the consequentials on other tobacco products. I noticed in the returns for 1988 that there was an increase in excise duty on tobacco of £13 million.  That would suggest there is a buoyancy in the cigarette smoking business in excess of the buoyancy elsewhere in the economy.  With emigration levels of 30,000, 35,000 or 40,000 over the last three or four years, with that large number of young people gone out of the country, it seems that a significant extra number of people are smoking and they are smoking more.  It looks now as if the trend towards fewer people smoking less has stopped and that the graph of cigarette smoking has gone up again.  Our own observation would confirm that.  It seems that somking among young women is widespread.  If we are to talk about the connection between cigarette smoking and health, there are even greater health concerns when we think of the effect of cigarette smoking on young pregnant women.  The industry can take the 4 per cent imposition.  It is in line with inflation and I have no objection to this imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand if we match it against the very small increases given in <Col N="365" /> social welfare, it is interesting to do some sums on it.  The main increase given today was 3 per cent across all the rates even though the Minister seemed to emphasise a 12 per cent increase which is restricted to single persons who are long term unemployed.  For somebody on unemployment benefit of £45, the increase of 3 per cent on that is £1.35.  If that man or woman is smoking 20 cigarettes a day, 28p of the increase is gone immediately. If we were very righteous we could say the unemployed and those on social welfare should not smoke or drink, that it is bad for their health but what other comfort have they?  It is a fact of life that people with time on their hands smoke more than people who do not have as much time on their hands and they are certainly inclined to drink more.</P>
    <P>The pint is going up a penny.  Depending on what part of the country you are in, it is a penny on top of 8p or 9p as the trade got 2p, the manufacturers got 2p before Christmas and the vintners took 5p last week.  For the man on social welfare &mdash; and you could make a great argument that he should never have a pint &mdash; if he was to have ten pints in the week, and that would not be heavy drinking for anybody, you are talking about 80p or 90p.  Regarding the impositions on drink and tobacco alone, the social welfare benefits are gone.  I know social welfare benefits can be made to look very large because there are many poor in the country and when small benefits are accumulated it results in £70 million.  It can then be claimed that you are doing a lot for the poor.  What it really shows is that there are many poor people, that you are doing very little for all of them but it runs into huge numbers.  That is the only comment I have to make.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the excise increases and other increases in the budget and see the clawback elements, the clawback element on the income tax side to give the benefits, that child benefit will be means tested next year and that public servants will be paying full PRSI. These are swings and roundabouts.  I know somebody is getting upset because I am wandering from the point, so I am <Col N="366" /> going to sit down.  We are not opposing the 4p on the cigarettes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one point with regard to consumption.  The underlying reality is that whereas the amount of duty may be increasing, actual physical consumption is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is increasing among women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give the overall figure.  I want to take up the point made by the Deputy.  The fact that the amount of duty taken by the State is increasing does not mean that consumption is going up, in fact it is going down.  I must acknowledge that the rate of decrease in the physical consumption was smaller in 1988 than it has been for many years.  Over the years there has been a steady decline, since 1982, in the actual amount of tobacco consumed, but between 1987 and 1988 that fall was much less significant than it had been in previous years.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else, my friends tell me that young women are smoking much more these days.  If that is so, it is very regrettable because this is an areas where women are possibly more vulnerable than men.  It is a pity that in spite of all our efforts there should be any increase in consumption in any sector of the community. This is something we should all try to do something about.  On the other hand, simply increasing the cost of cigarettes does not always have a beneficial effect on consumption.  It just means people sacrifice something else in order to be able to smoke.  However, I do not think the 4p we are putting on here will have any great effect one way or another on consumption.  In any event I appreciate that the House is prepared to let this resolution go without any division.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> (1) That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975);</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1988&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1988 (No. 12 of 1988).</P>
    <P>(2)  That the duty of excise on mineral hydrocarbon light oil imposed by paragraph 11 (1) of the Order of 1975 shall, in lieu of the rate specified in section 56 (2) of the Act of 1988, be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 26th day of January, 1989, at the rate of £30.35 per hectolitre.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the rebate of duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil provided for in section 56 (3) of the Act of 1988 shall, as respects mineral hydrocarbon light oil on which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that duty at the rate specified in paragraph (2) of this Resolution has been paid, be calculated at the rate of £1.68 per hectolitre.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This is another resolution about which I would not expect there to be any great disputation.  This deals with hydrocarbons. In plain language it means we are putting on an excise duty which is equivalent to 5p per gallon of petrol. Because of the developments in the marketplace, this increase of 5p will be fully absorbed by the trade, so there will be no increase in the price of petrol to the consumer at the pumps.  In these circumstances, I presume the resolution will be passed unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this resolution is in a different position to the five that went before it, because there can be arguments made on health or social grounds in relation to the others that <Col N="368" /> cannot be made in relation to this.  This matter is of importance to industry, to business generally and to tourism particularly. We are in the unfortunate position in this country that our petrol prices are among the highest in Europe, if not the highest, and out duty on petrol is among the highest in Europe, if not the highest. This is a major detriment to our tourist trade because people coming here with their cars or hiring cars are horrified at the cost of petrol by comparison with what it costs in most other European countries.  Americans, in particular, find it unbelievable that petrol here costs about two and a half times what it costs in the United States.  That, allied to the high cost of car hire, is a major impediment to tourism.  For that reason it is a pity that this increase in taxation should be imposed now.</P>
      <P>The fact that a decrease in the price of petrol is due, and has been due for some time but has been delayed in being implemented by the Government so that they can get away with this increase here today, is a great pity.  The price of petrol at retail level by and large is about the same as it was two years ago, in spite of the fact that there has been a substantial decrease in the price of oil during that time.  There have been some ups and downs in between, but by and large crude oil is a good deal cheaper than it was and therefore petrol has to be a good deal cheaper.  The reduction in the price of oil is reflected at retail level in petrol in other countries, and it helps their tourist trade, manufacturing and their exports to the detriment of ours.</P>
      <P>This proposal I am afraid does nothing to help our competitiveness and is an unfortunate &mdash; and one might say in the circumstances an unnecessary &mdash; penalty. While arguments can be made for some of the other increases we have discussed tonight, I do not think any real argument can be made here other than the argument that if a certain level of duty had been set in the past, that it should be retained at that level in real terms at all times.  I do not think that argument is valid and that it should be retained in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The argument that has been made about the harmonisation of indirect taxes is certainly valid here because while we can suggest, and we should suggest, to the Commission that taxes on tobacco and alcohol might be harmonised upwards in the Community, more towards our level, clearly there is a duty on us to harmonise downwards our taxes on petrol.  If we do not do it we are simply creating more and more unemployment or preventing the creation of jobs that would otherwise take place.</P>
    <P>If everybody in Europe had this level of taxation, keeping it in line with inflation, that would be fair enough but they have not.  Many countries have very substantially lower duty than this.  The Taoiseach did not give the figure that this increase would raise, but I think he needs to justify it to a much greater extent than he has attempted to do because this is damaging to the whole commercial life of this country and, in particular, to the objective of increased employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would say that this is a regrettable measure proposed by the Taoiseach, and with the exception of Government Ministers, it will affect the rest of the population.</P>
      <P>It is a penal measure that will have dire consequences.  As Deputy O'Malley mentioned, our pricing of hydrocarbon products is totally out of line with the rest of Europe, with the exception of Italy which has high petrol charges.  The Government should have allowed petrol to go untouched.  Strong reasons have been given in relation to the last two products mentioned, but the Government have seriously erred in regard to the 5p on the gallon of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the chief complaints by people living in rural Ireland rather than in the urban areas is the cost of actually getting to work.  The PAYE sector have no redress on this cost and unlike professional people or the self-employed, they have no facility for writing off their travelling costs with regard to taxes.  The cost of travelling to work is a fact of life. In many cases in my constituency people travel upwards of 60 miles per day at <Col N="370" /> high petrol consumption.  In this country motor costs are very high, as has been highlighted by the motor industry for a number of years.  If the Government were trying to give some relief generally to the PAYE sector, what had been given in the earlier part of the Minister's speech was well taken away in the latter part of it. Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify what amount of money the Government expect to take in on this measure from tonight onwards.</P>
    <P>In a budget where absolutely no imposition was made on the corporate sector, on those with property or on the banking sector, we are again hitting at generally average consumers who already feel, and are entitled to feel, that they are paying way over the odds for petrol and petrol products.  This is a disincentive to people to travel to work.  With school transport being reduced on a daily basis there is another cost on families and, as has been mentioned in relation to tourism, with petrol still selling at just over $1 in the US, we are talking about two and a half or three times that price when we are purportedly attempting to gear this country for the American market in particular.  There has been a great deal of emphasis on the American market in recent years but whereas Americans will make a speculative visit the first time, in regard to the possibility of their return things like the cost of petrol are a major factor.  We should be setting out to reduce costs, particularly when the opportunity is there for reducing the cost of petrol.  I believe the Government have missed that opportunity today.  They do not seem to realise the imposition this 5p per gallon will be for many people.  It seems to be treated in a light-hearted manner today but I believe it will be a very severe imposition. This increase has not been well thought out.  It certainly is not warranted and we will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address myself to the increase of 5p per gallon on petrol.  This is a slap in the face to small business and the motor industry in the Border area.  We have a major problem. <Col N="371" /> As the Minister, Deputy Wilson, is aware, people cross to Northern Ireland to purchase petrol.  I am told that the price there stands at 70p per gallon cheaper than on this side of the Border so it is well worth people's while to go there for it.  Even with a small family car there is a saving on 10 gallons of £7.  With the stroke of a pen, the Minister should, instead of putting 5p on, have taken 5p off.  We are told the increase will be absorbed in a 5p decrease that is coming. Had that 5p off come on top of a 5p decrease we would be talking about 10p, down to a difference of 60p.  The Fianna Fáil Party promised at the last general election that when they got into Government they would deal with this major problem of cross-Border trade, particularly in regard to petrol.  Instead, we have had two annual increases.  Subject to correction, I believe that last year it was 10p per gallon.  That was a substantial increase.  On both occasions had they lived up to the promise they made of decreasing the price of petrol we would be talking about a 50p per gallon difference and the price in the North would not be so attractive.  I accept we will not get parity but we would have been coming very close and people would not travel the distances they are travelling now of 20 and 30 miles for petrol.  Unfortunately, when they cross the Border for petrol they do their other shopping in the North. If the petrol price attraction was not there people would not be travelling north, they would do their shopping at home and the whole economy of the Border region would benefit.  Small garage owners and other small business people are becoming fewer in number.  They have their backs to the wall and are looking for some gesture to give them hope but we are not helping them by putting 5p on the gallon of petrol.  That is heading in the wrong direction and we need to turn around immediately.  Any light those people may have seen at the end of the tunnel has been turned out today for them.  This is all the more regrettable at a time when we are talking about 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the tourist industry we <Col N="372" /> have the same problem.  English, French and German tourists staying this side of the border drive North of the Border to fill their cars with petrol and may or may not come back.  They may go into Fermanagh and do their holidaying there.  I have no objection to that.  I want to see cross-Border trade but I want to see fair trade.  The Government are not giving a fair chance to the smaller businessman and his family who are making a gallant fight to survive.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance today paid glowing tribute to the way the economy has picked up.  Surely we can afford to carry 5p per gallon as a gesture to an area that is devastated and suffering severely in a way no other part of the country has to suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am concerned about this increase.  I was Minister for Energy for only six weeks and I have not the experience of the former Ministers, Deputies Spring or O'Malley.  I am not fully conversant with the petroleum market.  When the Minister for Finance introduced this measure today he said he was increasing the excise on petrol by 5p per gallon but that there would be no increase at the pumps because the increased excise would be cancelled out by a reduction to be effected as a result of world movements in oil prices.  The word that there was a reduction of 4p or 5p a gallon has been around since 1 January and the word was around also that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had suggested to the oil companies that if they held on to their product until the budget it would suit everybody.  That is fair enough.  People become involved in this kind of game anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why that reduction came through around the first week in January. In my experience there are two reasons the price of petrol comes down, first, if the price of crude is low, secondly, if the <Col N="373" /> dollar is weak, because petrol purchases in this country are denominated in dollars. In early November last year OPEC were meeting in an effort to establish a floor price for petroleum and suggesting about $18 a barrel.  They has great difficulty and the talks collapsed on a number of occasions.  Oil was being sold three months forward at somewhere around $12 or $13 a barrel.  On the other side of the coin, that was the run-up to the American election.  The election was held on 4 November.  There was a great deal of unease and the dollar was weak. It seems to me that the combination of a weak dollar and difficulties in OPEC fixing a price, giving in to low crude prices, brought about a situation that three months down the line there was a possibility of reducing the price of petrol by 5p a gallon.</P>
    <P>The situation has changed.  OPEC made an agreement.  I do not know whether it will stick, but crude is around $17 or $18 barrel.  It has dropped a little now but it stuck at $18 a week ago, then shook around for a bit and dropped a dollar one night last week.  The other side is that the dollar has strengthened substantially.  I do not think the Minister can hold to his commitment that there will be no increase in price at the pumps. There will be no rise at the pumps tomorrow or next week, but when the prices are fixed again, probably around 1 April, three months down the line, there is a great danger, for the reasons I have outlined, that 2p or 3p extra will be put on the gallon of petrol in the first week in April or the first week in May.  The Taoiseach has a far better base than I have. I am speaking from limited experience about events of a long time ago.  The Taoiseach, who may have the brief from the Department of Energy in front of him, should give us the projection for petrol prices for the start of the next quarter.  Can he give us a commitment that there will be no increase in pump prices and that they will be maintained for the remainder of the year?</P>
    <P>Last week, for some unknown reason, auto diesel went up by 1.4p per litre.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That was a serious imposition.  I accept that the Minister has refrained from putting extra excise duty on that but an increase took place last week and it is an extra cost to the economy.  In my view, it confirms that there is a counter trend upward in petroleum products.  If one matches that scenario with our disadvantages as an economy, hanging out on the periphery of Europe, and the absolute necessity to get our transport costs not only into line with Europe but lower, last week's move seems to be very unwise.  I would have thought that the Government would have absorbed the price decrease and taken an excise increase in petrol.  I would have thought that they would have used that money to reduce the excise duty on auto diesel to at least cancel out the 6.5p imposed last week.  That would have made sense.  Will the Taoiseach accept that if he had absorbed the 5p as an excise increase in petrol and used the total take to reduce the price of auto diesel, it would have amounted to a reduction of 20p to 25p per gallon.  If that is the case, it would represent a significant reduction in cost factors in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, and the Minister, are fully conversant with the fact that our transport costs are so out of line that they will be one of the great drags on us as we try to achieve economic growth.  That drag will be worse after 1992 or whenever the Channel Tunnel goes into commission. Then we will be the only island EC country.  Whatever the efficacy of the ports and the competitiveness of access transport, if we are to be an export-led economy, the goods have to be taken to the port in the first instance and hauled by road.  The cost factors that have to be addressed are the excise duty on auto diesel and petrol; the excise duty on motor vehicles, particularly articulated trucks, and the roads infrastructure.  It is a combination of those three factors that result in it costing 40 per cent more to <Col N="375" /> shift a metric tonne here over an equivalent distance in the UK.  That amounts to a huge disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may have information which corrects my figures but what I have said is more or less the run of transport costs.  We are about 40 per cent on the wrong side of the line.  I am aware of how budgets are put together and that very often the give away side is arranged in advance of the take side.  If one has a programme in mind to give such an amount on social welfare, such an amount on income tax and such an amount on reducing the debt, it must be funded.  After that one goes around to see where the money can be found and the old reliables are always old reliables. In the heel of the hunt, Ministers may say, &ldquo;instead of putting on 2p, why do we not make it 5p&rdquo;.  Those of us who have been in Cabinet have been involved in such discussion but in this case the cost of transport is a serious disincentive and drag on the Irish economy.  For those reasons, we are facing a serious problem and it would have been better had the Minister clawed in the revenue on petrol but given it back in the form of relief on auto diesel.  I do not intend to oppose the resolution tonight but I would have liked to amend it along the lines I am suggesting. I do not have power to do that but it may be possible to amend this proposal in the debate on the Finance Bill. The Minister for Finance should give serious consideration to what I am saying, especially if, in the meantime, there is an increase at the pumps in the price of auto diesel and petrol.  If that occurs we should look for a change in the system so as to reduce the cost of transport.</P>
    <P>I take the points about the Border and I am sure all Members are aware of the difficulties experienced by retailers in that area.  People drive across the Border, fill their cars with petrol and return home. They will continue to do that especially if there is an increase at the pumps here.  I presume that international factors which caused the reduction of 5p per gallon here will also apply in Northern Ireland and that the price there will reduce by 5p at <Col N="376" /> about the same time that it stays static here.  Therefore, the relatives will have changed and there will be an incentive to go across the Border.  This is a serious issue although the amount of money involved is small.</P>
    <P>It is also serious when we look at the harmonisation of excise duties.  I take the Taoiseach's point and I agree that it will be very difficult to move in the politically sensitive areas, as they call them.  How can one get up and say, &ldquo;we are going to have cheaper cigarettes and cheaper drink but we are going to tax food, children's shoes and clothes&rdquo;?  Whatever they may say in Europe, that does not make sense to me.  If there is an out where, for health reasons, we do not have to bring down the price of tabacco or the price of drink by dramatic amounts, then so be it, but at least let us discuss them for the tourist industry.  The area of excise duty on petroleum products is absolutely essential to manufacturing industry, to businesses that are export-led and to all distributive trades.  We are not simply talking about the foreign multinationals sending container loads of computer parts to our ports.  Any person who is distributing to the small shop in rural Ireland knows what I am talking about. I am referring to the bakeries, the post office vans and so on who make the small deliveries to shops in out of the way places.  This has to be brought into line and I urge the Minister to have a second look at this between now and the Finance Bill to see if he can, within the constraints that everybody finds on themselves on occasions like this, adopt a more targeted approach in line with the ultimate objective of reducing the cost of transport, which I am sure all Members share.</P>

      <P>I would have a lot more sympathy with the arguments being put forward by different speakers from the Opposition benches if we were, by imposing this excise duty, increasing the cost of petrol to the motorist.  However, as all Members know, we are not.  All we are doing is leaving the position as it was. It is a bit starry-eyed to expect that the <Col N="377" /> Government in a tight budgetary position, trying to provide a social welfare packet of £70 million and to produce an income tax reduction package of more than £100 million, would not avail of an opportunity that presents itself to get £9.5 million for the Exchequer without increasing the cost of petrol to the consumer. In my view it is a reasonable proposal. We would all like to see the price of petrol coming down further, if that was possible, but I would point out that the price of petrol per gallon 30 January 1986 was 296.5p and that today, 25 January 1989, it is 267.8p, a considerable reduction.  It is not that petrol is something that has been steadily increasing in price, as it was at one time.  Petrol has already decreased considerably from what it was in January 1986 and, therefore, I do not think the argument being put forward against this move is all that valid.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan distorted the position in regard to the Border.  Taking the relative values of the point and sterling into account the situation with regard to petrol in the Border regions is that in January 1988 the difference in the price of a gallon of petrol in the south and in Northern Ireland was 68p and on 26 January 1989 that difference will be 55p. The difference is between 68p and 55p because there was an increase in the UK rates of excise on petrol.  The difference is not as substantial as the Deputy makes it out to be.</P>

      <P>That is not really at issue here because this budget is not making things worse.  In that instance in fact it is maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> Deputy Noonan, with tongue in cheek, asked if I could give a commitment that the price of petrol would not go up in 1989.  The Deputy knows very well I can give no such commitment.  However, if the price of petrol goes up in 1989 it will not be as a result of this budget.  What brought about the reduction of 5p in the price of petrol was the lower cost of the refined product during December and a weaker dollar.  Those two things may change and the price of petrol may go up in 1989.  It may also go down, but whatever happens it will be as a result of market forces and not as a result of this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution will help the budgetary arithmetic by £9.5 million this year and, at the same time, it will not bring about any disadvantage to anybody.  Admittedly we will not improve the situation for motorists but we are certainly not disimproving it.  It is fortunate from the budgetary position that we are able to make a contribution of £9.5 million on the credit side while, at the same time, not increasing costs to the consumer.  The <Col N="379" /> arguments put forward from the Opposition benches about this increase are not really sustainable.  It is a perfectly valid budgetary operation by the Minister for Finance to take advantage for the benefit of the Exchequer of this fall in the price of the product in the marketplace particularly when petrol in January 1989 is 30p lower than it was in January 1986. There are not many products about which one can say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder sometimes why we just cannot be straight and honest about these issues.  When the price of a product ought to be 5p a gallon less than it is and we are told that it all remains the same because we are clawing back the 5p, it makes no sense to the man in the street.  The price ought to be reduced but the Government are putting on this tax to retain the <i>status quo.</i> But it is not really the <i>status quo</i>, as the price ought to be 5p less than it is.  When the price increases later on, as it inevitably will, if the Government had not applied that tax, then at least we would be in a true situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the actual price of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of garages in the Border areas is absolutely pathetic and I wonder about this figure of £9.5 million that this increase is supposed to produce.  Does it take account of the revenue lost by so many motorists going over the Border to buy their product in the North of Ireland? <Col N="380" /> The effect is that instead of getting even a lower excise duty, we lose not just the 5p or the 10p but the entire excise duty which goes to the benefit of the North.  It does not make any sense and it is not feasible to have a substantial price differential in any product in the Border regions.  To try to control the price differential by the 48-hours rule or any other rules is like trying to hold back the tide. One may hold it for a while but the forces are so great that it cannot be controlled and the loss must be immense.</P>
    <P>If we adjusted our prices so that there was a parity in the price between here and the North of Ireland or if we adjusted our prices to make the cost less here than in the North of Ireland we might reverse the situation so that people would come from the North to the South to buy petrol and would thus contribute to our Exchequer.  It would make far more sense and could substantially improve our balance of payments.  At the moment we lose all the excise on ever single gallon bought in the North and not just the 5p and, having regard to the quanitities of petrol involved, we must lose a vast sum in excise duties.  I wonder has anybody ever worked it out?  How many of the economists who look at these things actually try to calculate that loss?  I distrust the calculation of £9.5 million, because I do not think it takes account of that element in the transaction.</P>

    <P>This resolution proposes to increase from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent the flat rate compensation for farmers together with a similar increase in the VAT rate on livestock.  The changes will take effect from 1 March next.  In his Budget Statement today the Minister for Finance explained the reason for this change.  Perhaps I could outline it again very briefly. As most Deputies will recall, the rate of refunded VAT for unregistered farmers was reduced by the Minister for Finance from 2.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent because, by and large, farmers were not paying their appropriate contributions in the form of levies of one kind or another.  To compensate the Exchequer for the fact that these payments were not being made by farmers the rate of refunded VAT was reduced.  During 1988 the farming community did pay up very substantially in so far as these particular duties and levies are concerned.  As a result the Minister for Finance decided that it would be reasonable and fair to somewhat restore, not totally, the rate of refunded VAT for farmers.  It is being increased from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent. At the same time there is a similar increase in the rate of VAT charged on livestock to unregistered farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At the outset I would like to say that a farmer, like any other trader, is entitled to claim a refund of VAT as a matter of law if he registers.  It would be a great imposition on small farmers if they had to register. This catch-all mechanism of a rebate to farmers, through the price of their produce, is one in principle we favour. <Col N="384" /> It would be undesirable from both an administrative and a farmer's point of view if all farmers were to be forced to register for VAT purposes.  Two budgets ago this rate of VAT rebate stood at 2.4 per cent.  When the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, reduced the rate of VAT rebate he tied the reduction directly in with the difficulties in collecting levies from farmers.  I do not purport to quote him but, to paraphrase him, he said at the time he made the reduction that it was in effect part of the stick and carrot approach to the payment of tax and levies and that this was the stick.  He said specifically that he was reducing it in the first tranche because farmers were behind in their payments of the youth employment and training levies.  More explicitly last year he tied it directly to the health levy.  He said that, because the take in levies from the farming community was so far in arrears <i>in toto,</i> he was deliberately going to bring it down, but he added a commitment that he would restore it if the arrears situation improved.  We had our own views on this and argued about it but as far as it went, it was a fair enough decision.</P>
      <P>During the amnesty the levies were paid, and they were beyond the expectations of the Department of Finance. This was a rough and ready scheme at the best of times because it penalised those who paid their levies as well as those who were in arrears.  Many farmers keep their affairs in order, pay their taxes and levies but they got hammered as well. Many of them registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Finance got independent advice on this from a well known agriculturalist and that he was of the view that the appropriate level of rebate should be 2.6 per cent or 2.7 per cent rather than 2 per cent.  I am disappointed that the Minister, despite the commitments given, has not restored the rate to what it was prior to the 1987 budget.  It should be at least 2.4 per cent and I should like the Minister to tell us why he did not set it at 2.4 per cent.  I think advice on this was available to the Minister, as there was to all of us, and I understood there was a certain level of agreement between the adviser and the <Col N="385" /> Minister's officials, that the appropriate rate should be 2.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I approve of this move because it is timely.  This is an effort to fulfill the commitment given by the Minister last year, and I believe it is right that that commitment should be fulfilled.  I wish I was in a position to amend this because if I were, I would put down an amendment to set this rate at 2.6 per cent.  In any event the rate should be at least 2.4 per cent, and I will be putting down an amendment to that effect to the Finance Bill and we can debate it that day.  I approve of the restoration of the rebate. I have a quarrel about the level and I should like to hear the Minister's explanation on this.  However, it is a move in the right direction and one which we can endorse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach two questions.  As Deputy Noonan correctly said, when this process of resorting to a reduction of the VAT rebate was originally proposed to this House, it was a temporary measure, designed to produce a temporary effect, was regretted in ways and would be restored if the situation improved.  What was meant by that statement to the House?  Was it really meant that the rebate would be restored to its full value, and does the Minister now propose this at the first stage of its restoration, or does he see this as the entirety of what the Government intend to do in relation to the restoration of the VAT rebate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I should like to raise is the amount of tax paid.  The Minister in his speech said that a large part of the increase in yield over the 1988 budget estimate of £42 million was the result of the clearance of arrears under the tax amnesty.  I should like the Taoiseach to indicate to the House what proportion we are talking about.  Forty two million pounds has gone up to about £80 million, an increase of £38 million.  How much of that represents amnesty payments and how much of it is unforeseen buoyancy? In that context I think it would be possible to judge whether the restitution of the VAT rebate is appropriate, under-estimated or overestimated.  To simply say that a large part of the increase in <Col N="386" /> yield over the 1988 budget consists of a clearance of arrears leaves this House somewhat in the dark.  Surely we are entitled to know what proportion of that £38 million amounted to arrears and what proportion of it was accounted for by buoyancy and taxation of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of those items The Workers' Party do not support. The Taoiseach indicated that the reason the levy is being increased to 2 per cent is because a deal was done last year to reduce it to 1.4 per cent to encourage farmers to pay their health contributions, etc.  Because the take was so good in the last year they are now increasing it to 2 per cent &mdash; previously it was 2.4 per cent. The point raised by Deputy McDowell is important.  To what extent did the reduction in the refundable VAT have an effect on the take of health contributions and PRSI, and what effect did the amnesty have?  It would be interesting to have that point teased out.</P>
      <P>A more fundamental point is, how can one set of traders or businessmen opt not to register and yet reclaim VAT while other traders must register if they have a turnover in excess of £12,000 per annum and if they do not register they have no right to reclaim VAT at any level.  If their turnover is less than £12,000 per annum, they can opt to register.</P>
      <P>The case which farmers generally have made that they want to be treated in the same way as other sectors of the community for income tax purposes should hold in relation to VAT.  I know there are serious divisions within the farming community as to whether it should be income tax based on accounts, land tax or whatever.  Nevertheless the strong argument made in the past has been that they should pay income tax on the basis of their income and be assesed in the same way as everybody else.  I do not see why farmers cannot be treated in the same way for VAT as other traders are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no possible justification for increasing the notional tax rebate which farmers can claim by a further £12 million. According to statistics I have, the VAT refund claimed by farmers in 1979 <Col N="387" /> was £6.8 million; in 1980 it was £21 million; in 1981, it was £22 million; in 1982, it was £40.2 million; in 1983 it was £55.4 million; in 1984 it was £59.7 million; in 1985 it was £63.8 million and in 1986 it was £79.4 million, almost £80 million.  If one compares those statistics with the actual income tax paid by the farming community generally in the past year, which I understand was in the region of £40 million to £42 million, one can see that as a community, whatever about individual farmers, the amount of income tax paid was refunded twice over by way of VAT refunds.  Here we are proposing to add an additional £12 million to this figure.  This does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Another strange anomaly, if one can call it that, is the fact that this is to come into effect on 1 March.  If one compares that with the fact that the social welfare increases which have been trumpeted here today do not come into effect until July and the proposed scheme for deserted husbands and widowers will not come into effect until October, there seems to be a difference of approach to different sectors of the community.  That is not to say that there are not deserted husbands and widowers among farmers. I am simply saying that it is the difference as between the way those who are dependent on social welfare and those who may benefit from the tax breaks in this budget are treated.  There is a serious anomaly here in the way different business people are treated, for example, farmers and other traders.  There seems to be a lot of money being refunded to farmers with no real justification presented here tonight. I would like to hear what the justification is.</P>
    <P>There are no figures, for instance, for the amount of VAT which is being paid by unregistered farmers, even on an estimated level.  There is no information as to whether it is farmers or co-operatives or other traders who are actually collecting this 2 per cent refund.  There are quite a lot of unknown factors in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach argued earlier in relation to the increase in excise on petrol that it would bring in £9.5 million and that it would be unjustifiable not to take <Col N="388" /> advantage of the drop in the cost of petrol to bring this sum of money in.  I can see no good grounds for handing over £12 million in these circumstances.  I argue that farmers should be obliged to register for VAT in the same way as other traders and, if they choose not to, they should take their losses in the same way as other traders who do not register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two points on this issue which I do not regard as being very satisfactory in a number of ways.  For a start, the phrase &ldquo;farming community&rdquo; has been used here by a number of speakers.  I can think of no more misleading term to use.  The fact is that one can break farmers down roughly into at least three major groupings, those who are below the profile threshold, if one likes, those in the higher levels moving close enough to intensive commercial farming, and in the middle there is probably a great range of farmers who are at once the most productive in relation to unit investment and in relation to yield per acre and so forth.  There is spatial location of these categories as well.  Let us look at the category of agricultural production in the 12 western counties where matters have changed from the time of Dr. John Scully's work which showed that something like 70 per cent of farms in the 12 western counties were under 50 acres, that 50 per cent were under 30 acres and were held in fragmented holdings and that there were problems in terms of physical structure, drainage, market access and the absence of volumes of scale and so forth. I had hoped, nearly 20 years ago, that through the work that had been unleashed in the Agricultural Institute and An Foras Talúntais and elsewhere we were moving towards some degree of specificity in relation to farm incomes. What has happaened unfortunately is that every effort we have made in relation to getting the kind of information that has been referred to by a number of Deputies, I think quite responsibly, every effort we have made to establish income levels for different categories of farm households, has been negated.  Thus we have people speaking about the gross transfers to and from <Col N="389" /> the farming community as if that had real meaning.  It has very little real meaning.</P>
      <P>I found myself, listening to the case for and against, asking where are the principles of equality of taxation taking root.  Are we comparing an equality principle between those registered for VAT within the agricultural sector and those unregistered?  Are we making comparisons on income levels?  We are obviously not doing the latter which is grossly unsatisfactory and sloppy, and this work, the basis for giving more precise figures, was done and is there.  If we are just asked to prove the point, if we look at the Minister's tables he is able to specify exactly what the effect of some of his taxation proposals are on single persons, on married people with two children and so forth.  We have people caught oppressively for direct taxation and for indirect taxation.  When one looks at that type of detailed information and then looks at the comments of the Minister about the flows to and from the agricultural sector, we find they lack specificity.  Thus the questions are legitimately raised, for example, as to what sections of the farming community we are talking about; how many farm households; within what range of acreage structures.  We need to know this not only for principles of tax equity but in terms of whether the VAT refund is a net contribution to productivity or a contribution into some kind of general pool which will be soaked up by way of benefits which might be in no ration to actual expenditure in relation to supporting an agricultural sector which is like a house of ghosts in that we refuse to specify in terms of who is in it, at what level of productivity and otherwise.</P>
      <P>For all these reasons I am very uneasy at the suggestions that are being made.  I also think this lack of specificity is evident &mdash; and I very much direct my remarks to the Minister for Finance &mdash; in terms of the thinking within the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike 90 per cent of the people in this House at present I am not a conservative. I was trained in the principles of taxation and one was always encouraged to have a degree of certainty.  I do not see where <Col N="390" /> this is present in this case.  Such phraseology, for example, as &ldquo;eroded a rebate&rdquo;, &ldquo;a stick and a carrot&rdquo; or &ldquo;something may have happened that may perhaps have led to a greater contribution from the farming community&rdquo; is all very fine but it is a very unusual language emanating from a Minister for Finance and is at quite a distance from many of the old principles of certainty in taxation, the business of knowing the administration costs and posing an item, looking for its return and being able to specify it and so forth.  In fact the only people about whom the exactitude of language is directed are what one might call the victims who are involved in direct work and are taxed directly at source.  Everyone is suffering as a result of this.  There may be very many people who are entitled to a VAT refund but who are unregistered; there may be others who are not.  We do not know the human composition of the people involved and we do not know its productive composition.  All of this is stemming from a mixture of witchcraft and notions that the land should never have tax directed against it, that there are categories of people who are not used to paying tax and one has to get them used to paying it gradually.  Then there is the other kind of course, and I like this kind of ruralist reductionism because there is a certain charm to it although I have not much time for it.  One thing that is absolutely certain is that there is a great number of people within this category, again, the farming community who are paying a fortune to accountants to avoid paying levels of taxation that they clearly owe to the State.  This is raising questions that are going to divide this country.  If people want equal citizenship it means taking an equal responsibility for taxation and the people who have expressed disquiet about what is proposed as a handback of maybe £12 million would like to know to whom and for what and with what consequences it is being handed back.  This riddle-me-ree of sticks and carrots is all very fine if one is talking to children of the age of 9 but it is not very useful rhetoric from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with <Col N="391" /> the point raised by Deputy McDowell because it is the simplest one.  The figures given by Deputy McDowell were for income tax and have nothing whatever to do with this resolution.  Unfortunately, he has left the House and therefore that little correction on my part is wasted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is quite right in that having a flat rate for farmers and not having them registered for VAT is very sensible indeed.  It is a system which is in operation in ten of the EC countries.  The position is that most farm outputs are mainly zero-rated and farmers would be in a refund position on VAT.  If all these farmers were registered there would be the whole administrative burden of their registration and of dealing with them in the context of the VAT system and at the same time the Exchequer would be getting nothing.  That would not be a very sensible way of proceeding.  The idea of a flat rate of VAT refund for farmers is eminently sensible and very much to the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I will retrace the history of VAT refund.  When VAT was introduced it was decided it would be much more sensible not to have farmers registered and to have a flat rate refund for them.  That rate was fixed at 2.4 per cent.  As I have said, that was an eminently sensible and fair arrangement.  As time went on, farmers were not paying their health contributions and levies.  Deputy Albert Reynolds's predecessor, Deputy Ray MacSharry, decided, not as has been suggested here as a threat or some form of compulsion but to protect the Exchequer, that as long as farmers were not paying their health contributions and levies he would reduce the refund of VAT to farmers as a sector of the economy. First, he reduced it to 1.7 per cent but there was no improvement in the position. In order to look after the interests of the Exchequer he then reduced it to 1.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the while we acknowledged that that was a blunt instrument approach.  It was really a negation of the principles of VAT.  VAT is a very fine taxation system and is very much based on the concept of refunds.  You pay out a certain amount of VAT, get in a certain amount and <Col N="392" /> either pay over the difference to the Revenue or the Revenue refund you the difference. That is the essence of the system. In not giving farmers their flat rate refund of 2.4 per cent, the Minister for Finance and the Government were acting in defiance, as it were, of the proper administration principles of the system. It was a reasonable thing to do as long as farmers persisted in not paying their health contributions and levies which they were obliged to pay.  Basically, it could not be defended on the basis of the principles of administration of VAT as a taxation system.  It was always understood &mdash; Deputy MacSharry said this several times &mdash; that this was done only to make up to the Exchequer the loss the Exchequer was suffering by virtue of the farmers not paying these amounts that were due and if and when farmers did meet their obligations the position would be restored.</P>
    <P>In 1988 farmers paid about £18 million in health contributions.  This has been calculated very roughly.  The figures cannot be exactly measured but by and large they are accurate enough.  Of the £18 million paid in health contributions and levies in 1988 by farmers, about £11 million related to arrears for previous years.  Farmers have made a very substantial amount of payments of their current health contributions and levies and of arrears but there is still a fair amount due.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance and the Government decided that the time had come that, as farmers had made major payments of both the current amounts due and the arrears, the promise made by Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance should be adhered to.  It was decided in this budget to move towards restoring the position but to move <i>para passu</i> as it were in so far as the farmers still owed a certain amount of their health contributions and levies and therefore the restoration should only be in part.  I think that is fair and reasonable and will be accepted by the farming community.  As they have gone a fair distance to meet their obligations to the Exchequer, the Minister for Finance is going a fair distance to meet their claims for a full refund of 2.4 per cent.  The Minister decided, <Col N="393" /> with Government agreement, to restore the refund to 2 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Noonan, that is not the end of the matter.  It is an ongoing process.  At present the Government and the Minister feel that 2 per cent is just about right having regard to the amount the farmers have paid.  The situation will be kept under review and any further necessary changes will be made.  That is the best information I can give the House about this matter.  The Minister for Finance was right originally in making this change even though it was in contradiction of the basic principles of VAT. The Minister for Finance and the Government are right in moving back towards the 2.4 per cent but not going all the way because there are still arrears from the farming community in respect of health contributions and levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some discussion on this matter last year and the previous year.  It is extraordinary to hear the Taoiseach giving us this very confused presentation of what is going on.  The Taoiseach is now admitting that the flat rate VAT refund system, for farmers is not being properly worked.  He has said he accepts that the rate he is now proposing is inadequate.  He has accepted that it should be even more than he is proposing now.  He talked about moving <i>pari passu</i> and increasing the refund rate to 2 per cent because he thinks that is the appropriate figure, bearing in mind that other taxes have not been fully collected. The Taoiseach agrees that if it were not for any other consideration this rate would be higher than it is now.  I am told the rate should now be about 2.6 per cent.  I would like to ask if the Taoiseach would propose this kind of system in any other sector.  I do not think he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if the Taoiseach had the impression that there were a lot of unpaid taxes in the manufacturing sector would be say: &ldquo;You will not get your full entitlement in reclaiming VAT.  Although you may be charging the appropriate rate of 10 per cent VAT to your customers on what you sell them, you will not be allowed to claim back the 10 per cent VAT that is included in the price of what <Col N="394" /> you buy from other people&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach is not suggesting that at all.  He knows, or should know, that that would be a major disruption and totally out of keeping with the VAT system.  He agrees that what is being done in relation to agriculture here is out of keeping with the fundamental principles of operation of that system.  I find it bad enough that this kind of messing about has gone on with regard to the flat rate refund, but to hear the Taoiseach admitting calmly that that is what is going on is a little disquieting, to say the least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make it right.  The Taoiseach has been making a bags of it for two years.  If it is the case that the Taoiseach or the Government feel that any particular group &mdash; the farmers in this case &mdash; are not paying some other taxes or charges properly, they should go out after them and collect properly those other charges or taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not try it at all.  In fact, the Government in 1988 only got back into a position where they are doing something proper about the collection of taxes on agriculture.  They did not, in any other sector, say that this or that tax had not all been paid so they would seize the nearest available tax that appeared to be working and distort that in order to make up the balance.  That is not what one does.  If a tax is not being properly collected, one looks at the collection of that tax and does not find some other tax to make up the balance.  If it is found, for example, that income tax from the self-employed is not being paid fully, one would not try to invent a special change in the duty on beer or petrol to recoup what was not being got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VAT system is supposed to be neutral in its effect upon any production sector but what the Government have been doing for the last couple of years with VAT in relation to agriculture is distortion.  There is no good reason for doing it and if the Government are <Col N="395" /> moving at all on the matter this year they should be putting the flat rate rebate back to whatever figure is dictated by the calculation that underlies this flat rate system.  That calculation is to look at all the VAT paid on the inputs of the sector and decide what proportion that is of the output of the sector and have a flat rate refund of that particular rate.</P>
    <P>It is on the record very clearly tonight that the Taoiseach agrees that that is a distortion of the VAT system so far as agriculture is concerned.  It is on the record tonight that the Taoiseach agrees that the rate he is proposing is inadequate. He should do the decent thing between now and the time when we reach the Finance Bill and put the rate up where it should be which, as far as I am advised, is 2.6 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal briefly with the matter.  Deputy Dukes is making a serious miscalculation with regard to this whole matter.  In so far as other sectors of the business community are concerned, if there were arrears of VAT they would be arrears in individual cases but the general body of business people concerned in whatever section it was would be paying in full.  In the case of the farmers, however, it was a composite decision by the farmers as a whole not to pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes was making an argument that this system adopted by Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance was inappropriate in the case of farmers because it would not, or did not, apply in the case of other sectors. I am making the point that something like this never arose in the case of other sectors.  If there were arrears in other sectors it was a case of an individual trader or business person not paying, whereas in the case of the farming community up to 1988 it was a decision by farmers as a body, as a community, as a sector, not to pay.  The health boards <Col N="396" /> and the Revenue Commissioners tried to collect them and it proved impossible.</P>
      <P>The situation changed in 1988 and farmers, again as a body of business people, self-employed persons, decided to pay up and they paid up substantially, as I said, £18 million.  As a result, the Government feel that the original mechanism employed to try to protect the interests of the Exchequer can now be modified to the extent proposed here.  It is ridiculous and absurd to be making an analogy between the situation as far as farmers are concerned and other sectors of the business community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this point briefly.  The Taoiseach is trying to make the point that there was some corporate decision to adopt a certain line of action. That is not the case.  There are many cases on record of people who were in the tax net whose accounts were all submitted, where whatever agency was charged with the collection of these charges could determine what the income and the liability was and the charges were paid.  What the Taoiseach is saying is totally unfounded and it does not take away for a moment the inappropriateness of using an instrument like this to make up for the inadequacy of collection in another area of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from what we have heard and what we know about this mechanism that it was a classic case of rough justice.  Rough justice is never justice and I do not think that the State should ever indulge in rough justice.  I concede that there is a dilemma which arises with the administrative and legal difficulties of collection all the outstanding levies and other payments that were due.  If the collection was to be made through the normal system, the legal and administrative burdens would <Col N="397" /> be simply huge.  I can see the pragmatic justification for rough justice, although I must qualify that statement by saying that mere considerations of pragmatism should not justify rough justice when it is the State dealing with its citizens.  The State should always endeavour to be even-handed.  However, I concede that that was the &mdash; principle is the wrong word &mdash; policy that was adopted and applied.  The Taoiseach does indicate to us that it was successful, if success is to be measured in terms of the return achieved.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has quoted a figure of £18 million as having been gathered into the Exchequer since this rough justice mechanism was applied but he has been singularly silent as to the amount of the arrears now outstanding and it is that unknown sum that is now offered as the justification for continuing rough justice, albeit in a less rough form.  I think we are entitled to know how much is outstanding now so that we can make a pragmatic estimate, a pragmatic judgement as to whether the rough justice still being pursued is being properly applied although, as I say, I have reservations about the principle.  These reservations become even more pointed because what is being done now is that the entire body of the farmers of Ireland are now being punished for the alleged default of what must now clearly be a minority and the considerations, the administrative and legal difficulties that might have prevented an orthodox collection of the arrears in the case of a huge number of farmers surely do not apply when we are now dealing only with a minority of farmers.  What the Government are now doing is punishing all the farmers for the continued default of a minority.  There is no way that can be defended.  The Government should look seriously at the position in which they have put themselves whereby they are being unjust to the majority of a sector of the community because a minority of that sector are still in default. There is no justification for that.  If a minority are still in default, they should be pursued through the normal mechanisms rather than this blackmailing punishing of the entire sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements made by the Taoiseach are extraordinary for the reasons already given.  He says there was no way the money could be collected for health contributions and levies.  He says everything was tried but I do not think this was the case.  They could have acted in the same way as Dublin Corporation with regard to those who did not pay water charges.  They were not given any grants, they were not allowed to transfer.  They were not given approval for maintenance or home improvement grants until they paid their water charges.  In that way they got the funds in, but this was not done in the case of farmers who did not pay their health contributions.  If they were told they would not receive headage payments or any other grants they would pay up fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says tht the cut in the amount of VAT refund is justified by the fact that farmers did not pay their helth contributions.  The very farmers who pay their health contributions might be the ones to be penalised by cutting the VAT refund.  If the VAT refund is a justified refund which is due to them, what the Taoiseach is doing would be totally out of order.  I am sure some farmers would have taken appropriate court action, as they are very quick to do.  When the Taoiseach says that Deputy MacSharry used this mechanism of cutting off a certain amount of the VAT refund to farmers in order to get in the health contributions, he was regarding this not as a justified payment but simply as a grant or hand-out which he could stop or increase at will.  That is exactly what happened.  I do not understand it and I would ask the Taoiseach to state how much VAT was paid into the Exchequer by unregistered farmers.  Surely there is a figure for the amount of VAT paid by unregistered farmers if it has been refunded.  If one takes the total amount of VAT paid by farmers and deducts the amount paid by registered farmers, one has the figure paid by unregistered farmers. It should not be difficult to find the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach explain the enormous jump in the amount of VAT refund to farmers in those years?  How <Col N="399" /> did it jump from £6.8 million in 1979 to £21 million, then double up to £40 million in 1982 and almost double again to £79.48 million in 1986?  What is the explanation for the enormous increase?  If these VAT refunds ranged between £6 million and £15 million people would not worry too much about it.  It would seem to be justified for the small number of unregistered farmers who pay very little VAT. When the figure jumps to the enormous amount of £80 million, questions must be asked.  What is this all about?</P>

When the smallest shopkeeper at the corner can register for VAT, I do not understand why all other traders and farmers cannot register.</P>

That is a failure rate of about 8.5 per cent. The Government should not continue to penalise the majority of farmers for the <Col N="402" /> few defaulters.  Every section of taxpayers has its percentage of defaulters. In relation to the health contributions and levies, there is no greater default among farmers than in relation to the payment of any tax by any sector of the community.

      <P>The comprehensive eradication strategy which I recently announced as part of the ERAD restructured TB scheme entails the adoption of special measures for blackspot areas like north Clare.

In addition the introduction of new supports to the eradication effort will undoubtedly strengthen the disease programme in north Clare.  These include a revised reactor grant structure, the institution of a national reactor collection service and revised procedures for checking of cattle identity documentation at meat plants.</P>
      <P>At present very substantial resources are being directed to tackle the disease problem in County Clare and this will continue as funding for ERAD at existing levels has been guaranteed by the Government for the four years of the ERAD programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of farmers in County Cavan have been refused headage payments on all their cattle because on reinspection in November and December 1987 it was found that calf-cows had been sold off; whether it is a good farm practice to sell off old cows before the winter months especially in suckler herds on small farms where fodder is generally scarce and of low quality; whether the witholding of these pay ments under the circumstances causes severe hardship for the families concerned; if he will have these payments payed immediately; if he will ensure that inspections and reinspections are carried out earlier in the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question relates to the EC suckler cow scheme. Under the scheme applicants are <Col N="53" /> required to give an undertaking to keep on their holdings for a period of six months from the dates of lodgment of their applications, numbers of suckler cows or replacement in-calf heifers not less than the numbers for which premiums are granted.</P>
      <P>Applicants who are found to have less cows or replacement in-calf heifers at a second inspection than they had at their first inspection and who have not notified the Department of the drop in numbers automatically lose entitlement to all premiums. Applicants who notify my Department of a drop in numbers must satisfy the Department that the drop is due to natural circumstances affecting the herd or to <i>force majeure</i> before any payment is made.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is an EC funded scheme and I have no discretion in relation to the relevant EC regulations.  The EC attitude to those who fail to maintain the required number of cows and fail to notify the Department of the reduction is that they are not entitled to any grants.  I regard it as good practice to sell off old cows before the winter especially in suckler herds on small farms where fodder may be scarce and of low quality.  It is not good practice, however, to give undertakings to keep such cows for six months and to use them for breeding calves when a person has no intention of doing so and stands to lose premiums on all cows if discovered.  I cannot arrange to have EC Regulations amended to cater for such practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 44, 47, 95 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>A proposal to reclassify all existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas to more severly handicapped status was made to the EC Commission on 4 February 1987.  No specific proposal was made to extend the boundaries of the existing disadvantaged areas. The Commission indicated that the proposed across the board change did not meet the requirement in the basic EC Directive that the level of compensatory allowances (headage payments) should be fixed in accordance with the degree of severity of the permanent natural handicaps. This ruled out the payment of uniform rates of headage grants throughout all our disadvantaged areas and so the proposal was not acceptable to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> In the light of the reply from the Commission, the Government approved a modification of the February 1987 proposal to provide for a restructuring of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in a manner that should meet the objections raised.  This new proposal which was lodged with the Commission on 4 November 1987 made a reasoned case for improved FEOGA financing and wider coverage of the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes including the question of extending the boundaries.  The new proposal sought an increase in the EC contribution from 50 per cent to 75 per cent which would enable the proposed revisions to the schemes to be financed without imposing any additional burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Commission's interim reply to this proposal was received on 9 February 1988 and raised a number of queries which were dealt with in a letter from my Department to the Commission on 25 March 1988.  A further interim reply received from the Commission on 18 May 1988 indicated that the main outstanding issue, i.e. our request for an increased EC contribution would have to be dealt with in the context of decisions on the Reform of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Discussions on those decisions are ongoing at present.  While we have invoked the February 1988 decision on the doubling of the Structural Funds between now and 1992 in support of our case for increased recoupment, this is only one issue amongst a great many in the EC debate on the Reform of the Structural Funds and we must await the final outcome to that debate before the extent and timing of any increased recoupment will be known.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have arranged that all areas submitted to my Department for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas for the first time or for reclassification will be surveyed.  This survey will commence next week and will, of course, be concluded as quickly as possible.  Following the conclusion of the survey the areas deemed eligible for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas or for reclassification <Col N="56" /> will be submitted to the EC Commission for approval.</P>
    <P>Over 100 staff from my Department will be involved in the survey and these will be deployed through the various counties in accordance with the amount of work involved in each case.</P>
    <P>The EC has set specific criteria for the classification of areas as handicapped and many submissions have been received by my Department from farmers in those unclassified areas to the effect that they meet those criteria.  To propose including all unclassified areas, regardless of whether they meet the EC criteria, would therefore increase the survey work to be done by my Department and would delay the submission of eligible areas to the EC Commission.  Including areas that clearly do not meet the EC criteria would also undermine the case for designation of the areas that do meet those criteria.</P>

      <P>As the three mushroom houses in this case were erected without prior written approval of the Farm Development Service, they are not eligible for grant aid.  However, as work on the ancillary services for the mushroom houses had not commenced an approval <Col N="57" /> was issued in respect of these investments. Until notification of the completion of this work is received, together with a signed declaration from the applicants accepting the partial payment of the grant, the claim cannot be further processed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has reviewed the scale of grants payable to farmers whose animals are slaughtered due to outbreaks of bovine disease in their herds; and if he will outline the current scale of payments and any proposed change in order that the extreme hardship which is currently being experienced by many families can be reduced, especially with lightweight cattle.</P>

      <P>I have adopted a recommendation from ERAD for a revised system of grants payable on reactors identified as and from 1 February 1989.</P>
      <P>The revised grant system covers: (a) substantial increases (up to £155) for lightweight animals, with marginal increases (£10) for cows and in-calf heifers; (b) increased supplement (£100) for full pedigree animals; (c) a movement away from the current flat rate of depopulation/stock replacement grant to a system of payment related to the type of animal, farm enterprise and duration of the rest period, as specified by ERAD, for the holding.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these increases will ensure that the livelihood of farmers threatened by disease outbreak is secure. Details of the current grants and the revised grant structure will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will outline the recommendations of the milk quota review group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided in April last that, as we were at the mid-term stage of the initial milk quota system, it was an opportune time to review the existing quota arrangements.  I therefore set up a small group, comprised of representatives of farming and co-operative organisations, as well as from Teagasc and my Department, to examine all aspects of the quota system and to report on the changes that might be made to improve national and Community arrangements.  It was chaired by an assistant secretary in my Department.</P>
      <P>The group which met on 16 occasions has completed its report which was presented to me last week.  Because I had kept in very close contact with the group's work, I have been able to make speedy decisions on these recommendations.  I announced earlier that I had accepted the group's recommendations for the temporary leasing scheme and for the flexi-milk arrangements for 1988-89.  These details were outlined in notices published by my Department during 1988.  I can now state that in so far as the group's other recommendations relate to areas within my competence, I have decided, with some small modifications to agree to all of the proposed changes.  Other proposals involving amendments to the Community regulations will of course require to be negotiated with the EC Commission and the other member states.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank all the members of the group for the efficiency of their work.  I also wish to thank the organisations involved; the Irish Farmers Association, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Macra na Feirme, Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Ltd, Irish Dairy Industries Association and Teagasc for their ready willingness to participate in this exercise which I regard as a very useful approach to policy review.</P>
      <P>I am now arranging for publication of the group's report and for copies to be made available for the Dáil Library.  In the meantime the following is a brief résumé of the main recommendations.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Main Recommendations by Quota Review Group</i>
      </P>
      <P>(i)  Original distribution of national quota to remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Any imbalance of opportunities between producers in the different areas of the country will be addressed by restricting access to quota that becomes available for restructuring, etc., to the priority categories, particularly for those suppliers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> (iii)  Any quota available in any co-op or dairy area beyond the needs of the priority category producers would be transferred to other areas through a national reserve.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Greater priority for smaller scale producers under the temporary leasing and flexi-milk rules and within that group to new entrants and to farmers who have been following development plans drawn up under the Farm Modernisation Scheme in the period 1981 to 1984.</P>
    <P>(v)  Elimination of the clawback on quotas involved in land sales and clawback on quotas under 50,000 gallons involved in land leases (the leasing threshold is at present 25,000 gallons).</P>
    <P>(vi)  Imposition of stiffer penalties in order to eliminate irregularities and abuses of the system.</P>
    <P>(vii)  The setting up of a quota appeals tribunal to deal with cases where the quota arrangements are causing genuine hardship.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Preparation of a study by Teagasc on the consequences for the dairy industry here of the proposed break in the link between land and quota in the context of the operation of the single internal market in the Community in 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 106 together.  I presume the Deputies are referring to the reserve set up by the clawback on quotas transferring where land is being sold or leased.  On the basis of the information furnished to my Department by milk purchasers, the reserve at the end of 1988 amounted to about 200,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>The Quota Review Group has recommended in its report some changes in the operation of the reserve which I have decided to implement.  The reserve will be allocated on a 50:50 basis to new entrants and producers with quotas of less than 10,000 gallons.  As demand will greatly exceed the quantities available in the reserve, a ballot procedure will be adopted to decide on the successful applicants. I have also accepted the review group's recommendation that any quota available in any co-op or dairy area, beyond the needs of the priority category producers, will be transferred to other areas through the national reserve.</P>

      <P>As Co-Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference, I have availed of every opportunity to impress on the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr. King, the priority which the Government attach to a sensitive and compassionate policy in respect of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences in Northern Ireland who were caught up in the violence of the seventies and some of whom were convicted for offences committed when they were at a very young age.</P>
      <P>On 25 July last, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced a special review for those indeterminate-sentence prisoners who have served more than eight years and who are being held at what is described as &ldquo;the Secretary of State's pleasure&rdquo; (SOSP's).  These are prisoners who were convicted for serious offences committed when they were under the age of 18.  As a result of that special review, the Judiciary is being consulted about the possibility of fixing provisional release dates for nine of the 17 cases reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> In addition, the special category compounds in the Maze Prison were closed last June and a special review is being held of the sentences of the remaining special category prisoners.</P>
    <P>A further positive development was the relatively large number of prisoners in Northern Ireland who were granted special parole last Christmas.  Those granted such special parole included 75 life sentence prisoners and nine prisoners being held at the Secretary of State's pleasure.</P>
    <P>These encouraging developments have been welcomed by the Government and by a wide range of opinion in Northern Ireland.  As Co-Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference, I will continue to encourage and support a sensitive and compassionate prisons policy in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, it is the Civil Service Commissioners who, under the regulations governing admissions and appointments to the Garda Síochána, are responsible for the conduct of competitions for the selection of Garda trainees.  I am informed by the commissioners that the position with regard to the current recruitment competition is as follows.</P>
      <P>11,706 persons applied for the competition and of these 9,855 were eligible on the basis of age and their stated educational qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Notes for Candidates, which were supplied to all applicants for the competition, explained that selection would be by means of written test, interview and medical examination.  The notes explained too that those placed highest in the written test would be called for competitive interview and that the number called for interview would be determined from time to time, having <Col N="76" /> regard to the number required for training over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The number of candidates who reached the qualifying standard in the written test was 5,090.  Interviews of those placed highest in this test have now commenced. Recruitment is to take place over a three-year period (300 in 1989, 300 in 1990 and 400 in 1991) and interviews are also scheduled to take place, on a phased basis, over the same period.  Those candidates who, on the basis of the written test, will be called for interview have been notified of that and of the year in which they will be called.  The numbers at present scheduled to be interviewed in each year are as follows:</P>
    <P>Number to be interviewed&mdash;1989, 1,116; 1990, 1,150; 1991, 1,641.  Total: 3,907.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that it is not possible, at this stage, to indicate precisely the total number of candidates who will finally be interviewed.  This will depend on such factors as the success rate at interview and medical examination of preceding candidates and the number of successful candidates who actually accept appointments.  It is for that reason that the Civil Service Commissioners have found it necessary to inform some candidates that they do not expect to be in a position to give them a clearer indication of their prospects until 1991.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been some criticism of the way in which the interview stage of the competition has been scheduled. However, it is now normal practice in many organisations, when faced with the problem of filling a limited number of vacancies from a very large number of applicants, to grade applicants on the basis of a qualifying test and to interview only as many of the most highly placed candidates as is necessary to select the required number of suitable people.  This is the procedure at present being followed in relation to the selection of Garda trainees&mdash;interview selection of suitable candidates is being conducted at a rate to match the yearly requirement of trainees for admittance to the Garda Training Centre.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to call the first selected <Col N="77" /> group of around 75 candidates for training in April next.  At that stage, the success and acceptance rates of candidates will have begun to emerge and the Civil Service Commissioners have informed me that they will then be prepared to review the intervening schedule to see whether it is desirable to proceed with the interviewing of candidates at dates earlier than those planned at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>No developments of the kind referred to in the latter question have taken place.</P>
      <P>The intention is to lease, rather than build, a premises to accommodate the proposed Garda substation for Leixlip and there are sufficient funds available for this purpose in the current year's provision. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the new substation will be manned from within existing Garda resources in the Ballyfermot Garda district.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice, in relation to the new recruits to be taken on in the Garda Síochána in 1989, if he will supply the following information: (1) the conditions of service that will apply in the initial training period (2) if the allowance being paid will be subject to PRSI deductions and (3) if the course of studies as recommended in the Walsh report will be put into effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of service applying to Garda trainees are set out fully in the leaflet entitled &ldquo;Competition for Selection of Garda Trainees, 1988 &mdash; Notes for Candidates and Conditions of Service&rdquo; which was issued to all intending applicants who inquired about the competition at Garda stations.  I have arranged for a copy to be sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is assumed that the allowance referred to in the question is the personal allowance of £50 per week provided for in the conditions of service.  In fact this allowance is being increased to £58 per week.  This amount will now include a £4 increase awarded in line with the provisions of the 1989 Agreement on Pay in the Public Service and a further £4 to <Col N="81" /> offset the PRSI deduction to which the allowance will be subject.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the course of studies recommended in the Walsh report will be put into effect and the programmes for the new course are currently being prepared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together. Under the Ireland/UK Memorandum of Understanding on air services between the two countries, fares filed by airlines of either country are considered approved unless they are disapproved by the aeronautical authorities of both countries. Either side may, however, unilaterally disapprove fares of its own airlines which <Col N="88" /> it considers to be either excessive or anti-competitive.</P>
      <P>Under EC Council Directive (87/601/EC), fares for scheduled air services between member states may be filed individually by carriers or following consultations with other air carriers, provided that participation in such consultations is voluntary and that the results are not binding on carriers.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that promotional air fares on all routes between the two countries have been reduced substantially in recent years.  For example, on the Dublin-London route, the lowest Apex (return) fare was £104 in summer 1985, while in summer 1988 the lowest Apex fare on the same route was £63.  This represents a reduction of almost 40 per cent.  Promotional fares to/from other UK points have been reduced by up to 22 per cent over the same period.  I am satisfied that these very significant reductions have been achieved as a result of the increased competition which I have actively encouraged, as well as the pressure which I have consistently applied for lower promotional fares as part of the Government's programme to develop tourism. In all the circumstances, therefore, I am satisfied that fares currently being applied on Ireland/UK routes conform with the requirements of EC law and that no cartel exists on those routes.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has recently filed proposals for revised air fares on Ireland/UK routes, the main feature of which is a proposed average increase of 3 per cent, with effect from 1 April 1989.  To date British Airways has not filed with my Department proposals for increased fares although I understand from media reports that the company has indicated that if the Aer Lingus proposals are accepted they will file matching fares which they would be entitled to do under the EC Council Directive to which I have already referred.  No decision has been made in relation to the filing.</P>

      <P>The development programme for the pigmeat sector, which I announced in July 1987, involves a total investment of £140 million in the rationalisation and modernisation of the industry by 1992.</P>
      <P>A number of major investments in slaughtering and processing facilities have already been carried out under the programme; other projects are in the course of construction while some others are at an advanced planning stage.  My Department has to date, approved of investment projects in pig slaughtering and processing facilities involving a total capital input of nearly £80 million.  The IDA has committed £15 million to these investments while EC FEOGA grant assistance of £39 million has been sought, of which about £15 million has been approved.</P>
      <P>Achievement of the targets set down in the development programme requires an annual pig output of three million head by 1992.  Farmers are being encouraged to increase pig numbers through incentive packages put together by the plants involved in the development programme. In this way the benefits of the State and FEOGA resources being channelled to the industry will assist farmers in meeting the necessary investments for additional pig places.</P>

      <P>Where a person has less than 260 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned had only 103 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurance.  She was paid disability benefit up to 10 December 1988, after which date her 52 week entitlement to benefit became exhausted.</P>
      <P>It was subsequently established that the person concerned had 260 contributions paid.  As a result, disability benefit was restored from 5 January 1989. Arrears of benefit payable for the period 10 December 1988 to 4 January 1989 are being held to offset against adult dependant and child dependant increases paid on her husband's unemployment benefit claim for this period.</P>

      <P>An oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned was held on 25 October 1988.  In the course of the hearing a medical report was submitted by the appellant to the appeals officer.  As a consequence a further medical referee examination was held on 20 December 1988 following which the medical referee expressed the opinion that the person concerned was capable of work.</P>
      <P>In the light of all the evidence the appeals officer subsequently decided that the person concerned was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts from 2 October 1987 and is not entitled to be paid disability benefit from that date.  The person concerned has been informed of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>Part time workers who are employed for less than 18 hours per week and who are not mainly dependent on their earnings from the employment are insurable at a modified rate which gives cover for occupational injuries benefits only.</P>
      <P>The fact that the criterion for full insurability is based on the number of hours worked in a week means that employers who employ workers for less than 18 hours are liable only for a reduced employers PRSI contribution. Employees in this situation are not covered for the benefits of the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the protection of the social insurance system is available on an appropriate basis to part time workers, subject to the need to ensure that entitlements to full weekly benefits are not obtained on the basis of minimal contributions.  It may be necessary in this connection to change the present criteria for insurability.  I am examining this whole area at present and I hope to bring forward proposals at an early date.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 136 and 137 together.  Following an appeals officer's decision, payment of disability benefit was restored to the person concerned from 24 November 1988.

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit to August 1987, when he was found capable by a medical referee.  He contacted his local office on 22 August 1987, with a view to claiming unemployment benefit.

As a result, his entitlement to unemployment benefit could not be determined.</P>

    <P>He was next in touch with the local office on 8 November 1988.

    <P>The Finance Accounts 1987 included certain changes made in calculating the national debt.  These changes arose from the elimination of circular transfers following the enactment of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the incorporation, as a credit in the national debt statement, of liquid assets which were previously included in the statement of capital assets in the Finance accounts. For the purpose of calculating the ratios in the above table the national debt figures for each year from 1982 onwards have been revised to take account of these changes; for the years prior to 1982 the national debt figures have not been revised in this way.</P>

      <P>The precise information sought by the Deputy is not available.  In the absence of uniform timing of the application of the first phase of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> increase in the commercial state company area, it is not possible to calculate the average rate of pay increase in the overall public sector during 1988.  However, in relation to the narrower public service, it is estimated, on the basis of the provisional Exchequer pay and pensions outturn for 1988, that public service pay increased at a rate of somewhat less than 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>As regards the private sector, the data available from the Central Statistics Office in respect of the first half of 1988, when taken in conjunction with the application of the pay agreement associated with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, indicates that the increase in average earnings in manufacturing was in the region of 4 per cent last year.  The rate of pay increase in the remainder of the private sector is estimated to have been broadly the same.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Minister is required, under Decision 74/120/EEC of 18 February 1974, to adopt an annual report on the economic situation in the Community and establish policy guidelines for each member state.  As required by this decision, the Annual Economic Report for 1988-89 has been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the report is on the need for rapid progress towards the completion of the internal market.  It concludes that the Community's economic growth prospects are reasonably favourable. However, it stresses the necessity for a greater reduction in inflation rates, as well as in external and budgetary imbalances between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its guidelines for Ireland, the report notes the improvement in economic conditions achieved in this country.  In particular, it refers to the exceptionally strong export growth, the improvement in competitiveness, the emergence of a surplus on the current external account, the substantial lowering of interest rates and the reduction in inflation.  It also notes that strong measures have been initiated to rein in public expenditure and reduce the Government budget deficit, as had been urged in previous reports. GDP is expected to have expanded by <Col N="116" /> nearly 3 per cent in 1988.  A continuation of these favourable trends is forecast for 1989.  Although the prospects for growth are brighter than for some years, the report considers that the process of budgetary adjustment must continue to take precedence in Ireland.  A continuing reduction in the underlying Exchequer borrowing requirement in terms of GDP is, therefore, seen as desirable.  This should be achieved mainly through cuts in public expenditure, but with greater emphasis on restraining current rather than capital expenditure.  It also states that the restructuring of taxation continues to be desirable and must be financed within the constraint of the necessary budgetary adjustment.</P>
    <P>The report sees the medium term challenge in Ireland as the need to restore further the conditions necessary to sustain a high rate of economic growth while maximising the employment potential of such growth.  It considers that, given the need to pursue a policy of fiscal consolidation for some time ahead, growth and employment in Ireland will rely even more than in most other member states on a supplyside response to a more favourable economic environment.  In this regard the report suggests that structural policies aimed at improving the efficient operation of markets continue to be appropriate, particularly in the context of the completion of the internal market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 155 together.  Details of receipts from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the years 1986, 1987 and 1988 are as follows: 1986, £77.1 million; 1987, £87.4 million; 1988, £129.9 million.</P>
      <P>Records are not maintained in a format which would allow the ERDF receipts to be broken down by county council and borough corporation for (i) the number of projects which received ERDF assistance; (ii) the location and nature of these projects; and (iii) the amount of money received from the ERDF in respect of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the following table shows (i) the value of ERDF commitments to Ireland and (ii) the number of projects on a county by county basis for the period 1986 to 1988 inclusive.  In this regard it should be noted that ERDF aid is granted in the form of a commitment which is translated into a cash receipt according as the project progresses.  The table does not take account of non-quota measures such as the Special Border Areas' Programme (Phases I and II).  The National Programme of Community Interest &mdash; Roads Development in Ireland 1986-1990, The STAR and VALOREN Programmes and certain Telecommunication projects are also not <Col N="121" /> included as they are Multi-Regional and cannot be broken down on a county by county basis.</P>

        <i>Industrial Credit Corporation</i>

      <P>This body is participating with the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála and SFADCo in the establishment of a new company, International Development Ireland Ltd. to carry out the existing and future international consultancy activities of all of those bodies and to provide an integrated service to foreign clients.</P>

    <P>The Institute works to a five-year programme of research approved by its council.  The institute has increasingly developed its research to take account of <Col N="123" /> developments in the EC and their effect on the Irish economy and to earn export receipts by undertaking appropriate studies within the research programme of the Commission.</P>
    <P>During 1988, 13 external research contracts were secured providing an income of approximately £159.000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Institute of Public Administration</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Institute's Corporate Plan includes overseas development and targets possible overseas consultancy work in Europe, Africa and Central America. This involves ongoing contacts with the World Bank, the UN, UNESCO and the EC.  The information services of CTT and DEVCO are also utilised.  The plan for 1989-90 provides for two assignments in Central America (funded by the EC and World Bank respectively), an assignment in UNESCO (funded by that organisation), two assignments in Africa (funded by the World Bank and EC respectively) and an assignment in Spain (EC funded).</P>
    <P>In the last two years the Institute obtained external contracts in Liberia, Zambia, Portugal and the Gambia to a value of approximately £755,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Life</i>
    </P>
    <P>This body operates as a commercial life assurance company and would therefore avail of any suitable opportunities it can identify and exploit in overseas markets. However, these are unlikely to include consultancy services and the question of a development plan is therefore not relevant.</P>
    <P>The development of overseas consultancy services is not an objective of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta or of the Central Bank.</P>

Much work has been done to date in setting up the necessary mechanisms to support and market the company's services overseas. The emphasis has been mainly on marketing training services and engineering expertise.  Where possible, TESI has linked up with other, longer established consultants and also with major international agencies such as the EC and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).  TESI has also won a number of contracts directly, e.g. training in Saudi Arabia, rural automisation in Uganda and a large contract in local plant construction and exchange maintenance in Britain.  Among the other countries which have made use of TESI's <Col N="131" /> services are: Kenya, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Kuwait, Oman, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Bulgaria and the USA.  The business is still young and at the development phase but turnover to date totals more than £6 million covering more than 100 successful projects-training jobs.  RTE has no formal development plan to develop overseas consultancy services.  Through international broadcasting contacts RTE engages from time to time in such consultancy projects.

      <P>I am aware that the proposed marina at Kilrush, County Clare, has received Regional Aid funding as part of an overall integrated scheme.

      <P>I am aware that the local authority concerned, Dún Laoghaire Corporation, are considering a road reservation on the lands in question.  On 25 November 1988 my Department informed the local authority that, without prejudice to any statutory procedures that may arise, it was convinced of the desirability of retaining a reservation through St. Helen's lands so as to facilitate a road link from Stillorgan Road to the proposed Merrion Gates by-pass in the medium to long-term.</P>
      <P>Before any such road link is undertaken there will be full public consultation. In this connection, I announced last June that an environmental impact assessment will be undertaken in respect of any proposed road through St. Helen's lands.  The Department will generally be supportive of any proposal which may entail additional expenditure designed to minimise the environmental impact of the proposal.  As regards the preservation of Booterstown Marshes, I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Finance to Question No. 101 of 2 November 1988.</P>

      <P>In so far as EC Directive 85/337 and Circular P.D. 111/8/20 are concerned, the position is that it is a matter for the local authority to assess whether or not this type of project should be subjected to an environmental impact assessment, in the light of its effect on the environment and having regard to such factors as the nature, size and location of the project. An environmental impact assessment is required where a project of this nature is likely to have a significant effect on the environment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the existing sewage treatment works, which is located near the Birr community school, is over-loaded and causing problems.  Contract documents for a new scheme, including <Col N="153" /> the provision of a new treatment works to be located a greater distance from the school, are under consideration in my Department.  Having regard to existing commitments and other high priority schemes competing for the limited capital funds available, it is not possible to anticipate when the scheme might be approved to go to tender and construction.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions in recent years I have drawn attention to the value of smoke detectors and I have advocated their installation in houses as a precaution against fire.  A number of publicity campaigns to highlight the advantages of having smoke detectors in houses have been run by the National Safety Council and the former Fire Prevention Council. The management and maintenance of their housing stocks are, of course, matters for the housing authorities and it would be open to them to arrange for the installation of smoke alarms in their dwellings if they should so decide.</P>

    <P>The foregoing figures relate to notifications of proposed redundancies received in my Department during the year, not to actual redundancies.  An examination recently carried out by my Department in respect of a three year period showed that approximately 7 per cent of notifications of proposed redundancies are not subsequently implemented.  On this basis, the number of actual redundancies qualified under the Redundancy Payment Acts during 1988 would be slightly over 21,400.</P>
    <P>I do not have any information in respect of non-notifiable redundancies i.e those who do not come within the scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 248 together.  I would like to assure the Deputies that this matter has been fully investigated by the Mid-Western Health Board in conjunction with the staff at the Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles. The patient in question was treated in the hospital itself on a number of occasions and had discharged himself against medical advice some 24 hours before his death. Medical opinion indicated that because of the seriousness of his illness he could have died at any time.</P>
      <P>I should state that the casual unit at the hospital was not a medical facility. The unit was inspected regularly by a night attendant during the night of Mr. Broderick's death.  Its purpose was to provide overnight accommodation for homeless men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's officials are satisfied that conditions in the casual unit at Thurles were not a factor in the patient's death. Nevertheless they felt that, in the light of this sad incident, it was necessary to carry out a full review of the arrangements for <Col N="161" /> homeless people in the area.  Accordingly, they have asked the Simon Community in Galway and local voluntary groups to forward proposals concerning the provision of appropriate alternative accommodation for the homeless in Thurles.</P>

      <P>To date in this country 77 cases of full AIDS and 34 deaths have been reported to my Department.  Dr. J.H. Walsh, National AIDS Co-ordinator, is in contact with the doctors clinically responsible for these cases and he is notified when a death occurs.  In addition scans of death certificates are carried out periodically to ensure that cases are not missed. I am satisfied, in the circumstances, that everything is being done to ensure full reporting of AIDS deaths and that the current reporting system is working effectively.</P>

      <P>I have been aware for some years that the mental handicap services are not fully developed in the country but since I came into office it has been, and will continue <Col N="165" /> to be, an integral part of my policy that services for groups such as the mentally handicapped will be supported and developed to the maximum extent possible within the financial constraints operating. This is evidenced by the fact that the financial provision for services for the mentally handicapped has been protected since 1987, despite the reduction which has taken place in the overall Health Vote, and by the developments which have taken place in the services since that date.</P>
      <P>I am, at the moment, in the process of arranging a meeting with the national association to discuss with them the findings in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Committee's Recommendations</i>
      </P>
      <P>1. The Government have accepted all the recommendations in the report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Defence Forces Pay, Allowances and Conditions with one small amendment &mdash; the date for the payment of the increase in military service allowance.  That increase will now be paid in two phases from 1 January 1989 and 1 July 1989 instead of in a single phase from 1 January 1989.  The increases in all other allowances are payable in full from 1 January 1989.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Overall increase of 19 per cent for Non-Commissioned Ranks</i>
      </P>
      <P>2.  Non-commissioned ranks as a whole are getting an increase of 19 per cent, made up of an increase of 12 per cent in basic pay and significant improvements in a range of allowances.  This is significantly greater than what they would have got under traditional pay relationships.  In addition, all the general pay increases provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Public Service Pay Agreement are being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="175" />
      <i>Overall increase for Officers</i>
    </P>
    <P>3.  Officers who have not benefited from recent special awards are getting an increase ranging from 10 per cent to 16 per cent when account is taken of the improvements in basic pay and in military service allowance.  These officers are also benefiting from the increases in security allowances and from the general increases referred to in the previous paragraph.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Payment of Basic Pay Increase</i>
    </P>
    <P>4.  It is not possible to pay the increases in basic pay in one phase without breaching the Public Service Pay Agreement and undermining the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> These increases will be paid on the same phased basis as for other public service groups, i.e. 40 per cent of the increases in basic pay with effect from 1 July 1989, subject to the terms of the Public Service pay Agreement.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Immediate Increases &mdash; Non-Commissioned Ranks</i>
    </P>
    <P>5.  The combined effect of the general increases and the increases in allowances will be to improve the average weekly pay of non-commissioned ranks by nearly 9 per cent from 1 January 1989.  Payment of the increases is being made today.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Cost</i>
    </P>
    <P>6.  The total cost of the full award will amount to £25.7 million a year.  The 1989 cost will be £12.5 million, against which certain savings from rationalisation will be offset.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Promotions</i>
    </P>
    <P>7.  Promotions will be made where the <Col N="176" /> Minister for Defence is satisfied after consultation with the Chief of Staff that the vacancies should be filled because of military and security considerations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Details of Revised Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>8.  Examples of the amounts of the increases are shown below together with details of the various revised rates of pay and allowances.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Other Matters</i>
    </P>
    <P>9.  The other matters which were recommended by the committee and approved by the Government are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Revised rates of retirement gratuities for NCOs and Privates; Increase from 21 to 25 week's pay at 21 years' service and to a maximum of 45 weeks' pay at 31 years' service.</P>
    <P>(b)  Revised rates payable on discharge by purchase: Top rate to be increased from £1,200 to £5,000 and other rates to be adjusted also.</P>
    <P>(c)  Review of the rate of deduction for rations: The current rate is £1.68 per day in respect of three meals.</P>
    <P>(d)  Future pay Reviews: Two former members of the Permanent Defence Force will be appointed, following consultation with the military authorities, to the inter-departmental committee established in June 1988 which will continue in existence.</P>
    <P>(e)  Rationalisation of the network of military barracks and posts throughout the country involving the immediate closure and disposal of military barracks, including Griffith and Collins Barracks, Dublin, and other properties which are surplus to security requirements.</P>

      <P>A special fund totalling £4 million was created in 1988 for the development of youth services to disadvantaged young people.

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the capital grants scheme for the provision of recreational facilities. The entire 1988 allocation of £4 million has been allocated to projects under the scheme.  The sum of £1,689,245 was disbursed to grantees by 31 December 1988. The balance of the £4 million will be expended according as construction projects are completed, in the case of each grantee, and the various requirements of the scheme are complied with in full.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="204" /> Nos. 282 and 283 together.  The detailed information sought by the Deputy needs to be compiled and the time available to my Department is not adequate for this purpose.  Accordingly I will write to him in due course with the information required.</P>
      <P>As regards the existence of need for new accommodation a written reply which I made to him on 15 November 1988 sets out the main criteria governing the provision of new buildings for existing or newly established post-primary schools.  The circumstances of all schools provided with new buildings have been in conformity with the main criteria set out in that reply.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to the development of overseas consultancy services in relation to the State-sponsored bodies under my aegis is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Bord Gais Éireann</i>
      </P>
      <P>BGE is at present reviewing proposals for a five year plan.  To date BGE has negotiated one contract which has an approximate value of £40,000.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Bord na Móna</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna has no authority under existing legislation to engage in consultancy work.  The Turf Development Bill, 1988, which is currently before the Dáil, includes provisions designed to enable the board to develop consultancy services, where appropriate.  Bord na Móna personnel, on secondment to the <Col N="205" /> Department of Foreign Affairs, have participated in overseas bog development projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Electricity Supply Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>The ESB is engaged in a major expansion of its overseas consultancy operations via its newly formed subsidiary ESB International Ltd.  Its aim is to provide employment for 500 people with an annual turnover of £50 million by 1992. To date ESB International Ltd. has secured a total of 86 contracts valued at approximately £10 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish National Petroleum Corporation</i>
    </P>
    <P>INPC's activities are centred on the operation of the Whitegate Refinery whose output is restricted to the quantities required under the Fuels Order, 1983.  However, their subsidiary company, Irish Refining Plc., has secured two overseas consultancy contracts to the value of £40,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Nuclear Energy Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the Nuclear Energy Board is still engaged in setting up monitoring programmes in Ireland there is little scope at present for developing overseas consultancy services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Coillte Teoranta</i>
    </P>
    <P>Coillte Teoranta, the State Forestry Company, has only been operational since 1 January this year and has not as yet developed any plans in this area.</P>
