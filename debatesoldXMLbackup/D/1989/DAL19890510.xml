      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the taxation treatment of motor cars.  I welcome the increase in the limit to £7,000, which is sensible, and I do not want anything I say to be taken as critical of an upward movement in that limit. However, I notice that it applies to cars provided after 25 January 1989 other than cars which were contracted for before that date but supplied within 12 months of that date.  If that is true in relation to capital allowances, is it really workable? It is putting it up to a lot of businessmen and companies to be very honest in their affairs since they can retrospectively say when they agreed or they can break one contract and substitute another.  They could say they wanted a blue Ford instead of a pink Ford, or whatever, and get around the Act.  Should that provision be left there?  It is a bit daft really and only <Col N="1713" /> the most lily white businessmen will not be tempted to get around it some way.</P>
      <P>The figure of £7,000 means that effectively a new car of whatever kind &mdash; except the most modest &mdash; will be allowable for running expenses and capital purposes only, at a modest guess 70 per cent, of its value of £10,000.  That is a very artificial basis on which to cut off tax relief in respect of motoring expenses.  I have some personal experience of this because I know what it is like to have been stuck with a £3,000 limit and the kind of things that occur in those circumstances, where people tend to buy big old &ldquo;bangers&rdquo;, which nobody else can afford, to get around the limits provided. I ask the Minister to indicate that although this is the second year in succession that that amount has been raised, it is his policy to continue raising that limit until such time as it gets to a reasonable limit.  In that context I ask the Minister to take a jaundiced view of the advice he receives in Merrion Street.  The reason I suggest that is that there seems to be a notion in the Department of Finance that a car is a luxury.  This stems from a thirties view of the world when a car was a luxury. Cars are treated for tax purposes in every way as if they were a slightly morally doubtful commodity.  The time has come to admit that in terms of their significance for the economy cars are no more damaging than, say, white goods in the form of fridges, freezers and washing machines.  In fact, they create far more employment than the white goods.  It is time they were taxed on a basis which reflects the reality of the motoring industry which is an employing industry.  Cars should not be taxed as some kind of luxury, which ought to be kept to a minimum as far as consumption is concerned, in the interests of the balance of trade and all the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to indicate that the benefit-in-kind provisions in relation to the taxation of cars will be reviewed.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry made their case very forcibly in years gone by and on this occasion have been less clamorous in relation to the Bill because they have seen progress <Col N="1714" /> on the £7,000 limit.  However, it seems to me that the historic basis for valuing cars for benefit-in-kind is wrong and it should be substituted by some kind of replacement value assessment or a system based on the capacity of the car.  I should like to ask the Minister to indicate ministerial thinking in relation to these issues because the motor industry is a potential employment growth area.  Our fiscal policies in relation to cars which singles them out as a luxury that must be oppressed by the tax system has singled out one of the most likely to yield employment areas of imported goods.  It is wrong in principle to maintain that policy of fiscal winter as far as the motor industry is concerned.</P>

      <P>This capital allowance was introduced in 1973 and lay dormant until 1976 when the first adjustment was made.  It lay dormant for ten years after that and in 1986 the allowance was increased.  I accept what the Deputy has said, that it is out of line in real terms when one looks at the cost of cars and so on.  The allowance was improved last year and improved again this year.  I had pre-budget meetings with representatives of the motor industry and they recognised that I have to move along pretty slowly, that I do not have all the money in the world to do all the things people ask me to do.  If one were to contemplate increasing it to £10,000 one would be talking about an additional figure of £13.4 million.  The taxation of cars for business purposes is complex involving a number of interlocking tax arrangements for things like the level of the capital allowances, the extent to which business motoring expenses are tax deductible and the way the benefit-in-kind can be used. Certainly, it was left too long without being updated.  We have moved on this in the last two years and we will certainly review it again for the 1990 budget. However, I am not prepared to go any further than that at this stage.  To my knowledge the motor industry accept the position I am in and are happy that I am progressing in the right direction.  The motor industry will have a very good year in 1989.  I should like to tell the Deputy <Col N="1715" /> that the provision has been framed in the normal way such provisions have been handled over the years.  We have not encountered any difficulties with them.  I take note of the points raised.</P>

Subsection (1) deals with the capital cost of purchase while subsection (2) deals with the running expenses. What would be the capital allowance if the 1973 based figure of £2,500 was fully indexed?

      <P>Section 11 amends section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, <Col N="1716" /> to provide that, where an initial allowance is made in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1989, in respect of machinery or plant, annual wear and tear allowance cannot be made in respect of that expenditure for the same chargeable period.</P>
      <P>Section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides for an initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of new machinery or plant, excluding road vehicles, for the proposes of a trade.  The allowance is given for the chargeable period, a year of assessment in the case of a person liable to income tax and an accounting period in the case of a company liable to corporation tax, in which the expenditure was incurred.</P>
      <P>Section 251 was amended last year to provide (a) for an allowance at the rate of 75 per cent in respect of expenditure on machinery or plant incurred in the year 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1989 and at a rate of 50 per cent in the period from 1 April 1989 to 31 March 1991, and (b) where the initial allowance was claimed a claim to accelerated wear and tear allowance was prohibited on the same machinery or plant.  This provision was necessary to prevent the balance of the expenditure from being relieved under the free depreciation provisions and thereby circumventing the aim of the reductions.  Free depreciation is given by increasing the annual wear and tear allowance under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to a level specified by the taxpayer, subject to the rates in (a) above, under the provisions of either section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967, undeveloped areas, or section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971, the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>However, it is still possible to escape the intended upper limitations on allowances by combining the initial allowance and annual wear and tear allowance, which varies from 10 to 25 per cent depending on equipment, in the one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section corrects the position therefore by rewriting subsection (7) of section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, <Col N="1717" /> which was enacted last year to provide for (b) above.  The new subsection (7) provides that, in relation to capital expenditure incurred on machinery or plant on or after 1 April 1989, where an initial allowance is made for a chargeable period in respect of the expenditure, (a) no annual wear and tear allowance may be made in respect of that expenditure for the same chargeable period and (b) any annual wear and tear allowance due in respect of the machinery or plant for any subsequent chargeable period may not be accelerated, i.e. free depreciation may not be claimed for that chargeable period.</P>

Following the enactment of last year's provisions, in which farmers were put on the same footing as other taxpayers, it has been suggested that the expenditure could be written off in two years by accelerating the annual farm buildings allowance to 50 per cent in each year.  This was never the intention.  The section, accordingly, provides that, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1989, only one measure of accelerated allowance, whether taken in one year or over a number of years, may be granted.  The balance of expenditure may be written off at the normal annual rate for farmers of 10 per cent on a straight line basis.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is the section where relief is increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent in respect of agreements entered into after 6 April 1987 for the construction of toll roads.  I should like the Minister to, first, put the case as to why a 100 per cent write-off should be provided for toll roads but effectively for nothing else.  I should also like him to expand somewhat and throw some light on how he sees the private sector providing matching funds for the funds which are expected from Europe and, which I understand, under the roads programme, will be sanctioned very shortly.  Does the Minister envisage that all the matching private funds will be provided by way of a tolling system or does he have some alternative view on how the private sector will put up matching funds for the construction of roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief for toll-road expenditure, which is in existence since 1981, has not been availed of to date. The only toll-road in operation in the State, the east-link bridge in Dublin, was financed without recourse to section 26. Following lengthy negotiations with Roadstone in the context of the planned Lucan Road-Navan Road toll-road project, the then Minister for Finance agreed in January 1985 that section 26 of the Finance Act, 1981, would be amended to extend the allowance to pre-trading interest and to allow capital expenditure on a toll road to be written off in full on the basis of a 50 per cent allowance in the year in which trading commenced and 10 per cent in each of the succeeding five <Col N="1720" /> years.  The promised extension of section 26 was conditional on full financing of the project by the development company without guarantee or other forms of comfort from any public authority including a local authority.</P>
      <P>The agreed amendments were to be made when the toll project went ahead. The assurances given by the Minister were repeated in April 1987.  An agreement under section 9 of the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, for the provision of the Lucan Road-Navan Road toll scheme was concluded between Dublin County Council and West-Link Toll Bridge Limited in October 1987.  The toll road, now known as the west-link project, is expected to be completed by mid-1990 and the amendments to section 26 are being put in place on foot of the assurances given.</P>
      <P>As West-Link Limited began to incur expenditure on the project in 1987, the amended section 26 is being made effective in respect of &ldquo;relevant agreements&rdquo;, that is, agreements for the provision of toll roads, entered into on or after 6 April 1987.  The cost of the increased relief in the future will depend on the extent to which use is made of it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general principle of toll roads our national road network is just as important for future development as any infrastructure of industrial buildings.  As in the case of a factory, hotel or other building for which an incentive is given there is a need for the private sector to become involved in road building as well.  The purpose of section 26 of the Finance Act was to encourage such involvement.  The section in its previous form was not successful in achieving that objective.  Drawing on the experience of negotiations in relation to an existing project the relief is being reconstructed to provide what is hoped will be a more effective incentive.  It should be borne in mind that the relief applies only to expenditure which has actually been incurred and for which there is no other tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention in relation to toll roads and the question of Structural Funds in future under the <i>National <Col N="1721" /> Development Plan</i> that every project will be assessed in Brussels on its own merits. There could be a situation where the return on investment would only meet the investment which has been made but in other situations there might well be a profit involved.  If Brussels is to aid a project in that situation they will look at and discount down whatever aid they give in relation to whatever profit has been made after allowing for a normal return on investment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to return to the second part of the question. It seems that the potential for tolling roads in this country is limited enough for reasons which we need not go into. Does the Minister intend putting the National Roads Authority on a statutory basis and giving them the right to toll?  It seems to be very difficult to enter into commitments now when the tolling agent is effectively the local authority and where in regard to a long stretch of road a number of local authorities could be involved, sometimes competing local authorities.  I remember that the intention was to toll the Naas by-pass but Kildare County Council subsequently refused to toll it, and they are the people who have the authority to toll.  This is a reserved function in local authorities so it is a question for the members rather than the management.  If the Minister agrees with the general view I have, that the opportunities for tolling are limited, could he, for the benefit of the House, indicate what other mechanism he sees which would enable the private sector to get involved profitably in the construction of roads and bridges other than by way of tolling?  If the Minister relies on tolling alone the figure he has included in the <i>National Development Plan</i> will not be put on the table.</P>

      <P>There is a private sector element involved as well.  When the national roads authority are set up on a statutory basis it is intended that they will be empowered to operate tolls on national roads and enter into agreements with private sector interest whereby these interests would be remunerated from tolls on roads in return for their financial contribution towards the construction of the roads.  I will not go into greater detail in this area or say what the national roads authority may or may not do, because they will be the statutory body charged with the responsibility.  I think the Deputy will agree that it is the appropriate way to do it.  We would never make any progress if we were to rely on individual local authorities to do the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I question whether the intent of this section will constitute a large incentive.  If the Minister really was interested in getting people to invest in toll roads why does he restrict the allowance to be set off only against income arising by virtue of the toll agreement in question?  In that context &mdash; unless I am wrong &mdash; I have this vision that people lay out a huge amount of capital to build a toll road and that there is no way in which, over any given taxable period, they avail of this 100 per cent write off against income because they will not get 50 per cent back in any given year.  What is the importance of increasing the 50 per cent to 100 per cent if it is restricted to the flow of income from the project in question?  I find myself slightly at a loss to understand why that would be of relevance. Had I spent £100 million on a road I cannot imagine why &mdash; if I am restricted in setting off my expenditure against income arising from that road project &mdash; how I could possibly get more than £50 million in any given accounting period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read through the explanatory memorandum I asked myself, what could that possibly mean?  Who is being inhibited by the restriction to 50 per cent? <Col N="1724" /> What likely toll road owner will get more than 50 per cent in any accounting period within which to write off the allowance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The toll roads incentive represents a significant improvement on the previous 50 per cent relief which, as Deputy Noonan has said, was not taken up.  There appears to be a mistaken impression around that the former relief could be offset against other income generally. That was not the case as income from toll projects only was subject to relief.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 15 allow relevant expenditure to be set off against income arising from an individual toll project.  The ring fencing of the relief is appropriate in the context of doubling its amount.  The amount of the relief is being doubled and it can be carried forward. Given that the income arising from toll projects will be considerable &mdash; for example the East-West Link bridge is expected to be heavily used when completed &mdash; the relevant expenditure will be absorbed over a reasonable number of years.  The relief can be carried forward and set off over a reasonable number of years.  Obviously, if it was not attractive it would not be taken up.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that people are inhibited at present from investing in tollroads but that they will be attracted by this increased allowance. Then he used the phrase that the ring <Col N="1725" /> fencing around this was appropriate in view of this increase.  It may have been a misunderstanding that other income could be involved.  Certainly it was a misunderstanding added to by the Explanatory Memorandum in this case which says:</P>
      <P>Section 15 amends section 26 of the Finance Act, 1981&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to provide that the allowance may be set off only against income arising by virtue of the agreement under which the expenditure is incurred, and ...</P>
      <P>If that is a misunderstanding it is one that is shared by somebody who writes explanatory memoranda.  If that is the case I wonder, in any given year at the beginning of a project, if the Minister really wants to attract capital into tollroads whether it would not be far more sensible to say to somebody who had income arising on some other front that he could apply or set off the relevant relief.  I do not believe that the difference between 50 per cent and 100 per cent will be crucial at all.  I predict that the most likely outcome of all of this is that it will not act as an incentive at all.  Neither do I think it will increase investment significantly. The Minister has his Western Parkway road, or whatever it is called; that investment is committed.  To the extent that that is delivering on a commitment given, I do not mind, but I do not think the Minister will get a penny more by effecting this change than he would have got otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <P>It is obvious that there is a significant difference between offsetting 50 per cent of the capital expenditure and offsetting 100 per cent, so I <Col N="1726" /> do not know what Deputy McDowell is worrying about.  100 per cent is 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>I take it that tollroads mean tollbridges as well, since in fact we have not any tollroads.  In the case of the only toll bridge we have, can the Minister say what has been the experience <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 50 per cent allowance?  I cannot remember for how long that toll bridge has been operational; it must be almost five years. In that case can the Minister say whether any tax is now being paid or will the implementation of the provisions of this Bill mean that 100 per cent of the capital expenditure will be allowable in the case of the East Link bridge as well?  In other words, will the provisions of this Bill be retrospective in the case of existing toll bridges?  Whereas originally they could offset 50 per cent of their capital expenditure they will now be able to offset 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Of course, we must remember that there is the one person only building toll bridges here, one being the East Link and the other the West Link bridge.  I have not been in a position to check this out on maps and so on, but I was told recently that the West Link bridge will be a twolane bridge with a fourlane highway entering it on each side.  If that is true, that appears to be extraordinary.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm that it is true. If it is true, it means that the person building the West Link bridge is cutting back on his expenditure on it, holding the traffic to ransom knowing that it will have to traverse the bridge, there being no alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the fact that now 100 per cent of the capital expenditure and maintenance costs of the bridge, or the road, as the case may be, is allowable for relief mean that throughout the tenure of the toll the person building it will never pay any tax? The Minister will be able to effect that calculation.  For example, I understand that, after 20 years, the East Link bridge will be handed back to Dublin Corporation. Does that mean that, within that 20-year period if there is now to be 100 per cent relief on capital expenditure, maintenance and capital costs &mdash; no tax <Col N="1727" /> will be paid by the toll holder over the entire period of his tenure?</P>
    <P>The other question I should like to ask the Minister is whether the toll bridge constructor avails of EC funding, other grants and so on?  Is he ensuring that only capital expenditure actually incurred by the toll bridge builder will be offset in this case as relief?  As Deputy McDowell said, without the aid of the Explanatory Memorandum we would not have a clue what this section was about.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the section in the Bill whether this is to be retrospective to previous toll bridge builders, whether the total capital expenditure or the actual amount spent by the builder of the bridge will be offset, whether the Minister has calculated, taking the capital expenditure and the total maintenance costs over the period into account &mdash; which he can also offset &mdash; if the passing of this legislation will mean that no toll bridge holder will have to pay any tax, or that every toll bridge holder will be allowed a tax free run to collect as much money as he wishes and will have sufficient offset to ensure that he will not have to pay any tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing Dublin east-link toll bridge was funded completely without recourse to section 26 of the Finance Act and this section has no relevance good, bad or indifferent to it. The promised extension of section 26 was conditional on full financing of the project for the Lucan west-link bridge.  I thought the Deputy would know more about this than I do because the agreement was drawn between Dublin County Council and the company.  There are certain matters in respect of which the Deputy is requesting information which I do not have except to say that the extension of section 26 was conditional on full financing of that project by the development company without guarantee, or other forms of comfort, from any other public authority, including the local authority. I hope the Deputy understands that this has nothing to do with the existing <Col N="1728" /> east-link bridge not being made retrospective in relation to that bridge or anything else.  In relation to what profits may or may not be made out of it, the relief is put in place to ensure that if they make profits they will pay tax and if they do not make profits they will not pay tax, like any other commercial concern.  Details of the arrangements between themselves and Dublin County Council are not available to me here at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (1), line 4, after &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, other than a payment made in respect of the cancellation, redemption or repurchase of a unit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments affect a number of technical changes to section 16 of the Bill. To create a proper environment within which UCITS could successfully trade both a revised regulatory regime and a revised taxation regime were necessary. The regulatory regime was contained in the UCITS regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 18 April 1989.  Strictly, the taxation provisions should have awaited the making of the regulations but it was considered undesirable that a section of the complexity of section 16 be introduced on Committee Stage.  Accordingly, while it was known that the regulations were to be made shortly, as the Finance Bill provisions were being drafted, the regulations were not in final form and some of the Finance Bill references were no more than holding provisions until the regulations were passed.  The purpose of the amendments now being moved is to bring the Finance Bill measures into line with those UCITS regulations as made and to maker certain other technical changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional words being added to the definition of &ldquo;relevant payment&rdquo; is to put beyond doubt that the withholding tax does not apply to payments made in respect of the cancellation, redemption or repurchase of a unit.  Such a payment <Col N="1730" /> would include or could consist only of a return on the investor's own capital and it is not and was never the intention that the withholding tax should apply to such payments.  The cancellation, redemption or repurchase would be dealt with as part of the investor's personal gains liability.</P>
    <P>The subsitution of the new definition of &ldquo;relevant regulations&rdquo; is to make specific reference to the new UCITS regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The previous definition was a temporary reference pending the making of the regulations.  The deletion of the definition of &ldquo;securities&rdquo; is caused by the fact that the UCITS regulations, as finally drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, did not contain the expected definition of securities.  The amendment of subsection (9) (a) is consequential on the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;relevant payment&rdquo;.  That definition is being amended to put beyond doubt that payments in respect of the cancellation, redemption or repurchase of units are excluded from the withholding tax.  The provisions of subsection (9) (a) specifying that certain payments are not to be treated as a distribution refers only to a relevant payment.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, due to the operation of section 84 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, a payment for the cancellation of a share in a company can be a distribution.  A unit can include shares in an investment company set up under the UCITS regulations.  Accordingly, it is necessary to extend the exclusion to cancellation, redemption and repurchase payments.  The deletion of subsection (10) is so that a substantive stand alone amendment of the VAT giving the same exemption can be included in Part III of the Bill.  An amendment to that effect will be moved at the appropriate time.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like some clarification from the Minister. This is an extraordinarily complex section.  One of the benefits of being in this House is that one's vocabulary expands all the time.  Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities are now being known as &ldquo;UCITS&rdquo;.  Can the Minister illustrate the difference between UCITS and a unit <Col N="1732" /> trust as I cannot grasp it.  We were provided with Statutory Instrument No. 78, introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which has 90 pages.  This section is to put a statutory base into the tax provisions in the instrument.  This is quite difficult.</P>
      <P>Is it the intention now that unit trusts will not be taxed globally, but that the tax liability will apply to the individual investors who make up the unit?  Will they then be liable for income tax and capital gains tax?  Will the liability fall on the investor or unit holder?</P>

      <P>I want to echo what Deputy Noonan has said.  An 84 page regulation was put on our desks recently. It was as long as most Acts of Parliament and as complex.  It was made under the European Communities Acts of 1972 and 1973.  It does things like creating indictable offences and setting penalties and these are done by Statutory Instrument. It is entirely wrong that those regulations should be made in those ways.  The European Communities Act of 1972 is infirm. Many people in this debate so far have <Col N="1736" /> been muttering about the Constitution and I have not, but one thing that I say about the Constitution is that the only things on which we are exempt from constitutional challenge on foot of our membership of the EC are necessitated obligations.  One of the things we did on foot of our EC membership was to introduce an Act saying that 84 pages of regulations creating indictable offences and other things could be made by regulation. That was not required by the Treaty.  It is not a necessitated obligation.</P>
      <P>The first time that anybody is prosecuted under one of those regulations, it will be immediately challenged and the whole procedure struck down.  It will be said that these penalties were selected by a Minister, not by the European Community; that they are not required by the regulation in question; that there is no authority for them except that the civil servants and the Minister at the time selected these penalties and procedures. I obtained from the Oireachtas Library the directive on which the regulations are based.  There is a close correspondence between them, but there are areas where a totally discretionary content is built into those regulations.  I regard it as extremely extraordinary that the equivalent of a very substantial Act of Parliament has been pushed through by way of regulation, without anybody being in a position to challenge it and query its contents. Here we are, by reference, giving it some kind of statutory blessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to accept that there is a huge infirmity about those regulations and the way they have been brought in and scrutinised. Nobody in this House has the slightest idea of what their content really is and they have never even been debated here.  It is amazing that something as long as that, 84 pages of solid law, can go through on the nod whereas we can spend an hour or maybe two hours on two or three lines of this Bill here.  It is an extraordinary contrast.  I worry about it because if the legal textbooks are to be believed, in particular Hogan's book on administrative law, there is the mother and father of a constitutional issue coming up the tracks at us on this because <Col N="1737" /> we are busily enacting things we are not entitled to do by these regulations.  I would like the Minister to compare and contrast for my benefit the difference between the unit trust taxation regime, which was very beneficial to unit trust holders with levies and all the rest of it &mdash; they can make quite substantial capital gains &mdash; and what the regime will be under this because it seems to me they are going to be in a much worse position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen that they will be in a worse position.  We will deal with the regulations first.  The regulations governing this are made under the EC Directive and are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the general practice in regard to the translation of EC law into domestic law, and the general practice has been followed in this situation with UCITS.</P>
      <P>On the development of UCITS, in order to facilitate the growth of the International Finances Services Centre and Shannon and to improve the competitiveness of Irish investment funds in the light of the easing of exchange controls, the basis of taxation of these collective investment undertakings has to be changed.  This section also gives effect to decisions already made in relation to the IFSC.  Essentially the new legislation recognises the trust nature of much of this type of investment and removes the tax bias against collective investment.  If matters were left as they were they would be in a tax disadvantage position.  The section puts in place the practice prevailing in most of the countries of the EC of not taxing the collective investment undertaking, but instead taxing it in the hands of the recipients by reference to their individual residence status and the status of the income received by them from the investment undertaking.  A foreign resident receiving income from an Irish based fund would have no Irish tax liability.  He would be dealt with in whatever country he was resident in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without tax similar to that applied to deposit interest, but with full tax credit and repayment where due, is applied to distributions made to Irish residents and <Col N="1738" /> to funds outside the IFSC and Shannon who do not distribute all of their income. Funds inside the IFSC and Shannon can also be liable to withholding on accumulated income only in relation to Irish investors.  Because Government gilts are free of capital gains they do not catch that withholding tax which the Deputy mentioned earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the distribution of those?  If you make a gain on Government securities in a fund and distribute that gain to the unit holders, whoever they are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no tax on the distribution of that because it does not attract tax at the start.  It does not attract capital gains, consquently when it is distributed it does not attract tax either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>They claim that by buying and selling unit trusts shrewdly they can, by paying the existing levy on capital gains in relation to unit trusts, make a very substantial tax free income or, let me put it this way, reduce tax income.  It seems to me that this provision here ends that completely, although it may be putting the Irish unit trusts on the same basis as continental ones.  Is the Irish taxpayer who uses these trusts to generate these reduced tax incomes being put at a disadvantage?  Are there people who now can make substantial low taxed incomes by paying the existing levy on unit trusts and taking that as their only tax liability who will be liable to a great deal more taxation when this is brought in?</P>

It seems when you move the liability from, say, the unit trust to the individual who has invested through the unit trust, the individual incurs the normal liabilities under income tax and capital gains tax.  On the face of it it looks as if he will end up worse off than he is now.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, whereas there is a full transfer on to the shoulders of the individual investor.  Secondly, I understand the interest income accruing on Government gilts is not subject to withholding tax.  If a certain proportion of a UCIT or a unit trust is invested in Government paper and the withholding tax applies, as the Minister said, not only to distributed income but to non-distributed income, I cannot see then how the investor in the unit trust will be free from withholding tax on <Col N="1740" /> Government paper.  Again that works to the disadvantage of the investor.  I am wondering if the Minister and his Department have gone to great pains to ensure that non residents will have no tax liability and in doing that have increased the tax liability on residents.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Perhaps the Minister would provide further information. The section provides for the disclosure of information by UCITS at the request of the Inspector of Taxes.  What is the intent of the section?  I presume it is an anti-evasion measure.  I wonder how practical are the expectations of the section in the light of the free movement of capital in and out as we approach 1992 and 1993.  One would not need to be particularly agile to invest in UCITS and source them through London, Amsterdam or Newry, thereby not being caught by the provisions of this section.  Is it only a bit of Christmas tree work for decorative purposes?</P>

      <P>We could not leave the Irish market uncompetitive.  We had to put it on a level footing with everybody else.  In Luxembourg it is zero rated.  If we do not change our own position we could find UCITS based in Luxembourg being sold here.  The market opens up for everybody.  It could be based here and sold abroad or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>Then we had to look at the possibilities of tax evasion.  Under the exchange control notice relating to portfolio investment in foreign securities all instructions with regard to transactions in foreign securities must be routed through an approved agent.  An approved agent is any bank in the State, any stockbroker licensed by the Irish Government, any solicitor of the courts of justice practising in the State and any other person appointed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  They have to make the declaration and that is one way of protecting the position in relation to Irish investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised on the Second Stage the question of ring fencing the tax rates in an open economy such as ours, especially since we will have free movement of capital.  It is a difficult problem because of the scope for tax evasion which it entails.  It is a problem which is recognised by the Government and by the European Community.  The Community are trying to stitch it down by introducing a Community-wide withholding tax.  In terms of the steps which the Irish Government can take to counter abuses, it is obvious that obligations can be imposed only on persons subject to Irish law.  This section imposes certain disclosure obligations on persons providing facilities in Ireland for Irish people to invest in foreign UCITS and on persons providing services in Ireland on behalf of foreign UCITS.  Combined with the exchange control regulations and the requirements of the UCITS directive, this appears to be the maximum extent to which legislative control can be imposed. Persons who for tax evasion purposes indulge in activities which bring themselves outside this area of control will do so with the risk of at least exposing <Col N="1743" /> themselves to severe tax penalties for making fraudulent tax returns.  Freedom from the withholding tax provisions given to undertakings in the International Financial Services Centre and at Shannon is on condition that they have non-resident investors only.  It is accordingly in the vital interests of such undertakings not to allow Irish investors to invest by whatever means in their own activities.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this appeal to self-interest will act as a much more effective means of encouraging these undertakings to police themselves rather than the granting of elaborate powers of disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners. While this is an area to be kept under constant review, particularly in the light of developments in the European Community, what is contained in the section is the most that can be achieved consistent with the need not to impede the free movement of capital and not to damage Ireland's competitive position in the UCITS market.  We have gone as far as we can go in making sure that our own fund managers are not at a disadvantage.</P>

Even with agreement on withholding tax at whatever level, the Community have to be extremely careful what arrangements are entered into in relation to the OECD countries on the fringe, places like Switzerland, Austria and the Channel Islands. We could reach an agreement in the member states but find that the capital had flowed before the agreement was in place.  It goes wider than the Community, into the EFTA and OECD countries.  If any bit of it falls out of place, I am not sure how effective it will be.  This is as far as we can go in taking precautions.  A Community-wide system is the only way to manage it effectively in the long term.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I come back to the idea of establishing a level playing pitch so that these activities would be as profitable here as anywhere else and would contribute to our economic development.  The Minister should consider as a matter of priority the introduction of a confidentiality of banking Act.  It is in this respect that we do not have a level playing pitch.  This is the major difficulty with section 17.  It will not work in the real world but it will <Col N="1745" /> upset many people because the Revenue Commissioners will have power to look behind transactions in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the 10 per cent withholding tax which has been removed in Germany by the new Minister for Finance.  The effect of that withholding tax at the kind of interest rates which prevail in Germany was probably about 0.6 or 0.7 of 1 per cent.  In the past 12 months £800 million or £900 million must have come here from Germany at a differential of about 2 per cent.  The withholding tax was removed not simply because of the 0.6 or 0.7 per cent return; it was removed because it took confidence out of investment in Germany because it enabled the authorities there to look behind transactions.  The cream-off of revenue was not the issue; it was looking behind the transactions.</P>
      <P>They are now getting on to a level playing pitch with Luxembourg.  Money was crossing to Luxembourg from Germany in enormous quantities.  It is not the issue of the 10 per cent being withheld; it is the issue of confidentiality. The operation of the withholding tax provided enough information which the Revenue Commissioners could look behind. I would advocate that the Minister seriously consider a confidentiality Act for banks and investment houses for these kinds of transactions or all the things we aspire to in the financial services centre and at Shannon and in the operation of UCITS right through the Dublin market outside of those areas will not come about.  That, added to free movement capital and the difficulties with withholding taxes will ensure that, whatever our aspirations, Dublin will not be a major player in financial services.  That is the missing piece at the moment.  In a totally non-political manner, I advocate very strongly that the Minister introduce that kind of Act.</P>

      <P>The German situation is different.  I take the Deputy's point, but the Revenue Commissioners do not have the right to go behind anything.  It is no more than a declaration such as one would make in relation to DIRT.  For foreign investment coming in, the situation is as intact as ever, and will remain so.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Most of that is in Government paper and it is sourced elsewhere anyway.  I am talking about situations where people, especially private individuals, have large sums of money they want to invest and they do not want people looking behind it but simply want to get a return.  With the increase in trade in Europe and in the world, especially over the last ten years, there has been an enormous growth in personal wealth right across Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The major activity in Luxembourg is in institutions handling the wealth of private individuals in a discreet and confidential manner and, frequently, through this mechanism of the UCITS.  They rushed through, in something like 16 hours, a Confidentiality of Banking Act about two weeks ago and went into special session to do it.  They did it very soon after the withholding tax in Germany was withdrawn. If we see big players like the Luxembourgers doing that almost as an emergency, if we are serious about Dublin as a financial services centre, we are very foolish not to look at the merits of what people are doing elsewhere because they have been very successful in this activity and we are only starting. We know how the people in Switzerland do things.  Absolute confidentiality is the key and we do not have that in Ireland.  If we do, it is more a question of custom, practice and precedent and not a matter of statute law backed up by penalties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is and has been in existence in Ireland, and is very closely guarded by the banking institutions themselves. I accept it is not in statute.  I will certainly take on board the points the Deputy raised in relation to it.  In my view, Luxembourg rushed such an Act through for a different reason.  The whole question of withholding tax was being raised in Europe and if the withholding tax as per the proposals that were on the table were to come into being, I am sure the Deputy would agree with me that the Luxembourg business would be in serious trouble because it formed such a major part of their whole economy.  They rushed it in because, when it came to the agreement, they could claim that their national position was enshrined in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point that I was not going to apply withholding tax to Government contracts and Government papers sold abroad.  I was looking for that exemption. They were looking at it from a different angle, and that is the situation.  I see no risk in relation to the confidentiality of the Irish banking system.  I have seen no <Col N="1748" /> developments in more recent times to change my view as to the level of confidentiality that the Irish banking system have held dearly and guarded very tightly.</P>
    <P>The question of confidentiality in regard to the financial services centre in Dublin does not arise.  We have an industry of its own in revenue trying to deal with every aspect of it, and we would not have the names we have if there was any doubt about issues of confidentiality as raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to echo what Deputy Noonan said.  I believe the emphasis in the International Financial Services Centre may be off target.  Financial services may not be the great bonanza some people close to this Government seem to think it is going to be.  By not attracting personal private banking to this country we are missing a golden opportunity to improve employment in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is worth while, as Deputy Noonan is pointing out, to emphasise that there is a growth in personal wealth as well as corporate wealth and that it is in personal banking that one finds the greatest employment potential.  Corporate banking is very like wholesaling, whereas personal banking is much more employment intensive.  If the Minister says there is such confidentiality, why not enshrine it in the laws and make it clear that that is the situation?  Why leave it to be a matter of contract between the customer and the institution?  If it is simply a matter of contract between the customer and the institution, the customer really has very little redress against an institution that breaches confidentiality.  He cannot come to an Irish court to complain of breach of confidence because they would want to know how he was damaged by it and he might have to say it was as a result of the consequences that flowed from being found out and the court would probably say that that is just too bad.  I do not think a court here would award damages to a foreigner claiming breach of confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money talks.  Influence works.  I agree with Deputy Noonan.  It is not sufficient <Col N="1749" /> to leave matters to an agreement between the bank and its customer.  We have to go further and lay down law requiring confidentiality on behalf of these institutions if we are to compete with Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, Switzerland and other places, for private banking.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to the point that I do not believe financial services of the kind now contemplated in the Customs House Docks area are sufficient.  There is a huge opportunity to take it one stage further. I do not think it is simply a question of hot money.  Money has varying temperatures, from tepid to hot, and if we want to compete with Luxembourg and other places in Europe on a financial basis, we have to take this step of confidentiality being part of the statute law of this country.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Noonan says.  I think the Government are foolish to take a holier than thou attitude on this because the full potential of the financial services and banking industry in Dublin is being undermined by the absence of such legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 16 contains no disclosure rules.  Foreign investment can be made in confidence in the Irish based UCITS.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite stunned by it all.  It is entirely above my head because, like Deputy McDowell, I do not have the money that I could consider investing in any of these schemes but, unlike him, I do not even have friends who would tell me about the prospects of them.  After that rather esoteric area that the Minister has been occupying himself with for the last hour or two, this amendment is in a sense somewhat more down to earth and is, I hope, of some significance. At this stage my concern is to put the proposal before the House and to invite the Minister to consider it.  If he sees merit in it I would be quite happy not to press the amendment but to see him return to it on Report Stage.  Even if he is not prepared to give that commitment I would propose to return with a redrafted amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present our tax code provides tax relief for those who are prepared to invest in various worth while activities.  There is, for example, support in the tax code for those who are prepared to invest in sport and also for those who are prepared to invest in the President's Awards scheme. In section 349 (1) of the Income Tax Act there is support for those who invest in our educational institutions and specifically for those who invest in the promotion of natural science.  This amendment seeks to provide a similar <Col N="1751" /> level of support and comparable relief for those who are prepared to encourage and invest in the teaching and training of modern continental languages.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the extent to which we should prepare for 1992 and what is required of us in the economic, service and educational areas.  We have boasted for many years that our educational system is one of our great strengths and traditionally it has been one of the main selling points employed by the Industrial Development Authority.  I am struck, as a spokesman on education, by how high the level of education is meant to be.  When listening to the debate a few moments ago I heard Deputy Noonan suggest that a 14 year old first year commerce student would have no difficulty making his way through the tangled web of section 17.  Recently I heard Deputy McDowell tell us that a first year law student would be able to drive a coach-and-four through a planning Bill.  Clearly this speaks highly for the quality of education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all accept &mdash; and I think it is the case &mdash; that the quality of our educational system in the past has been one of our great strengths.  We would all say that the fact that we are an English speaking country has been an advantage to us in seeking to advance our position in the international markets.  With the developments that will flow from 1992 and the creation of the single internal market, the fact that we are English speaking and monolingual may well become a very considerable disadvantage.  We keep talking about the fact that we will be part of the largest internal market in Europe but if we want to sell our goods there we would have to have an ability to speak the languages of those to whom we wish to sell.  I think it is fair to say that all parties in this House have recognised that in one way or other.</P>
    <P>The Minister's constituency colleague has made much of her commitment to the promotion of the teaching and training of modern continental languages although that public commitment is not always matched by the individual decisions <Col N="1752" /> taken, which sometimes have the effect of actually reducing the range of choices available within the school system, particularly the vocational education system.  My own party have produced a document on the subject, spelling out in detail what we think can happen within the formal education system and perhaps more significantly what can happen outside the formal education system and the more significantly what can happen outside the formal education system and the role we see for industry and business.  The Irish Council of the European Movement have published documents on this matter as have the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>
    <P>In a sense this amendment seeks to invite the House to make a public statement on the importance that it attaches to the promotion of the teaching and training of modern continental languages and to evidence that importance by giving this matter the same status as has been given to support for the natural sciences in the past and also to other areas including, in the very recent past, sport.  As I have indicated the amendment as drafted provides a basis for discussion.  I would be quite prepared to concede that the amendment would need to be polished and improved before it could find its way into the legislation.  At this stage there should be support for the principle of giving encouragement and relief to those who are prepared to invest in this important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to have a look at it but I would put on the record straight away that this would mean a further narrowing of the tax base.  While I do not disagree with much of what the Deputy has said in relation to the promotion of the teaching of continental languages, why should we always return to the tax base as a way to deal with these matters?  This would be a further erosion of the tax base.  The question of teaching continental languages is one that has to come into focus straight away but I am not so sure that everybody should look towards the tax base as a means of dealing with it.  The tax base has been eroded enough already.  I presume it is the covenant the Deputy is referring to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this section is to impose a limit on the continuing escalating costs to the Exchequer &mdash; estimated at £79.4 million in 1988 &mdash; of domestic source section 84 loans.  In particular heavy use was made of such loans by Shannon leasing companies.  A representative of one such company has been quoted as saying that his company had an insatiable appetite, at the Exchequer's expense, for tax-based borrowing.  Consideration was given to abolishing the device altogether but this was strongly objected to by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the IDA who were fearful of the adverse effect of such a move and the effects it might have on <Col N="1754" /> their efforts to increase manufacturing employment.  In the circumstances the section denies, subject to phasing out provisions, the facility to all non-manufacturing entities including Shannon-based leasing companies.  These companies will, however, continue to be able to avail of foreign source section 84 loans which do not involve an Exchequer cost. Representatives of some Shannon companies have already indicated that the change will not have any material effect on their businesses.</P>
      <P>Denial of further domestic source section 84 loans to Shannon Leasing will put them on the same footing as the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, companies in the Custom House Docks area with which we are all familiar. International financial services centre companies are precluded from obtaining domestic source section 84 loans.  The same regime applies to both.  In addition, the overall level of section 84 loans is being restricted to 110 per cent of current levels.  This will effectively put a cap on the cost to the Exchequer of the device in future years.  In effect, we have looked at it, left it in place for manufacturing companies both for domestic source and foreign source section 84 loans and we have put in a phasing-out period to 1991 for companies in the non-manufacturing area.  As they are phased out the section 84 loans available from the banks can be increased to the manufacturing areas.  We have also allowed the 10 per cent.  All in all it is a fair response to the problems. The costs to the Exchequer were escalating and it is the manufacturing area about which we are more concerned because that is where we get a real payoff to the Exchequer and not from some of the companies that were using the system very heavily.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister mentioned tax foregone of approximately £79 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In this section the Minister has moved in two ways to restrict the scope of section 84 loans.  First there is a restriction on the lending agency and then there are restrictions on the nature of the activity to which a section 84 loan will apply.  Regarding the restrictions on the lending agency, there is a new concept introduced here, of a section 84 lender.  At the risk of incurring the ire of Deputy McDowell I wonder how constitutional it is to differentiate between banks and finance houses, and nominate one as a section 84 lender from a particular date and say that people carrying similar licences cannot engage in the activity?  I presume all the commercial banks are involved in section 84 lending at the moment, so they will all become section 84 lenders when this Bill is enacted.  If we take this in tandem with the Central Bank Bill, other institutions will be given licences by the Central Bank to involve themselves in banking activities but they certainly are not section 84 lenders at the moment.  I wonder what advice the Minister has on the constitutionality or the legality of a provision which allows one group of institutions a particular benefit and prevents others from getting involved in the activity.</P>
      <P>My second query relates to the restrictions imposed on the lenders.  Why is the limit 110 per cent?  What sort of money are we talking about?  What expansion in lending is envisaged there?  I would like the Minister to expand further on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we move to the area in which the activity is restricted, I understand that the section 84 lender will be able to lend next year up to 110 per cent of his commitments this year for manufacturing activity in the country.  What is being <Col N="1756" /> excluded is non-manufacturing activity in Shannon.  The leasing engaged in by some of the major Shannon companies will not be financed through section 84 lending domestically.  That is the major restriction being applied to the activity.  Has the Minister any information on, for example, companies like GPA and Yeoman?  To what extent are they funded domestically now using section 84 loans, or are they almost exclusively funded internationally using section 84 loans?  I have had no consultations with Shannon-based companies, so I presume they accept the section.  If they had an objection I am sure I would have heard from them.  I have heard the Minister's assurance that some of the big companies in Shannon are happy with these new arrangements.  What level of consultation has the Minister or his officials had with Shannon-based companies?  Can the Minister give a categoric assurance that they do not feel under pressure to relocate as a result of the removal of the section 84 loan from non-manufacturing activity?  Perhaps the Minister has information as to what extent they are funded internationally rather than domestically and to what extent allowing them to continue with their present domestic arrangements until 1990 or 1991 will be of benefit to them?</P>
    <P>Section 84 has expanded to a degree and has introduced an element of tax foregone which it is difficult to justify in present circumstances.  We must continue to look at situations where we accommodate the corporate sector in too benign a fashion at the expense of income taxpayers and at situations where extra revenue can accrue to the Exchequer by tightening up a scheme such as this, in particular if the extra revenue is redistributed to income taxpayers, a general line of approach with which I agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The first comment on the proposed changes after the publication of the Bill came from GPA and they did not see any material effect on their business.  They have become so large in international financing that what they would require would not even be <Col N="1757" /> available.  Everything that is available in Ireland would not be any good to them. Their spokesman commented immediately that they did not see any problem, nor do we.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rationale of using 110 per cent, we do not want to inhibit in any way the growth of manufacturing industry.  The need for jobs is paramount. It was a question of judgment as to whether to leave it at 100 per cent or allow some expansion to take place.  In view of the upturn in investment in the manufacturing sector, we want to encourage it in every way we can.  In relation to the non-manufacturing areas, these areas are not of substantial benefit to the economy or to the taxpayer.  It is only right that we should turn away the cost which has been escalating in this area over the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>According to information from the Central Bank the total outstanding for both section 84 loans and preference share financing which accounts for only a small part of the total, as of mid-February in the last four years was as follows: February 1986 £785 million, 1987 £982 million, 1988 £971 million and in 1989 £1,285 million.  The increase between February 1986 and 1989 was 64 per cent, so one can see the escalation.  We do not have any information on the amount of foreign-sourced section 84 loans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not get it there either, as far as I know.  We have no information on the foreign-sourced section 84 loans.  Of the number of lending agencies, 16 of the banks are now section 84 lending, and this is a drop of three in the last 12 months.  They are going out of it rather than trying to get into it.  The total section 84 borrowing at present is £1,300 million.  In answer to other questions, it increased in February 1986; the cut off date of 12 April in the present instance frequently occurs in connection with the restriction of any tax reliefs and in some of these situations <Col N="1758" /> taxpayers availing of the relief at the cut off date may be allowed to continue to avail of the relief, and we are leaving it until 1991 for them to get out.</P>
      <P>On the question of advice, we do not see problems restricting the number of banking companies.  I hear the point the Deputy has raised, and I am sure Deputy McDowell might have a view on it too. They say there have been precedents and they are quite happy with the advice they have had on the cut off point.</P>

      <P>I see.  I was looking at the date of the order for printing, but, of course, that was at the Minister's request. The companies did not have any time to get their act together, but it makes you wonder whether it is a fair way to go about business that one institution can indulge in profitable activity, if it is profitable, on the basis that it did so last year to the extent of 110 per cent, whereas another institution, which for whatever reason decided to cut back, or thought perhaps it might be cut back by Government, finds it is at a disadvantage commercially <i>vis-à-vis</i> competing banks. I agree with deputy Noonan that it is invidious to select institutions on the basis that what they have done last year they can do again this year.  I do not see why lending in those circumstances should be capped in that way.</P>
      <P>I do not see the logic for allowing further expansion in the circumstances.  It restricts competition in section 84 lending. I cannot see the logic of that.  It flies in the face of competition policy.  It is probably very arbitrary.  I do not know whether it offends the equality provision in the Constitution but the problem with that is that the equality rights in the Constitution are confined to citizens and companies or banks cannot claim to be equally treated.</P>

      <P>The shareholders have a secondary right of equality.  However I agree it is problematical.  On the wider issue, I do not see the justification for retaining section 84 lending in its present shape or form, and I said that before. The officials in the Department of Finance and their Minister were correct in suggesting to Government that it should be curtailed or abolished.  When you get your nose out of the furrow at any given stage and survey the field around you, you see that our tax system is pro-capital <Col N="1760" /> and anti-employment.  The IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce may shout and roar about the importance of this measure to their efforts to secure manufacturing employment here, but there are others trying to provide service employment who languish under a tax system which is very cruel and harsh to would be employers who will not get IDA assistance.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant lumps in a tax reform package of any kind&mdash; whether it is the one I proposed or anybody else's &mdash; would be the abolition of section 84 lending.  The Government should have taken their courage in their hands and said that they would apply the proceeds from the abolition of section 84 lending to a reduction in income tax, or a reduction of employee PRSI, and they would effectively shift the balance in favour of employment and away from capital.</P>
      <P>I again want to go on record saying that I am against section 84 lending continuing as part of our tax code.  This is a rather timid compromise between two conflicting views.  It is a rather absurd compromise because in large measure it keeps it in existence.  It confines it in this way and that and tries to cap it with a flexible cap.  However, I think the time has come for the Minister to scrap section 84 lending and to tell the IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, that his best chances of securing employment in the long run are not by aids to capital but by making the taxation on work lower.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 33, before section 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20. &mdash;Chapter VI (as amended by section 45 of the Finance Act, 1984) of Part I of the Finance Act, 1980, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" />  (a)  by the substitution in section 38 for the definition of `relevant accounting period' of the following definition:</P>
    <P>` &ldquo;relevant accounting period&rdquo; means an accounting period or part of an accounting period of a company falling within the period from&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  where subsection (1CC) (inserted by section 45 of the Finance Act, 1984) of section 39 applies, the 13th day of April, 1984,</P>
    <P>(b)  where subsection (1CC) (as so inserted and amended by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1989) of section 39 applies, the 6th day of April, 1989, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in any other case, the 1st day of January, 1981,</P>
    <P>to the 31st day of December, 2000; ',</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the substitution in subsection (1CC) of section 39 of the following paragraph for paragraph (a):</P>
    <P>`(a)  In this subsection &ldquo;computer services&rdquo; means any or all of the following:</P>
    <P> (i)  data processing services,</P>
    <P>(ii)  software development services, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  technical or consultancy services which relate to either or both subparagraphs (i) and (ii),</P>
    <P>the work on the rendering of which is carried out in the State in the course of a service undertaking in respect of which an employment grant was made by the Industrial Development Authority under section 25 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to substitute a new section 20 for the existing section 20 in the Bill to provide a current commencement date for that section.  Section 20 extends the definition of &ldquo;computer <Col N="1762" /> services&rdquo; (in section 39 (1CC) of the Finance Act, 1980) for the purposes of the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme to include technical or consultancy services related to data processing or software development.</P>
    <P>The section as drafted would come into effect on 6 April 1989 under the commencement provisions in section 87 of the Bill.  However, there is already in section 38 of the Finance Act, 1980, a specific commencement date of 13 April 1984 for the application of the 10 per cent scheme to &ldquo;computer services&rdquo;.  The 10 per cent scheme was extended to computer services by the Finance Act, 1984. The effect of section 20, as drafted, therefore, would be that while relevant technical or consultancy services would be recognised for the 10 per cent scheme from 6 April 1989, claims for relief in respect of these activities could be backdated to 13 April 1984.</P>
    <P>The new section 20 provided for in the amendment removes this unintended effect and ensures that relevant technical or consultancy services will qualify as computer services from 6 April 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the principle of the section and the amendment, we have the manufacturing rate of tax being extended to a service area of the economy. Whereas, I welcome the lower tax I wonder whether the selective reduction of a tax rate from 40 per cent to 10 per cent by political decision is the right way of going about it.  I ask the more fundamental question: is it right that we <Col N="1763" /> should move bits and pieces of the services sector from one category of high taxation to another category of low taxation in the way provided here?</P>
      <P>I am also wondering about the relevance of tying it down to IDA-backed projects.  Why has that provision been inserted?  The amendment reads as follows: &ldquo;.... the work on the rendering of which is carried out in the State in the course of a service undertaking in respect of which an employment grant was made by the Industrial Development Authority under section 25 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986&rdquo;.  Why is it being curtailed in that way and what is the justification for a curtailment?  I note that the meaning of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; is being extended to include computer software development services.  That is fine but to announce that it is to be transferred from one category of taxation to another and to include this provision that it has to be IDA financed makes me wonder what function we would be giving the IDA.  In effect we would be giving them a taxation function.  It seems that they would be able to decide whether someone is to get a lower rate of tax.  I question the wisdom of doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the extension is that data processing services and software development services and consultancy services which relate to either are recent developments in a high risk area.  It is difficult enough to get people to invest in software services and because of this in an effort to promote software development services which are labour intensive this has been included as an incentive.  They have much to recommend them.  We are now turning out graduates suitable for this work and in an effort to promote these services in a high risk area this provision has been included. That is the way I see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister elaborate on the provision in relation to the IDA?  I do not accept that the way to <Col N="1764" /> decide that something is export orientated is on the basis that the IDA have grant aided the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of defining the qualification.  If some tightness is not put on it various other services could be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I object to is that here we have a tax system and we are saying that certain forms of services would be liable to a lower tax rate, a preferential tax rate for a particular purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the way we say to categorise them is to determine which of them have been grant aided by the IDA and those which have not.  Is this wasteful?  Are there people who might develop these services and look for the 10 per cent rate of tax but who for some reason might not satisfy IDA criteria? For instance, their capital structure might be totally inadequate or they might have an off the wall idea which the IDA advisers consider foolish.  To make it as a precondition that the IDA must have helped someone out is a very roundabout way of saying, what the Minister is now saying is the real reason, that it should be export orientated.  That is okay by me but I cannot see for the life of me why we have to say that one would not pay at the 10 per cent rate unless they had received IDA backing.  Effectively this would allow the IDA to say how much of what this House has decided to be available by way of corporate relief should be given, to whom and when.  I think that is wrong in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The wording of these sections makes me feel uneasy.  Similar sections have been included in every Finance Bill published during the past eight to ten years.  I am glad the Minister has come back with a <Col N="1765" /> new section which reduces the possibility that this would be applied retrospectively. We are all aware that year after year some new lobby group, usually supported by SFADCo or the IDA, go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance to make the case for including some area of activity within the 10 per cent corporation tax regime.  Each year concessions are made. While none of these little steps are objectionable in themselves they have the overall effect of diminishing the corporation tax base quite significantly and of accentuating the problem to which Deputy McDowell has constantly drawn attention, that we are making the regime for capital and fixed assets more benign in each Finance Bill while at the same time not making the income tax regime significantly better.</P>
      <P>Some improvements have been made and some more are being made as outlined in the Finance Bill but there is no fundamental reform.  The main reason for this is that the resources are not there to do so and they will never be there if we continue to restrict the corporation tax base.  On its own merits this step can be justified in the same way that any of the others can be justified.  There have been a series of them during the past few years, be it in respect of trading houses, the shipping industry, certain horticultural activities, the film industry and so on but they do not relate to what we strictly called manufacturing industry. We are now seeing the movement of certain sectors of the service industry into the 10 per cent corporation tax regime.  I suppose this will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way this section is drafted makes me feel uneasy as it seems when it was first drafted a gap as wide as a gate had been opened up but then someone decided to close it by introducing this concept of companies having to be grant aided by the IDA.  If this stipulation was not included we might be okay with software development services as they would very clearly be defined activities associated with manufacturing industry and technical or consultancy services are usually stand-alone activities but once we <Col N="1766" /> include data processing services we will be faced by the insurance companies and banks, who since 1 January, are liable to a 43 per cent rate of tax, at least on the face of it.</P>
    <P>It seems that if the additional words which would have the effect of confining the 10 per cent rate of tax to companies who received an employment grant from the IDA were not included, a large proportion of the activities of an insurance company would be liable at a 10 per cent rate of tax rather than 43 per cent, as a large amount of the work done in an insurance company is of a data processing nature.  The same applies to banking. Much of what goes on in a bank would come under the heading of data processing and there is nobody better at giving a wide definition than tax advisers if the form of words suits.  I believe whoever drafted this section saw the gap and then tried to close it by introducing this notion.  As Deputy McDowell has pointed out, the pressure will be put on and the Minister will be asked how we can justify this.  Those who have already received will get more.  First of all, a person would get a grant and then get tax relief.  What about the fellow who has got nothing?  Has he not a better case?  There will be fellows back with levers trying to widen that gap further.</P>
    <P>I am uneasy about the approach being adopted at present.  We will have to take another look at this question.  I am aware that we are bound by commitments and contracts and that the 10 per cent régime will continue until the year 2000.  I support that fully but there are two things we will have to do very quickly.  First, we will have to look beyond the year 2000 and make our minds up about what is going to happen then.  After 1992 people will be thinking in terms of investment decisions, the benefit of which will accrue after the year 2000, and they will want clear signals &mdash; if not categoric statements &mdash; at least seven or eight years in advance of what will happen here after the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The other matter is a concept on which Deputy McDowell has been fairly strong. Nobody would mind a 10 per cent scheme but it is a maximum of 10 per cent and it <Col N="1767" /> would be well worth putting flesh on the formula that Deputy McDowell proposed in his tax document of exploring the possibility of getting as near to 10 per cent as possible.  It is not as simple as saying that it will be a minimum of 10 per cent because certain write-offs are legitimate.</P>
    <P>Effectively, zero rated companiese have been operating in this country for years without paying any tax.  Since the introduction of the 10 per cent régime companies have operated here and paid 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 3 per cent and not much more.  In the first five or six years of operation they have effectively paid nothing.  I know that the Minister's predecessor last year &mdash; and the Minister this year &mdash; tidied up the reduction in accelerated depreciation from 100 per cent to 50 per cent and sections 11 to 14, inclusive, this year.</P>
    <P>We have a strong corporate base and it might be of greater benefit to the companies here if they paid slightly more on their corporate tax and less on their payroll taxes.  It is well worth looking at that kind of switch and it could be done in a manner which would not only benefit the economy and employment but the companies which are now the beneficiaries of the 10 per cent tax régime.</P>
    <P>I am not an advocate of easy ideological solutions.  I do not say that there are enormous quantities of wealth out there in the corporate sector which we should grab.  I am not into that line of simplistic argument but it is time to look at the balance of advantage, for the economy and the companies, because certainly in individual companies a case can be made where it would be to their benefit if the kind of switch I am talking about is made.</P>
    <P>Quite frequently a corporate identity does not express a corporate view.  The view expressed is that of the people running the corporation and frequently it is the view of the collective three or four key people at the top.  The people who run our corporate sector now on the basis of the financial pages of the newspapers run it very effectively and profitably. <Col N="1768" /> However, they are running it at a return far less than their equivalents abroad. The people who are running the corporate sector so well in many areas, who are making it such a highly profitable sector and have a terrific export record, are being penalised because of PRSI and income tax.  The very captains of industry who would be expected to lead the attack against any change along the lines I am talking about in regard to the 10 per cent régime would be the main beneficiaries of the change if the thing was constructed properly and if there was a switch from the corporate to the personal side.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of schizophrenia in corporate Ireland at the moment because a chief executive who has a great gross income has quite a low income after tax. Some very significant people are living quite modestly and certainly they would benefit from major changes in income tax.  However, one of those same people wearing his corporate hat is protecting the profitability of the corporation and advocating low corporate tax régimes.  It is time to look again at the balance of advantage.  This is a small step in one direction I will not be voting against the section, but it accentuates fears that have been growing in me and others over a number of years that this gradualism is wiping out the corporate tax base.  At the same time the people who work in the sector are personally penalised for the advantages which accrue to the institution in which they work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I thought about it the more convinced I became about the wrongness of this.  Think of two individuals who have some expertise in the data processing or software development or consultancy service relating to those two things: one is an under-capitalised entrepreneur and the other has backing.  One can go to the IDA with a corporate plan and the other can just hire an office in Camden Street and get going. One sets up a company which, as far as capital structure is concerned, is ramshackle and takes risky ventures on board which would not impress any grey-suited executive in the IDA.  The other decides <Col N="1769" /> to do the safe thing and at the end of the first or second year &mdash; whenever the corporation tax falls to be paid &mdash; one of them pays 43 per cent and the other pays 10 per cent of their profits because the man who had the safe course and who had all the money behind him also got a grant from the IDA.  That legislation seems wrong in principle.</P>
      <P>You are saying to somebody, &ldquo;to him who hath more shall be given, and from him who hath not even that which he has shall be taken away&rdquo;.  That is fundamentally the principle laid down there. If you hold out the begging bowl and are sufficiently impressive to get help from the Government in one area you will get it from the other area as well, whereas if you cannot, for whatever reason, get the IDA to back you, you can stick at the 43 per cent level.  How can it possibly be justified that someone who does the same service but in a different way and is undercapitalised, is told that he can have a 43 per cent corporation tax rate but someone who does the same work and does not attract the favourable attention of a semi-State body &mdash; would-be entrepreneurs but too cautious to put their toe into the pool themselves &mdash; is told by the IDA that he will get a 10 per cent rate? Look at the converse side of the coin. The IDA are saying to the Department of Finance that if they get a tax incentive package they will haul in a few big fish to this country.  They say that if they have the right to offer a 10 per cent rate they will bring in the goodies.  That is fine except for the proposition that one of the pre-conditions for giving the goodies is that they have to give employment grants as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a wrong basis on which to decide.  Why is it relevant that the IDA have given them a grant?  It is relevant only for the reason Deputy Noonan gave, that in some sense it puts a piece of string across the gateway that has been opened. The decision as to how wide the gateway is open is given to the IDA and they are allowed to market tailormade tax packages for people in whom they are interested while others, who are not <Col N="1770" /> favourably looked on by the IDA, do not get anything like the same treatment.  It is simply wrong in principle to design a tax system where a certain class of activity attracts a 10 per cent rate but only on condition that a semi-State body have decided to pour some of the taxpayers' money into it through another pocket.</P>
    <P>To go back to what Deputy Noonan said in relation to the section 84 type lending discrimination, is this not much more obviously a case where there is discrimination because you are discriminating between two potential entrepreneurs on the basis that one of them is approved of by a semi-State body?</P>
    <P>The High Court recently struck down the Imposition of Duties Act on the basis that this House cannot delegate its legislative powers but if the House provides a 10 per cent tax rate and then allows the IDA to select to whom that tax rate will be given it is in my view delegating its taxation powers to the IDA.  That is wrong.  For the reasons I have outlined I am against this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to move from the theory to the practice and refer to a number of IDA decisions I came across in my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I can recall a cut-glass manufacturing industry in the west being refused IDA grants in accordance with the normal IDA practice that they do not grant aid another activity if they think the market is saturated.  The line of decision-making would be, we have Waterford Glass, Cavan Crystal and Galway Crystal and neither the domestic market or the foreign market would justify another cut-glass industry.  Grants were refused to the applicants from the west but the entrepreneur went ahead and has now a successful small glass cutting industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to apply that scheme of things to computer related services, as in the section, that person would be paying tax on his profits at 43 per cent.  If that person had been grant-aided by the IDA in the first instance and had received an employment grant he would be paying tax at 10 per cent.  This does not arise in <Col N="1771" /> manufacturing industry because all manufacturing industry has a 10 per cent regime.  However, the Minister now is differentiating between service industries which are aided by the IDA and those which are not.  The IDA will have propositions for data processing services which they will not grant-aid because they have had such proportions before; they will grant-aid some and will not grant-aid others.  If a person has the bottle to go ahead without grant-aid and sets up a data processing service or a softwear development service he will be paying tax at 43 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is new in this is technical consultancy services which relate to either paragraphs (1) or (2).  The remainder has been in existence for years and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed about certain aspects of them. Computer services were first included in the scheme in 1984 and the vetting service of the IDA has always been the vehicle by which those things have been done. One can argue for and against that.  As Deputies Noonan and McDowell rightly say, one can look at any sector and say that it should get more than another sector but what is involved here is trying to improve the labour intensive side.  I agree with the Deputies when they say that we must get further away from aiding capital as against labour.  We started that process and are continuing it this year. Other areas are being tightened up but a lot of tightening up remains to be done on the whole corporate side of taxation. I want to see us going further down that road because the balance was tilted for too long, far too heavily in favour of <Col N="1772" /> capital as against employment.  Hopefully, we will be able to continue the move in the right direction next year.</P>
      <P>As far as softwear and technical services are concerned we are talking about labour intensive services.  One can argue one way or the other as to whether we should do this.  In my view we need to pull the whole area together.  I am aware of cases like that mentioned by Deputy Noonan.  Different State agencies have told people there was no room for their project, that the market was saturated and that they would not get into an export market with their product, but subsequently they were proved wrong.  We all could be good decision makers in hindsight but somebody has to make a judgment on the day an application is received.</P>
      <P>There has been mention of keeping an entrepreneur out if one believes that the market may be saturated but if a person is good enough he will take a niche in the market at any stage.  A decision has to be made then as to whether that person should be supported.  The Report of the Commission on Taxation favoured more use of grants and less use of tax incentives and it appears that that is what Deputy Noonan is referring to.  I do not think the Deputy believes in grants and I certainly do not.  They have been overused here and industry has been overpadded by them.  We have developed a grant mentality here.  At the end of the day if any project has to depend solely on a grant for success it will inevitably fail.  That is my honest opinion.  In the case of many of the investors who come here the grant is used as a top-up.  I have never believed they were the crucial factor in encouraging an investor to come here.  The taxation system had a hell of a lot more to do with them coming than the level of grants.</P>
      <P>In my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce I attempted, and succeeded to a great degree, in scaling back the grants.  The result is that we are producing more jobs for less money and I want to see us going further down that line.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At the <Col N="1773" /> commencement of his reply the Minister told us that these provisions have been in existence for some time but that is not the issue involved.  If a person is manufacturing aluminium saucepans and makes a profit that person is charged at the rate of 10 per cent regardless of whether he or she was grant-aided by the IDA.  Whether one gets a grant or not there is no differentiation in manufacturing between the way the tax is applied subsequently.  However, the difference between that provision which has existed for some time and the provision before us is that to qualify for the 10 per cent regime one must get a grant from the IDA in the first instance.  If one has the bottle to go ahead and establish a niche in the market without the IDA grant &mdash; good entrepreneurs do that &mdash; then that person is taxed at the 43 per cent rate because it is not self-evidently manufacturing industry.  To be a computer related activity which qualifies as manufacturing that industry must be grant-aided by the IDA or otherwise it will be treated as part of the service industry and taxed at the rate of 43 per cent. That is unfair.</P>
      <P>It is IDA policy, and it is a correct policy, that we should not throw grants at everybody until the market is saturated and they all knock each other out of business.  We should not be grant-aiding in the way some of our bank managers sanction figure for a house or six figures for a farm.  If the IDA give grants to everybody they will compete with each other and knock each other out of the market.  However, that is not the issue. What we are highlighting is that to qualify for the 10 per cent regime one must get a grant from the IDA, while in manufacturing activity the tax rate is 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;21. &mdash;Section 39A (inserted by the Finance Act, 1981) of the Finance Act, 1980, is hereby amended by the deletion of subsections (8) and (9).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert into the Finance Bill a new section 21 which will amend section 39A of the Finance Act, 1980, to remove the less than 50 employee limitation on Shannon service companies qualifying for the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax.  Where the number of such a company's employees equals or exceeds 50, subsection (8) of section 39A provides for a limit on the amount of relief due to it under the 10 per cent scheme by reference to the number of its employees.</P>

This is a particularly welcome improvement in the incentives available in trying to attract new employment to the Shannon area.  In addition it will encourage existing companies in Shannon to expand their operations and removes the possibility of them leaving, as their relief will no longer be liable to be restricted if their employee numbers equal or exceed 50.

      <P>Sections 21 and 22 amend section 32 of the Finance Act, 1988, in a number of ways.  Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1988, changed the tax rules for distribution by companies of dividends from different types of profits. Prior to section 32 a company with a mix of profits had to pay in dividends all its post-tax 10 per cent profits first before they could pay out dividends from their other post-tax profits.  This was known as the Primary Fund rule.  Section 32 abolished the Primary Fund and introduced new rules to take effect from 6 April 1989.  The key rule in these new arrangements is proportionality, that is, dividends are treated as coming proportionately from the mix of post-tax profits.  Thus the new rules reflect the underlying commercial reality of a company with a mix of 10 per cent profits, standard rate profits and other profits.</P>
      <P>In response to representations made after the publication of section 32 my predecessor announced last year that consideration would be given to simplifying or improving the detailed provisions of section 32.  Following discussions with a number of representative bodies and companies, certain changes to section 32 were decided on, as proposed in sections 21 and 22. The key change is that, instead of the rule that the dividends must be paid in the first instance out of the mix of profits of the immediately preceding year, a company will now be able to pay the dividends out of the mix of profits of any one or more previous years in the past nine years.  This is known within the accountancy profession as &ldquo;vintaging&rdquo;. Where such profits are exhausted the company can go back to earlier years. Thus these changes will give companies much more flexibility in regard to dividend distributions while maintaining the basic proportionality rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proportionate basis, as set out in <Col N="1781" /> sections 21 and 22, is logical and reasonable. The reality is that companies have one pool of profits only.  The new rules are designed to treat dividends as paid from this pool for the purpose of calculating the tax credits to be attached to those dividends.  This approach ensures a fair system for companies, their shareholders and the Exchequer.  It strikes a balance so that if there were, within a group of companies, a 10 per cent company, a 43 per cent company, a 35 per cent company, we are saying to them that they should distribute their profits in the proportions in which they are earned.  It seems to be a fair and reasonable way for the Exchequer, shareholders and everybody else.  Certainly, some companies would like to have total flexibility in relation to which would be the most tax efficient method as far as they are concerned. Therefore, this endeavours to strike a balance between the different interests involved.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to allow companies an alternative to the provisions of section 45 of the Finance Act, 1980, as amended last year, which provides that, for the purpose of computing the attaching tax credits, distributions made by a company, with specified exceptions, should be attributed to the accounting period ending immediately prior to the date of payment of the distribution.</P>
      <P>Subject to conditions the alternative will allow companies to nominate an accounting period or periods for which a distribution will be treated as made for the purpose of computing the tax credit to be attached to it.  A company may nominate an accounting period or periods ending not earlier than nine years from the date on which the distribution is made if it still has undistributed income relating to those periods.  When there is no longer undistributed income relating to those periods companies may nominate an earlier accounting period or periods.  A company will not be entitled to nominate that a distribution was made for the accounting period in which it was made unless it is an interim dividend paid before 6 April 1990, a distribution arising from tax-based section 84 lending or preference share financing, or is in respect of the first or last accounting period in which a company carries on business.  An election for the alternative method will have to be made to the inspector of taxes within six months of the end of the accounting period in which the distribution is made.</P>
      <P>The option set out in section 22 allows companies generous scope in managing the tax credits they attach to distributions made to their shareholders.  Sections 22 and 45 of the 1980 Finance Act, as now amended, introduce maximum flexibility into the computation of tax credits consistent with limiting the cost to the Exchequer of the abolition of the primary fund.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This section is a technical provision designed to remove two unintended and opposite interactions between the relief for manufacturing <Col N="1784" /> industry &mdash; the 10 per cent scheme &mdash; provided by the Finance Act, 1980, and the surcharges contained in sections 101 and 162 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in respect of the undistributed investment, rental and certain other income of close companies.  One of the interactions, by not giving full weight to the amount of tax borne on the income liable to surcharge, actually increases the surcharge beyond what it should reasonably be.  The other interaction, by allowing manufacturing relief in respect of a surcharge, effectively reduces the surcharge.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing relief and the surcharges are totally unrelated concepts and, therefore, should not interact as they do.

      <P>This is a drafting amendment to section 25 of the Bill which increases the relief payable to a company referred to as an allowable investor company which invests in film productions.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify for me this film industry provision.  There seems always to be great concern to make special arrangements for the film industry.  In the couple of minutes remaining I should like to know what the Department of Finance think of this, whether all these tax-based incentives are effective at all or do they merely represent a response to the urgings of an influential group of people?  Is there much in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an incentive scheme in existence which was not operational or being taken up.  This constitutes a significant improvement on that scheme.  If one looks at the development of the film industry in Canada and Australia one will see that it grew out of a tax-based incentive package.  This is a similar attempt to ascertain whether there will be a response to it here.  As the House will be aware, if we could attract film makers here their industry is a very labour-intensive one and a good business to get going.  That is the way it grew in Canada and Australia and it is being tried here in the hope that it will be successful.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if any research has been carried out by him or any agency of his <Col N="1788" /> Department in relation to the level of unemployment in housing estates (details supplied) in the western suburbs of Dublin; if so, which of these estates have (a)  unemployment in excess of three times the national average of 18 per cent, that is 54 per cent or higher and (b) unemployment in excess of 18 per cent, that is 36 per cent and less than 54 per cent; if this information is not available if he will arrange to provide it; and if the information is available, the exceptional measures which he proposes to take to relieve the problems in the worst affected areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my top priorities in establishing FÁS was to develop a training and employment service on a regionalised basis capable of responding promptly, effectively and efficiently to local needs. In its short existence, FÁS has made considerable progress in developing such a client-centred service.  Its presence at local level gives FÁS a detailed knowledge of local priorities and problems such as youth unemployment in the areas in question and enables it to respond in the most appropriate way.</P>
      <P>The experience of FÁS in the Clondalkin, Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Blanchardstown areas supports my view on the need for local structures.  The areas contain two major training centres with a further one operating in the vicinity. There are four FÁS employment service offices in the areas with the most recent being opened last November in Blanchardstown. Residents of these areas also use the centre city employment office in D'Olier Street.</P>
      <P>The Clondalkin, Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Blanchardstown areas contain a number of Community Training Workshops. In addition some of Jobsearch courses are operating in the areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Youthreach programme which has been developed to meet the needs of those who leave school with little or no qualifications will operate intensively in the area.  The Dublin West-Kildare region plan provides for 500 places on Youthreach involving FÁS and the VECs <Col N="1789" /> with the majority of places being provided in the Tallaght, Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas.  A new VEC Youthreach programme will be launched in the Blanchardstown area.</P>
    <P>These are also on-going Community Youth Training Projects, Community Enterprise Programmes and FAS's continuous recruitment assistance to local businesses.</P>
    <P>In the case of Tallaght, FÁS have developed an integrated area development plan which has been running for 18 months and which involves collaboration on enterprise and the promotion of enterprise with all State agencies and local voluntary bodies and groups in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>All FÁS regions have developed regional plans and the plan for the Dublin West region to which I have already referred will set out FÁS plans for its services and activities in the areas in question.</P>
    <P>The examples which I have outlined combine the application of national programmes to the identified needs of local areas with the mix of programmes being determined by local management.  Such an approach calls on the knowledge of the local FÁS personnel.  It is, in my view, more cost effective than expensive surveys which may need continuous updating and consistent with the policy of local structures and decentralised decision making which I have pursued since the passing of the Labour Services Act two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give it road by road as the question asked but I will give the details I have.  In the Dublin west region a total of £16 million will be spent on training and employment programmes within the region.  The unemployment rate in the sub areas &mdash; Dublin west inner suburbs &mdash; which comprise Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore and Walkinstown is 19.6 per cent.  In greater Tallaght which comprises Tallaght, Firhouse, Oldbawn, Jobstown and Kilnamanagh the rate is 24 per cent.  In greater Clondalkin which comprises Clondalkin, Neilstown, Bawnogue, Palmerstown and Chapelizod the rate is 22.4 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the protection and safety procedures which are available to people working in laboratories including all the national blood transfusion services dealing with the AIDS virus; the safety requirements, if any, which are in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980 together with the regulations made under them apply to workers employed in laboratories attached to factory premises as defined in those Acts.  In addition the European Communities (Major Accident Hazards of Certain Industrial Activities) Regulations, 1986, commonly known as the &ldquo;Seveso&rdquo; Directive Regulations, apply to most pharmaceutical and allied chemical industries including laboratories attached to those industries.</P>
      <P>Laboratories, other than those referred to &mdash; such as hospital laboratories, separate research laboratories and laboratories in universities, schools and colleges &mdash; are outside the scope of safety and health legislation which is currently in force.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which I intend to bring into operation shortly, will, however, extend legislative safety and health protection to all places of work, including laboratories.  The new legislation will set down general duties of care in relation to all employers, employees and the self-employed. It will also extend protection to non-employees who may be affected by work activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Health have issued comprehensive recommendations relating to the protection of all medical and paramedical personnel who may be exposed to the AIDS virus in the course of their work. These recommendations relate to the safe use of instrumentation, protective clothing, handling and disposal of contaminated items and other matters, <Col N="1792" /> including the strict observance of the rules of good microbiological techniques.</P>
    <P>Although the Blood Transfusion Service Board laboratories are outside the remit of the Safety in Industry Acts, I have been advised that the board have in operation a detailed set of standard operational procedures on laboratory safety for their laboratory staff.  These procedures comply with the standards recommended by the World Health Organisation, The Council of Europe and the standards used by other blood transfusion services throughout the world.  In addition, each individual section of the Blood Transfusion Service Board's laboratories has its own safety procedures applying to the specific work carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

      <P>The new Act, as the Deputy knows, went to the Seanad since the Easter session began.  I have now written to the Federated Union of Employers and the Congress of Trade Unions for their nominees.  I would realistically hope that meetings would start from September.  Between now and that time all the preparatory work will be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to procedures, the Department of Health advise that they have issued the following guidelines in relation to the protection of medical and pharmaceutical personnel from the AIDS virus.  First, special care should be exercised in the use of sharp instruments and needles, to avoid self-innoculation; gloves or other protective clothing must be worn whenever contact with potentially contaminated material is unavoidable; all instruments, objects, surfaces, possibly contaminated with infectious material should be decontaminated using effective disinfectant solutions; disposal of contaminated items of waste should be made safe by auto-cleaning before final disposal; materials such as blood tissues <Col N="1793" /> and secretions should be labelled as infectious; all material likely to contain these agents should be packaged in a way in which they can be transported safely; for the handling and processing of specimens, strict observance of the rules of good microbiological techniques are mandatory.  These are extremely detailed and are enforced in all hospital laboratories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure me that the guidelines he has mentioned are being observed in the laboratories?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Department of Health that these are rigorously enforced.  In the new Act, I presume, codes of practice which we will discuss during the Bill or regulations will become the regulations, but in the meantime these guidelines are strictly enforced.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the recruitment and training of apprentices rests with employers.  It has, however, been the practice for FÁS to sponsor a number of apprentices to meet any shortfall due to unexpected increased demand for skilled persons from existing or new employers.</P>
      <P>At my request, FÁS are undertaking a review of the current system of apprenticeship with a view to making the system more flexible and ensuring that the future needs of industry are met.  The review was also prompted by the very sizeable funds directed to apprentice training from the FÁS budget.</P>
      <P>The question of further increasing the number of apprentices will be considered in the light of the outcome of the review.</P>
      <P>The board of FÁS have not yet completed their review, but I look forward to receiving it in the near future.  The recommendations will be considered in consultation with interested parties.</P>

Would he indicate to the House whether he would accept the principle of the need for sharply increasing the number of apprentices in training, even if at this moment it does not seem likely that there will be places for them at home?  Would he accept that if, unfortunately, some of our young people have to go abroad it would be better for them to go abroad skilled rather than unskilled?</P>

      <P>The recent statement of the Minister to which I referred in my question was made on 30 March of this year at the East Wall Training Centre. The Minister also stated that there was a shortfall of skilled people in the hotel industry.  Would he agree that this shortfall is largely due to the fact that the contribution due from the hotel industry has not been matched?  The target figure was £500,000.  Could the Minister tell the House if this £500,000 has been paid through CERT by the hotel industry?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is actually £500,000 but it is not too far off it.  What I said in the East Wall Training Centre is, unfortunately, true and I have asked the Council of CERT to look at what means they have of increasing their training throughput for the remainder of this year and into next year.  Unfortunately, the people leaving the RTCs and colleges well qualified are still emigrating although there are jobs for them in the country.  This is creating difficulties for the hotel industry.  Something like 20 per cent of the hotels and guesthouses are short of numbers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the changes, if any, which the Government intend to make in the operation of the employment incentive scheme in the light of the recent ESRI report which showed that the scheme had not had a significant effect on increasing employment or improving the position of the long-term unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I have already decided to (i) increase the number of workers an employer may recruit under the employment incentive scheme from four to eight and (ii) in the case of employers who had previously participated in the scheme to use an employment base level obtaining three years prior to the date of application. Both these changes are now in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major conclusion of the ESRI was that the scheme had not a significant job creation effect.  The survey did, however, indicate that the scheme was cost effective and it did direct some hirings by <Col N="1800" /> employers towards workers in the target groups.  The target groups were at the time of the survey the long and short term registered unemployed and young people including school leavers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  We have plans. As the Deputy knows, the uptake in the scheme has not been the greatest.  It was never considered it would be a major determinant of job creation but it has been significant, particularly for target groups.  I have brought in two changes and we are looking at others to see if we can make the scheme more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with regard to uptake relates to the way FÁS are operating the scheme, and the disadvantages and discouragement many employers are confronted with by FÁS interviewees and officials are a major problem.  Is the Minister aware of that problem?  If he is, has he any proposals to alter that bottleneck in the system that currently exists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that but I am aware of the difficulty with the base line figures.  The two changes I have made are an attempt to make that easier. Until now they had to go back to the 1984 base line figures; now it goes back to the 1986 figures.  Also they can now take on eight workers instead of four, but in the review, the suggestions and recommendations of the ESRI report, the aim <Col N="1801" /> is to take as much bureaucracy as we possibly can out of the system and make it easier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the scheme as operated at present, in particular in view of the reduced level of payment on the scheme from its original £70 basic, is acting as a definite disadvantage for married people?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is concentrating on the cost effectiveness of the scheme today as a source of cheap labour and he must re-establish primary importance of the scheme as a device to employ <Col N="1802" /> those who might otherwise not be considered for employment, such as the long-term unemployed and those coming from socially disadvantaged categories.  The reliance on cost effectiveness is an argument that one could keep people off the dole for very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not over-emphasise that.  The report said it was a fairly cost effective scheme, but the one advantage was that, while employers in 90 per cent or 92 per cent of cases showed they would have taken on employees anyway, the report showed that because of the scheme they took on people from the categories it was focussed on, the long-term unemployed.  In my view the conclusions of the report, and perhaps the presentation of it, should have given more credit to that point.  All the comments on it were to the effect that the scheme was taking on people who would have been taken on anyway.  They should have been to the effect that the scheme was taking on people who would not have got a job but for the presence of this scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to comments recently by senior officials of the FUE suggesting that EC social harmonisation should be implemented in this country voluntarily rather than by directive or laws; if he will outline the Government's attitude to this suggestion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the particular comments referred to by the Deputy.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to outline the Government's general approach to the question of development of a European social policy dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully support the idea of a social dimension as part of the measures to implement the development of <Col N="1803" /> the single European market.  They considered that such a dimension is appropriate and necessary so as to ensure that workers derive a fair share of the benefits of the single market.  However, they believe that the social dimension should not include elements which would impede the promotion of employment, which is the main priority of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards the nature and scope of the proposed social dimension, I should stress that it does not imply total harmonisation throughout the Community of social standards or of the manner of their implementation.  In some areas, detailed minimum requirements will be prescribed centrally by the Community. In many others, however, what will happen is that broad guidelines for objective standards will be set out at Community level, leaving the methods of their implementation to be determined by national governments, through domestic legislation or collective bargaining.  Finally, there will be aspects in relation to which action by member states is recommended but not laid down in Community legislation, the voluntarist approach.</P>
    <P>The need for Community legislation, the areas to be covered, the standards to be set and the method of implementation will, therefore, be determined on a case by case basis.  Ireland supports this sort of pragmatic approach which proposes common objectives but takes account at the same time of the differing circumstances in the individual Community member states and of their traditional methods of implementing minimum standards in employment matters.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to hear the Minister is unaware of the views of the senior members of the FUE as referred to in the question.  In short, what was being suggested was that any introduction of social harmonisation of development of worker participation in industry should come by agreement or by arrangement between the workers and management and not by response to an EC Directive.  Will the Minister agree <Col N="1804" /> or disagree in general terms with that approach?  If there is agreement, do the Government anticipate making representations in response to these views to the European Parliament or the Commission to go easy on the directives in this field or to seek in any way a relief from directives for this country?</P>

      <P>A discussion is going on about fundamental rights and how these should be achieved.  The Spanish Presidency is working on a charter of rights. What is to be contained in that is a matter of considerable disagreement.  We would go along with the concept of a character of rights except for items which would cause particular problems to small employers or create some major difficulty in the collective bargaining system.  The German Presidency and the Greek Presidency were working on aspects of safety and health and minimum protective legislation. There is no disagreement on these matters and we strongly support their views.  There still is considerable disagreement on a charter of rights, particularly by the UK Government.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the net question in relation to the Irish Government's response to the proposed charter of social rights relates to whether the Community, and particularly the Council of Social Affairs Ministers, is prepared to give effect to that charter by way of directive or by way of exhortation?  Would he agree that the Irish Government have reneged on previous occasions and are now aligned with the conservative government of Mrs. Thatcher in saying that while the charter of social rights is a good thing it should be left to the voluntary practices of individual nations?  Would the Minister further agree that his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Brennan, has sold out entirely in relation to worker's rights, for which he has statutory responsibility?</P>

      <P>Regarding the Deputy's <Col N="1805" /> claim that we are aligned with the Thatcher government, nothing could be further from the truth as far as the meetings of the social affairs Council are concerned. Practically all the time I am on the other side but so are the other ten.  It is an 11 to 1 position on all issues.  On some issues that changes slightly in that the line-up would be different.  It is all very fine to have a legislative charter of rights, for which I have much support, but it is vital that we do not legislate away from the collective bargaining process and into a charter of rights which is all legislation and does not allow room for discussion.  In the collective bargaining process employers and workers often move away from the norm because of particular circumstances.  If it is all built into legislation it will mean that the biggest and the smallest employers will be tied in legislatively.  When I talk about the voluntary approach I am referring to that matter, not matters of safety and health or minimum notice.  For several years there have been other directives which would be quite difficult and dangerous to implement.</P>

      <P>A lot of our legislation, regulations, etc., is acceptable but there are other proposals which could make it more difficult and less attractive for employers to employ people.  That must be looked at carefully.  I take the point that we cannot allow people to be discriminated against but we have to be careful.  There are some proposals that might operate well for a German multinational company but which would not be of benefit to a small Irish company.

Would the Minister agree that we should be wholehearted supporters of the idea of a charter of rights for workers and that the charter should be balanced by a charter of responsibilities?  Employment is less likely where there is no onus on workers and trade unionists to be responsible. There is a need for balance in this respect.</P>

      <P>I am a wholehearted supporter of a charter of rights for workers and the recent Bill on health and safety agreed by this House covers many of the aspects which will eventually be included in a bill of rights.  Our law is up to date in that respect.  On the question of responsibilities, this is among the issues being discussed.  I could not agree with the UK Government's position.  They do not want to legislate for anything and their bill of rights will probably include nothing.  There is a big difference between what we, the Germans and others want and what the UK Government are prepared to accept.  I do not believe the next meeting will cover this issue.  It is likely to go on for some time.</P>

I have also arranged for a seminar to be held on 12 May to consider the issues involved. Subsequently I will discuss the matter further with the ICTU and the FUE before deciding what action should be taken.</P>
      <P>The conditions of employment and working hours of persons employed in the retail trade, including part-timers, are at present regulated by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942.

      <P>I am aware of that.  For that reason in recent months, we have been involved in discussions with the FUE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This seminar arose out of these discussions and it is giving a platform to employers, trade unions, legal experts, industry itself and people who have researched the areas, to put forward views.  On this issue we have to implement changes because it is not <Col N="1809" /> acceptable that people who work for maybe ten or 20 years for less than 18 hours a week are not entitled to minimum notice, are not entitled to have recourse to the unfair dismissals legislation, have no redundancy at the end of the day, have no maternity leave and, if they work under 120 hours a month, are not entitled to the benefit of the holiday Act.  This state of affairs has been allowed to go on for several years and I am totally opposed to it.  I am not trying to get agreement on this issue.  I am looking for a balanced view on it.  I am not trying to make part-time or temporary or casual work unworkable so that people will not be able to employ people here and there for short-time work; but I am opposed to people being continually employed on a temporary part-time basis without statutory protection.  They should be entitled to such.</P>

I am also aware &mdash; and this is something the Deputy did not mention &mdash; that some of the major employers have organised their computers so that all their employees work 17 hours 50 minutes a week and therefore are under the statutory limits.  I know that if I were to up the limit to 19 hours they would move their limit to 18 hours 50 minutes a week. Therefore it is not just a simple matter of upping the threshold.  It is a matter that <Col N="1810" /> must be carefully looked at.  I have highlighted the abuses to the FUE with the organisations involved that I know of; I know there are many more smaller organisations, and I have asked them for their views.  The up coming conference will be very interesting.  We have done a lot of work already in this area.  It involves social welfare in a major way because of the thresholds on redundancy and maternity leave.  From then on we will complete our legislative review and bring proposals before the House.</P>

The Act has been left that way for over 50 years.  It is also far too complicated.  In the last 12 months or so I have been going through it.

According to the circular report for the period 1984-89, 16,438 people were employed in fast food outlets.  It is reasonable to assume that lots of these people are not afforded proper protection under existing legislation.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, provides that most employees are entitled to three weeks annual holidays for each leave year &mdash; that is, from 1 April to 31 March &mdash; with <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for periods of less than a year.  The collective bargaining process has added a further four days for most employees and in addition there is an entitlement to eight public holidays.</P>
      <P>The position in the EC is that statutory minimum annual leave entitlements vary from 14 days in Greece to 30 days in Spain.  There is no statutory entitlement to annual leave in the UK.  The average is about 20 days which is just above the 19 days holidays to which most employees in this country are entitled.</P>
      <P>The number of public holidays in EC member states at present ranges between eight in Britain and Ireland, to 14 in Denmark, with an average of about 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> The priorities of the Government relating to employment are concentrated in implementing policies which will lead to the preservation of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs.  Declaring extra holidays would directly increase employment costs, and this would not be compatible with Government strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that it is time, since the legislation dates from 1973, to review it and consider extending it and bringing it into line with the majority of countries within the EC in terms of holiday entitlements generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If unemployment were not as high as it is I would love to be the Santa Claus who would deliver a few holidays.  Quite frankly the cost of an extra day, at the lowest level of the calculation would be £50 million to employers and industry.  That would not take account of profits or inconvenience to industry.  For example, in Europe there is a holiday on May Day so businesses are closing down on 1 May.  What generally happens is that production on the preceding and following days are affected. So there are clearly major effects on industry.</P>
      <P>In all these issues the facts have to be considered carefully.  Several thousands, and maybe even hundreds of thousands of people get the minimum leave but the majority of the workforce get far more than the minimum number of days.  I have spoken recently about changing some of the bank holidays, and I certainly intend to raise that aspect with the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was going to raise.  For instance, the Minister made a point on the radio during the past week about New Year's Day and about extending the Christmas holiday to a fortnight. Would he not consider changing the holiday on New Year's Day to a more appropriate time during the year when it would be of more benefit to tourism and to the country as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking along <Col N="1813" /> those lines, but industry responded by saying that even when people work on 1 January, after the Hogmanay and New Year's Eve parties, they are not in the best physical condition.  It is very hard to satisfy everybody.  I will certainly see what can be done about that.  I know some people, for example bar staff &mdash; as I have been reminded by letters from wives of hard workers &mdash; finish work on Christmas morning at 2 a.m. and are expected back at work at midday on 26 December.  We cannot generalise, but this is certainly an area I will look at.  We do not take any great delight in being out of line with other countries in regard to May Day in particular, but at a cost of £50 million, that would be too much to make it a bank holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is highlighting the issue of May Day, since Ireland is one of only three countries in the European Community that does not honour May Day &mdash; Denmark and the United Kingdom being the other two &mdash; it is time, in view of the calls from one of the social partners, the trade union movement, for the Government to give serious consideration to honouring May Day.  Industry has devices and means available to it, in negotiation with the workforce, to keep production in motion and a bank holiday or a public holiday does not mean, in this day and age, that all industry must close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but as the Deputy knows the costs would rise drastically.  I am not denying that we are one of only three countries that do not honour May Day and I suppose I could argue that other countries are out of line in that they do not have St. Patrick's Day, but I do not want to get into that argument.  The cost factor is stopping me from declaring another bank holiday, and nothing else. If industry was doing particularly well and we did not have to worry about the fact that 17.9 per cent of the labour force is without a job, I think we could do that. I will not rule it out indefinitely but at the moment we are asking industry to create more jobs, not to give more time off.</P>

      <P>This is just one programme out of many.  The international conference at which I spoke related to the entire co-operative movement and co-operative development association. This particular scheme directly assists groups to set up business in local communities and creates employment indirectly by providing grant aid for development, business start up and business advice services.  It is a fairly small programme but it helps many communities to get a start.</P>

It proves, in a limited way, extremely helpful to local communities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if the Government intend to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Worker Participation in relation to the private sector; if he has recently met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Advisory Committee on Worker Participation, which reported in June 1986, made several proposals for the development of worker participation in both the public and private sectors.  Progress has been made on some of the proposals.  In particular, a booklet, <i>Guidelines for Employee Participation,</i> has already been published and widely distributed to employer and worker organisations in accordance with the committee's recommendations.  A <Col N="1817" /> directory of working examples of successful participative arrangements is also being prepared and will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals, and in particular that relating to the introduction of enabling legislation for the private sector, did not have the support of the full committee and in the absence of agreement between the social partners I would be reluctant to take any action on these recommendations.</P>
      <P>I had discussions in March with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on worker participation issues generally.  In the course of the discussions Congress outlined their views on the recommendations of the advisory committee. A meeting with the Federated Union of Employers is being arranged.</P>

Would he agree, in view of recent developments and troubles that large concerns in this county faced, that workers must now be given the opportunity to become involved in the economic affairs of companies to which they commit themselves?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At numerous meetings with employer bodies I appealed to them to involve themselves in worker participation at board level if they deemed it necessary and certainly at sub-board level.  With the help of all parties in this House, we passed a very important Bill dealing with sub-board level structures in the public sector.  That practice should also be followed in the private sector because it is very important that there be co-operation as regards work agreements and understanding of the economic realities, difficulties, changes and work practices that are necessary.  Any right-thinking company should actively involve themselves in worker participation mechanisms. From my own experience over the past two and a half years the difficulty <Col N="1818" /> arises invariably where there is a lack of trust or the lack of a forum where employers and employees can discuss issues.</P>
      <P>I am taking this opportunity to appeal to employers to follow the example in the public sector and use the Worker Participation Act as a basis for their own mechanisms in the private sector.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that in this area cajolery will not be enough and that he must commit himself to some legislative programme to implement a blueprint for worker participation in the private sector.  What the Minister has said is laudable but they are only pious hopes.  Unless there is a legislative programme private industry generally will not allow workers to participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  We have a case study prepared to cajole and convince some employers about the great successes that some companies have had in this area.  The vast majority of big companies, including multinationals, do not have any difficulties.  The difficulties arise in companies where management lack experience and formal training.  I do not agree that every plan has to be implemented by legislation or that the only way we can get the private sector to comply is by writing it into legislation. From the advisory committee's report and from the case study of the proposals, I am sure we can convince a great many industries to pursue this idea.  This is a good idea but it does not require legislation to implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Youthreach was introduced last October jointly by the Minister for Education and myself to assist early school leavers with little or no educational qualifications.  The programme will provide up to two years co-ordinated and integrated training, work experience and temporary employment.  Up to 8 May 1989, more than 1,200 young people had started training on Youthreach of whom approximately 800 would have left school early without any qualifications.</P>
      <P>Youthreach is funded mainly through the allocations for FÁS and the vocational education committees.  Under the programme young people are directed to a newly designed VEC programme and to a number of suitable FÁS courses.  The main FÁS courses are the skills foundation programme and community training workshops.  The FÁS budget for the skills foundation programme in 1989 is £4 million approximately while the budget for community training workshops is £8 million approximately. In addition, FÁS have set aside £600,000 to meet the cost of the weekly allowances which will be paid to those attending the special educational programme for young people who have left school without any qualifications.</P>

Apart from the economic factor there may have been climatic factors influencing the number at that time.  However, in view of the fact that there are 240,000 people out of work and that approximately 40,000 emigrate per annum, and in view of the fact that these people are all receiving up to £40 a week unemployment benefit or assistance, does the Minister not think that we should use the social employment scheme to a greater extent as there is obvious potential there for giving people jobs, a return to the State for money they are paying out, and for giving people the dignity of work?</P>

Discussions have been undertaken at local level since February and from my information no difficulties have been highlighted.  If there are difficulties there can be appeal to the Labour Court but at this stage I do not believe that there are appeals to the Labour Court. However, a great number of firms and groups have already reached agreement and I know that many of the big employers are still at the discussion stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined yesterday various points of view in regard to this matter.  The Bill proposes to establish an appeals procedure whereby individuals may appeal in relation to the provisions of the Act.  Who would deal with these appeals, and who would provide the extra staff to implement the appeal procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years my Department have operated public officers in relation to <Col N="1960" /> housing grants, group water schemes, driver testing, etc.  However, despite the thousands of interviews that have been held, especially in the grants section, there have been few if any complaints about the lack of privacy.  Indeed, I can assure the House that every effort is made to ensure that the public offices operated by my Department are up to the best possible standard and that in these cases where confidential matters have to be discussed with members of the public, the staff of my Department conduct those discussions with tact and understanding.</P>
    <P>With regard to driver testing, which is a major activity administered by my Department, involving some 70,000 tests annually confidentiality is certainly something to which every individual has a right.  Part of the test involves an oral examination on the Rules of the Road at the test centre in the first instance and, if the individual subsequently fails his practical test, a written explanation of the faults which contributed to that failure is given to him or her by the tester.  These tests are held on a half-hourly basis, which gives the applicant the necessary time.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to agree that an individual, in those circumstances, should enjoy security and confidentiality and my Department have always fully recognised that fact.  In most test centres throughout the country a problem in this regard would not arise because of the relatively small numbers being tested at any one time.  Only in the major urban centres could a problem arise; in Dublin, for example, the big increase in numbers seeking tests has necessitated drafting more testers into the Dublin test centres. This could mean that, on occasions, a lesser degree of privacy would obtain.</P>
    <P>My Department are dealing with the problem.  The provision of a major new test centre, which will, in effect, be the headquarters centre is in the process of being considered.  Negotiations are at an advanced stage.  When completed, it will provide first-class facilities for driver testing and relieve any overcrowding at the other two centres in the city.  In other <Col N="1961" /> parts of the country the local test centres are being or have been improved.</P>
    <P>Local authorities throughout the country also have many day-to-day dealings with members of the public.  Each local authority has many public offices where inquiries may be made about services and entitlements and where the public may pay rents, house loans, service charges, motor tax etc.  These offices are open to the public in general and the emphasis is on providing the best possible service with the shortest possible delay. However, where matters of a confidential nature arise every effort is made to protect that confidentiality.</P>
    <P>In recent years much effort has been made by local authorities to improve the position.  Many of the hatches have been removed.  Where matters of a sensitive nature are concerned, the staff involved have treated people in a most human way.  I have had no complaints in this respect, certainly not from my own authorities in Laois-Offaly.  The only complaints I had were in regard to the local authority being unable to accede to a request, and we all know the reasons for that.  I know the personnel in many local authorities treat all the cases I mentioned with great care and have been particularly understanding when the question of confidentiality arose.  I spent a long number of years in local authorities and I know that has been the position.</P>
    <P>In areas of dense population, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, there may be pressure at times when the public come in to discuss their affairs.  I want to assure the House that I will be asking the local authorities to see what improvements can be made.  I have noted the references to the facilities available to members of the public in the new Dublin offices but I was not aware of problems in relation to those offices. However, I will now ask the city manager to let me know if there is a need for improved facilities in these offices.  We will then see what can be done.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, the provisions of the Bill are like the proverbial sledgehammer used to crack a nut. Section 4 of the Bill proposes that <Col N="1962" /> members of the public would need to be protected against visual observance from other members of the public &mdash; I am not clear what visual observance means in this context.  Does it mean that every public office must have totally enclosed rooms before the public can be dealt with?  This requirement would place a huge burden on the bodies referred to in the Bill and I would suggest therefore that the provisions of the Bill would be unworkable.</P>
    <P>I have seen many members of the public transacting business in post offices, building societies, banks and the like and they are not generally interviewed in total privacy.  The public go to the counter and, in most cases, are attended to by the personnel at the counter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill states that in meeting the requirements of this Act the Department or designated body concerned should also have regard to the safety of their own personnel and requirements of security.  Safety and security must, of course, have a priority in any cases where the general public have access to the offices of Government Departments and other bodies.  As Deputies will be aware most public offices are located as far as practicable in secure areas and access is restricted to other parts of the buildings in question. The provisions of this Bill will do nothing to improve the overall situation in this regard.  Indeed, they will increase the problems of security and give rise to further unnecessary costs.  The need for security is obvious particularly in offices dealing with the public and where cash is involved and the personnel involved must be considered also.  Where there is room for improvement I will be happy to help where possible.  Local authorities have made a number of major improvements in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are certain difficulties in areas of greater population.  My own office in O'Connell Bridge House was at one stage handling up to 135,000 applications for grants and there was a steady flow of people into the building for a number of months, but very few complained about not being treated in an appropriate <Col N="1963" /> manner, which goes to show that the staff involved treated all these cases with a very human approach and in a competent manner.</P>
    <P>If the changes proposed in the Bill with regard to accommodation were to be made, it would cost some money.  I must point out also that if each individual were to be interviewed in a private room, irrespective of what was being discussed, I have no doubt it would slow down the processing of applications.</P>
    <P>It would mean also that extra personnel would have to be involved.  I want to assure the House that if any improvements can be made I will see to it that the local authorities and my own Department will make whatever arrangements are necessary to do so, within reason.  In conclusion, I must reject this Bill because it is unnecessary and unworkable but I am pleased this debate is taking place because it gives an opportunity to highlight how Deputies view the matter.  I do not think anyone will disagree with me that many improvements have been made by local authorities and other State agencies throughout the country in recent times and that of course is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few comments on the Bill.  There is not a lot in it and it would not justify a very lengthy contribution.  What is necessary to be said about it could be said in a relatively short space of time.  I do not think the time of the House should be taken up with this type of legislation.  There are much more important issues that we could be discussing, which would be much more beneficial to the population at large.  The Labour Party will be supporting the main thrust of the Bill in the sense that we agree that privacy in public offices should be improved but whether or not legislation to this effect is very practical I have my doubts and I will explain why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would remind the House that there is an embargo on public service recruitment.  In other words, people who retire, are made redundant or take early retirement cannot be replaced except in <Col N="1964" /> very exceptional circumstances.  That has been the case for some considerable time and it looks as if it will continue.</P>
    <P>When talking about improving privacy obviously we would have to talk about improving facilities.  We have to include in that the question of personnel and the manning of an improved service.  I do not think a Bill of this nature can operate effectively without the necessary backup, without improving facilities in employment exchanges, local authority offices, health board offices and FÁS offices.  One example comes to mind.  For about a year there has been no receptionist in the FÁS office in Drogheda because of the embargo.  The FÁS officer, the most highly paid official in the office, has to carry out the function of the receptionist simply because she could not be replaced.  That is the position throughout the public service.  It is laughable that we are talking about improving facilities for the general public while at the same time Dáil Éireann has approved the continuation of the embargo in the public service.  It is a total contradiction. This measure was implemented under the umbrella of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I would remind the Minister and indeed my colleagues in Fine Gael who supported it that that is the position.</P>
    <P>I will just comment on the main problems in relation to privacy in public places.  In local government &mdash; I am a member of two local authorities &mdash; the problem of privacy arises simply because many local authorities are located in very old buildings, buildings that were not built to cope with the type of services that are provided by local authorities.  Most of these buildings date back to the last century or certainly early in this century and very substantial expenditure would be needed to provide the necessary facilities. It is very easy to have privacy in a building such as the county council offices in Portlaoise, a new building which was properly designed and constructed for that purpose, but it is a different matter when we are talking about the old corporation offices throughout the country, many of which have been abandoned for <Col N="1965" /> one reason or other and are now being used as local authority offices.</P>
    <P>We also have to take into consideration the fact that the staff in these offices have worked for many years in deplorable conditions. They have had to suffer from lack of proper heating and lighting and have had to deal with the public under those conditions.  It is true to say, irrespective of what the Minister has just said &mdash; I do not know about his constituency but certainly it is the case in my own constituency and in many others &mdash; that there have been very frequent complaints from local authority offices.  People have to stand at a hatch in the hallway and discuss such matters as rent arrears, the non-payment of mortgages, the fact that the council may be threatening to repossess their houses and non-payment of rates and local service charges which have been proposed and supported by the Dáil.  All these matters are dealt with in the main in the hallways of local authority offices. I know of very few local authorities where you can sit down with an official in private to discuss matters such as these.  Such offices certainly do not exist in the north-east region, as far as I am aware.  Maybe they exist in the Minister's constituency and, if so, I would be very much in favour of extending them to the north-east counties from where I operate.</P>
    <P>As far as planning matters are concerned the same applies.  People are expected to have their planning application discussed in the presence of other people and the possible objections to or support of their planning application may be known to those who are passing through or standing around.  We do not need legislation to improve that.  We need a county manager or a town or county engineer to make the necessary decisions to improve the facilities in which the staff operate and in which the general public are seen.  To do that the local authority need to have money.  There is no point in the Minister saying that facilities will be improved without providing the money. At the moment in local authorities there is not enough money to pay for the filling of potholes in the country roads, the national primary roads and the national <Col N="1966" /> secondary roads.  Money is being cut back at the rate of millions of pounds in each local authority.  In those circumstances it is ludicrous to talk about improving the facilities for the general public.  If the local authorities are provided with the funds to improve the roads and the footpaths and to provide sewerage and water schemes where they are needed, we can then talk about improving facilities in public offices for the public.  Let us get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the principle of improving facilities but only on the basis that the Bill would provide some mechanism for financing the improvement.  Far too much legislation is enacted here which ends up on the shelf in Government Departments because there is not enough money to put it into operation. Any local authority will tell us that.  There are a number of other Government Bills coming on-stream which will end up in the same way.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector are paying more than their fair share.  Yet in the tax offices throughout Dublin where most of them are located, people have to queue ten deep to receive attention and everybody and anybody can listen to the discussion that takes place between the official and the person with the problem whether it relates to filling in an application form or querying an application form.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity to provide appropriate facilities in that area. Most of the facilities in that area are relatively new.  Many of the offices were rented at expensive rates, quite recently, yet no arrangements were made to provide proper facilities for the general public.  I went into one such office recently where one could not even get to a toilet.  One had to go down two floors to get to a toilet.  Recent Governments had absolute control over this situation. They could have insisted on proper design and proper facilities for the general public before they paid out millions of pounds to private companies and individuals for rent.  They did not do that. Are we now to reconstruct and renovate buildings owned by private companies? <Col N="1967" /> We cannot do that.  We cannot reconstruct buildings which do not belong to Government Departments; and the vast bulk of the tax offices are accommodated in rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>We are all very familiar with social welfare offices.  How would this Bill deal with the situation in a village in rural Ireland where the people have to go to the local Garda station to sign on every week and where they are interviewed by officials from the Department when there is an investigation, for instance, about working and signing on which is happening all over the place now?  Most of these Garda stations where such interviews take place are old buildings with no real facilities.  The people have to sign on at a certain time as the stations are not open eight hours a day to enable people in rural areas to sign on.  All the social welfare business undertaken in these stations is dealt with in the open and people in the Garda station can hear what is being said.  Under this Bill are we to reconstruct every Garda barracks in every rural area?  That would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Desmond was Minister he provided additional finance to improve the facilities in Dundalk.  The facilities, improved though they were, can no longer cope with the number of people who are unemployed so that the office must pay out, four days out of five a week.  It is no longer possible to facilitate the signing on and paying of people on one day.  They must do that on four days, with eight different sessions in one week.  How then does one cope with every person with a query or how does one cope when the official has a query? Are all these people to be taken into the back room and interviewed?  That is not very practical especially when one takes into consideration the fact that some people are waiting and watching every day of the week with the intention of robbing social welfare offices, post offices, or barracks.  We must also consider the security and the lives of the staff and the people who must guard them, the Garda and security workers.  What <Col N="1968" /> does one do if there are queries relating to ten or 15 people?  Should there be ten different rooms in use on a morning when there are 1,000 people waiting outside to be paid?  That is not very practical either.</P>
    <P>The only way the problem can be solved is by a gradual improvement in the facilities available in social welfare offices.  I am satisfied that the facilities are disgraceful and that an improvement is warranted, but we cannot legislate for it.  The Department should provide better facilities but in practical terms that improvement cannot be achieved at the moment because of the construction of the buildings.  The only way to achieve improvement is to extend the buildings, reconstruct them or replace them.  Many of the old labour exchanges were rented out by private individuals and we do not have the right to interfere with them. Offices owned by the Department and managed at local level would need to be totally replaced in many cases.  At the moment people have to queue up out on the street in the middle of winter.  I have seen this throughout the country.  It is ridiculous for the Minister to talk about the facilities being improved.  They have not been improved in general.  They are still Stone Age facilities as far as the general public and the bulk of social welfare recipients are concerned.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies in post offices.  The queues at the post offices for children's allowances, for old age pensions, for invalidity pensions and all sorts of pensions collected in post offices, are half way down the street on the mornings they are paid.  There is not room to cope with the queues.  The only institutions that provide the privacy we would all like to see are the financial institutions.  You never have any problem with privacy in a bank.  They can spend money to provide the necessary facilities.  Because they are in competition with each other, if they do not provide proper facilities their customers will go to the bank down the street where the facilities are provided.  People do not want to discuss their business &mdash; loans, repayments, arrears, etc. &mdash; in public.  Therefore, the banks have <Col N="1969" /> devised a more efficient way of conducting business.  Perhaps the Department of Social Welfare, or the Department of Health, which is represented in the Chamber by the Minister of State, should follow their example.</P>
    <P>Can anyone name one health board clinic where you can have privacy?  Privacy, my foot, even in the most modern clinic in my county, people are herded like cattle, left sitting on stools in the hallway, right out to the front door, and there are no facilities for children, nor in many cases, for the staff.  However, I do not think we can legislate against that. To provide proper facilities we would have to replace most of the health centres in every county, and to do that we would have to provide money.  While I and the Labour Party support the idea of legislating for privacy in public offices, who will provide the money to achieve the aims of the Bill and provide proper facilities?</P>
    <P>In other public offices, for example the ESB, social welfare recipients have to explain why they cannot pay their bill. While they explain their position everybody in the shop can hear the discussion. The ESB should not be allowed to get away with this because they would quickly cut off the electricity supply if a person cannot pay his bill.  There may be a little sympathy for these people, but generally speaking if a person does not pay his bill his electricity supply will be disconnected.  In fairness, I believe such an organisation should be obliged to provide the proper facilities for the general public.  A person's telephone will be disconnected if he does not pay his bill.  If you get a final notice or an arrears notice and you do not pay, suddenly you will find that your phone is dead.  Yet, Telecom staff deal with queries in public.  My point is that many organisations which have a multi-million pound turnover should be forced to provide the proper facilities for the general public, but we should not try to legislate for privacy for local authorities, health boards, social welfare offices and Garda stations.</P>
    <P>For the past six years I have been trying <Col N="1970" /> to get the various Administrations to provide a Garda station in Drogheda to replace a building which has been standing for 200 years and which is totally unsuitable for the Garda and the general public who visit it, never mind the poor unfortunates who have to be locked up there from time to time.  However, we have been unable to get that facility, and there is no sign of it coming.  No matter what you would do with this 200 year old building, you will not have privacy because it would need to be replaced before you would have any semblance of privacy.  I do not think that this can be incorporated into a Bill.  I believe it will depend on individual Ministers to provide the money in their budgets &mdash; be it social welfare, the environment or whatever &mdash; for proper facilities for the staff and general public.</P>
    <P>As I have said in my opening remarks, we agree with the idea that there should be improved facilities across the board for the general public, but I do not think we can legislate for that.  Even if we do succeed in getting the Bill through, it can only be implemented if the Government of the day have the will to do so and provide the necessary funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Having listened to various speakers last evening and this evening decrying some aspects on the grounds of cost, I feel that the case made by the Deputies who have spoken indicated that they had a clear and adequate understanding of the necessity for the Bill.  They all recognised that privacy is something that the public, the taxpayer, every citizen, is entitled to when discussing their problems.  Everyone who spoke has admitted, in one way or another, that there is a need for a greater degree of privacy than exists at present in <Col N="1971" /> public offices be it the ESB, employment exchanges or whatever.</P>
      <P>Much time has been given to the possible prohibitive costs.  I submit that modern shop fitting has been developed to such an extent that it is possible to very effectively carry out minor alterations in various offices up and down the country which would provide much more privacy. Let us face it, no member of the public wants to go into a public office and discuss his personal problems in front of a long queue.  That is a throwback from colonial times when a person sat at a table in the market square and a long queue tailed around the corner.  The people in the queue were able to hear quite distinctly what was being discussed by the first person in the queue and they were able to titillate their imaginations with all the information they could glean from such encounters.</P>
      <P>There have been numberous instances &mdash; although not in recent times, but over the past ten years &mdash; where people were able to glean information in employment exchanges, for example where they were able to hear social welfare numbers or PRSI numbers etc, and in a couple of cases were able to devise a system whereby they could cash other people's cheques.  That should never happen.  I am not blaming the officers involved because they could do nothing about it.  It is a fact of life that people queued in such a manner that it was impossible for the person talking to the official to be able to carry on their business even in semi-privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothwithstanding the costs referred to by other speakers, I was very disappointed that Government speakers, in particular, saw fit to denigrate the motives behind the introduction of the Bill.  Surely as public representatives they must recognise that the one thing the public like is a little bit of privacy.  After all they pay well for it.  When the general public deal with public officials surely they have already paid for the privilege of privacy and of having their case dealt with in such a fashion that nobody can overhear them, that their business cannot <Col N="1972" /> be discussed outside and, in some cases, with beneficial effects to unwanted listeners.</P>
    <P>I would have to point out that people differ.  There are many people who by nature are timid and who find it difficult enough to pick up a telephone to discuss their business with an official in a public office or in a private office for that matter. In many cases people have to deal with an official through a grill on a counter or through a hatch on what appears to be a wall &mdash; which is a disgraceful way to deal with the public &mdash; and be interrogated, not because the person on the other side of the hatch is unnecessarily inquisitive or aggressive but because they need to obtain certain information.  There is a tendency for someone who is under pressure with little time to obtain information to ask questions quickly.  In this event some people will lose their nerve while others will break down.  People who are nervous and timid will often refuse to even await interrogation in a semi-public office where everybody can hear their business.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the points made by Deputy Bell.  Let us take the case of a deserted wife or single parent awaiting a social welfare cheque who goes along to the local health board clinic.  They may be fortunate enough to have their query dealt with in a private or semi-private interview room.  On the other hand it is possible that they may have to have their problem dealt with in the presence of up to a dozen people who can hear their business.  At the very time they want most noise to be made in order to have some privacy silence descends on the place with the result that everyone knows their business. This can be very intimidating and a source of some annoyance for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why some speakers on the opposite side of the House regard the Bill as mischievous and say it will lead to unnecessary demands being made. Having paid for a service a person has the right to have his or her query dealt with in private.  Some speakers said there is no need to introduce legislation to deal with this matter.  If that is the case why <Col N="1973" /> have we not improved things far more than we have done during the past ten to 20 years?  I accept that many public buildings are old and it is not possible to provide private or semi-private interview rooms.  For that reason there would be no harm in introducing legislation.  The cost of providing these facilities &mdash; to which I have already referred &mdash; is not prohibitive if we take into account the cost of acquiring new public offices.  I am aware that greater care is now taken to ensure that some thought is given to this matter.  Nonetheless shopfitters are capable of coming up with a suitable design.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the local authorities.  As a member of a local authority, as I am sure most Members of this House are, I have to say that they are much maligned organisations and have to put up with much abuse, hardship and misunderstandings.  Very often they do not have the facilities which are both desirable and necessary.</P>
    <P>In recent times, however, they have begun to realise that there is a necessity to discuss a person's loan arrears or rates arrears in some kind of inner sanctum, a bit like the inner sanctium in a bank.  If you see a person going into the inner sanctum in a bank you know it can be for only one of two things.  It is possible that the manager wants to extend his hand and welcome a person, or it is possible that he is being called in, as all of the onlookers and people in the queue well know, not to bid the time of day or to raise a toast but rather for a grilling in the grill room as it is known in some places.  On coming out half an hour to 45 minutes later having been grilled, the other people waiting in the queue will know quite well that that unfortunate person has been put through the wringer. Any person who is in any way halfhearted having looked at the expression on that person's face will immediately turn and go home instead of going through the same process.  We do not need a dual system but rather a system whereby each person receives equal treatment and a private audience for the want of a better term.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond our capabilities to <Col N="1974" /> design something like that.  I do not think it is unreasonable in this day and age for people to demand that their queries should be dealt with in private.  It is true that banks probably have a vested interest in providing private facilities but this is only a recent development.  There is much room for improvement and a need to provide cubicles along counters. While there are people who may be described as timid and others who mind their own business, there is another breed of people who love to glean information that is not theirs by right, who love to crane their necks to look over someone's shoulder to find out that vital piece of information, the bottom figure, the last sentence, for their own private titillation. Incidentally, the airports and banks have devised a system whereby one walks into a roped off area before being called.  The problem with this system is that if one observes the rules and remains where one should remain until called, it is quite possible that someone could walk in and go right to the head of the queue and have no difficulty whatsoever.  It is also possible that a second or third person will do likewise.  I always think that someone feels a little bit stupid standing in a queue which ends in the middle of a room.  To my mind it would be far better if an area was screened off where people could wait before being called.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to employment exchanges.  There is no better time than the present to carry out the necessary improvements in employment exchanges.  The facilities in many employment exchanges are totally inadequate to cater for even the smallest of crowds and totally inadequate to cater for the kind of numbers who now have to go to employment exchanges on a weekly basis.  It is not possible to deal with people in private.  For that reason there is an onus on us to provide decent employment exchanges and in doing so to avail of the opportunity to ensure that private interview rooms are provided so that the people who must use them on a daily basis can have some degree of privacy.</P>
    <P>The same applies to our income tax <Col N="1975" /> offices.  I accept that considerable improvements have been made in some of the new offices and I welcome them. However, in many of the old offices people queueing for attention can hear the conversations between officials and members of the public.  I am not saying that those people make an effort to listen to those conversations but, because of their close proximity to the official and the member of the public, they cannot avoid hearing what is taking place.  They can glean quite an amount of information from those conversations.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to visual observation and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, wondered what that meant.  I do not know what the draftsman had in mind when preparing that section but I have a good idea what he was thinking of.  Close observation of an individual consulting an official at a counter can give people a considerable amount of entertainment. They get that entertainment from the expressions on the face of the person being interviewed, depending on the problem he or she has, and the reception he or she receives from the official.  Eye contact with other members of the public can be very embarrassing for people being interviewed by officials about a private matter.  Obviously, people will be embarrassed if during the course of such an interview they make eye contact with other people in the queue.</P>
    <P>Members have suggested that the implementation of the provisions of the Bill would pose a security problem.  I do not accept that.  Security problems will arise regardless of whether the public are dealt with in public or private.  The fact that there is a queue of 30 or 40 people waiting to be interviewed by an official does not mean that the official can feel secure or that the officials behind him are more secure.  It does not mean that the money they may be in charge of is more secure.  As has been illustrated in the banks it is easy to provide a high degree of security while at the same time giving a reasonable degree of privacy to the public.  We should strive towards those <Col N="1976" /> objectives rather than be negative about our approach to this problem.  We should not hark back to the olden times and insist on maintaining the old system.  In those days people were not that interested in the business of their neighbours. Certainly, they respected the fact that their neighbour required privacy when dealing with officials.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of a person seeking supplementary welfare benefit. That individual must make an application to the local health centre and then may have to pay a number of visits to that centre.  He or she may be involved in a series of question sessions to prove eligibility. I do not propose to comment on the type of questions put to those people or the extent to which some officials are prepared to go to satisfy themselves as to the eligibility of applicants; that is a matter for another debate.  If applicants cannot meet officials in a private room they will not be in a position to discuss their business in an any open way.  I cannot understand how such people could tell the truth, because the truth may be embarrassing for them.  An unfortunate person may have an embarassing fact to reveal which may be crucial in determining his or her eligibility to a benefit. That person should not have to disclose that information in front of people.  It is demeaning if people are subject to such embarrassment.</P>
    <P>All our citizens should be equal in the eyes of the State although I wonder on occasions if they are.  Under our Constitution all children of the nation should be cherished equally but I do not think they are.  Regardless of whether a person is rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate, that person should be treated with respect and a degree of dignity when he or she seeks advice or information on their entitlements in a public office.  They should be permitted to conduct their business in absolute privacy.  If we do not provide them with those meagre facilities it is a sad state as we approach the end of the twentieth century.  I do not think we have progressed in regard to these matters.</P>

      <P>There is a need for these provisions which will help to concentrate the minds of those who have control over public offices on the need to provide proper facilities for interviews with members of the public.  The cost involved will not be colossal but the public have a right to the facilities called for in the Bill. As legislators we have an obligation to provide the public with these desirable facilities.  I appeal to Members on the Government side to reconsider their attitude to the Bill and recognise that those who must go to public offices daily will have greater regard for them, and for the House, if they see that we are united in our desire to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Durkan for sharing his time with me and to thank the Chair for his generosity in giving me one extra minute.  I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  All human beings are entitled to be treated with dignity, care, consideration and compassion in any democratic society. We cannot bring any wealth, property or possessions with us when we depart from this world but while we are here we can do a lot to create a democratic, civilised <Col N="1978" /> and caring society.  That is what politics should be about.  We should do what we can to break down barriers and distinctions between people.  We should treat all people fairly and equally.  We should apply legal and social justice to every person, young and old, men and women, the employed and unemployed. This is what democracy is all about.</P>
      <P>Sadly there is often a big gap between the ideal and the reality and we as public representatives are in a good position to know all about this reality because we visit all kinds of public offices every week in the course of our constituency work. Unfortunately, the old poor law mentality and attitude is conveyed in much of our social welfare and health legislation. More than 35 per cent of our population are in receipt of social welfare payments &mdash; this figure does not include farmers and business people who receive grants of all kinds &mdash; and about 17 per cent of all households are totally dependent on social welfare to survive.  All too often we treat these recipients in far too narrow and selective a manner.  The buildings those recipients are forced to use tell their own unfortunate story.</P>
      <P>Far too many of our employment exchanges, health clinics, social welfare and community welfare offices, housing departments and other such public offices are shabby, seedy and generally run down in appearance.  They are also badly designed.  When they were being fitted out little consideration was given to individual privacy, dignity and comfort.  By allowing the unemployed, the sick and other members of the public to use these buildings in their present condition we are showing them contempt rather than respect and dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One shameful example of this is the Limerick employment exchange in Upper Cecil Street.  This is one of the worst exchanges of its kind in Limerick and is a dreadful spectacle to behold.  It is an old Victorian building which has long outlived its usefulness as a public office; it is nothing more than a large hovel.  Every week long queues of people are forced to suffer unnecessarily and little or no dignity or privacy is available <Col N="1979" /> to people who have to use that office, or for that matter the staff who are forced to work in the building.  The staff have protested a number of times during the past five years at the state of the building and indeed have taken industrial action on a number of occasions but to no avail.</P>
    <P>During the last five years successive Governments have promised to provide a new employment exchange in Limerick but so far this exchange has not materialised. I appeal to the Minister in the House tonight to come to Limerick during the summer recess to inspect this Dickensian building and the shameful conditions which exist there.  The Minister's father worked in Limerick for a long number of years and fortunately for him he did not have to use the building I have referred to during his time there. That building is a disgrace to our city and the sooner it is closed down as an employment exchange the better.  I appeal to the Minister to do this immediately so as to relieve the suffering and hardship being experienced by the people in Limerick who have to use that employment exchange.</P>
    <P>Our unemployed and the public generally deserve improved facilities in public offices.  If we improve and upgrade the present facilities I believe the public will respond to the improvements in an appreciative and positive way.  Of course, there will always be a small number of people who will behave in an anti-social way and abuse the new improved facilities but so far as I am concerned it would be the politics of despair if we allowed a small minority to dictate how a majority of people should be treated in this respect.</P>
    <P>This principle should also apply across the board to all sections of the Department of Social Welfare, health boards, local authorities, ESB offices, post offices, Telecom Éireann offices, etc.  In the course of his contribution Deputy Durkan referred to the new arrangements in post offices throughout the country where green ropes are strung around making the offices look like snakes' nests.  Old people in particular <Col N="1980" /> are confused by these new arrangements. Deputy Durkan was quite right to make that point.  I do not know who decided on the use of these ropes but they are confusing for many old people who go into post offices to draw their old age pensions and transact other business. Sometimes these people's eyesight is not the best.  They are frail and feeble and they cause confusion by going to the head of the queue instead of to the end of it. Even young people are confused sometimes by the labyrinth of ropes.  It should be possible to devise a more civilised and efficient way of dealing with the public in those offices.</P>
    <P>Apart from improving and upgrading these facilities unemployed people are entitled to better treatment in other areas of life also.  There is no good reason that the unemployed should not be allowed undertake full time educational courses while continuing to draw unemployment benefit or assistance.  I must say that the Department of Social Welfare have allowed unemployed people in Limerick to undertake two pilot courses in order to continue their education.  I applaud and welcome that initiative but it should be extended to the entire country.  The courses should also be extended to cover subjects such as English literature, history, the study of languages and other such subjects.  There is no reason we should not treat our unemployed in a dignified way.  Education in that respect is no load; it is useful, will enhance their chances of getting employment and also enrich their lives.  However, we do not have that broad a concept of education, and more is the pity.</P>
    <P>In the matter of providing privacy and dignity for our unemployed and the public generally we can learn a lot from other countries such as Sweden and the Scandinavian countries.  Some of these societies may be post-Christian but in terms of their Christian injunction to &ldquo;love thy neighbour as thyself&rdquo; we can learn a lot from them.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Minister.  To be unemployed and sick is bad enough but to humiliate people and to rob them of their privacy and dignity is to add insult to injury and, without taking it too far, to rub salt into their wounds.  Going to an employment exchange for the first time can often be a traumatic, searing and lasting experience which can stay with one in an endurable way to the end of one's life.  We in this House must do all we can to ensure that all our citizens are treated with dignity, and given privacy and care.  For this reason I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to confer a statutory right on any person, who has cause to engage in business of a personal, private, or confidential nature at any office covered by the Bill, to insist on such a discussion being held in a way which protects not merely against overhearing, but also against visual observation by other members of the public. While very few people would disagree with the general purpose behind the proposal the question arises as to whether it is necessary or indeed practicable to have legislation giving effect to this intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point that the intention behind this Bill is already being met in practice is so far as is reasonably possible. There may, no doubt, be some difficulties particularly in small local offices in providing facilities for confidential interviews but legislation is not going to solve this.  In the long run it boils down to the goodwill and the common sense of the official or officials involved in the interview, and this is certainly not a matter which can be legislated for.  In fact in the circumstances the Opposition should withdraw the Bill.  It is absolutely unnecessary and I am rather <Col N="1982" /> surprised that a Bill has been put forward as opposed to a motion which would be a form of recommendation to State and semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill would also give rise to honest differences of interpretation as to what is or is not of a personal, private or confidential nature.  While the Bill proposes that guidelines be drawn up by the Minister for Finance I cannot envisage how such guidelines can include a definition of what is a &ldquo;personal, private or confidential matter&rdquo;.  As I have said already, it must be left to the good sense of the officials to take whatever steps are practical to ensure that interviews on matters of such a nature are conducted as discreetly and successfully as possible.</P>
    <P>I have many reservations about whether it is practical to legislate against visual observation by other members of the public.  While it may be possible to protect against visual observation while an interview is in progress, it is not possible to protect against visual observation of the location in which such interview is being held.  A doctor's waiting room is one example.</P>
    <P>Coming to my own area, that of health, I should say the services provided under the Health Acts are wide in scope covering, at some time or another, every citizen of the State through the seven ages of man from infancy to old age.  Some matters concern income maintenance schemes administered by health board officials; others are concerned with eligibility for medical services; while others still concern medical or social problems, many of which require urgent attention.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department are concerned, the office of the General Register of Births, Marriages and Deaths is the principal office at which members of the public attend for services which are located at Joyce House.  The main requests are for copies of birth, death or marriage certificates.  These services are dealt with at public counters and, in the main, are of a routine but not confidential nature.  At certain times throughout the year there will be a considerable queue of people waiting to obtain these certificates. If each applicant had to be <Col N="1983" /> received in a private office it would delay the process quite considerably. However, there are occasions when requests of a confidential or sensitive nature arise, particularly in relation to birth certificates for children of unmarried persons and marriage certificates, but facilities are available for private discussion. Officials of my Department are always willing and available to provide such facilities when required to do so.</P>
    <P>Similarly in relation to the Department in general, any confidential matters a caller to the Department may wish to discuss &mdash; whether by way of complaint or otherwise &mdash; may be discussed with an official in complete privacy.  As the House will be aware, the offices of the Department have been amalgamated in one building, that is, Hawkins House. Indeed, I recall that there was some criticism of the amount of expenditure incurred in adapting the relevant floors in Hawkins House in order to accommodate the Department.  I make the point that a not inconsiderable proportion of that expenditure was necessitated by the provision of the type of facilities envisaged in this Bill.  I refer in particular to the accommodation for the Adoption Board which, while not part of the Department, nevertheless comes within their aegis, is accommodated in Hawkins House also and had particular requirements for privacy and confidentiality which have been met.</P>
    <P>Going further afield to the health agencies, It must be accepted that health boards with offices located throughout the country deal with the vast bulk of callers concerned with medical or social matters administered by those boards.  It is accepted that many of these matters are of a private, personal and confidential nature ranging, as they do, from eligibility for services to supplementary welfare allowances, physical and mental health problems, the boarding out of children, child abuse, substance abuse and numerous other medical and social problems.  Business which might be termed of a routine nature with members of the public arising from the foregoing <Col N="1984" /> are dealt with at public counters or hatches, but facilities are available for dealing with matters of a sensitive or confidential nature.  I have never yet received a complaint from a member of the public or a constituent with regard to lack of sensitivity on the part of health board officials in relation to private or confidential matters they had wished to discuss with them.  I would be very surprised if such a problem arose.</P>
    <P>My Department are satisfied that the existing arrangements for dealing with such confidential matters are adequate. It must be appreciated that, having regard to the large number of places of different types &mdash; ranging from hospitals to local offices, to health centres and so on &mdash; at which health services are administered and discussions held with members of the public, it would be impossible to implement a rigid, statutory approach as to what measures should be taken when dealing with discussions of a confidential or private nature.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, in the long run it boils down to the common sense of the officials involved.  In this context I might refer to section 4 (2) of the Bill which I regard as extremely vague and wide open to misinterpretation.  For example, it is proposed that it should be left to the discretion of the public officials concerned to determine what is and what is not routine.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I do not see anything in the proposed Bill to deal with failure to comply with its provisions.  The only regulations mentioned in the Bill are for the purpose of providing appeals by individuals in relation to its provisions.  It is not possible to implement such totally unnecessary provisions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also at the proposal contained in section 2 (2) of the Bill that the provisions of the Bill may be extended, by order, to include offices run by private organisations but providing a public service.  Presumably the voluntary organisations providing health or health-related services would fall into that category. They would include the voluntary hospital, organisations for mentally <Col N="1985" /> handicapped and physically handicapped, for various social services and so on.  While we provide extensive funding for such agencies, in so far as possible we are anxious to avoid overloading them with bureaucratic administrative procedures. In common with the statutory health agencies it is safe to say that these voluntary organisations conduct their client-patient interviewing in accordance with the best confidentiality criteria.  I might add also that Deputies themselves in conducting clinics in their constituencies may encounter grave difficulty in complying with the provisions of this Bill.  With all the facilities available in their constituency offices it may still be found difficult to provide facilities that would afford 100 per cent privacy or confidentiality. Of course the provisions of the Bill would have to be extended to such offices also and I do not believe they could comply with the regulations thereunder.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements obtaining within the health area for dealing with confidential matters are adequate.  Because of that and bearing in mind the cumbersome, time-consuming procedures proposed in this Bill &mdash; not to mention the considerable expenditure which may be involved &mdash; I am firmly of the opinion that a statutory framework to govern such matters is not warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputies generally voiced the request that, where possible, officials dealing with the general public should provide private accommodation whenever confidential matters are being discussed.  We would all support that principle.  The point was made also by Deputies on the other side of the House with particular relevance to financial institutions.  We are aware that the facilities available in banking institutions are of a semi-private, confidential nature.  Some institutions are now taking the person to person approach, removing counters and providing desks at which officials can sit down with their clients to discuss confidential matters.  However, the fact is that the public are more anxious to get on with their business and have a free movement of people through the banking <Col N="1986" /> institutions.  I do not think they would be very favourably disposed towards the provisions of a Bill which would in any way delay that procedure.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the debate Deputy Barnes suggested that in public offices the public should be dealt with by senior officials, mature people with a sense of wisdom, compassion and experience of life, that the burden of dealing with people in a distressed state should not lie on the shoulders of young, inexperienced and unskilled junior clerical staff.  The Deputy also suggested that skilled staff should be available to deal with angry or frustrated callers.  The general position in public offices is that members of the public are dealt with by front line junior officials but if necessary senior staff are always on hand and available for consultation. It would be impractical to have an arrangement whereby senior staff should deal with all cases, many of which will be straightforward and well within the competence of junior officials.</P>
    <P>In May 1986 the then Department of the Public Service issued guidelines to all Departments on the selection and training of staff in public offices.  Those guidelines are still in force.  Among other things they require Departments to ensure that staff on public office duties have a thorough understanding of the work about which queries are raised.  They are trained in all aspects of customer relations and services before taking up duty.  Indeed, one aspect of that request at the time was that officials should provide their names to members of the public who would not have to deal with a person at the end of a telephone but a named person at the end of a telephone.  I am very happy that that was brought in at that time.</P>
    <P>In my Department, the Department of Health, I would be totally in favour of all officials providing their names to the caller so that the person can return a call to them and have the call dealt with by that person.  As public representatives we always consider it useful to be able to contact a person in a Department with whom we can communicate and who will <Col N="1987" /> know the issue so that we do not have to repeat the problem.</P>
    <P>A useful debate is taking place so far as the facilities are concerned.  In the circumstances it would be advisable that the Bill should be withdrawn to allow it to filter through the public service that the Dáil recommends to public servants that they would provide facilities.</P>

As I understand the VAT Act from memory, a barrister is only deemed to have supplied a service when he is paid for the actual service.  I think the Minister will find, through his advisers, that this is correct.  There is a special arrangement for barristers they are only deemed to have supplied a service when, in fact, they are paid for the service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the mere fact that you are indemnified will mean that the barrister is deemed to have supplied the service whereas at present the general rule for barristers is that they are only deemed to have supplied the service when they are paid for it.  I think the draftsman may have damnified the poor barristers slightly because at present a barrister is not deemed to have supplied a service until such time as he is paid for it.  This section says that his services have been deemed to have been supplied to and <Col N="1991" /> received by a person when he is indemnified under the policy of insurance. Before he pays the barrister, the barrister's services are deemed to have been supplied and received.  I wonder whether that changes the barrister's position.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 52, before section 50, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;50.&mdash;That section 8 of the Principal Act (Value-Added Tax Act, 1972) is amended as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  in subsection (3) (inserted by the Act of 1978)&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  in paragraph (b) (inserted by the Act of 1982, as amended by the Act of 1983) by the substitution of `£25,000' for `£12,000',</P>
      <P>(ii)  in paragraph (c) (inserted by the Act of 1981, as amended by the Act of 1983) by the substitution of `£50,000' for `£25,000', and</P>
      <P>(iii)  in paragraph (e) (inserted by the Act of 1981, as amended by the Act of 1983) by the substitution of `£25,000' for `£12,000', </P>
      <P>(b)  in subsection (3A) (inserted by the Act of 1982, as amended by the Act of 1983) by the substitution of `£25,000' for `£12,000'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment to explore the possibility that the Minister might be willing to raise the VAT thresholds on <Col N="1993" /> small businesses.  I am suggesting, effectively, slightly more than a doubling of the thresholds.  If a self-employed person engaged in something like hanging curtains at the moment has a turnover in excess of £1,000 a month he becomes subject to 25 per cent VAT.  At that level of activity the temptation is not to be legitimate but to be in the black economy. Nobody can carry that kind of tax imposition if competing at the same time with people who are in the black economy and not in the VAT net.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made now on the grounds of competition between legitimate traders and traders in the black economy.  We should raise the thresholds to see if, by doing so, we could get more activity going in the first instance.  Secondly, we should have a clear cut-off point between the black economy and people who are registered for VAT.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  I do not know the cost of the proposal but I am sure the Minister has that to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Noonan said in this regard.  For his information, our thresholds, together with those in the United Kingdom, are far higher than those in any of the member states of the EC.  The level of our thresholds is not viewed with favour by our fellow member states.  Back in 1983, the Coalition Government reduced the thresholds.  Obviously, they must have taken the view at that time that the thresholds were out of line.  Has the Deputy reason to believe that the situation has reversed, that we should think in terms of increasing them again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It would increase activity.  It would encourage people to be self-employed.  People who are now in the black economy would be legitimised.  By taking them out of the VAT net completely, at least they might be subject to PRSI on the one hand if self-employed and on the other hand to returning their income tax properly.  It is not all one way traffic.  There is the problem, especially in certain areas where services are provided, that it is impossible for somebody with a small turnover to be legitimate because if he is legitimate he cannot compete.</P>
      <P>Increasingly people at low levels of activity are being driven into the black economy.  Once they are in the black economy, everything is hidden.  They just disappear off all books.  The imposition of VAT at low thresholds makes them uncompetitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> their colleagues in the black economy.  There is an advantage in raising the threshold, legitimising the activity, removing the VAT imposition and then allowing people to make proper tax returns as self-employed people would do on the basis of self-assessment and make proper returns of PRSI at the ultimate rate of 5 per cent which was introduced last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate what the number of taxpayers in this band between £12,000 and £25,000 actually would be?  If it is £3 million and we were talking about spending £1,000 to collect £1, it must require a great deal of supervision if there are many people in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000, but not necessarily everybody would take advantage of it no matter what was done.  It is something in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are 7,000 to 10,000 people in that area and they are producing £3 million, it follows that their total yield is about £500 each per annum <Col N="1995" /> or thereabouts, on average.  This is very small beer from the point of view of the administration involved on their side and on the Revenue side in chasing that kind of money.  That is in favour of Deputy Noonan's point.</P>
      <P>Against it, I would be worried that he may, in fact, be increasing the pressure on the black economy.  I am not going to single out any area of the economy.  If the Government say that the threshold is to be £25,000 for a house painter or a barrister, you can actually live on an income which is below the threshold. Once people are in the position that they can say effectively to their inspector of taxes that they earn £23,000, or whatever, as their gross turnover in the year, that their profit is half that and that they can live on that, it is very hard to detect evasion.  Some people will say they are under the limit.  They compete on unequal terms, I find, with people who are respecting the limit and being honest about it.  By raising the threshold you give people grounds for contending that they do not have a turnover subject to VAT. The net result is that there is more evasion. From my own experience of VAT, I would be against the proposal because it would lead to more evasion rather than to less.</P>
      <P>If it is £500 a head, it may cost the Revenue more to collect this money than it is worth.  I imagine that VAT compliance for anybody in terms of their time at around £12,000 to £25,000 would cost about £500 per annum.  You would have to have somebody doing your books or spend much of your own time at that level.  There would be people in the Revenue Commissioners' office opening files on you, sending out forms, chasing you up.  For £500, is it really worth it?  Deputy Noonan's point, on a practical level in terms of money received, has a good deal of merit about it but I am afraid that it might actually increase evasion if the thresholds were raised.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am talking effectivley about one man or one woman operation in the service industry <Col N="1996" /> where most of the activity in the black economy is at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;because he would not be registered for VAT he saves £1,000 a month.  If he has to register and has to pay 25 per cent, he is going to sell the same service now at £15,000 a year to his customers where previously he was selling at £12,000.  That makes him uncompetitive.  Because he would not be trading in the material anyway, he is going out purchasing the material, he would not have a claim back. I am talking in particular about small service industries where there is a very small input of purchased materials but where the major cost is the labour of the serviceman.  In those circumstances there is a case to be made for lifting the thresholds along the lines of the Minister's argument yesterday that it does not make much sense to spend £100 to go after £1. There could be other advantages on the employment side by raising the thresholds. At the moment people in the kind of case I have described are being forced into the black economy and forced to be in it because so many others are in it that they are uncompetitive if they are registered for VAT.  At least you take a burden off the Revenue Commissioners once more.  The tax foregone seems quite small.  I am not categoric about doubling the allowances if you go up to £5,000 or £6,000.  I would like the Minister to explore the merits of this suggestion.</P>

Of course the boys really in the black economy are those in those small businesses who just pay nobody.  The real tax advantage to them is if they are not caught.  The other move in relation to annual accounting is a move towards better management.  I will consider the approach the Deputy is taking with increases less than he mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the rate of VAT on electricity.  It has the effect that electricity distributed in certain circumstances attracts the 25 per <Col N="2000" /> cent VAT rate and not the 5 per cent rate which applies to electricity generally.</P>
      <P>The amendment is necessary because of a recent Circuit Court decision that the activities of a particular company who relay television and radio signals to their subscribers constitute the supply of electricity.</P>
      <P>Electricity was charged to VAT at 5 per cent with effect from 1 March 1988. Prior to that, from 1975, it was zero-rated. In adopting the zero rate, and in introducing a 5 per cent rate on electricity in 1988, the intention was that those rates should apply to supplies of the kind made by the Electricity Supply Board, that is at a level and strength which would provide power for normal industrial, commercial and domestic use.  Accordingly, there was never the intention that activities, such as the relay of television and radio signals, in connection with which a minuscule amount of electricity is distributed, should benefit from the application to electricity of the zero rate up to March 1988.</P>
      <P>The amendment confirms that intention by excluding from the application of the 5 per cent the distribution of electricity in connection with the distribution of communications signals, as mentioned, television and radio signals and also computer networks.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 46:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> In page 52, line 5, to delete &ldquo;2&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2.6&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 is to increase the level of rebate of VAT to unregistered farmers.  The compensatory rate of credit allowed to taxable persons purchasing agricultural products or agricultural services from unregistered farmers is proposed to be increased in the section from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent with effect from 1 March 1989, which merely confirms Financial Resolution No. 7 of the budget. Last year the credit was reduced from 1.7 per cent to 1.4 per cent to penalise farmers for the non-payment of arrears of tax and tax related levies.  Since then self assessment has been introduced and become operable.</P>
    <P>The amnesty has got the tax affairs of most of the agricultural community up to date.  The amnesty also applied to the levies and the backlog was substantially cleared.  When the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy MacSharry, reduced the rebate from 1.7 per cent to 1.4 per cent he tied it to the issue of non-payment of arrears of tax-related levies. The levy position has improved significantly and has been eliminated as a serious problem in so far as it relates to the farming community.  The rate should therefore be brought back to 2.6 per cent, as independent assessors have indicated, rather than 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Farmers who are unregistered are still being penalised and are not getting the full rebate to which they are entitled because of the penalty approach adopted by the former Minister.  The situation has righted itself and it should be restored. People are being affected by this provision whose levy payments have always been up to date, but they are being penalised for the faults of their neighbours.  It is peculiar that a person whose affairs are in order should be penalised on account of his neighbour down the road or in another county.  I strongly advocate that the Minister should accept this amendment. The rate of 2.6 per cent is within the spirit of the commitment made by his <Col N="2002" /> predecessor.  It would be justified and widely welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support this amendment in the name of Deputy Noonan and reiterate some of the points he has made.  We have to underline the fact that the Minister's predecessor gave an unequivocal commitment to this House when he stated that he would restore the VAT refunds to the level at which they should be, provided he collected from the farmers what he considered to be the outstanding 1 per cent levies.  The amnesty brought in virtually all the levies which are collectable.  No sector of the community has a 100 per cent record in terms of collection of any form of tax.  This House can no longer accept that farmers should be penalised when the vast majority have paid their just desserts in respect of these 1 per cent levies.  I repeat that there is no tax which has a 100 per cent collection rate.  There are always problems and always taxes where the amount outstanding is not collectable. There were 12 Apostles and one of those was a wrong one.  If we could get 11 out of 12 in every community to pay their dues and to be on the right side of these issues, we would be doing very well. There is no point in discussing the principle of penalising all farmers for the sins of the few.  We have had that argument before.  What happened was not justified. We need full restoration to 2.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons we sold our entry to the European Community and Fine Gael canvassed so vigourously during the referendum on the Single European Act was the benefit to our farmers and the agri-food business from the single market, a market without frontiers. We have only to look at what the farmers in Europe contend with in relation to VAT rebates to realise how uncompetitive our farmers are on this issue.  Pigmeat imports, for example, have increased from zero to 17 per cent in the past two years.  The VAT rebate is 13 per cent to the unregistered farmer in the countries concerned.  We think we are being generous in suggesting 2 per cent here.  We are calling for 2.6 per <Col N="2003" /> cent.  We cannot consider that there is fair competition when our continental competitors have that advantage.</P>
    <P>The same applies to beef producers on the Continent.  The bull beef producers of Germany and France have VAT rebates of 11 per cent to 13 per cent, while our beef producers will have to contend with 2 per cent if the Minister has his way or 2.6 per cent if he accepts our amendment.  A new beef régime was cobbled together by the Council of Agriculture Ministers last January and the cap was put on it at the price negotiations more recently.  The first lot of European beef to go into intervention under the new tender system, amounting to 3,000 tonnes, all came from German beef producers. Using the tender system they could undercut beef producers from countries such as Ireland due to their more favourable VAT refund régime.</P>
    <P>We could go through all the different enterprises in agriculture and point out where our farmers are at a serious disadvantage. The rate of 2.6 per cent would be only a slight improvement on what the Minister is offering, but we must return to our farmers everything possible in terms of the VAT refund so that we may reach the position where like is treated with like.  We talk about harmonisation of indirect taxes and what will happen post-1922.  I suggest that it would be a gesture towards reaching that level of harmonisation, at least in relation to VAT refunds to farmers, if the Minister would give them all he could on this occasion.  We request 2.6 per cent.  It is but a small improvement on what the Minister has to offer.  We will have a lot to do during the next few years before we go into the position of harmonisation. I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The VAT rebate is related to rates of VAT on farm inputs. Abroad more of the inputs are taxable, so flat rates are higher.  Most of our farm inputs are zero rated &mdash; feed, fertilizer, seed and oral medicines.  Actually our flat rate is comparatively low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the commitment by my predecessor, Mr. MacSharry, I invite Deputies to read the Official Report of the debate on last year's budget which I read very carefully before I met the farmers' representatives in advance of the budget this year.  I pointed out to them that Mr. MacSharry's only commitment was to go back from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent, provided there was a reasonable increase in levies being paid.  When I examined the best calculations we had in relation to the receipt of outstanding levies, the Government in their generosity decided to go to 2 per cent.  This is the first time I have ever heard the figure of 2.6 per cent mentioned. I do not agreed with that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in the debate on the Financial Resolution on the night of the budget that the reason for not improving the refund to 2.4 per cent was the considerable amount of arrears outstanding from farmers in health contributions and levies.  He also said that the arrears had not been exactly calculated at that stage and that this was in the context of the incomplete analysis of the amnesty receipts.  The analysis has now been completed for the period to 31 March 1989 and shows that farmers paid £28.8 million in health contributions and levies, made up of £11.2 million in health contributions, £5.3 million in income levies and £12.3 million in employment and training levies.  While this represents a considerable improvement, the Revenue estimate that a further £4.9 million is still outstanding from farmers.  This is made up of £2 million in health contributions, <Col N="2005" /> £2 million in employment and training levy and £0.9 million in income levy. These figures concern the arrears owed to the Revenue who have been responsible for collecting them from full time farmers only since 5 April 1984.  Prior to this the Revenue were concerned with part-time farmers while the health boards were responsible for the collection from full time farmers for all years up to 5 April 1984.  The latest estimate by the Department of Health for the arrears owed to the health boards in health contributions is £4.29 million at the end of 1988.  No figures are yet available for the levy arrears due to the health boards. Therefore, despite the amnesty payments, at least £9 million is estimated as still owing by farmers to revenue and health boards.  While I would concede that there are a certain amount of bad debts in every situation we are certainly a long way from being at the ideal situation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the best I can say to the Deputy at this stage is that I cannot accept that amendment.  What I gave the farmers this year cost in the region of £12 million.  I met the situation fairly and squarely.  I can assure the House that I will certainly be looking at it again in the context of the budget of 1990.</P>

      <P>I am opposing Deputy Noonan's amendment.  I will also be opposing the Minister's section.  I have dealt with this issue on a number of previous Finance Bills.  Deputy Doyle is crying about the crucifixion of the farmers in this matter and advocating that not alone should they be getting 2.6 per cent but should be harmonised with the EC and getting 13 per cent.  The Minister's response to that is that there are lower rates of VAT on agricultural products here and if one pays less one gets less by way of refund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said that farmers are not getting the full rebate to which they are entitled.  I would like to know how we assess that.  How do we know that they are entitled to anything when they are unregistered?  There is no question of entitlement to anything.  This is just a further subsidy to farmers, an addition to the price subsidy.  If there is a problem about not getting the full rebate to which they are entitled surely they should register and then we would know what their entitlement is, just like small traders who know exactly what their entitlement is. What rebate or refund they should get is very clear and mathematically correct.  In this case there are no such mathematics; there is no relation whatever to VAT. The system is wide open to fraud.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare made great play during the course of the year with the great efforts he made to uncover fraud in social welfare to the extent of something like £5 million.  The huge escalation, year by year, in the amount of VAT refunds paid to unregistered farmers indicates that there is something wrong.  They have jumped in the five years from 1981 to £22 million.  Five years later in 1986 the amount of such refunds had risen to £79.4 million, almost £80 million.  That is a four fold increase.  Was there a four fold increase in VAT payments? The system is obviously wide open to fraud and I would like to know if the Minister or the Department of Agriculture have ever attempted to uncover the fraud in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister reduced the level from 2.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent <Col N="2007" /> because the farmers had not paid their levies, but this raised surprisingly little protest among farmers.  It was the equivalent of the corporation refusing to give grants until the water rates are paid.  The farmers knew that.  They were not able to say that they were entitled to this refund and claim it irrespective of what levies or income tax they had not paid because there is no such legal entitlement.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am certainly opposing the Fine Gael amendment to increase the VAT refund to 2.6 per cent.  There is no basis for it whatsoever, certainly not in this Finance Bill, having passed section 50.  I will even be opposing the Minister's section, section 51, until there is a clear explanation of why farmers cannot register, the basis for deciding the amount of refund and whether the taxable persons who are purchasing the agricultural produce are making more of a good thing out of it than the unregistered farmers who are supposed to be getting the refund as a subsidy to their prices for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The whole area requires major investigation to see how it operates, who gets the money, where the rip-off is and whether all farmers should be made to register for the purposes of VAT.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate the previous history of the figure which was reduced from 1.7 per cent to 1.4 per cent?  What is the history of this level of VAT refund over a period?  I take it from some remarks the Minister made there that this would cost an extra £12 million.  Could the Minister indicate, in relation to last year, the total yield of income tax from agriculture so the House can know whether this year we can expect a significant increase in income tax yields from agriculture.  I would be interested to know what his prognosis is about the yield from agriculture.</P>

There is no sense in coming into this House and trying to raise scares about frauds that do not exist.  The Deputy does not even understand the system of the flat rate.  If he keeps quiet for one minute I will tell him the position.  The co-ops and the marts operate the system.  They give the flat rate to the farmers who, in turn, sell their goods to the marts and co-ops.  The Deputy can oppose all the sections he likes but he should not raise scares about frauds that do not exist.  Account is taken of the special position of farmers in all other member states except the UK and Denmark.  It is embodied in EC law.  It is the best way to operate the system and that is the way we will continue to operate it.  I hope the Deputy knows a little more about the position now and will not come into the House in future looking for headlines about frauds that do not exist.  He <Col N="2009" /> should not let anybody cod him that the Revenue are a soft touch because they are not and everyone in the country knows that.</P>

      <P>In 1972 the VAT rate was 1 per cent; in 1979, 1 per cent; on 1 September 1981, 1.5 per cent; 1 May 1982, 1.8 per cent; 1 March 1983, 2.3 per cent; 1 July 1983, 2 per cent; 2 per cent; 1 March 1985, 2.2 per cent; and on 1 March 1986 it was increased to 2.4 per cent, the highest ever.  On 1 May 1987 it was reduced by my predecessor to 1.7 per cent and there was a further reduction to 1.4 per cent.  I am now increasing it to 2 per cent.  There was never any mention of 2.6 per cent as is proposed in the amendment.  The adjustment which was made this year to 2 per cent will cost £12 million in 1989 or £17 million in a full year.  If Deputy Avril Doyle would like to tell me where I could get another £12 million to increase the figure further I would be glad to hear it.</P>

      <P>If this proposal is not accepted the farmers will lose about £15 million.  Our proposal of 2.6 per cent is fair and reasonable.  Farmers have paid almost all, if not all, the levies that were due.  The additional £15 million which is due to them and which is being withheld on this occasion should be paid to them. The position is most unsatisfactory because quite a number of farmers will lose a considerable amount of money. The VAT refund at present is not sufficient. I put it to Deputy Mac Giolla that the decline in the numbers employed in agriculture and the fall-off in farming families should be sufficient proof that there are still a lot of problems in agriculture. If the farmers were paid the additional £15 million it would make an enormous difference to them and the <Col N="2010" /> Minister should meet our request in this instance.</P>

      <P>I agree absolutely with what Deputy Enright has said. About 20,000 farmers have got out of farming in the past ten years and it is expected that 40,000 will leave the land in the next decade.  There is a saying that the rising tide lifts all boats but that is not true as regards farming.  A large number of farmers have experienced increased profitability but the majority of smaller farmers are not benefiting from the EC or from anything else.  They are getting out of farming and the bigger farmers are buying the land.</P>

      <P>Why are they not registered?  As Michael Dillon said, in 50 years time 10,000 farmers will control all the land and production in this State.  He is an expert in this area.  I do not agree with his taxation policies but that is what he said.  Deputy Enright is absolutely right in that farmers are leaving the land and will continue to do so.  People on both sides of this House have been crying about the family farm down through the years and have been in favour of the farmers.  I am supposed to be anti-farmer and they are supposed to be pro-farmer. When the State was founded there were 380,000 farm holdings and now there are only 120,000.  Successive Governments were in favour of the farmers but they drove them off the land.  I am saying that the farmers who have the money should pay their taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain whether it was a huge increase in productivity in agriculture or an increase in the number of farmers that resulted in the VAT refunds increasing from £22 million in 1981 to £55 million in 1983.  I am an ignorant person in these matters. In 1983 the VAT rate was 2.3 per cent and there were VAT refunds of £55.4 million to unregistered farmers.  In 1986 the rate was 2.4 per cent, an increase of <Col N="2011" /> 1 per cent, and there were VAT refunds of £79 million, an increase of £24 million. Why was there such an enormous increase in Exchequer refunds?  Was it due to an increase in agricultural produce, in purchases and sales and so on?  If the Minister would explain that to me it would be a great help for next year's Finance Bill, for instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a simple answer to that.  The increase in VAT refunds reflects the increase in VAT rates over the period.  In 1980 the rates were 10 per cent and 20 per cent and by 1983 they had increased to 23 per cent and 35 per <Col N="2012" /> cent.  As those rates increase, so too do the VAT refunds.  It is as simple as that. There is nothing mysterious about it and there have been no frauds.</P>

      <P>We discussed the basic principle of PAYE deductions, which in certain cases may not be returned to the Exchequer for a maximum period of one year.  I objected to that under the relevant section, and I am objecting to this section as well because the principle is the same.  VAT payment is a tax, which people know is going to the Exchequer.  Under this section of the <Col N="2014" /> Finance Bill those who deduct that tax at the point of purchase, or at the point of sale, may retain it for themselves instead of forwarding it to the Exchequer.  I made the same points in relation to PAYE.  I think it is totally wrong &mdash; possibly illegal and unconstitutional &mdash; that tax payments made by individuals who accept that they must pay for the normal running of the State and the social services, education, health or whatever are not forwarded to the Exchequer.  The only reason they do not object to paying taxes is that they know these taxes help to provide these services for the general public &mdash; health, education, local authority services, social welfare benefits and so on.</P>
      <P>If these services were not being provided people would object to paying taxes.  They object to paying double taxes &mdash; paying for the health services and then having to pay extra charges.  In this case they find their taxes are not being forwarded to the Exchequer, but rather are being held by employers and business people for a period of 12 months.</P>

      <P>I have spoken solely about the retention of VAT by traders for a period of 12 months, when people who have paid their VAT would expect this money to be with the Exchequer and being used to finance the health services, the education services, etc.  That is the point I made.  It is wrong that this Finance Bill should contain a provision which would allow individuals to retain what belongs to the Exchequer for a period of 12 months without paying any interest on that money.  It would amount to an interest free loan for 12 months from the public, the consumers. In the other case it amounted to a loan from workers, deducted from their wages.  In this case, it is money paid over by consumers to the Exchequer, but it is being held by traders.  I do not know how the Minister will decide who will retain the money and who will not, but it can be held for a period of 12 months.  I am registering my objection to this, as I registered my objection on the PAYE section because I think it is illegal, unconstitutional and totally wrong.</P>

      <P>To respond to the criticism made by Deputy Mac Giolla, if small traders opt for an annual return, right through the year they would have no vehicle to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the goods they have purchased.  We are talking about the net VAT figure. The traders have paid VAT on the goods they purchased but they would not have to make a return to the Revenue, if they so opt, for 12 months.  We are talking about a minute figure, not a large amount of money as Deputy Mac Giolla seems to believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but all we are talking about is the VAT on the margin, no more than that.  We have already discussed this matter at length. The scheme is aimed at helping small traders to ease their compliance burden. The amount of tax at risk is a minute fraction of the VAT yield.  The scheme is optional.  By the same token the Revenue Commissioners do not have to extend this facility to somebody with a bad record.  At any given stage the Revenue Commissioners can ask for payments and the section has been so framed that if the worst should happen, the Revenue would still have preference.</P>
      <P>The Collector General is the final arbiter and it is he who will decide whether a trader should be allowed opt for the scheme, and he would make his decision on the basis of the past record of the trader concerned.  As I said in the other section, there are substantial administrative benefits to be gained, and the Exchequer will gain, not lose, at the end of the day.  In other words, I would not be spending £1,000 to follow £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me highlight one administrative problem about which the Minister might not be able to do something. In the normal course of events a person pays over their VAT returns to the Collector General.  That person is entitled to claim a VAT refund and he deducts that refund from the figure he is paying and sends the net amount to the Collector General.  A problem arises if the accounts are not sent in to him in time.  If someone wishes to keep their accounts in order they pay out what is owed on the nineteenth day to the Collector General.  At the end of the nineteenth day, they try to balance the account of a particular person, but it may transpire later that some further moneys have been paid out with the result that that person will have to make a futher deduction, This leads to confusion and many difficulties for business people.  I suggest, Deputy Mac Giolla may disagree with this, that even though the amount of money involved in some cases is sizeable many administrative problems arise from this money having to be paid over within 19 days.  I think that period should be extended to at least 28 days.</P>

      <P>There are two ways traders can opt to pay their VAT.  They can opt to pay on a cash/receipts basis.  If they opt for that system the problem the Deputy is concerned about does not arise.  However, if they are on an invoice/sales basis, they must pay before they have taken in the money.  I suggest to the Deputy that the person he has in mind should consider opting for the cash/receipts system.  People are entitled to opt for that system and that would get over the problem if they are not getting in their money fast enough.  Under that system they pay when the cash is received.  If they opt for the invoice/sales system they are caught for the money even if they do not get paid.  Any type of trader is entitled to opt for the cash/receipts system if he or she wishes. That system may suit the businesses referred to by Deputy Enright.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister in regard to paragraph (viii).  I understand that that authorisation allows value-added tax to be collected from small traders over a period of 12 months rather than over a two month period as at present.  I note that the authorisation in accordance with this paragraph will automatically cease, and, presumably, all VAT will automatically become due, on the death of the taxpayer which is not a predictable event, as the Minister will appreciate in all cases.  That could be the cause of some hardship.  For instance, if an authorisation had been given to a person that he or she did not have to pay VAT for 11 months, and that person died, the person succeeding in the administration <Col N="2020" /> of that business would be obliged, it appears from the provisions of paragraph (viii), to bring the VAT affairs up to date. Will the Minister indicate if that is the position?  It appears to me that that is so because paragraph (viii)(c) refers to a person either ceasing to be a taxable person, dying or becoming bankrupt.  I am concerned about the death of such person.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the financial and other consequences of a death are sufficiently severe in themselves without adding this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is correct.  The provision is no worse than the consequences that would apply in regard to normal VAT procedures.  I accept that one could argue that there may be more arrears involved if such an event occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are introducing a new system which allows people financial latitude to account for their VAT and to provide for their VAT over a period of 12 months, where previously we had asked them to provide for it over a period of two months.  We are saying to them that, notwithstanding the fact that they have been authorised to account for VAT on that basis, if they die suddenly everything is cancelled.  We are saying that the person who succeeds must pay immediately as if no such authorisation had ever been granted.  The Minister will be aware that at the time of the death of a small businessman there will be many other financial charges to be met, such as capital acquisitions tax, stamp duties of various kinds and other dislocative expenditures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are saying that simply because of a death an authorisation is automatically terminated, as appears to be quite categoric in the section.  It states that an authorisation shall be deemed to be terminated and it does not state that the authorisation shall be open to be reconsidered and, if necessary, withdrawn.  It states quite categorically that the authorisation shall cease on death.  It will be more appropriate to insert some measure of discretion in that provision so as not <Col N="2021" /> to create hardship, not to turn what is designed, laudibly, as a sensible concession to small businesses into something which in the case of the death of a small business person could become a source of hardship to successors in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how we can do anything else.  We have to bring them all together and use that phraseology to take care of other likely events, apart from deaths.  I am referring to liquidations and so on.  I cannot see how we can differentiate in these cases.  The death of a person is a tragic event and it can bring its own consequences and problems but we are dealing with small amounts of money.  If we were dealing with large sums of money it could be said that the provisions might constitute a real hardship but the amounts involved will be very small.  The provisions will operate only six weeks after the death of a taxpayer. We are not talking about large amounts of money that would put people out of business.  I do not see how we could divorce a death from the other eventualities that must be covered by such a provision.</P>

      <P>Now that I have the Minister's whole and undivided attention, if he looks at lines 43 to 45 of section 52 he will see that you shall be deemed to have complied with the provisions of paragraph (a) in relation to the taxable periods if you comply with this regime. However, if you do not comply you are not deemed to have complied with those provisions and, therefore, all the people behind you in the line are not deemed to have complied with their duties when their duties arose.  If the Minister looks at it that is a clear and obvious reading of the section.  In other words, you only get a retrospective validation and compliance with all the steps taken during the year if at the end of the year you comply with what you are supposed to comply with.  If you fail at the end of the year you are deemed to have failed at each individual spot during the period.  What I am saying is that an officer of a company who was there during part of that period and was liable to penalties for failing to comply will find himself in the position that he would be exposed to penalties for things which happened after he ceased to be an officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As we appreciate, this section was brought in through a judgment of the European Court of Justice. It is understood that corrective spectacles and contact lenses are subject to VAT.  I should like the Minister to consider on Report Stage that a section of the population &mdash; and I refer to the partially sighted &mdash; who are in need of a particular type of low vision aid could be exempted from the payment of VAT on these aids.</P>
      <P>In Ireland there are some 5,000 registered blind people and perhaps a little fewer than 2,500 partially sighted people. The need for low vision aids for partially sighted people is very great.  As the Minister will be aware, just before Christmas, the President opened an institute on the north side specialising in this area for people who are in need of low vision aids. There is not a great lot of money involved and I know that across the water in England these aids are exempt from VAT. We are not speaking in terms of spectacles as such: we are speaking of a particular type of sight correcting aid for people who have very low vision needs where the benefit to them would be very great as a result of that extra degree of sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do not intend to give the Minister figures of the number of persons so affected but it is very low.  Perhaps the Minister could recommend to his officials that they take a look at this section of <Col N="2027" /> society to see if there is a way in which these aids can be exempted from VAT. In certain cases low vision aids can be quite expensive.  They are not worn in the same way as spectacles.  I am not referring to hand held magnifying glasses or anything of that kind: I am speaking about sophisticated aids which have been developed by modern technology and which can help people.  I know it was not the Minister's intention to include these aids in this section of the Bill but as I read the section they are included and it would be a shame if the section was not amended in some way or brought into line.  In developed countries sophisticated techniques for reading Braille, closed circuit television and so on are used to assist such people but if the Minister examines the area I am talking about he could, without any loss of revenue to the Exchequer, include this group of people in section 52 on Report Stage.</P>

We were queued up right behind them and this is why we gave an undertaking at that time to include this provision in VAT legislation here.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy, the reason these aids were not included is that I am debarred, under the decision of the European Court of Justice under EC law, from zero rating them.  I will certainly look at that segment of society.  I have every compassion for them and I will see how they can be accommodated in some shape or form, perhaps by way of refund or whatever.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 55, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) period furniture, and works of craftsmanship in silver, glass or porcelain, 100 years old or more;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When this section was originally drafted the proposal was to reduce the rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 10 per cent on works of art more than 100 years old. The Minister has modified the position since his announcement on budget day to what appears in the section and has removed the requirement that an allowable work of art should be in excess of 100 years old.  He has tightened up the section quite considerably.</P>
      <P>Effectively three new paragraphs will be added to the Sixth Schedule listing new items that would be 10 per cent VAT-rated.  For example, there is reference to a painting, drawing, or pastel, or any combination thereof, executed entirely by hand, an original lithograph engraving and so on, or an original sculpture or statuary.  I should like the Minister to consider extending the provisions of the section to include antiques and, for the purposes of such extension, to revert to the original intent on budget night, to talk, in terms of the extension I am proposing, of period furniture, works of craftsmanship in silver, glass or porcelain 100 years old or more.  I am seeking the addition of a fourth paragraph to the Sixth Schedule to include antiques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that at present there is a huge loss of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners from the antique trade.  What is happening is that, because of the 25 per cent VAT rate, the trade is being taken out of traders' rooms and being conducted at auctions in parish halls and public places.  Second, the trade is being conducted by the submission of items to house auctions where furniture, other than the furniture and contents of the house, is being added and sold at public auction.  There is a tax advantage in this exercise because, when something is sold <Col N="2029" /> at auction in a parish hall or at a house auction, VAT applies only to the auctioneer's commission, whether that be at 5 per cent or something less.  This means the trade in antiques is being diverted into auctions where VAT is not charged on the market value of the item; rather is it being charged on the auctioneer's commission.</P>
    <P>I can see the difficulties in framing a section which would allow for the inclusion of genuine antiques and exclude objects with little artistic merit or those whose age would be difficult to establish. I think the Minister will grasp my intent here.  For example, any expert in antiques will be able to validate furniture which is 100 years old or more.  I am also endeavouring to have included works of craftsmanship in silver, glass or porcelain.  The extension to silver goods should be easily administered because silver is hallmarked. There should be absolutely no problem about establishing the age of any item of silver.  Not only would the extension I propose be of benefit to people in the antique trade but it is my belief that the trade would move back from auction rooms into antique shops with a consequent increase in the VAT returned to the State.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take this amendment on board.  If he cannot reply in detail this evening he might examine the matter between now and Tuesday next.  I am seeking an extension to cover genuine antiques where such can be clearly established.  There would be no loss of revenue to the Exchequer because of the circumstances I have described in which antiques are now being traded in auction rooms rather than in antique shops.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Noonan I should say that, since budget day, we have received six representations only in relation to the point he made; that is not to say it is not valid.  Certainly I will examine the matter.  I will talk to the Deputy between now and Tuesday next in order to ascertain whether we can devise a sufficiently tight provision.  The reason I removed the original provision <Col N="2030" /> on budget day was that it has excluded much of our own Irish artists' works and it seemed somewhat crazy to do so.  That is the reason I followed that course and included manuscripts as well.  We have had very few representations in relation to it.  It is not easy to draw up a sufficiently tight section or provision <i>vis-à-vis</i> description and so on.  I will talk to the Deputy between now and Tuesday next in order to ascertain whether we can reach some accommodation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to point out that I accept the section, as drafted.  The new formulation is quite justified for the reasons the Minister gave both now and on Second Stage.  I am seeking an amendment of the section by way of addition which would use the 100-year formula suggested by the Minister in the budget and that this would apply to the antique trade exclusively without interference with the section, as now presented.  It would then be possible to isolate the antique trade, certainly in respect of silverware, where the hallmark will give the year anyway.  It would not be a matter of debate as to what was the age in that case.  The same would apply to a large extent to furniture, porcelain and glass.  If the Minister really wants to tighten it, if he places the onus of proof on the seller rather than on the Revenue Commissioners, the requirement will be to prove that an item is 100 years old and that VAT should be imposed at 10 per cent.  If that proof is not available VAT should be imposed at 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 52 in the name of Deputy McDowell. I observe that amendment No. 55 is an alternative.  Therefore, I suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 52 and 55 together if that is satisfactory.  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 56, before section 57, but in Part IV, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;57.&mdash;The First Schedule of Stamp Duties under the Stamp Act, 1891 as revised by the Finance Act, 1970 is hereby amended to exempt from stamp duty all leases and contracts of tenancy of 12 months duration or less in respect of any premises proposed to be used for a dwelling where the rent thereby received calculated on an annual basis does not exceed £6,000.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises, as does amendment No. 55, from a suggestion by the Threshold organisation in relation to rented accommodation.  That organisation is of the view that the requirement that short term leases in respect of modest dwellings be stamped actually acts as a reason for not giving out written leases or written tenancy agreements at all, which tends to the prejudice of tenants in such accommodation.  In view of the fact that the amount of money involved must be very small indeed from the point of view of the State on short term tenancies of flats and the like, there must be very little actual stamping of the vast majority of such leases, it would be better if it were completely abolished as an area of documentation requiring stamping, when landlords would be more inclined to give their tenants written contracts of tenancy which did not need to be stamped.  Accordingly, social justice would be furthered at very little expense to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could be enlightened in regard to this matter.  The Deputy is talking about a short term lease given by a landlord.  I should have thought that the reason a landlord would be interested in issuing a longer lease would be that he would be inclined to keep his options open and be able to have the premises vacated at an earlier stage. We are talking about a small amount of money involved in the stamping of a lease, of perhaps £5,000 or £6,000 which would be paid by the tenant.  Why would that act as a deterrent to a landlord not to issue a lease?  I am not clear on the reasons being advanced by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most landlords prefer the minimum of documentation, records and complexity.  They tend to conduct their business on the basis of a verbal tenancy or weekly lettings of a premises. However, such a weekly letting means that a tenant will be left high and dry in terms of minimum notice and obligation on the part of the landlord to the tenant. What the Threshold organisation want is the Exchequer to withdraw its requirement of stamp duty on such short term leases in order to encourage the general granting of written leases in respect of short term tenancies.  That is it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond O'Malley gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the operation of the export credit insurance scheme in relation to beef exports to Iraq for the years 1987 and 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you very much for allowing me to raise this matter tonight.  I raise the matter because it has now become clear, as a result of a long series of questions which I and my colleagues have addressed to members of the Government in recent weeks, that some very disturbing facts have come to light in regard to the export credit insurance scheme and, in particular, to its operation in relation to beef exports to Iraq.</P>
      <P>There are good grounds for believing that a substantial abuse has occurred, that the actions of some of those involved were deliberate, that as a result there is a risk to the Irish taxpayer of a liability currently measured at not less than £56 million and potentially much more and, most important, that this state of affairs has come about as a result of a series of steps involving governmental and ministerial intervention and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the abuse and of the potential liability of the State is unprecedented. We have waited four weeks for an explanation from the Government without result so far.  We may or may not get some belated attempt at explanation tonight but, even if we do, the absence of it for so long is in itself a serious scandal.  Two incontrovertible facts now emerge.  These are: (1) at different periods during 1987 and 1988 between one-fifth and one-third of all the available export credit insurance provided by law <Col N="2034" /> for all Irish exporters of all goods to all countries was, in fact, made available to two companies in respect of one product, beef, being exported to one country, Iraq.  Of that very extensive cover the great bulk of it &mdash; more than 80 per cent &mdash; was made available to a company which was part of the Goodman organisation; (2) the amount of beef in respect of which the State has provided insurance cover on its sale to Iraq in those two years exceeds the amount of beef actually exported from the Republic of Ireland to Iraq according to official CSO figures by a figure of approximately £57 million.</P>
    <P>This is an enormous discrepancy which has not been explained.  Tentative explanations were offered.  They were then abandoned.  It now appears to be clear that the only reasonable and credible explanation for the discrepancy is that beef from sources other than Ireland was given cover under the Irish export credit insurance scheme operated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the risk of the Irish taxpayer.  By definition such cover is in breach of the scheme.  I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this widespread belief, which I share.  I need hardly say that the provision of export credit insurance cover by the Irish taxpayer for goods which emanate from another State is a flagrant abuse of the export credit insurance scheme and cannot be described as other than a fraud on the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>To deal first with the proportion of export credit afforded to certain beef exporters to Iraq I want to point out that the figures have all been given to my colleagues and myself by the relevant Ministers in reply to Parliamentary Questions over the past month or so and are derived also from the speech of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, in this House on 21 June last when introducing a Bill to extend the cumulative limit of the Minister's liability under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the years up to and including 1986, the amount of export credit insurance afforded in respect of beef exports to Iraq was extremely small.  In the year 1986, for instance, it amounted to less than 30 <Col N="2035" /> per cent of our total beef exports to that country.  On the change of Government in 1987 there was a dramatic change of policy and the cover afforded was increased to substantially more than the amount of beef exported.  This trend became even more pronounced in 1988 and huge potential liabilities were undertaken at the expense of the Irish taxpayer and not, as some people seem to think, at the expense of European Community funds.  Suddenly the scheme was withdrawn at the beginning of 1989 because of the size of the cumulative outstanding liability and the bad experience.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a valuable one because it enables exporters not just to insure against non-payment of export contracts but also enables them to raise attractive cheap finance in respect of sums due to them where the credit has been insured. It is, in effect, a State aid to exporters by virtue of which the risks under any export contract are under-written by the taxpayer. The larger indemnities afforded by the scheme are, from the information available, decided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce personally.  I have evidence that in the case of Iraq, the Government as a body acting collectively, discussed the matter and decided to set various higher ceilings in respect of insured exports to Iraq.</P>
    <P>The great value of the scheme to any exporter is underlined by what the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the Dáil on 21 June last as reported at column 1148 of the Official Report which states:</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance not only affords protection against non-payment from abroad, it also provides access to finance from the banks at preferential interest rates.</P>
    <P>In a particular market to provide this cover, therefore, to some companies to the exclusion of others gives the companies getting it enormous advantages as against their competitors.  It effectively excludes the competitors.  This is particularly favourable to one organisation if it <Col N="2036" /> gets 80 per cent or more of the cover in a particular market.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, a huge proportion of all export credit insurance is afforded to one company &mdash; in this case the Goodman organisation &mdash; it is of considerable assistance to that company in increasing its dominance within the Irish market and with suppliers.  It puts other companies in the same sector at a considerable disadvantage. Needless to say, it puts a large number of exporters in all other sectors producing all kinds of goods and services at a great disadvantage too.  How can the Government justify giving such an enormous proportion of all our insurance cover, in each of these two years, to two companies, one getting 80 per cent or more, when hundreds if not thousands of exporters and would-be exporters are left without this facility and without the indemnity and cheap finance which it provides? Is it not also remarkable that such a high percentage of our export credit insurance is afforded in respect of the Iraqi market which, throughout those two years, was well known to be high risk and not covered by other western countries because of the risks involved?</P>
    <P>As I said, export credit insurance cover is a valuable State aid to industry and to exporters.  If the IDA or CTT were to administer the funds at their disposal on the basis that two companies would get in each of the two years between one-fifth and one-third of all such funds, there would rightly be a public outcry.  Why should the outcry be any less when the slightly more complex and less well understood State aid of export credit insurance is abused in this fashion.  The Minister's explanation about two companies having firm contracts and having priority in time is not really credible.  If there was any personal or political will to do so, there is no doubt that the highly lucrative financial facilities which are available in this scheme could and should be made available among competing companies, even if only as a matter of wise political discretion.  In any event an explanation which might have, even in a far fetched way, some validity for one <Col N="2037" /> year cannot have any validity at all for another subsequent year.</P>
    <P>To revert again to the second major point of discrepancy in the figures between the amount of beef afforded cover under the scheme and the amount actually exported from Ireland, I should state that in cash terms the volume of export credit insurance cover for beef exceeded actual beef exports to Iraq in the two years by £37.6 million.</P>
    <P>However, the actual figure for beef contracts effectively covered by insurance exceeds the actual export figure by approximately £57 million, because the insurance cover was restricted to 70 per cent of the value of contracts of 18 months credit and 80 per cent of the value with 12 months credit.  The gross volume and value of beef covered may, in fact, be somewhat higher because the manner in which I have done the calculations is very conservative indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been making inquiries for the past four weeks into how these discrepancies have arisen.  I presume that he must have been making these inquiries for much longer because, while they came to light publicly only within the last four weeks, when we raised the matter here, his Department must have been aware of them well before that.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the facilities at his disposal the Minister has as yet been unable to explain the discrepancies.  My own inquiries have given me substantial and reliable grounds to believe that the chief factor in these discrepancies represents the use of beef sources outside the State to satisfy contracts, in breach of the export credit insurance scheme.  This state of affairs is extremely serious from a number of points of view.  First, the Irish State and taxpayer have under-written exports to Iraq at the behest of Irish companies when the goods exported were not eligible for cover.  Second, banks and others advanced moneys to Irish exporters on foot of export credit insurance scheme contracts for non-Irish exports.  Third, potential Irish beef exports to Iraq have failed to materialise, by virtue of the use of the scheme here <Col N="2038" /> to finance competing exports from other States.</P>
    <P>The use of the scheme to cover foreign goods exported to Iraq, in these circumstances and in these quantities, amounts to serious abuse of the scheme and to a fraud on the State and the taxpayer. A substantial potential liability has been incurred by the Central Fund to finance dealings which, in part at least, were not exports at all.  Would-be exporters were refused indemnity which was diverted to cover competing products sourced outside the State.  In view of the fact that other beef exporters were anxious to secure this cover, but were refused, the scheme was used to exclude fair competition from within the State, which aggravates the scandal.</P>
    <P>Allowing these two companies, of which by far the larger and more substantial is the Goodman organisation, cover, in the Iraqi market for such large sums, so considerably in excess of their actual exports to that market, as well as being entirely wrong in principle and an act of blatant favouritism, has the further improper consequence that the credit periods allowed are abnormally long.  Eighteen months, or even longer, is allowed, as opposed to the normal 28 days for beef.  This means that a high proportion of all the available insurance cover is tied up for a very long period and is not allowed to revolve numerous times within the one year as is the case normally.</P>
    <P>To allow this excessive cover for an excessive length of time in respect of this particular market is especially wrong, in my view.  The great majority of other countries were not providing any cover at all during the two years in question for the Iraqi market.  At the same time we are providing cover that far exceeds our own exports for periods that are extraordinarily long.</P>
    <P>Our earlier trading history with Iraq was certainly a happy one and as one who was involved in it, I am happy to acknowledge that.  However, in recent years Iraqi credit has come under substantial pressure internationally as a <Col N="2039" /> result of a lengthy war in which they were involved.</P>
    <P>When other countries were withdrawing credit incredibly, in 1988, we were expanding ours.  Indeed, as recently as November 1988, at the Baghdad Trade Fair, I understand that a Minister of State from here indicated that we would further increase our export credit insurance limits for exports to Iraq in 1989.  Happily it now appears that particular decision has been rescinded.</P>
    <P>The matters that I have been describing all have this in common.  They arose out of decisions made by Ministers, and indeed in some instances by the entire Government.  Their effect has been to put the Irish Exchequer at risk of considerable liabilities in respect of the sale of goods, some of which are not of Irish origin, and to strengthen further the already strong position of the Goodman organisation as the dominant group within the beef processing and allied traders in Ireland.  At least 80 per cent of what was made available in such abnormal circumstances to beef exporters to Iraq went to that group, which have already established a position of some considerable dominance.</P>
    <P>The implications of this for Irish agriculture and for employment here are substantial. It has been suggested that controversy in relation to the beef export trade is always damaging to the interests of farmers.  In this case, however, there are considerable grounds to believe that the direct effect of these abuses is to damage the interests of Irish agriculture. These interests have been damaged in the short term by the Irish taxpayer giving support to competing products from another country or countries, but in the longer term the damage will be much greater.</P>
    <P>The greater the dominance of the Goodman group becomes, or indeed of any other single group, the more vulnerable and insecure is the position of the Irish beef producing farmer.  The less effective competition there is in the beef processing trade, the less Irish farmers in <Col N="2040" /> the future are assured of a fair price for their output.</P>
    <P>If the person holding a very dominant position in the Irish market is also an international trader, even the withholding of supplies from him within Ireland will make little difference if he can obtain supplies elsewhere in the world, in view of the fact that the great bulk of beef traded is as a commodity rather than as a branded product.</P>
    <P>These developments are undesirable also from an employment point of view. There certainly has been no net increase in employment in meat factories in the last few years.  In fact, if anything, there is net disemployment of full-time permanent employees in favour of seasonal and part-time employees and in favour of gangs of so-called subcontractors from Northern Ireland and Britain who are brought in for short periods.  The processing capacity seems to far exceed the level of demand for these facilities, with the result that some plants have closed and others almost inevitably will.  Unfortunately, these plants have almost all been aided by FEOGA funds and IDA grants.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disturbed therefore that these unusually generous facilities, in terms of export credit insurance and what flows from them, are made available to what is by far the most dominant group within the trade to the exclusion of all others except one.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in this House on 9 March last, members of this present Government from the Taoiseach down, are extremely close personally to the leading figure in the group concerned. The Taoiseach personally announced a £260 million investment programme by this group in June 1987.  Almost two years later none of that programme appears to have commenced.  As I said then, we can hardly blame the Government.  They have been generous and helpful to a fault. I instanced on that occasion their willingness to accommodate Mr. Goodman's private jet in a state military air base.</P>

      <P>In addition, we can now instance their provision of this extraordinarily generous export credit insurance support to the almost entire exclusion of everybody else in that trade and to the considerable detriment of hundreds of other exporters in other sectors of business.</P>
      <P>The closeness and helpfulness exhibited by the Government to the group concerned in terms of export credit insurance may well be echoed in the nonenforcement by the Government of the terms of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, in respect of a different group, the Master Meats group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure to give a notification under the Act for nearly seven months and the failure to pursue the question of the beneficial ownership of that group further deepens the concern and sense of fear that many people in the country have.  It is unhealthy that so much of our agriculture and agri-business should be dominated from one source to the extent that it is.</P>
      <P>I cannot elicit all the necessary information in this matter tonight, nor, I think, can Dáil Éireann, given its procedures, ever elicit all the necessary information.  The Government have shown over the last month or so how reticent they are in giving information and how it has to be dragged out of them, even in very limited quantities.  It is evident that some form of independent inquiry is required in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a particular group, because it is so powerful and large and constitutes, in fact as it says itself 4 per cent of the Irish GNP, it then becomes a matter of public interest.  Any aspect of its activities which <Col N="2042" /> give rise to concern is necessarily a matter of public importance.  In a republic a group like that must accept that they have passed the threshold of public economic significance, which necessarily deprives them of the right of secrecy and privacy to which smaller concerns, individual or corporate, are entitled.  In this context, the knowledge that there has been widespread use of export credit insurance cover in the Iraq beef export trade is a matter of legitimate public concern.</P>
    <P>The public are entitled to be informed of the facts.  They are entitled to know whether beef from outside the State is used to fill export credit insured contracts. They are entitled to a full and frank explanation from a major commercial group of this size.  It simply will not suffice to adopt a &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; approach or to threaten litigation against those who wish to throw the spotlight of public attention on an area of serious suspicion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion let me say that it is important to distinguish the suspected fraudulent abuse of the export credit insurance scheme from other recent allegations of abuse of the aids to private storage.  In the latter case it appears there has been a pattern of non-compliance with the APS scheme and a number of beef processors have been penalised.  However nobody has suggested there was political responsibility for that pattern of non-compliance.</P>

Important though it was to expose and remedy any such abuses, I wish to indicate that the grounds for concern about the beef export trade <Col N="2043" /> to Iraq are far more grave in their implications for the Exchequer, for the question of Government responsibility and for the interests of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of the House will show that since March last 24 questions have been asked concerning the operation of the export credit insurance and finance schemes.  These questions have ranged from a variety of technical issues relating to the mechanics of the schemes such as the average amount of cover afforded by policies of export credit insurance and the relationship between export credit insurance and finance to the operation of the schemes in relation to beef exports to Iraq specifically.  In all cases I have answered the questions as thoroughly and as accurately as possible and again the records of the House will clearly demonstrate this.</P>
      <P>In essence I am saying that almost every conceivable question has been asked and answered fully.  What has come out tonight is nothing new from Deputy O'Malley.  It is merely a rehash of the position and personal abuse in relation to the Government and in relation to one company.  I must say I am surprised at the continuation of these reckless charges from Deputy O'Malley.  One thing that came out loud and clear is that the country should really want to know and be aware of the fact that Deputy O'Malley is out to get the Goodman Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may charge us in relation to Master Meat and the takeover of that company.  He is aware, but he did not want to put it on the record tonight, of the fact that the situation in relation to the takeover is a matter that <Col N="2044" /> is being examined under the mergers and monopolies legislation.  That answer was given to him in the House here but again it does not satisfy his poison line to take note of it.  The one lesson that comes out tonight is that Deputy O'Malley, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, has made it quite clear that he and his party are out to get the Goodman Group.</P>
      <P>However, I want to focus on two elements of this matter which, in the light of the exchanges so far, deserve to be stiched further into the record of this House in view of the charges made again tonight.  The first concerns the operation of the scheme in the years 1987 and 1988 in respect of beef exports to Iraq. Already I have described in reply to questions why two companies obtained export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq in 1987.  In 1987 the first two companies who applied had at the time of their application firm contracts for the supply of beef to Iraq.  At the same time the total amount of insurance cover sought by these two companies, when added to existing exposure on the market and allowing for a reasonable level of residual cover for industrial exports, reached the overall limit set for the market.  Accordingly, it was possible to facilitate only the first two applicant companies with export credit insurance in respect of their firm contracts.  This is still considered to have been the correct approach in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>As regards 1988, I have told the Deputy of my communication in December with all seven beef companies who had expressed an interest in the Iraqi market to the effect that applications for cover would be considered as sympathetically as possible on production of a signed confirmed contract with the overall cover established for the market, which was limited.  This was a statement of general policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I emphasise and, because of the interruption I repeat, that this was a statement of general policy in relation to all companies, that no specific company was to get particular treatment. Deputy O'Malley said there was unfair treatment in relation to companies and that others had been debarred.  Let me say that one company in 1987 applied for insurance in respect of a contract for beef exports to Iraq and said they were tendering for it at that time.  The payment terms were based on 18 months' credit. An offer was made to the company in November 1987 at a level of indemnity of 70 per cent of contract value, the standard level of indemnity for contracts with credit terms of 18 months.  This offer was not, however, accepted by the company who sought instead to have cover at a 90 per cent level of indemnity.  As this level of indemnity exceeded the prudent norms established by this market, it was indicated to the company that cover on the lines requested would not be granted.</P>
      <P>The situation as outlined by Deputy O'Malley is of companies being excluded from cover and people being debarred from cover.  Roughly £700 million worth of export turnover is insured annually under the scheme and to date approximately £5.25 billion of Irish exports have been insured under the scheme, about 450 companies employing some 40,000 people use the facilities under the scheme and a single policy may cover 150 buyers at any one time in 15 markets.</P>
      <P>Throughout it has been my impression &mdash; and it has been confirmed tonight &mdash; that many of the questions raised on this matter have been characterised by insinuation, innuendo and hints of abuse regarding the operation of the scheme, and they have been stated here tonight.</P>

First, there is no justification whatsoever for the implication in some of the questions asked, that in <Col N="2046" /> one form or another Iraq might have been less than committed to the development of our mutual economic relations. I repeat that Iraq has never defaulted in a trade debt to Ireland.  That may not be of interest to the 6 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have answered 24 questions on this already.  I have mentioned previously that this ongoing debate about a single country can cause apprehension in the minds of other trading partners about the manner in which we can discuss our business affairs with them.  I can now confirm that I have already received some indications of this kind from other sources.  Let me add that I have also received views from some Irish representative bodies that this ongoing public saga in relation to one country is straining our international image and giving rise to some difficulties for doing business in other countries where the State in the main is involved in the business process.  It is self evident that this prolonged debate in so far as it relates to one sector can only continue to give rise to bad press internationally with potential <Col N="2047" /> consequences which are not pleasant to think of from a national viewpoint.  Our international competitors may be happy to see Irish firms lose business.  Who will take the responsibility for any loss of output, loss of jobs and loss of export earnings that follow from here?  Will it be those who unnecessarily and gratuitiously make insinuation after insinuation?</P>

      <P>I indicated in the Dáil on 1 December 1988, that in the present difficult financial situation there had been a reduction in the Exchequer allocation for all graduate programmes in 1989.  FÁS will provide funding totalling £200,000 in 1989 in respect of the European Orientation Programme. This will enable the CII to support 74 participants under the programme in 1989, 54 of whom had started last year and 20 new participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Graduates are not considered to be a priority for Exchequer funding in the <Col N="1828" /> overall context of FÁS activities.  There are a number of reasons for this position including the need to direct FÁS resources at the long term unemployed and early school leavers and the considerable State resources spent on third level education.</P>
    <P>We have well educated graduates.  It is my hope that business itself will train and provide jobs for them in their own interests and those of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied the issues involved here and I am not satisfied that any change should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following as I see it are the questions involved: (1) Since the bank holiday coincides with the holiday period, this means that the day in lieu is taken either at the end of the normal holday or at some other time during the year.  This has the effect of extending the holiday period in any event.  This arrangement has the advantage of leaving more discretion to employers and employees.  The change mentioned in the Deputy's question might therefore only have a subsitution effect, without any real benefit.  I might add that the fact that the day in lieu is added to existing holidays means that in effect the holiday coincides with the bank holiday in most European countries in mid August; (2) Apart from that, as far as the economy is concerned there is the argument that it may be more beneficial from a production/productivity point of view that the August bank holiday should merely be added to existing summer holidays, as occurs in many employments. This has to be balanced against any possible benefits to the tourist industry, which because of the points I have just <Col N="1829" /> made may be minimal or non-existent; (3) The simultaneous timing of the two holidays in the UK and Ireland could lead to unnecessary congestion in transport; (4) School holidays are a key factor and school reopening militates against family holidays at the end of August.</P>
    <P>Taking all the factors into account, I see no reason to change existing arrangements. If good arguments can be made to the contrary, I will of course consider the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 105 of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, contains detailed provisions as regards the appointment by workers, at their own cost, of workmen's inspectors. I understand that this option has not been availed of in the past due largely to the cost implications for workers.  I have had a very recent report and recommendation in the matter from the Mines and Quarries Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which I intend to bring into operation in the next few months, contains provisions as regards the appointment by workers of safety representatives who, among other matters, may investigate accidents and dangerous occurrences and carry out inspections.</P>
      <P>Under section 27 of the 1989 Act, the tripartite authority to be set up under the Act is required to keep under review the provisions of existing legislation, such as the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, and to submit proposals to me from time to time for legislative change.  It would be appropriate at this stage to ask the new authority, when it is established, to review the position as regards workmen's inspectors in mines and quarries and to bring forward its recommendations.  The authority will, no doubt, wish to take account of both the provisions of the 1965 Act and those on safety representatives in the 1989 Act.  I will ask the authority to give some priority to this matter given the high level of risk in the mines and quarries sector.</P>
      <P>I have already, in anticipation of establishing the new authority, written to both sides of industry requesting their nominations for appointment to the board of the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we have in Ireland a distinct body of labour law which reflects our own industrial relations and employment environment.  This legislation, which has been enacted in consultation with the social partners, sets down a floor of minimum standards and is periodically updated in response to changes in the labour market and employment practices.</P>
      <P>Since I assumed office, legislation on safety and health at work, safety on offshore installations and worker participation has been put on the Statute Book.  At present amendment of the legislation is being considered in relation to industrial relations and trade union law, payment of wages, unfair dismissals, employment equality, part time work and the regulation of working time.  Such reviews are carried out in consultation with FUE and ICTU and other interested bodies and account is taken of labour law developments in other member states of the European Community.</P>
      <P>Labour law is not uniform throughout the other member states but rather reflects the particular traditions and labour market conditions in each country.  The European Council has asked the Commission to carry out a comparative study of member states' legislation on working conditions.  This is at an advanced stage and when published will help decision making in relation to harmonisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some harmonisation of labour law has already taken place as a result of Community instruments.  The laws on employment equality and some aspects of safety at work are examples of this.  Limited harmonisation will continue in the form of Community Directives, particularly in the context of 1992.  However, in my view the complete harmonisation of labour law <Col N="1832" /> at European level is not a realistic proposition given the diversity of arrangements in the various countries.</P>

      <P>The 1987 Estimate for the Department of Labour included Sub-head T Grant-in-Aid Fund for Training and Employment of young people.  The type of activities to be funded from the Sub-head were contained in the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, and the amount of the provision related mainly to receipts from the youth employment levy.  In brief, the activities related to the employment and training of young people.  In 1987, a total of £33.090 million was transferred from the Department of Labour's Sub-head T to the Department of Education towards funding relevant programmes, particularly the vocational preparation and training programme.</P>
      <P>Under the Labour Services Act, 1987 the levy became known as the employment and training levy.  It is allocated by the Minister for Labour with the consent of the Minister for Finance to fund the type of activities listed in the Youth Employment Agency Act except that the age constraint has been removed.  Activities funded include those of FÁS, CERT and certain programmes of the Department of Education.  A sum of £30 million was allocated from Subhead T in 1988 to the Votes for Second Level and Further Education (Vote 29) and Third Level and Further Education (Vote 30).  The distribution of the allocation within these Department of Education Votes is a matter for that Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the three teacher unions, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland and the Teachers' Union of Ireland have recently announced their intention to enter into negotiations on an amalgamation of the three unions.  The negotiations are, I understand, at a relatively early stage. Before the amalgamation can be finalised an instrument of amalgamation will have to be approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and a ballot of the membership of the three unions will have to be held.  I understand that the unions will not be in a position to ballot their members on the amalgamation until some time next year.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Trade Union Act, 1975, grants may be paid by my Department towards the expenses incurred by unions in an amalgamation or transfer of engagements.  However, grants can only be paid at present, where a merger has been successfully completed.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the proposed merger of the three teacher unions and to say that I hope the negotiations will reach a successful conclusion.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to encourage trade union rationalisation.  We are at present witnessing a very widespread move among unions towards mergers and I welcome this.</P>

      <P>The free movement of workers is a basic principle of the European Community. Under the EC rules governing the free movement of workers the Government is obliged to assist persons wishing to obtain employment elsewhere in the Community.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (1) (g) of the Labour Services Act, 1987, FÁS is required to facilitate and assist persons who are seeking employment abroad in a state that is a member of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>In carrying out its obligations under the Act and under the European Community free movement provisions, FÁS provides pre-departure advisory services at two levels:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" />  (a)  to inform interested parties of the job-opportunities and working conditions elsewhere in the EC; and</P>
    <P>(b)  to discourage those unprepared and ill-suited for emigration and to offer them the option of a training scheme or employment programme at home.  This is particularly intended for groups such as early school leavers and involves programmes such as Youthreach.</P>
    <P>FÁS also participates in the EC sponsored SEDOC system.  This is operated in conjunction with the employment services of other member states and involves the exchange of notifications of job vacancies and applications for employment between EC members states.  This means that any national of a member state may, through his local employment office or national SEDOC section, apply to take up employment in another member state of the European Communities. Information is exchanged on a regular basis between the specialist services in each member state on:</P>
    <P> (a)  vacancies unfilled or unlikely to be filled by manpower from the national labour market and</P>
    <P>(b)  applicants for employment who have declared themselves actually ready and available to accept employment in another country.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the internal market in 1992, leading to the removal of remaining barriers to free movement of labour and the probability of labour shortages of some of the more economically advanced member states, FÁS is improving its services to workers seeking employment abroad.  I should add that there is a fair degree of uniformity throughout the European Communities in the skills and qualifications in demand.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that with improvements already in train and developments being planned, FÁS will be in a position to assist positively Irish workers wishing to avail themselves of their right to work in another member state.</P>

      <P>I agree with the implication in the question that workers have a right to know what their companies are doing, or failing to do, in terms of coming to grips with the completed internal market.  I would take this opportunity to advise employers to take appropriate measures both to plan for 1992 and to keep workers informed. Indeed, for the enterprises themselves the maintenance of good communications with their workers offers the only prospect of securing co-operation for any necessary changes in preparation for 1992.</P>
      <P>Having advocated good employer-worker communications, I have to say that I believe that there is no one mechanism, like a standing committee, for enabling such communications to take effect and it is not the intention to prescribe any single method.  It is essentially a matter for each company to decide on how best this can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The total number of redundancies notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts in the four months, January-April, 1989 is 5,403.  This is made up of 1,388 notifications in January, 1,375 in February, 1,232 in March and 1,408 in April.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figure of notifications in the first four months of 1988 was 9,202.  This year's figure, therefore, represents a decrease of over 41 per cent for the same period last year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, following the recent Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants conference at Saint John of God's, Stillorgan, Dublin 14, he is prepared to recommend to the Government that his Department be given overall responsibility for Irish migrant affairs; if, as a consequence of that overall responsibility, it is his intention to appoint a Labour Attaché to the embassies in the United States and in the EC member state capitals in order to co-ordinate his Department's affairs in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the welfare of Irish nationals abroad, including Irish emigrants to the United States, rests with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The question of the provision of consular services to look after the interests of Irish nationals abroad is a matter for that Minister. The difficulties experienced by Irish people abroad result from a number of factors, of which labour market problems are only one.</P>
      <P>An inter-departmental committee, under the chairmanship of an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs, oversees co-ordination between Government Departments concerned with different aspects of emigration.  My Department are represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> Because of the historical common labour market links between Britain and Ireland my Department has a role in relation to the welfare of Irish workers going to Britain.  This involves the provision, through FÁS, of pre-departure information and advisory services for persons interested in seeking work abroad and also the allocation, on the advice of DION (the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services) of Government grants to voluntary organisations operating front-line emergency services for Irish emigrants in Britain.  In the 1989 budget, the moneys allocated to my Department for this purpose, were doubled from £150,000 to £500,000.  I believe that our present organisational arrangements are the best possible to deal with the complex and varied needs of Irish people either working or seeking work abroad.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the serious lack of manpower available to the Garda Síochána in the Dún Laoghaire area, County Dublin, on a recent occasion when a person (details supplied) reported a suspected break-in it was a full hour before the gardaí were in a position to respond to the call; that the person concerned was informed that there was only one car available to answer several calls in an area ranging over Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey, Cabinteely, Leopardstown, Sallynoggin, Glenageary and other areas; and if he will increase the level of manpower available to deal with this situation.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that a response time of one hour to an incident is completely exceptional and that the delay in this case was due to the need to respond immediately to an unusually high number of more urgent calls for assistance which were received at the time.  I am informed that the response time of gardaí to calls for assistance from areas in the Dún Laoghaire division is generally satisfactory.  It is not the case that only one car was available to cover the various areas referred to on that night &mdash; in fact three cars were on patrol duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he intends to honour the agreement entered into between himself and the Land Registry staff union on 16 December 1988 for 22 promotions and 37 redeployed computer staff; the rank of the seven staff recently appointed.</P>

      <P>Following negotiations between my Department and the Civil and Public Services' Staff Union, proposals for 21 internal promotions and the assignment of 35 additional staff members, who were to be redeployed from elsewhere in the public service, were agreed with the union in December last, with the approval of the Department of Finance.  The promotions took effect on 20 February 1989 but the additional staff to be provided by redeployment has not as yet become available.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 67 on 19 April 1989, my Department are having discussions with the Department of Finance concerning the urgent provision of additional staff for the Land Registry.  As a result of these discussions, 11 clerical assistants and one messenger, these are not redeployed staff, have been assigned to the Land Registry since 18 April 1989 and further assignments are expected in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The question of filling the posts which were to have been filled by redeployment is still receiving attention.</P>

      <P>She continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity for work to the Department and she qualified for payment of benefit from 2 January 1989.  All payment due from 2 January 1989 to 1 May 1989, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has issued.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that an applicant must be available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 26 January 1989. Following inquiries her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking employment as she did not appear to have made any specific efforts to secure work.  She appealed on 16 April 1989 against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy refers to the disability benefit claim of the <Col N="1853" /> person concerned.  He was paid disability benefit to 9 January 1989, when payment was disallowed following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He expressed dissatisfaction with the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee, on 6 February 1989, who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He submitted an appeal last month against the disallowance and included additional medical evidence which was considered by the medical adviser who has concluded that it does not affect the findings earlier of the two medical referees.</P>
      <P>The case is now being submitted to an appeal officer for decision.  That officer may decide case summarily or may decide to hold an oral hearing.  If an oral hearing is being held the person concerned will be advised as soon as possible of the venue, date and time of the hearing.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Following a reinvestigation of his circumstances, he was assessed with weekly means of £92.52 derived from income from self-employment and from capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed the means assessed against him and on 28 April 1989, an <Col N="1854" /> appeals officer assessed him with means of £15 per week effective from 12 October 1988.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for treatment benefit, which comprises dental, optical and aural benefits, a person aged 66 years or over must have at least 208 reckonable contributions paid since entry into insurance together with 39 paid or credited contributions in either of the last two complete contribution years before reaching age 66.  The vast majority of persons who work up to pension age satisfy those conditions and, together with their dependent spouses, remain qualified for treatment benefit for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>Persons who retire early and who continue to be capable of and available for work may sign on for credited contributions at their local employment exchange.  More flexible arrangements in relation to signing on apply to persons in this category.  Similarly, those who retire early because of illness may receive credited contributions for weeks of certified incapacity for work.  Credited contributions awarded in these ways continue to qualify the person for treatment benefit.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the position as outlined above, it is not considered that early retirees are in an anomalous position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other workers as regards entitlement to treatment benefit.</P>

    <Title>Written Answers. - Imports of Tropical Timber.</Title>
    <P>59.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has any proposals to discourage the import of tropical timber and the replacement of same by softwoods in light of the evidence available of the destruction of tropical rain forests and the serious environmental and other consequences of same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of Ireland's obligations under the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983, the terms of which were approved by the House on 28 June 1984, it is not possible to actively discourage imports of tropical timber. Such a step would also run counter to the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite accept, however, that the destruction of tropical forests is a very serious and complex issue requiring much careful thought in relation to the many factors which must be taken into account, including, in particular, the economic realities in those countries where the forests are located.  For example, it must be borne in mind that in many areas tropical <Col N="1857" /> forests are under great threat also from the ever increasing demand for agricultural land and that steps taken merely to obstruct the tropical timber trade could well prove counterproductive in the long term.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that no action is being taken on this matter.  Already, the subject has been carefully considered at European Community level where it has been agreed that any action, to be effective, would have to be on the basis of a broad consensus between consumers and producers regarding continuation of a viable timber trade, coupled with reafforestation measures to maintain the ecological balance.  A proposal from certain Community trade interests for the imposition of a levy on imports to fund <Col N="1858" /> reafforestation projects is among the possibilities currently under discussion in this regard.  My Department are closely monitoring developments in this area.</P>

      <P>There are no provisions in existing food legislation which specifically prohibit the importation of irradiated food.</P>
      <P>While no food irradiation is carried out in this country over 18 countries have reported commercial activities in food irradiation and approximately 30 industrial irradiation facilities are under construction or being planned.  There is no satisfactory method of scientific analysis available to food control agencies which would enable them to determine whether food has been irradiated prior to importation.</P>
      <P>Following extensive international research food irradiation was approved in 1981 by the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency for use in certain foods at specified levels.  Countries which are currently engaged in food irradiation include the USA, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France, Israel, Netherlands, South Africa and the USSR.  The most common types of foods irradiated are potatoes, poultry, strawberries and spices.</P>
      <P>An EC working party have been considering the adoption of a directive on irradiated foods for some time.  The EC proposal is that foodstuffs may only be irradiated if there is a food hygiene need, or a demonstrable technological or other advantage or benefit to the consumer and if the foodstuffs are wholesome and in a proper condition.  Irradiation should not be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practice.  Foodstuffs irradiated may be marketed only if their packages and containers comply with the Food Labelling Directive (79/112/EEC) and the Commission is considering a proposal to make specific provision in this directive in relation to indication of irradiation so that the consumer will be fully able to exercise a choice in the matter.</P>

The normal post-contract and pre-commissioning works need to be carried out before the in-patient element of Phase 1C can be equipped and opened.</P>
    <P>The total revenue allocation to St. James's Hospital in 1989 is £36.628 million. I have provided £8.2 million for equipping and commissioning the radiology, outpatients and accident and emergency departments: £6.9 million of this has been expended to date and is included in the total capital figure set out above.

      <P>I recently met a deputation regarding this project.  My Department has approved the provision of an extension and the upgrading of existing buildings to enable the school to cater for 500 pupil places.  The proposed new accommodation will consist of: seven general classrooms, one social studies area, one science laboratory plus prep.  resource area, one demonstration room, two domestic science rooms, and one flat, one dress design and materials room, one PE hall, library, guidance suite, administration and ancillary accomodation.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning of the project has reached Stage 3 (developed sketch scheme) of the Department's design team procedures.  However, the rate at which this proposal, as with all other capital projects, may proceed is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on my Department's commitments and priorities.</P>
      <P>I assured the deputation that I would contact the school in the near future regarding the possible further development of the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision in the Bill imposes an increase in excise on petrol.  It was operative from 26 January 1989 and effectively increased the price of petrol by the amount set out in the budget on that day.  At the time the increase was proposed, the Progressive Democrats asked the Minister whether it was inflationary, likely to lead to a general increase in costs and likely to damage the tourist industry.  We made the point at that time that unless it could be shown not to have those characteristics, it was a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for his part vainly sought to assure this House on that occasion that <Col N="1888" /> the increase in petrol provided for by way of increase in excise duty would be totally absorbed by what he anticipated would be a fall in petrol prices and that, as a consequence, there would be no change in the overall cost of petrol to the consumer but that the share to the Exchequer would be increased by the amount set out in the amendment.  The Minister obviously took an over-optimistic view of the movement in oil prices. I am aware that he is the Minister for Finance and not the Minister for Energy and no one can claim to have clairvoyance in the area of oil prices but as things have transpired, the resolution passed by this House that night has added to an inflationary push on petrol prices.</P>
    <P>The response of the Government has been remarkable to say the least.  Faced with a real price increase in petrol of somewhere between 20 pence and 25 pence per gallon their response was twofold. First they required the oil companies to desist from non-price competition in the form of gift schemes and other promotional devices, with which I have to say I am in general agreement but I would have to add that the purpose of the Government intervening in that regard was to persuade the oil companies to absorb the cost of these promotions from their profits so as to cushion the price increase in petrol.  Secondly, the Government sought to mitigate the price increase by the device of resorting to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation's activities at Whitegate and under-cutting the general prevailing spot price for petrol.  By seeking to use the Irish National Petroleum Corporation the Government sought to, again, cushion the consumer from the full extent of the shift in the market price for petrol which otherwise would be payable.</P>
    <P>This is a Finance Bill and I do not want to get into a long excursus on the history of petrol prices or the behaviour of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter, but I will satisfy myself by saying that by adopting publicly an aggressive and pugnacious posture and then backing off in a most timid manner, the credibility of the Government was <Col N="1889" /> somewhat damaged.  Much more serious than that is the fact that the Irish National Petroleum Corporation are cushioning the price of petrol for a short term political purpose, preventing an increase in the consumer price index from having full effect.  I thought it was the Government's intention to kick past 16 May &mdash; the next date on which the CPI is calculated &mdash; the inflationary effects of the petrol increase, but I have been assured by the Minister here present that I was wrong in thinking that and I doff my hat to him.  However, I did not realise the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, would have thought of a different way of achieving the same result.  It now appears that the inflationary effect is the subject of a different conjuring trick.  This is what I have referred to before as Tommy Cooper economics, blundering conjuring tricks which would be funny if they were not so pathetic.</P>
    <P>The Government recently disposed of their Tara Mines shareholding to the Finnish majority shareholder in that company. We have been told that they propose to apply the proceeds of that sale to up-grading the activities of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation at Whitegate.  At the same time they are asking the INPC to undertake a £2 million per month loss.  If one is to up-grade a facility and ask a company to behave commercially, but then ask them to conspire effectively with the Government to defeat the apparent outcome of market forces for a political end, then by a slow process the £35 million raised from the disposal of Tara Mines shares is going to be frittered away in a cosmetic operation on petrol prices.</P>
    <P>It comes down to this: If the Government were serious about keeping down inflation and if they could have anticipated the increase in petrol prices, they would not have imposed this extra duty by way of resolution on budget day.  Since they now know with the benefit of hindsight that that decision and the assurances given by the Minister to this House were wrong, it behoves the Government to surrender, in the national interest, the cost of this matter to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1890" /> What I am saying, in effect, is that this is an inflationary provision.  It is one which is having a serious effect on the overall consumer price index.  It would have had a more serious effect were it not for the steps taken by the Government in relation to abusing the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to disguise the full effect.  It is something which damages the country on every front &mdash; in relation to tourism, industry, business, the consumer price index and the ordinary person's living standards.  It is unjustificable, it flies in the face of everything we are talking about in terms of trying to reduce Ireland's disadvantages in Europe and increases transport costs in a peripheral area of the Community.  On those grounds I reiterate the opposition of the Progressive Democrats, which was made clear at the time of the budget, to this measure and we are opposing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy when he says that I am not a clairvoyant in the matter of oil prices.  Petrol prices are reviewed every month by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The 5p. increase in excise duty in January represented a reduction that was available in January; it represents less than 0.1 per cent on the consumer price index.  There was no way any of us could have known a ship would run aground in Alaska and knock out the Alaskan pipeline which supplied oil to America.  As a result, the Americans came to Europe to buy up all the available petrol supplies.  On 1 April every year &mdash; you can set your watch by it &mdash; the international oil industry stock up petrol for the summer months. Because of the very mild weather there was an over-supply of gas oil and a shortage of petrol.  That, coupled with the Americans buying all the available petrol in Europe had the effect of pushing up the price of petrol on the Rotterdam market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could speculate on what the price may be for the rest of the year but only one week ago it was reported on a morning radio programme that Saudi Arabia expected international crude prices to go to $25 per barrel.  The same afternoon crude oil prices had dropped back to $18 <Col N="1891" /> per barrel on the Rotterdam market.  It is not possible to forecast what the price may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Mandy Rice Davies will look after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect someone in the oil business, like Saudi Arabia, to know more about it than I. They claimed that the price would go to $25 but on the same day it dropped to $18.</P>
      <P>The Government take the view that the INPC run their business over a full year period, not over a month or two months.  The best advice on the future trend in oil prices is that they will come down in the second half of this year. Consequently we lose money in one part of the year but make it in the other part. We have no intention, good, bad or indifferent, of using the money from the sale of Tara Mines shares to prop up an artificial price in INPC.  As the Minister for Energy has already stated, that money will be used to develop and modernise refining capacity at Whitegate.</P>
      <P>Another development in the oil industry in that they have taken out a lot of their refining capacity, in America and elsewhere, and not replaced it.  Those who study the trends will know what is happening in the oil industry, that the major portion of the profit is being taken at the refining end where the companies are in control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants to examine what the position should be <i>vis-à-vis</i> crude oil to petrol one should refer to the time when crude oil was 28.5 dollars per barrel early in 1984.  When it was that price the price of petrol was the same as it is now.  One must ask why, if crude oil prices fell back from 28.5 dollars to less than 20 dollars per barrel, petrol prices should be so high.  It all comes out of the same barrel of crude.  That distortion exists and I hope the Fair Trade Commission inquiry will focus on that aspect.  Crude oil prices are down nine dollars per barrel but we do not seem to have had a reduction in the <Col N="1892" /> price of petrol.  Some interesting questions remain to be answered in relation to that.  Prices are reviewed on a monthly basis and in January I could not have known that we would run into a serious supply problem that would result in an increase in the price in the next few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Having listened to the Minister I cannot accept that he was fully advised by the Department of Industry and Commerce before he made his budgetary decision.  Clearly, in the budget speech the Minister said that there would be a reduction at the pumps which would compensate for the increase in excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>And there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Within 12 days that reduction was lost and the price at the pumps went up again.  The Taoiseach, when taking the Financial Resolutions on budget night, gave a commitment that the price at the pumps would reduce.  The information available to all of us on that night was that the commitment could not be kept.  There is enough on the record to show the serious doubts we had about the promise that the price at the pumps would reduce.  The lead-in time before circumstances such as the value of the dollar or the price of crude tips into the retail price of petrol is more than two weeks but within two weeks of the budget statement the price at the pumps had gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister who did his job on budget night but I would argue strongly that the relevant information was available or should have been available in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The trigger time is certainly not two weeks and anything that would have happened within two weeks of the budgetary announcement should have been, and would have been, known in the Department of Industry and Commerce and, probably, in the Department of Energy.  Something went wrong in the line of communication from <Col N="1893" /> the Department of Energy to the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and on to the Minister for Finance.  There is no point in saying that the Government, and the administration, acted in all innocence on budget night about the expectation that the price at the pumps would drop to compensate for the excise increase and that the price would stay down.  That argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>Some of us were, like I was for a short time, in a position to monitor the flow through of the hardening position of the dollar, the increase in crude prices, how the review takes place periodically and how we come to have an announcement of an increase or reduction about the fifth of each month.  A mechanism has been in place for a long time.  The point I wish to stitch into the record is that the lead-in time is longer than two weeks.  The increase occurred within two weeks of the budget and there is no doubt that that information was or should have been, available in the relevant Department.  I accept that the Minister acted in a bona fide manner on the night of the budget and that he spoke on the basis of the information available to him at that time. I am not making any accusations against him but there was a breakdown in the system.  It should not happen again. When breakdowns like that can occur within the relevant Departments one must come to the conclusion that they are not the greatest people to go tiger-shooting with.  I would prefer to have more reliable allies behind my back if I was taking on the oil companies than those who could not see a fortnight ahead from the relevant information that should have been available.</P>
    <P>I accept that a lot of what has happened since was unpredictable.  On the night of the budget I argued that the price of crude oil was almost 18 dollars per barrel and Deputy O'Malley contradicted me and said it was back down to about 17 dollars per barrel.  Texas crude, in the days when we used get CNN in my part of the country, was over 18 dollars a barrel the week before the budget.  North Sea Brent might have been slightly lower, <Col N="1894" /> about 16.5 or 17 dollars per barrel.  There was no expectation at that stage that the price would go above 20 dollars per barrel but it has gone above that price and slipped back again.  I take the Minister's point that he is not responsible for the activities of drunk tanker captains off the coast of Alaska and we would not expect him to be responsible for such events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>He washes his hands of all those occurences.  He tries to evade his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is true to say that the gentleman in charge of that tanker did not cause the whole problem in Ireland.  He had some influence on it but it was a fairly marginal one and was temporary. In the spring time the trend was upward and that was accompanied by a dollar which was strengthened and is continuing to do so.  There has been a fall in the price of crude but the dollar is strengthening.  One may balance one against the other but there is no guarantee that the price is going to drift down in the autumn, as the Minister optimistically suggested on the last occasion he took Questions in the House.  The price of crude may reduce to 18 dollars or 19 dollars per barrel, or lower, but if the dollar continues to strengthen the swings and roundabouts will come into effect and we will continue to have problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that bogus war he declared on the oil companies.  That was a pure cod and it diminished the standing of the Government and of the Minister.  For an administration which purports to believe in a market economy and in market forces to be in north County Dublin, King Canute-like, looking out at the waves being engendered by international oil prices and currency fluctuations and saying one could keep them out with a four-pronged fork is nothing short of ridiculous. The Minister for Industry and Commerce got involved in a lot of unseemly stunting and blustering and we are still left with that particular bubble in the oil pipeline.  The Minister's bluster is <Col N="1895" /> not yet out of the pipeline because the increase that came through last week is not the full increase.  When trick-of-the-loop economics is applied in an attempt to turn back the strength of market forces which are inevitable there will be severe problems.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Petroleum company will be the victim.  This is against everything that the previous Government stood for and is against everything that the leading members of this Administration are on the record as standing for in respect of the running of State companies.  A State company is being forced to run at a loss.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance, said on numerous occasions that the standards which apply in the private sector will have to apply in the commercial State bodies. They have said that the same disciplines will have to apply and that those State companies will have to run their affairs so as to make a profit.  That is fair and we agree on that.  We are not in the business of carrying passengers.  However, to put a company like the INPC in the position that it is effectively subsidising the price of petrol is to put them in a most invidious position.  I should like the Minister to put figures on this.  I have been told that Whitegate is now losing somewhere between £1 million and £1.5 million a month.  I do not know if that figure is accurate but somebody should put a figure on this loss.  There is no point in saying that they bought it cheap so they can sell it cheap.  That is not the way it works.  If it was bought cheaply but has to be replaced dearly, they will have to move the price at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Irish National Petroleum Company will last for very long &mdash; I do not know what the intentions of the Government are in this regard &mdash; carrying that below cost selling and loss trading.  While they may last for a short period I think the limit on this will be four or five weeks.  I am seriously worried now about the antics of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who got us into this situation by declaring a phoney war which he cannot possibly win and which <Col N="1896" /> is having repercussions now on the Irish National Petroleum Company.  When that is coupled with the sale of the Government's stake in Tara Mines and the availability of a great chunk of money &mdash; £25 million or £26 million &mdash; for the refurbishment of Whitegate there is a temptation to use the capital sum which accrued to the State to subsidise the price of fuel.  We are all for low cost economies and keeping energy costs down but forcing a State company to trade at a loss is not the way to do business and is very shortsighted.</P>
    <P>Already there has been a 5p increase in a gallon of petrol, which occured on budget night.  It was only a week before the budget that the price of diesel went up something like 8p a gallon.  How anybody could have come into the House and said that the increased excise on petrol would be cancelled out when the week before very similar factors had triggered an increase in the price of auto diesel is difficult to sustain.  We had that increase, it went down for two weeks and then it came back up, and now we have the 5 May increase.  I think there is another increase on the way because the Minister has not allowed the full increase as a result of the market forces to come through so that there will be a June increase.  There is also the increase that was lagged because of the Whitegate situation. We need clarification on this aspect.  What we need is a statement on what increases are imminent and not inquiries into the conduct of the petrol company and that kind of smokescreen. These inquiries might have some merit in calmer times but now they look as if they are simply engineered distractions to give some credibility to a Minister who measured it wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious side to this because it is putting up costs.  If it is for international reasons we do not have a whole lot of choice in it because we have not got the kind of revenue resources anyway where we can use tax foregone to keep prices down at the pump.  If the Minister for Finance is correct and things begin to settle at the end of the year so that there will be a reduction anyway, we <Col N="1897" /> should see ourselves through the sticky patch by following the market forces and allowing the prices to come down when conditions justify that.</P>
    <P>It has a more serious effect than that on the price of energy: it has an effect on confidence.  When a senior Minister of Government is seen to be bungling publicly it does not help and when that kind of bungling runs into the inflation figures and there is a widespread belief, as there is now, that a deliberate attempt has been made to keep down the consumer price index figures for 16 May that does not help confidence either.  It looks as if the CPI will be just under 4 per cent on 16 May.  There has been mention of a figure of 3.9 per cent and last week the Minister talked about 3.75 per cent for the year. However, it is now expected that it will be 3.9 per cent as a result of the petrol increase on 5 May.  If I am right there will be another significant increase in June and on 10p of that there is the question of the Irish National Petroleum Company and a strengthening in the dollar.  The exchange rate yesterday for the dollar was $1.39 to the Irish pound, the strongest it has been since August last year, I think.  Whatever about the trend in the price of crude that strengthening in the dollar will be a counter current which will negative any gain there may be in the drop in the price of crude.</P>
    <P>Those are a number of issues of a general nature which the Minister should provide the House with information on. First &mdash; and I am not putting this to the Minister in any political way &mdash; he should try to project what increases are there now on the basis of the evidence available. How long does the Minister think these increases will be in the system before the price comes back down to where it was on budget night?  How does he relate the increasing cost in the price of petrol and diesel to the consumer price index and overall inflation not only in 1989 terms but also for the 12 month period from say, June to June or from mid-May to mid-May so that we will get the full year bang of the energy increases rather than taking half year calculations and making the effect look smaller than <Col N="1898" /> what it actually is?  I should like to hear the Minister's views on these issues before we conclude this section.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to refresh our memories again and tell us, in millions of pounds, what the total take in a full year will be from the 5p excise which was put on petrol and the consequential increases on diesel and so on so that if a decision was taken today not to go ahead with this increase we would know how much the Exchequer would be short.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was watching the Chester races in my office while at the same time listening to the very reasoned tones of the Minister.  I had to leave my office to come across to the House because his folksy style of debate, reminescent of Ronald Reagan at his best, makes him seem to be a most rational man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, neither he nor his colleagues were as reasonable about the world price of oil during the four and a half years we were on that side of the House.  There were impassioned cries from Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, about the price of petrol.  As a Deputy who comes from the Border area one Saturday afternoon I had to watch the then spokesman on Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, when he came to Newry with a fanfare of trumpets to assess the situation in the Border area.  He had more photographers with him on that occasion than Mrs. Gorbachev had on her visit to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is saying something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>He acknowledged the plight of the people who lived in my deprived area but like all Fianna Fáil fairy tales he did nothing about it when he got into power.  I want to ask the Minister if it is the intention of the Government to destroy all businesses in the Border <Col N="1899" /> region.  No Government in the past 20 years &mdash; including Fine Gael Governments &mdash; have recognised the plight of the people in the Border area and in particular the unfortunate traders, many of whom have gone under.  In recent years we have had to deal with the spectre of sheriffs collecting in an area where traders should have been subsidised by the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned carrying out an inquiry, which I believe is a smokescreen. The inquiry should be carried out into the immoral size of the State take from petrol.  The differential in the price of petrol is £1.20 between Newry and my town of Dundalk, an incredible differential driving people across the Border in hordes.  At one stage some years ago I likened the cavalcade to a pilgrimage to Mecca, there were so many people going across, when the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a revealing photograph taken from a helicopter showing the cavalcade of cars three miles long.  That sight can still be seen in any part of the Border area and will be with increasing frequency because of the latest decision to increase the price of petrol.  Why does the State not take a lesser take in order to help unfortunate motorists in Border areas and more particularly those unfortunate people who continue to endeavour to provide a service at petrol pumps for people living in those areas?  For example, there are no petrol stations open in the town of Clones, the petrol being available in County Fermanagh. That is the fault of the Irish Government and nobody else's.  I have been told in Dundalk of people driving into petrol stations for 25p worth of petrol to get them to the promised land just three miles down the road.  How on earth can people be expected to remain in business in those wartime conditions without any help, subsidisation or indeed any type of rates relief from this Government.  We must also remember that a trader will be paying the same rates as five years ago when he may have had a weekly turnover of approximately £4,000 or £5,000 whereas today he might have a weekly <Col N="1900" /> turnover of £100.  There has been no recognition of the plight of traders in Border areas.</P>
    <P>Although petrol is the real attraction it is not the only one.  When families get used to travelling across the Border at weekends they tend to buy their Sunday joint, have their shoes repaired and buy other household commodities.  This means there is a huge haemorrhage of money across the Border essentially on account of the greed of the Irish Government extracting too much tax out of a lucrative market.  The motorist is an easy target and has no protection.  Unfortunately, traders who have survived in Border areas have received no protection from this or any previous Government over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that, in Border areas, the law of diminishing returns obtains.  I would ask him to recognise that fact, when I will be the first to applaud him.  The price of petrol is too dear in this State.  This means the Minister is consigning a whole area along the Border, encompassing five countries, if not more, from which people travel in order to fill their tanks with petrol, leading to a huge hole in our economy.  I exhort the Minister for Finance to be the first Minister to acknowledge that fact and reduce the price of petrol to a realistic level.  The year 1992 is not far off.  With this in mind surely some type of levelling off, however small, could be initiated.  If the economy of the Border region is to be sustained it must receive some help but it has received none over the past 20 years.  People living in Border areas are saying in increasing numbers to all political parties, &ldquo;a plague on both your houses&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge what he knows to be a fact and help those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McGahon I should say we must recognise what is the reality, that is that petrol is dearer here than across the Border.  The gap has been narrowed somewhat as a result of the number of increases granted in the United Kingdom but there still remains a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> The proposals for the harmonisation of taxes in 1992 have been around for a long time.  They have not received any great degree of support within the member states.  Consequently the new Commissioner for fiscality and customs union affairs, Madame Schrivener, is expected to put a new set of proposals in relation to the harmonisation of taxes to the Commission within the next couple of weeks. It is quite clear that she is not proceeding with the older set of proposals which had not received any measure of agreement. One cannot anticipate what will be contained in the new set of proposals.  For example, she may adopt a different approach altogether and go for approximation on a regional basis; I do not know; that is pure speculation at this stage.  Let us hope that the new proposals will receive a greater degree of support than the last lot so that we can move toward harmonisation of taxes between now and 1992.  That is the only realistic way in which the problems in Border areas about which Deputy McGahon spoke can be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I would like to be in the position of saying that I did not need money, that money was not required by the Exchequer, that I could narrow the gap. However, the House will know full well the financial problems confronting us, that, while we have reduced the borrowing requirement as a percentage of Gross National Product, we cannot stop there.  Certainly I will take appropriate steps as soon as I know what objectives must be achieved in the area of harmonisation of taxes.  At the same time I will continue to point out to the Community in Brussels that the Exchequer problems posed for us, on the basis of the former proposals, were such that they could not be resolved by an Irish Government or economy on the one hand harmonising taxes with a huge loss to the Exchequer &mdash; emanating from one side in Brussels &mdash; while, on the other side, the Commission points out to us that we must get our national finances in order. They constitute two contradictory directions to us from Brussels.  At the same time, from a Community point of view, <Col N="1902" /> it is unrealistic to think that we could take on board the type of Exchequer loss of revenue we would be forced to incur in order to undertake that task.  It is just not realistic.  It may well be that the new proposals, having taken account not alone of our problems but those of the British, the Danes and others, will constitute a more realistic approach.</P>
    <P>What else could we do in relation to the Border countries?  I recognise the problem fully &mdash; I do not live that far from the Border myself &mdash; which is that whenever there has been a price differential of anything more than 5 per cent or 6 per cent, there is always this cross-Border traffic with its attendant distortion of trade.</P>
    <P>The 48-hour rule we introduced was beneficial &mdash; I know Deputy McGahon would be the first to admit it &mdash; and is still maintained there.  It is a question of whenever the case might come up at the European Court but, as far as I am concerned, it will obtain until I am forced to abolish it.  Indeed I am not so sure we will lose the case in the European Court either.  I have always contended that it is a distortion of trade that is taking place. Equally the Community must ensure that no distortion of trade takes place in contravention of their competition rules.  It will be an interesting case to follow whenever it arises.  People appear to assume that we will lose the case.  I am not so sure at all that we will lose it.</P>
    <P>I recognise and know the problems caused by the price differential in petrol to which Deputy McGahon referred.  I am aware of the number of petrol stations that have closed down, that sell only a few gallons of petrol to take people across the Border.  However, I might point to another problem, that I regard as a very serious development, the smuggling of petrol and diesel.  Since coming into the Department of Finance I have been examining ways and means of devising a licensing system for dealing in petrol. The proposal here today constitutes a minor one but is a step in the right direction.  Such a licensing arrangement would give Customs and Excise officials authority to seize all records and anything else they needed in that respect. <Col N="1903" /> The problem appears to be so serious we may well have to go further.  I am examining ways and means of how I can arm Customs and Excise officials in relation to it.  For example, I extended their inspection areas 40 miles from the Border.  I am at present examining an adjustment of that mileage.  It must be acknowledged that there is big money being made out of smuggling activities. I am examining ways and means of trying to prevent it.  Apart from the distortion of trade it constitutes a big loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure Deputy Noonan was aware at the time he asked that there is not available to me here on this kind of debate the information that is available in the Departments of Industry and Commerce or Energy in regard to endeavouring to project what might be the price of oil over the next 12 months, or how the dollar might fare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On the evening of the budget we did not have the next 12 months projections for the price of petrol and oil or for the performance of the dollar.  The Deputy must be joking.  The dollar could affect prices if it continued to get stronger.  I carried out an analysis recently and when I looked at 1987 as compared with 1988 &mdash; with the fluctuations in the dollar alone and that aspect of it &mdash; strangely enough the fluctuations in 1987 balanced out the fluctuations in 1988.  For the first quarter of this year the wide divergence in the value of the dollar only represented parameters of 142 to 146.  It goes up and down but over a two and a half year period it balances out.  In an analysis of what happened over the last two and a quarter years you can discount the dollar but if you want to take the first quarter in it is a penny a gallon against the oil companies in Rotterdam spot prices.  I think Deputy Noonan would also know from his own experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce that half way through <Col N="1904" /> the month one just does not know.  The formula is based on what movements take place in Rotterdam on a mean class average for whatever month one is talking about.  For the month of May the movements would be reflected in a review about the fifth, sixth or seventh of the month.  But it does reflect what happens in the whole month.</P>

Whatever one may say about the public inquiry I want to see a certain number of things coming from it.  As I said earlier, and I was only drawing from memory &mdash; though I have a paper on oil prices which is very interesting &mdash; I have the full run down on petrol for every month from July 1984 to April 1989 &mdash; in July 1984 petrol on the spot in Rotterdam which is the basis of the formula we use, was $265.77 at a time when the barrel of crude oil was $28.24.  Now we come to the month that sparked off the first confrontation with the Minister and the oil companies, the month of March.  Regarding the review of 5 April concerning the 5p, the Minister and the Government took the view that because gifts were costing in or about that amount, in the interests of customers it was better to do away with the gifts and give them petrol at the price it should be sold at.  I am sure there is no Deputy in this House who would disagree with me &mdash; Deputy Noonan has had his own experience &mdash; when I say that there is no petrol sales competition in this country.  There are a few small Irish companies who try to create some competition.</P>

When I took the 10p from them I told them they could discontinue the gifts if they so wished and make a contribution to the 10p.  At that stage no retailer was carrying any cost of the gifts. The response of the major oil companies in that situation was: &ldquo;We will put half the cost of the gifts on to the retailer.&rdquo; They forced the retailer to pay half the cost of the gifts.  We are not affected by the retailers margin.  It was the oil companies and the suppliers who forced the retailers to pay the cost of the gifts. That is exactly what happened.</P>

      <P>These are very interesting factors to look at.  Now we will come back to the month which was in dispute &mdash; the month of March, for the April review.  During that month the on the spot Rotterdam price for a barrel of crude was $17.48 and the price of petrol was $206, in April the price of crude went up to $19.83 and the petrol soared to £268.  If you go back to look for $268 you will find that in July 1984 when crude was $28.24 the price of petrol was $265.  Those are the questions that need to be addressed in an inquiry and I hope they are addressed.</P>

      <P>Now that the Deputy has asked the question I will take him back to July 1987 when I took 10p straight off the retailers.  I did that because their margins were too high.  I will give the position as obtained in July 1987.  In July 1987 the barrel of crude oil cost $18.8 and the price of petrol was $194.57 which, <Col N="1908" /> when I calculated the margins, I considered to be too fat and I took 10p off. Now look at the position and compare it to the big row which erupted in April concerning the 5p when the price of the barrel of crude had dropped to $17.48 but yet the petrol was costing £206.83. The retailers were getting more for petrol in April when the row erupted than when I took 10p off them in July 1987.  I will give the bottom line cost of the 5p.</P>

It is very easy to continue putting an extra 5p on a gallon of petrol, and now there is another 12p.  My authority from the Border counties tell me that the 12p that has been put on our petrol must be compared with 8p across the Border.  There is another gap of 4p.  This, plus the Minister's 5p, is 9p and 1992 is not too far away.</P>
      <P>I look forward to it because I shall get cheaper goods, but with regard to the country's finances we are not doing anything to prepare ourselves.  The Minister is lecturing other people to get their act together and prepare for 1992 but this will sound very hollow if his Government &mdash; and he as Minister for Finance has to direct that Government into preparing themselves for 1992 &mdash; do not do that job.  You cannot keep telling everybody else to do it when you are not doing it yourselves.

      <P>I do not think the Minister got this message at all.  I think he needs a bit of schooling, as they say in racing parlance.  He has not really copped on to the job he will have over the next couple of years, with this extra 5p a gallon on petrol and blinding us with the sheet of paper about the spot price and all that. The only fellow who worries about the <Col N="1912" /> price of a gallon of petrol is the fellow at the petrol pump who hands out the money.  You can talk about the spot price and anything else but we are talking about a Government that are increasing their take when they should be reducing it in preparation for 1992.</P>
      <P>There is another side to this, and I shall give the Minister one bit of recognition. He has plenty of experience running a business.  He knows as well as I do that one of the things that are crippling our industry is the continuous high cost of telecommunications, postage, transport costs, insurance and the price of petrol. We ask why the private sector are not expanding, but look at the costs.  The Government are contributing to these costs with another 5p in this instance and the 12p they approved a couple of days ago.  That is 17p this Government have added to the price of a gallon of petrol in the last three months.  They can agrue what way they like, he as Minister for Finance has stood over a 17p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol in the last three months.</P>

I indict my colleagues on my own front bench who did not get the message either when I was pleading on behalf of the Border region. Now this Government are stonewalling in time honoured fashion.  It is the size of the take, based on greed, that is the problem with the price of petrol.  I would describe Governments in the recent past as being burglars who burgled the unfortunate Irish people, the Irish motorist and those in other areas who are easy prey.</P>

      <P>Drinkers and smokers, yes, and reformed terrorist organisations, too, who knew the way to the Irish banks in their time.  I want to acknowledge the effectiveness of the 48 hour rule and the initiative taken within a couple of days of the Government coming into office.  That kept immense amounts of money in our economy, but it did sweet Fanny Adams for the Border region.  People on trips from Kenmare and Kinsale were not coming to spend <Col N="1914" /> their money in the Border region, they were going across the Border and leaving unbelieveable sums of money with Margaret Thatcher.  That has stopped to a large extent and the Irish nation benefits, but the Minister is now giving a charter to increase smuggling and he himself made reference to smuggling.  Because his Department cannot quantify the figures he turns a blind eye; it is not happening. As petrol is being smuggled into every county in Ireland, it is not just the Border retailers who are hit, it is people all over the country.  It is a very lucrative trade. Many gangs, some possibly IRA influenced, are involved because the money is so big.  It is said that up to £5,000 profit can be made in a full tanker.  That is big money by any standards.  The Minister is encouraging that because he cannot quantify it.  The Department are like dummies, snap happy and turn a blind eye, it is not happening.  I tell the Minister it is happening and it is seriously damaging the economy.</P>
      <P>There is another side to the equation. Deputy Barrett referred very eloquently to 1992 and suggested that the Minister and his Government had been remiss in the period leading up to 1992.  They are going to continue complacently, like a rat nibbling poison he knows will kill him. They are going to screw the Irish motorist until the advent of 1992, instead of gently reducing the price of petrol in reasonable phases.</P>
      <P>I believe 1992 will not happen.  It is a giant con as far as the Government are concerned and the Minister has hinted over the last two years that the man in the street need not look forward with heightened anticipation to 1992.  I have no doubt the Government of the day will find ways and means to get lucrative returns from differentials.  It might come under a name, perhaps licences, but it will be there.  It is part of the general political charade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the plight of the 2,000 customs officials.  What is to happen to them?  Are they to be put out on grass, maybe consigned to hell or to Connaught? There is grave concern among those people.  They are not being given <Col N="1915" /> much information from the Government. One hundred and twenty have made their lives in my home town and naturally, they are concerned.  Most of them have families.  Those men perform a very good job for the nation.  They are confronted with the problem of dealing with smuggling and in recent years their lives have been at great risk.  There have been plenty of documented cases of them being assaulted and guns having been trained on them because smuggling is so lucrative and the gangs have become very sophisticated.</P>
    <P>Customs officers' homes are watched. The smugglers are in command of walkie-talkies and if a client is sitting outside the custom house they know when he is leaving and inform their colleagues along the line.  There are not enough customs officers to deal with the flood of smuggling not alone of petrol but of different consumer goods coming across the Border and the very lucrative trade in drink which the Minister is aware of. He is trying to hold back a torrent of smuggling with a handful of customs officers along the Border.</P>
    <P>In Dundalk in recent years lorries and goods have been seized and placed in custom compounds and on the same night gangsters have broken into the compounds and taken those goods and lorries back.  No Irish Government have come to terms with the depth of smuggling in the Border area and the forces trying to keep them at bay.  It will be scant recognition of the efforts of those officers over the years if they are put out to grass. I am sure the Minister recognises their difficulty, but can he give any indication how they will be dealt with?  Will they be absorbed into the system or is there a future for them in the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to Deputy McGahon and Deputy Barrett in relation to the Border and 1992.  I assure Deputy McGahon and the whole House that there will be no instant harmonisation in this country.  I have said many times, and am on the record as <Col N="1916" /> saying, it will be a gradual process.  We will have three Fianna Fáil budgets to go between now and 1992 in which I can take on board the harmonisation process when I know what the process is going to be.  I have explained in this debate that the old set of proposals are now off the table.  Deputy McGahon, a good, solid, sensible man, and Deputy Barrett would not buy a pig in a poke, neither would I. When I know what the harmonisation proposals are and when I see them getting a measure of support within the Community to be implemented, then I will take the necessary gradual steps, whatever they are.</P>
      <P>With regard to why I put on this or that, taxation is not an <i>a la carte</i> menu. If you say not to take £10 million out of one area, that means £10 million less will be given in personal tax reductions or some such thing.  You make a judgement at budget time as does any other Minister for Finance, and try to get the best balanced budget you can and respond to the needs as you see them.  That is exactly what I did.  The situation was not clear when I put those figures together.  I made the best effort I could.  I do not think for one minute the Deputies opposite are going to accept every single thing I do, and why should they?  They have their views and I have mine.  I am in that seat to take the decisions.  I took them and they are on the line, but in no way can you have an <i>a la carte</i> menu in relation to them.</P>
      <P>Regarding 1992, it is a pity Deputy Barrett was not with me today at the CII annual dinner to hear the President of the CII enumerate the many improvements that have been brought about over the last couple of years with political consensus in this House and what the country has gained from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had made their effort to prepare the Irish economy for 1992.  We have got inflation down.  The parties opposite made their contribution to that in their time, and we brought it down the rest of the way. Interest rates are down.  As a nation we want to become competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> inflation, the cost of money, etc.  The unit cost increase for Irish manufacturers this year <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK market will improve by 5 percentage points.  That gives them a competitive edge and that is how we will have to continue.  It is not fair to suggest that the Government are not preparing the economy for 1992.</P>
      <P>In relation to cost competitiveness, there is a great deal of work to be done by the business community and manufacturing industry. All we can do as a Government is prepare the economy, get it as competitive as possible and use the Structural Funds to try to offset some of the cost disadvantages.  I recognise that the differential between an Irish exporter getting his product to the marketplace is about 5 to 6 per cent per invoice more than that of somebody in the marketplace itself.  That is a cost disadvantage.  We can all be good decision-makers in hindsight. If we knew last January what would happen in May we would be great decision makers.</P>

I assure Deputy McGahon that as soon as the situation crystallises I will let them know where they can be accommodated in the system.  There are other aspects of 1992 to be taken into consideration, including the movement of drugs and many other factors.  Provisions will have to be put in place to deal with these matters.  I will not leave them and their families in uncertainty for one day longer than necessary.</P>
      <P>We are doing our bit in relation to 1992 and will continue to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on Second Stage about petrol prices and asked the Minister to take into account the hardship being suffered by the people in the western areas in particular.  There the people have to travel long distances over roads with myriads of potholes.  I am quite sure the Ceann Comhairle when visiting scenic areas of south Tipperary meets some of these blemishes in the roads and is quite aware of this problem.  The Minister is from a county where roads are not as good as they used to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>He understands the difficulty. However, the Minister is ignoring <Col N="1919" /> the problem that will arise in 1992, that is, doing away with the Border.  In replying to Deputy McGahon about problems in the Border area, the Minister should have indicated that the Department of Finance were thinking of some way to make the price of petrol in Dundalk equal to the price in Newry as a first step towards 1992.  We are competing to sell goods in the UK market.  The Minister spoke about the comparison of prices and said the difference was only 5 per cent. It may be 5 per cent in some areas but it can be 25 per cent or 30 per cent in others. Transport charges have a vital bearing on the success or failure of industry.</P>
      <P>Regarding the creation of employment, the &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; policy has been the undoing of the preparation for 1992 which was set in train.  The Minister is hanging on to the idea that the rising tide will lift all boats.  They must be helped along the way.  The harmonisation of petrol prices between ourselves and the UK would be a step forward.  I made representations to the previous Government and I have difficulty in understanding what the Department of Finance officers are thinking about when they increase the price of petrol in successive budgets.  The increase of five pence in the January budget was supposed to be insignificant, but it was the start of a big increase in costs at a time when we should be moving in the opposite direction.  The Minister has ignored the fact that on the international market we are accepting the claim by the petrol companies that they are not charging the Irish economy above the odds for petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a substantial difference between some of the figures produced by the Commission and those produced by the petrol companies.  Claims have been made that a cartel is working and that the petrol companies have being successfully exploiting this economy for many years. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce never refer to the fact that the petrol companies are taking an advantage, but I come from a constituency where we are well aware of the cartel and the way they were using <Col N="1920" /> aircraft fuel and exploiting high prices for air carriers at Shannon.  It was not until the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, gave permission to Aer Rianta to barter with the Russians for the supply of aircraft fuel that the price of such fuel dropped at Shannon and they were able to compete with other international airports for charter flights.  The retailer is the sufferer in the current dispute but the companies also have to answer.  It is very difficult to know what is happening in the Department of Industry and Commerce because the Minister has somebody else looking after the problem and he is not investigating it himself.  It is difficult to see why Deputy Burke has to hide so much and has not come up with a definite decision.  Transport is such a vital factor in the economy that these problems should be examined more thoroughly.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the vital information to the House that this five pence increase will yield £10.5 million in a full year.  The challenge for politicians is to find some other means to get this £10.5 million. The Minister has been well set up by his advisers in the Department of Finance as to the easiest route to take.  I am sorry he took that route.</P>

      <P>Debate on this section could have ended well over an hour ago.  Most of the points have been made on a number of occasions but I feel compelled, having listened to such a long debate, to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the doubling of the differential in regard to unleaded petrol.  The Minister is tackling that problem in a serious manner.  We will expect a huge increase in the sales of unleaded petrol following this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey has just made a point about the way the country is being held up to ransom by the oil companies.  This is accepted.  The Minister and his colleague, Deputy Burke, have more or less admitted that this is so.  They wanted to give the impression of standing up to these &ldquo;seven sisters&rdquo;.  As everybody knows, however, what they are doing is subsidising the price of oil.  I cannot understand why, because there is such a <Col N="1921" /> consensus about subsidies that the subsidy on food was abolished.  Now the Government are saying oil is more important than food and should be subsidised. It is difficult to understand the philosophy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with subsidies on food, particularly in view of the very high price of food.  Yet food is the item that is given least importance in the economy by Irish Governments.  With this major consensus against subsidisation, this Government appear to be forcing the petrol companies to keep the price of petrol down and are forcing Whitegate to subsidise the oil companies.  The oil companies are still making their money as if the Minister had put up the price of petrol.  What is it all about?  Is it the policy to let prices go up and then people will not buy it because the cannot afford it?  That seems to be the system of Government.  Why not continue it in this case?  What is the difference?</P>
    <P>I feel it is very important to keep the price of petrol down.  All the discussion has been centred on the motorists, but if all the motorists were brought to a standstill, the price of petrol would still have a major effect on the economy because of distribution, transport, commercial vehicles and various other costs on manufactured goods, food and everything else.  We are not keeping the price of petrol down, and I would like to know how the Minister is managing to pay this subsidy.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago we sold a major part of our assets in Tara Mines for £35 million. It was stated very clearly that this £35 million was to go towards the expansion of the refinery in Whitegate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now it is going as a subsidy to the oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I would like to ask the Minister.  Has that deal gone through yet?  Is the Tara Mines share sold and has the £35 million been received by the Minister?  If so, is he pushing hard to see that this enhancement of the refinery takes place at the earliest possible moment in order to give <Col N="1922" /> us increased capacity, etc., in Whitegate as was outlined by the Minister when the Tara Mines share was being sold?  If the Minister got the £35 million, how much of it has already been spent in this subsidy? Was Whitegate given the money and told to use it to subsidise the oil companies?</P>
      <P>It is important that we know the financial procedure adopted in Whitegate and with the oil companies.  It is important to know where and how the transfers of money take place.  Everybody is in the dark on how the deal was done and where the money is coming from.  In the final analysis, people want to know why was it necessary to subsidise petrol and why no Minister was the slightest bit worried about the price of newspapers going up by 5p, an 8 per cent increase.</P>

      <P>There was an increase in the price of all newspapers except <i>The Irish Press,</i> de Valera's old rag, which stands fair and true and says they will not put up their prices.  They got no credit for that.  Nobody commented on the effect on inflation of this increase in the price of newspapers, least of all the newspapers who put up their prices.</P>
      <P>The oil companies are ripping off the economy and making huge profits which are not reflected in their books.  Look at the profits made by the newspapers, by the Independent Newspapers Group.</P>

      <P>I am trying to relate price increases, all the Ministers were so upset about the increase in petrol and why it was important for them to give the impression that they were not allowing a price increase.  I merely referred to the increase in the price of newspapers as another recent very substantial increase in the prices of all our newspapers, except The Irish Press group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I rose was to ask about <Col N="1923" /> Whitegate.  I have always been an advocate of increasing our own refining capacity.  We had an opportunity some years ago to build an oil refinery in the port of Dublin in total opposition to the oil companies who orchestrated a major campaign against that effort.  That could have been done without any Government subsidies if they had got the required permissions and assistance, and we would now have opposition to the massive control by the existing multinational oil companies of our oil capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Union for rescuing us from the grip the American multinationals had on our economy.  I am very glad Deputy Carey recognises the great assistance the Soviet Union has been to us, particularly to Clare and the mid-west region.  The Government have also recognised the importance of that in the battle against the oil companies, and I fully support them in this battle; but the way they have gone about it is the worst of all.  They are giving the impression of a major fight against oil companies but they are giving the oil companies everything they were looking for and put it all on to the taxpayer.  Both the motorist and the taxpayer are paying for this, not the oil companies.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when replying to concentrate on the question of the sale of Tara Mines and upgrading the oil refinery.  I want to know what stage it is at, if it will begin this year or if the money is being eroded through this subsidy to the oil companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister for providing some of the information I requested in my previous contribution.  Certainly a figure of £10.5 million is a significant sum of money in the computation of a budget, and if it is not to be got from increased excise on the price of petrol it will have to be found somewhere else.  We simply cannot let a hole of that magnitude develop in the finances.  The Minister did not attempt to answer the question I posed about the present level of subsidy <Col N="1924" /> from INPC to the oil companies.  Are we talking in terms of £1.5 million a month and how long can this go on?  That information could be, should be and has to be available to the Minister even though the Department of Industry and Commerce are the primary Department with responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to reiterate what I said on budget night, 25 January &mdash; the Department of Industry and Commerce would have the information available to suggest that the price of petrol was not going down at the pumps on the announcement on 5 February.  Whether the Minister's speech was written by the middle of January, before Christmas, on 24 January or on the morning of 25 January does not matter.  There were people who should have had the information, because it was not passed on to the Minister he was left in a position where both he and the Taoiseach misled the House on the night of the budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is no competition in the price of petrol now.  That is a matter the review body will have to examine.  I want to make a couple of observations on this.  When the Minister says there is no competition I think he means there is no price competition. There is no price competition because people do not know the price of petrol. Most motorists were educated in pounds, shillings and pence and they know the price of petrol in terms of pounds and pence per gallon, but they have no idea of the price when they see the price of petrol displayed on an automatic pump at so many pence per litre.  To the average motorist 59.4p or 59.5p a litre means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The price differs at different pumps.  I am not trying to nominate the figure; I am simply saying that pence and decimal points of pence on an automatic pump mean nothing to the average motorist.  They do not know whether they are paying a high <Col N="1925" /> or a low price, and there is no price competition at that level.</P>
      <P>I had an agreement with the retail outlets, when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, that they would display the prices and they agreed to do so by poster where the motorist could see them before he committed himself to purchasing the petrol.  That was done for a short period of time, but I understand from an item in one of the newspapers last week that this has been discontinued now, and that more than 90 per cent of the retail outlets are no longer displaying the price in terms of pounds and pence per gallon, which is what was agreed at the time.  The agreement was that if they continued to display the price in this fashion, the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day would not fix the price of petrol.  If they do not display the price, it should be fixed, whether it be in pence per litre or whatever, and if it is fixed the retail outlets then have a problem.</P>
      <P>There were areas of competition other than price competition, such as with the level of service offered but of course no service is being offered now at petrol stations.  It is like the story of the old gentleman who found three of his workmen asleep by the avenue, and he said he would give a pound to the man who illustrated that he was the laziest.  The third man won on the basis that he told his employer to put the money into his pocket.  The same applies when you buy petrol.  You pump it yourself, you go to the window or counter and hand over your money or your credit card.  If it is after 7 p.m. there is a kind of robotic gesture inside the window where you slide in the money and you then receive your coupon or change.  There is no service any more at petrol stations, and there is very little employment as a consequence of the reduction in service.  In the first instance there is no price competition because people do not know the price of petrol and, secondly, there is no competition at the level of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third area where there was competition was in the dispensing of gifts. People changed from one retailer to another on the basis of the attractiveness <Col N="1926" /> of the gifts being offered and there was an element of competition in that.  One of the results of withdrawing the gifts is that the only element of overt competition that existed is now gone.  I am not advocating gifts, but if there is to be a choice between getting 5p off the price of a gallon of petrol and receiving free red wine glasses everytime you buy £20 worth of petrol, I would opt for the price reduction because that is better for the economy, but the withdrawal of gifts has taken away the only element of competition which was available to the customer at the pumps.</P>
    <P>On the face of it there appears to be no competition at all, but that is not so. There is competition which I think will make it very difficult for the Minister to reduce the price of petrol when the review is published.  As I understand it, the companies are competing for market share on the basis of controlling outlets, some of which are company outlets.  With the private outlets, they are making offers and saying they will give so much of a grant to renovate the premises, provide new pumps, a new canopy and automatic pumps etc.  They also offer to build a shop and say they will charge low interest or provide them interest free on condition that the person takes 4,000 gallons of petrol a week from that particular company. There is competition but it is competition that is damaging the Irish economy because it is competition to control the outlets on the market at prices which are fixed by the cartel.  Since the companies fix the prices there is no competition at price level &mdash; I believe they have been taking more than they should &mdash; but they are still competing for market share and they are pushing out the smaller traders all the time.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of this type of competition is that the companies have been so generous in providing loans to the private retailers and have invested so much in colossal canopies, forecourts and automatic pumps that the capital investment has already been made and this in turn will force the price of petrol to stay high to service that capital investment. When the Minister says the price of crude <Col N="1927" /> oil was $26 dollars and the price of a gallon of petrol was so much and the difference cannot be explained by increasing refinery costs, he may find his answer in the capital investment which we see at every mile or half mile of the road, through money provided by the companies to establish these ludicrously expensive petrol retail outlets which are a feature of the Irish landscape.  This has been accompanied by a total abolition of service because the young people who were employed around the forecourts to clean the windscreens and pump the petrol have been let go.  The investment now is in these massive automatic pumps and huge canopies, backed up by the shops etc.</P>
    <P>When the Minister examines the position he will find he is trying to lock the stable when the horse has gone because the massive investment has been made by the companies and they need the margin to service the capital cost of that investment.  It is a very insidious kind of competition where companies are seeking to control the Irish market by controlling outlets and at the same time fixing prices.  It is a pity it has come to that.</P>
    <P>I use the roads a lot.  I often travel to Dublin and back on the one day, and I pass many petrol stations.  There is no doubt that in the last three years or so there has been a colossal investment in pumps, canopies, forecourts and so on but these retail outlets cannot be selling very much.  They are springing up like mushrooms all over the place.  There are too many of them in the country, they are too well appointed, they are over-capitalised, they provide no service and their prices are high.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is successful in attempting to control the price of petrol and to cut the margins which I believe the companies are getting.  The fly in the ointment will be that the investment has already been made and the companies will be able to produce figures to show that in servicing the investment they will need the margins that now exist, even though those margins are substantially higher than those that pertained on the <Col N="1928" /> Minister's statistical table four, five or six years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this provision, I recently had the benefit of hearing the Minister for Finance while sharing an interview with him on RTE, insist not once, but five times, that there was no budget provision to increase petrol tax. The Minister said this not just in the quietness of a room but to the assembled million viewers of &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; at that time.  That chicken has come home to roost.  It is sad to see the Minister attempt to hoodwink the public in that way.  This Minister cried crocodile tears about the inflation problems created by rising petrol prices but we see that he has put 65 pence on, and not content with that, the agreement that his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced last week of 11.5 pence increase includes an extra tax take of 2½ pence.  This Minister who was so concerned about petrol and inflation is taking not just the 5 pence that we see here today but another 2½ pence out of the latest agreement.  It is quite wrong for this Government to approach petrol pricing in this way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has decided that the INPC, a company we all believe should operate commercially, should be the swing factor. That Minister, after all his huffing, puffing and fulminating against the oil companies, in which he was joined by the Minister for Finance, said that refining margins, were excessive, that crude prices and petrol prices were going out of line and that the company should not charge so high a price for the refined product, yet he reverted to the formula that was in place before the March rise. They are back to square one.  Instead of having the courage to say that the tax take should absorb the shock that might be caused in inflationary terms, they have instead sought that the INPC take that shock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INPC is a State run company.  This Government have made a virtue of their attitude to State run companies.  They believe State run companies should be <Col N="1929" /> run at arms length free from arbitrary political intervention and should approach problems in a business like fashion.  For the Government to step in and force the company to take sustained losses of £3 million a month is not the way to deal with this problem.  At the end of the year the INPC will have had a bad year.  That company are at the moment seeking joint venture partners who would put in their money to join in a commercial venture.  It bodes ill for the success of getting a joint venture partner if arbitrary political intervention to shroud the Minister for Industry's inactivity is used to put that company into difficult trading positions.</P>
    <P>The reality about the petrol issue is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not done his homework.  The Minister for Finance, to give him his due, announced an inquiry into the question of excessive distribution margins last October.  His colleague failed to deliver on that and he had to announce again what Deputy Reynolds announced last October.  It has been a sad chronicle of mishandling that started with the budget. In the run up to the budget when this 5 pence was imposed the Minister for Industry instructed the oil companies not to pass on to the motorist a price reduction that was due from 5 January. Where was the concern about inflation and about the hardpressed motorist then? It was simply a cynical move to try to shield from the public the ultimate objective of hiking up the tax on 26 January. We can only now hope that the Fair Trade Commission will do the job they should have done six, eight or 12 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This ground has been ploughed and furrowed here for the last hour-and-a-half.  I repeat for the benefit of Deputy Bruton what I repeated here and on television; I did not put up the price of petrol in the budget nor did the price of petrol go up the day after the budget.  It went up subsequently, some two weeks afterwards.  As I said here, and Deputy McDowell agreed with me, I am not a clairvoyant.  I could not foresee that a ship would go down in Alaska, that <Col N="1930" /> it would cut off all the supplies from America and that it would put pressure from America into Europe to supply their scarcity in petrol.  In retrospect people can say I should have known.  These facts were not known.  I did not know them.  I am repeating this for the third time and I do not want to hold up the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the dispute &mdash; and this is unfortunately ploughing the same ground again &mdash; the first dispute between the oil companies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce related to 5 pence that the oil companies were claiming would go on following the month of April review.  The Government took the view that the 5 pence being spent on gifts would have been better spent by passing it on to the motorist.  That disposes of the April issue of 5 pence.  During any of the interviews halfway through April I recognised that the price of petrol had gone up some $60 on the Rotterdam price and I said that if it continued even at that level for the rest of the month there would be a price increase to reflect it.  That is what has happened.</P>
      <P>The Government position in relation to the INPC is that we cannot look at the operations of INPC on the basis on one or two months.  The best oil analysts are forecasting a downturn for the second half of the year and already we have seen reductions in the price of crude, down to $18 dollars.  One looks at the operations of INPC over the year.  One does not judge any business on how it runs for a month or two.</P>
      <P>In relation to the money forthcoming from Tara shares, it will not be used to subsidise the consumer in the oil market. That deal is almost legally complete although I am not certain that the money has passed.  I will find out about that from the Minister for Energy.  In relation to the question raised by Deputy Noonan as to the quantity of petrol they are selling out of Whitegate, and the differential, I do not have that information available.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42a:</P>
      <P>In page 44, before section 37, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" />&ldquo;37.&mdash;The duty on bets imposed by section 24 of the Finance Act, 1926, shall (subject and without prejudice to the provisions of section 20 of the Finance Act, 1931) be charged, levied and paid on bets entered into on or after the first day of January 1990, at the rate of 7.5 per cent of the amount of the bet in lieu of the rate of 10 per cent mentioned in section 31 of the Finance Act, 1985.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment before us requests a reduction in off-course betting duty from 10 per cent, the present rate to 7.5 per cent.  As such it is not self-explanatory because what we on this side of the House have in mind is that the reduction in off-course betting tax would be accompanied by the imposition of a 1 per cent levy on bookmakers with that 1 per cent or its equivalent to go directly to the Irish Racing Board to improve stakes and facilities at race courses.  As an Opposition spokesperson, I am not in a position either to propose the imposition of a charge or the appropriation of money. Therefore, I cannot put down a second amendment to direct how I would like the 1 per cent to be allocated.  I am asking the Minister for Finance in this amendment to accept a reduction from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent in off-course betting tax as from 1 January 1990.  I put in that date advisedly.  The present rate would continue until January next.  In the autumn a separate subhead could be raised in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Food through which the equivalent of the 1 per cent levy from off-course bookmakers could be directed to the racing board.  This Bill does not allow us to sort out that aspect.</P>
    <P>This is not a political issue and there is support on all side of the House for the case that we have to invest on a regular basis in our racecourses.  There is hardly a man or woman who does not have an interest in horses.  They need not be racehorse owners or trainers.  They need not even be regular attenders at race meetings. Everybody up and down the country, from the housing estate to the large house, has a love of the horse. <Col N="1934" /> There is a huge number who never attend race meetings but who daily, certainly weekly, attend their local bookmaker. The case could be made that Irish racing is not the only raw material for the off-course bookmaker but so far as we are concerned the racing industry backed up by the bloodstock industry is a most important industry both as an employer and tourist attraction.  I must acknowledge that £500,000 has been given this year by way of the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food to Fairyhouse racecourse.  An equivalent amount was given last year but I am sure the Minister would agree that we need to put on a regular footing the investment in our racecourses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Our domestic racing industry is a developing one but it needs finance to develop to its full potential.  We need action now to preserve the valuable employment in the industry.  Over 25,000 people are employed, both directly and indirectly, in the racing industry.  We need investment to secure the long term future of the bloodstock industry.  The Minister is aware that a weak racing industry has implications for all of the other aspects of the bloodstock industry, an industry which has the potential to contribute even more significantly to our economy in the years to come if a means is provided, as I have suggested, through which the domestic racing industry can develop racecourse facilities and prize money improved and the long term employment of those in the industry secured.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of off-course betting tax to 7.5 per cent would also make bets in Ireland a more attractive proposition for overseas punters, particularly those in the United Kingdom where the present rate is also 10 per cent. The United Kingdom credit betting market is estimated at approximately £500 million sterling per annum.  This is a most responsive market to differential tax rates between betting markets.  For every 1 per cent of the UK credit betting market attracted to Ireland by a more <Col N="1935" /> favourable taxation regime here, domestic betting turnover would increase by IR£6 million approximately per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the significant implications in my amendment for the Financial Services Centre and the credit betting market, particularly in relation to attracting companies from the UK.  The terms of the amendment can be implemented at minimal cost to the Exchequer and widespread benefits will flow over a short space of time.  Now is the opportunity to secure the future of the domestic bloodstock industry for the nineties and I urge the Minister to seize it by accepting the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's advisers and officials in the Department of Finance, react strongly the moment they hear the expression &ldquo;a self-financing tax cut&rdquo;.  I do not think they believe that such a cut exists.  They have heard arguments made over the years about self-financing tax cuts in different areas.  It is important to put on record the fact that Deputy Dukes, as Minister for Finance, in 1985 reduced off-course betting tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and that within a few years revenue from that tax had more than doubled.  I accept that there is a limit to self-financing tax cuts, but with the potential of attracting considerable sums of money from overseas punters, particularly from the UK and with the potential for the Financial Services Centre of credit punting, the time is right for us to make this move.  That should have been done in 1985 but we should make this one final move to reduce the rate of off-course betting tax from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent and impose a levy of 1 per cent on off-course bookmakers.</P>
    <P>The Minister should direct the equivalent of that 1 per cent through a sub-head in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Irish Racing Board towards the improvement of facilities at our race courses and increasing prize money.  We should be in a position to reward the owners, breeders and trainers of our bloodstock industry, all of whom we depend on for that sport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> Many of us get hours of pleasure from that sport.  One does not have to be an owner, a trainer or a jockey to enjoy that sport which is provided by investments by others at great cost to themselves.</P>
    <P>We have suggested a commencement date of 1 January 1990 so that there will be no loss of revenue between now and that date.  We are suggesting that a tax rate of 10 per cent should remain until next January to allow the Minister an opportunity to include in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture a new subhead for the equivalent of 1 per cent to be directed to the Irish Racing Board. I would like to have been able to table an amendment suggesting that a 1 per cent levy be imposed on bookmakers but it is not up to me to do that.  Had I taken that route, and my amendment was ruled out of order, I would have been precluded from expressing my views and developing the discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister may need time to consider how he can put the three steps in place.  What we do today in relation to the reduction from 10 per cent to 7½ per cent is the first step.  We then, through the Government offices, have to get the 1 per cent levy in place.  I suggest to the Minister that between now and Report Stage he make arrangements to have that included in the Bill.  The third step is to adjust the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, which is presented in the autumn, to allow the proceeds of that levy to be passed on to the Irish Racing Board.  If we agree in principle with what I am suggesting, and I hope the Minister will do so, we must take action now in regard to the first step in the Finance Bill. The third step involves a change in the Estimates, and if the Minister was to suggest that the matter be left over we would be postponing the implementation of my suggestion for 18 months.  As it is, there will be an eight months delay but if we do not move now to put the pieces in place for the Estimates in the autumn it will be January 12 months before we will be in a position to direct money on a regular basis to the Irish Racing Board.</P>
    <P>Off-course betting revenue is worth £22 million to the Exchequer.  I would be <Col N="1937" /> happy if the Minister included a clause in the Finance Bill to the effect that the first £22 million of off-course betting tax at the 7½ per cent rate should continue to go to the Exchequer and that the 1 per cent I am suggesting should be collected on sums over and above that figure.  My point is that the Exchequer should not be without at least £22 million, the amount they collect at present.  I do not want to reduce the direct Exchequer take from off-course betting.  We want to guarantee that amount and, hopefully, by an increase in the value of betting turnover due to a reduction in the off-course betting tax and the attraction of overseas punters, particularly from the United Kingdom we will have about £2 million or 1 per cent, to go directly to the Irish Racing Board.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter.  The Government should seize this opportunity to put my suggestion into operation. We have had reports from the Commission on Taxation on this issue and it was dealt with by the Killanin Commission. Indeed, my suggestion is in line with the recommendations of that report. I understand that it suggested a reduction to 8 per cent of the off-course betting tax and the imposition of a 2 per cent levy.  I am suggesting that it should be 7½ per cent and 1 per cent to keep a differential between us and the UK rate and to maximise the possibility of attracting credit punting to the Financial Services Centre.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment tabled by my colleague. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the bloodstock industry and the racing scene here.  Some people regard it as the sport of kings and are of the opinion that a lot of money is being made by a few individuals.  Those people hold the view that suggestions like that put forward by Deputy Doyle are for the purpose of putting more money into the pockets of a few people.  That is far from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the condition of many of our race tracks.  They are a disgrace to any sport and could not <Col N="1938" /> be classified as public places of entertainment. Many of them do not have such basic facilities as toilets.  Very little money has been spent on racecourses to try to attract spectators to that sport. What is badly needed is a regular flow of funds to the Irish Racing Board to enable them to prepare a long-term development programme for racecourses.  They should be in a position to provide facilities that will attract more people to race meetings.  I am sure the Irish Racing Board will be given permission to bOrrow money to accelerate any development programme.  If the Minister listened to me I might be able to persuade him to accept my views.</P>

      <P>If money was given to the Irish Racing Board for a development programme the Exchequer would benefit in the long run.  Employment would be created and the Exchequer would benefit through PAYE, PRSI and VAT paid on materials.  The Exchequer will receive a fair slice in return for any investment.  At the same time racing facilities will be modernised and more people will be attracted to races.  Ireland is regarded as the home of the horse and the bloodstock industry is a very big one.  It used to be a show piece for this country.  We spend vast sums of money in advertising this country so as to attract tourists here, and horses were a vehicle by which this country became famous throughout the world.  The condition of our half bred industry at present leaves an awful lot to be desired.  Those who follow racing only have to look at the results at the main festival meetings abroad to see that this year we did not even have one winner at the Cheltenham festival.</P>

      <P>We are advertising the <Col N="1939" /> Irish racing industry so that people will come here to look for horses so as to help that industry from an export point of view.  The reality is that we did not have a winner this year at Cheltenham.  How long is it since we have had a classic winner in Britain?</P>
      <P>The writing is on the wall and the reality of the situation, for those who may not be fully aware of the value of this industry, is that, as Deputy Doyle pointed out, 25,000 people are either directly or indirectly employed in this industry in this country.  I should like to invite any Member of this House to visit a few of these stud farms in rural parts of Ireland.  Deputy Davern knows one of these stud farms in particular, Coolmore Stud, which employs about 500 people in the middle of rural Ireland.  I ask the Minister how much it would cost the industry to attract a foreign industry into this country which would give jobs to 500 people.  I am talking about highly skilled people who have a natural affinity towards horses, who can use their skills very quickly abroad and who would have absolutely no trouble whatsoever in finding employment in other countries.  Five hundred jobs are being provided by one stud farm in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>We have to find a way of making certain that we have the facilities so that people will go to watch racing and that we have prize money which will make it attractive for people to continue to invest in the industry and put horses into training so that they will get reasonable rewards if their horses win particular races.  At present the prize money for races, particularly those run on the flat is deplorable and we have to find some way of attracting more money into prize money.  This will attract people to put their horses into training which again will give employment in training establishments and race tracks, for example, through the employment of jockeys and grooms, and in all the other ancillary service attached to that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of coming in here with a special plea for a very small group of people.  We should be very wary that <Col N="1940" /> if this industry continues the way it is going it will get into serious difficulties. The world is becoming a very small place and already some of out top stallions are being sent to Australia for certain periods of the year.  The Australian Government decided in their wisdom to reduce off-course betting and to channel money on a regular basis into racing purely from the point of view of creating employment and keeping the industry going.  The bloodstock industry in Australia is now booming, and it is booming under a Socialist Government &mdash; a Government who saw that it was advisable to put something back into racing so as to protect and develop that industry.  If we sit here nice and snugly and think this industry will continue the way it has been going we might have reason to have second thoughts about it.  People can shift their investment from this country very quickly into places like Australia where it is more attractive to breed horses because the prize money for those who eventually race the horses which are bred from these top sires is more attractive.  In the space of a couple of years the bloodstock industry in this country could be wiped out.</P>
    <P>Whatever revenue the Exchequer is getting at present from off-course betting, PAYE, PRSI and all the other taxes I have spoken about before could very quickly disappear and for that reason I appeal to the House to support the amendment proposed by my colleague, Deputy Avril Doyle.  We are not asking the taxpayers of this country to fund anything; we are putting forward a formula which in itself, by reducing off-course betting, should increase the turnover. This in turn would produce greater profit for bookmakers and rather than bookmakers getting all of the profit we would impose a 1 per cent levy which would go to the Racing Board who, therefore, would have a regular flow of funds.  We are not asking the taxpayers to fund investment into the pockets of a few people.  We are asking this House to wake up and realise that the Irish bloodstock industry is declining, that the racing industry is in jeopardy, that a number of <Col N="1941" /> horse trainers are finding it more and more difficult to keep going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work, The age groups attending race meetings need to be watched.  Younger people are not coming through as in the past and an older population than before are now attending races.  Now is the time to look at this industry and produce some radical measure which will arrest the decline of this industry and enable it to advance and create more employment.</P>
      <P>It should be put clearly on the record that we are not asking the taxpayers of this country to fund prize money or facilities at race tracks.  When the present leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Alan Dukes, reduced the tax from 20 per cent down to 10 per cent that generated more turnover and it more than compensated in the longer term for the loss or revenue in the short term.  By reducing off-course betting to 7½ per cent our rate would be below that in Britain.  We are in the EC and there is no reason why English money should not be coming in here to Irish bookmakers.  That in itself would create a greater turnover and the racing board would get their funds through the 1 per cent levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle was quite specific when she said that we are not asking the Department of Finance to forego any loss in revenue.  If we want to impose the condition she suggested whereby the present take is £22 million and that £22 million must still be got I am confident this could be done very quickly.  I am asking the House to realise that the future of this industry is not too rosy.  I want to put it on the record that the advances being made in places like Australia are a very stern note of warning to us that our bloodstock industry could be seriously affected if money moves from this country down to Australia and the top <Col N="1942" /> sires move with that money.  We have something very special and we should hold on to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern was right when he spoke about the number of winners at Cheltenham and other top race meetings in Britain being Irish bred.  That is not the point.  The point is that, as a nation, we are not seen to be the leading country in racing that we were and which has had a serious effect on this industry.  We should not ignore the fact that there are at stake here 25,000 jobs.  Anybody who takes any interest in racing or has any contact with horse trainers will know that very few of them are making any sort of a decent living here at present.  Some of them have owners but find it very difficult to receive payment.  If one must incur anything up to £5,000 or £6,000 to keep a horse in training and receive prize money of £1,000 only for winning a race, that is not a great return.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there are many people in this country who have kept horses who have never won a race. Bearing in mind prize money of £1,000 when weighted against an investment of, say, anything between £100,000 and £1 million, in addition to the upkeep on the horse, where is one going to go? Inevitably one will go to wherever the prize money is greater.  People who traditionally invested an awful lot of money in bloodstock in this country are now moving their investment to places like Australia where bigger prize money is the main attraction.  If that continues to happen the breeding industry will encounter very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a political point of this.  I am aware that the Minister has a deep personal knowledge of the industry.  I am satisfied that he has the good will to recognise that it is an important industry with tremendous potential, that all we must do is, first, recognise the problem and, second, find a solution to it in the short term that will not cost the Exchequer anything.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to all sides of the House to pay attention to the points made in the course of this debate. I recognise that, in a period of cutbacks, <Col N="1943" /> it is difficult to justify taking decisions which may be misinterpreted.  However, this is a time to demonstrate some little courage in this respect.  It is also a time when those of us interested in maintaining employment in that industry should be able to respond to any type of ill-informed criticism of what we are endeavouring to do here.  I repeat, it is not a question of trying to put money into the hands of a few.  Rather is it an endeavour to create employment in an industry which is very important to this country and to maintain an industry for which many people had to struggle hard in the first place.</P>
    <P>We should be mindful of the fact that we might wake up when it is too late, when all the top investors and best stallions will have left the country, ending up in Australia or elsewhere.  We have a glorious opportunity here to develop this industry if only we have the courage to take the steps proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It had not been my intention to speak but I should like to voice my support for the industry here.  If we examine the State of Nevada tax laws we find that when their rates were reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent their income trebled, that when they reduced the rate further to 1 per cent the yield rose to over five times what it had been previously.  I appreciate very much what Deputy Dukes did as Minister for Finance in 1985.  He increased the yield from betting; that is the incentive to get people to pay tax on betting.  It is bad enough to take a chance on losing one's money but to pay tax before losing it is even worse. It is like the pint after hours; it is one of those irresistible temptations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with other speakers that the facilities available at race courses have become diabolical.  We must remember the enjoyment people gain there but the main drawback is that the prize money is not sufficient.  Whatever about flat racing, particularly in the national hunt, the prize money is simply not a sufficient return on the risk being taken.  Of every <Col N="1944" /> 100 horses born, 30 will be found to be unsuitable; more than likely no more than 10 per cent of the remainder will ever see a race course and, of the 10 per cent, 1 per cent only will ever win enough races to justify their existence.  Therefore, it will be seen that there is a major problem in that area.</P>
    <P>I might put this question to the Minister: with the way things are going, will there be an Irish betting office left here because they are being continually taken over by British bookmakers?  While it might add weight to Deputy Doyle's argument to say that foreign companies could use their offices elsewhere to transfer a bet to Ireland, I am concerned about the indigenous industry that is losing out and unable to compete.  My fear is that betting will become a cartel, that there will no longer be a real chance of an outside swipe at something somewhere along the line, that it will become a fixed market, so controlled that there will no longer be any real interest in betting. Deputy McGahon and I were in India recently and we were extended the courtesy of paying a visit to a racecourse there where, with small money, they slashed the price in two and, of course, Deputy McGahon would not follow my instructions.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried that there will not be an Irish bookmaker remaining here.  I accept that under EC regulations other companies are perfectly entitled to come here but I contend there should be a reduced form of taxation for the indigenous industry &mdash; which has proved successful already &mdash; and in particular for those who support race meetings.  They afford such a sense of enjoyment.  I suppose one could say it is part of what we are ourselves.  If more was reinvested from increased betting moneys in prize money and facilities we would be talking about a much improved scene.  If the Minister looks at the increase in registered bets since 1985 he will appreciate that if there were more still there would be even greater registration and all of us would be much happier about the honesty and integrity of racing.</P>

      <P>This is a subject in which I have had a life long interest. Indeed, perhaps I know more about it than I should.  In supporting this amendment I want to express my appreciation of the Irish bloodstock industry.  Equally I want the Minister to acknowledge the prominence of the Irish horse and everybody connected with it worldwide.  I had the privilege and pleasure recently of attending a race meeting in Bombay with Deputy Davern and nothing changes, whether it be in Leopardstown or Bombay.  We were losers.  However, we were left in no doubt about the esteem in which the Irish horse is held worldwide.</P>

      <P>No Irish Government have ever appreciated or done sufficient to bolster our racing industry which is clearly needed at present.  Anybody who has followed the successes of Irish horses over the past 20 years will have been saddened to note the dearth of winners in recent years at Cheltenham.  Indeed, the steady supply of classic winners turned out here in the seventies and early eighties has ground to a halt, indicating that the Irish bloodstock industry is ailing for the reasons Deputy Seán Barrett has advanced &mdash; that the temptations and attractions of selling a good animal are overwhelming.  God knows, we do not lead the world in many things but we were a world leader in horses.  Now Irish horses of ability and promise are being sold for more glamorous racing in England and France.  The attraction is the huge difference in the stakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I should like to pay homage &mdash; and take some of the credit &mdash; to my celebrated colleague, Deputy McCreevy, who had the courage in 1984 <Col N="1946" /> to say on television &mdash; and I supported him &mdash; that we did not pay the betting tax.  I was sent to Coventry by some of my more self-righteous colleagues in this House, it was terrible for a person to admit that he had not paid the betting tax.  One million people in the real world outside these four walls knew I and Deputy McCreevy were telling the truth. There is a real world outside these portals and Deputy Dukes recognised that and took steps and reduced the betting tax from the penal imposition of 20 per cent, which was obscene, to 10 per cent.  As Deputy Davern has already stated, the Exchequer benefited enormously.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in paying the betting tax as it is now because it is reasonable. I think most bookmakers have worked with the Revenue Commissioners in gathering that tax.  At this stage I want to say that I agree with Deputy Davern who warned us of the growth and the influence of English bookmakers in Ireland.  That is a worrying trend because these big combines are squeezing out the independent Irish bookmakers.  They are doing it in a very subtle way.  They are paying the tax for the punter.  They are putting undue pressure on the small, independent Irish bookmaker who cannot compete.  In order to survive that is driving him to under the counter betting. That is very subtle and it is definitely unfair competition.  I view with concern the increasing influence of British bookmaking concerns in this country.  It is not good for this country, it is not good for the punter and it is not good for the bloodstock industry as a whole.  I would ask the Minister to look at that problem with a very keen eye.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the need to boost and help the racing industry.  There is no doubt that that is needed, particularly for many country courses.  The value of races in some cases is as low as £800 for the winner and that is totally unrealistic.  That is one of the reasons there is a question mark over Irish racing. I am referring to the correctness of racing.  As a punter I have grave reservations about the correctness of Irish racing.  I understand that an owner is not <Col N="1947" /> paying a trainer for the punter's benefit, he is paying him for his own benefit.</P>
    <P>Some of the Irish racing results make me raise my eyebrows because horses can be put away &mdash; and the Minister knows what I mean by that &mdash; for periods of up to one or two years and then sprung, and the unfortunate punter is left looking in sheer disbelief at the form book.  John Comyn in the <i>Irish Independent</i> continually highlights reversals of form that are mind boggling.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I think Irish racing needs a face lift and a spring cleaning from the punters point of view.</P>
      <P>There is a need to update the Betting Act.  There should be a charter for the punters because bookmakers can write their own rules.  Some bookies are paying first past the post, some are paying on the official result, some have their limits, there is a free for all in that area.  There should be hard and fast rules which apply to everybody.  The Minister should have discussions with the National Bookmaker's Association to work out a fair deal for both the punter and the bookmaker.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I support this amendment. I agree with the proposal that 1 per cent be given back to the Irish industry.  I would ask the Minister to reduce the overall tax a little further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to betting duty undoubtedly is one where the Department of Finance and Customs and Excise live in a different world, as Deputy McGahon said.  In another capacity I was privileged to see how the law enforcement operation worked in relation to betting duty in the days of the 20 per cent duty.  At that time I spoke to Customs and Excise officers very frequently in the course of conducting prosecutions, and they all told me that at 20 per cent they were just wasting their time, that so much money was being lost to the Exchequer which would never be recovered and that the whole situation was foolish.  When the rate was reduced to 10 per cent the result was entirely predictable that there would be a boost in the yield.</P>
      <P>I believe there is still a huge amount of money being lost to the Exchequer.  The one place where it is obviously being lost to the Exchequer is by telephone betting. I do not believe any of that carries any tax.  I understand the poor old Customs and Excise people could not get a warrant to tap a phone if they were paid double for it.  Unless bookies actually see themselves at risk on telephone betting, they will continue to do a lot of heavy betting off their books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being booked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not being booked out; let us be realistic about it, they are being booked on the back of cigarette boxes.  The simple fact is that the volume of betting will yield far more than at present if the tax is reduced further so that it will not make it worth any bookmakers' time not to book a bet in his office &mdash; and that includes a telephone bet.  The bookmakers will not like what I am about to say.  You must use telephone tapping and take one or two as examples, and that would stop also.  If you stopped telephone betting being off the books, I think the yield from betting duty would be increased by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> I agree with what Deputy McGahon said about the Betting Act, 1931.  It is a joke.  It is a puritanical thing with all sorts of regulations about not having inducements to go into betting shops; it is almost as if they were something between a morgue and a public loo, or like a brothel which cannot even be decorated.  It is the most absurd idea.  The other point made by Deputy McGahon is correct, that is, that the behaviour of bookies is really a matter for themselves.  The method of enforcing standards among bookmakers, which is the Garda Superintendent witholding consent of the licence, that is archaic.  I have recently seen one or two court examples of how draft that can be in its own way.  It would be far better if there was a charter of implied rights for every punter who would know what he was taking on and he would not have to look to his local superintendent to get him fair play from the bookmakers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the English betting offices I should like to say two things.  I think Deputy Doyle's point is right; if there is a significant differential in the tax treatment of Irish betting from English betting then the presence of those offices may bring more money into this country.  I do not believe the employment offered by them is going to be very significantly less than the employment offered by other bookmakers.  The capital they are bringing in to their end of the business &mdash; which is very substantial indeed in terms of the equipment and the telecommunications equipment &mdash; would not have happened if we were waiting for the Irish bookmaking business to do it. Therefore, we cannot afford to be too hostile to them.  They are coming in and investing their capital.  They are so big that they cannot afford to be caught cheating, because if they are caught cheating and are deprived of their licences the consequences of them would be a multi-million pound loss.  For a Joe Soap running a small office in the middle of nowhere on a wing and a prayer, the risk to his own capital is far less.  I would not be too hostile to English bookmakers coming in here &mdash; although I know there are others who would take a different view &mdash; if they <Col N="1950" /> are bringing in good business.  It is about time the Irish bookmakers got their act together and started to compete rather than whingeing about the money the English bookmakers are bringing in.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Davern that the competition in relation to offering to pay the tax is unfair.  It must be unfair because, effectively it means that they are subsidising the odds by the amount of the tax they are giving.  It is all the more unfair the higher the amount of tax.  This is another reason for reducing the 10 per cent rate to 7½ per cent &mdash; I would go as far as 5 per cent.  It might become a little ridiculous if it were less than 5 per cent.  If the Minister brings it down to 5 per cent, in two years time he will have more money out of racing.  If he does something about the telephone betting he will get more money out of racing and if he does something about the betting Act he will improve his situation, also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle is correct when she says that this set of proposals would be self-financing. All the experience from the past is that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have underestimated the volume of betting that is going on in the country.  By overtaxing they have driven betting underground. If a few punters were consulted on how betting should be taxed, a lot more money would be got out of it.  If the Minister listened to the Deputies involved he would realise that they are telling him what to do with it.  I am glad to see that there is a consensus in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice in support of having something done about the whole racing industry.  To put the matter on a serious note, there are thousands of people employed as a result of racing, owning horses, etc.  In my constituency the numbers employed in breeding, racing stables and all other <Col N="1951" /> ancillary occupations would add up to thousands employed in that industry.</P>
      <P>A few basic principles should be understood before you tackle any problem. From going racing I knew the Minister for Finance long before he came into this House.  I know that he understands, as does Deputy McGahon, the twilight world in which we all exist who have anything to do with racing and gambling. Many years ago when the price of land reached enormous proportions I realised that the day would come when things would have to change.  There is an economic value on everything and when the price of land reached an extraordinary price per acre, it then went the other way. People found that they could not make an economic return on the price they were paying.  You can apply the same principle to the owning of a horse.  Over the past ten or 15 years the fundamental principle of what owning horses was about was forgotten.  It became so important to concentrate on the breeding of horses that horses became too important to race.  It would be too much of a chance to take the horse to the races because he could be beaten by another racehorse and the value to the syndicate would go down. When the top of the stallion market started going the other way, it emphasised that basic principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It all relates back to the value of land or the economic principle involved.  People come to see one horse compete against another and one horse beating another. That is what stakes races are about. People say they have a better horse and they make a wager of £100, or whatever. That principle was forgotten in relation to the stallion industry.  People come to the track to see one horse beating another and this generates money for those who build the stands and for the racecourse owners.  There is also the money that comes to fund racing by the take-off from the betting tax.  Irish racing is funded solely by the course betting tax.  The traditional argument about taking any slice off the off-course betting and putting it into racing has been put like this: most money bet in the SP offices is bet on <Col N="1952" /> English racing, etc. so why should the off-course punter fund Irish racing?</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point about which Deputy McGahon was speaking. The reason for the off-course punter not betting on Irish races is that he does not think he is getting fair play or that the form works out as well as it does in English racing.  Why is that?  I will tell the House the basic reason and I speak from no little experience in this matter.  Somebody decides that he would like to have a national hunt horse, because most Irish people like to go to see national hunt racing.  His base is, say, £10,000 on a three year old horse, or whatever, which will not run until he is four years old.  He is put into training and will cost another £6,000 to be kept for that year.  He stands at £16,000 then, or probably would stand at £20,000 between the Turf Club and everything else.  He is run in the bumper race in Naas, or wherever the case may be, where the first prize will be about £1,000.  Out of that will have to come 20 per cent for the trainer.  I presume it is ridden by an amateur so 20 per cent for the jockey will not be taken out.  You would get back about £700 for winning a very competitive race, which is exactly one month's grain.  A horse at the top echelon of national hunt racing would have to win some very great Irish races to pay for his keep in any one year.</P>
    <P>The only chance that an ordinary fellow has who is racing horses is to gamble.  I have owned race horses and owned shares in them for many, many years.  I am prepared to admit that every horse that I ever owned did not always win on his or her merits on any particular day.  Without the gamble, the horse stands at £20,000 and you will come home with one month's training fees.  Everyone is in it for the sport, but you like to get a reasonable return for your money, or have the expectation of getting it.  You will punt that horse on the particular day that you want to.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the off-course punter is right. There is much codology talked about racing, that every horse is not trying and so on.  Having owned horses down through the years, I know that the day <Col N="1953" /> that they are off form there is a difference of about two or three lengths.  They probably cannot go any more quickly. However, people must have an opportunity to get some return on their investment. They will not come to the race meeting unless they are going to see competitive racing and they will not see competitive racing unless the prize money is realistic.  That is the fundamental problem with Irish racing.  At any mid-week meeting here in the middle of the summer there are very few paying customers. Therefore, you have to increase stake money to make racing competitive.  By that means you bring more people to the race meetings and generate more revenue from the betting levy or the tax, which will increase the take.  You must put an injection into it at some stage to start the ball rolling.</P>
    <P>When my mother used to walk to Nass or to the Curragh and see new stands, she used to say that she built those stands with her pounds going in.  I attended the Curragh races when it cost two shillings to get into the stand and it was the same in Naas.  That is going back a long, long time.  The ordinary Joe Soap goes in to have his £1 or £2 bet.  It is not, with all due respect, the Robert Sangsters or the Vincent O'Briens who keep racing going here.  It is the ordinary Joe Soaps all around the country.</P>
    <P>Another thing wrong with Irish racing is that the bulk of the prize money from sponsors and so on goes into flat racing where the bigger returns are for syndication etc.  The real chance of big money is there but the majority of people who own horses own at national hunt level and it is the betting at national hunt level that funds the whole of racing.  I have never seen the figures, nor have they been published, of what the take off is in a year of national hunt racing as against flat racing, but the serious punting goes on in national hunt racing, yet the funding goes into the racing board for the flat end of it for which the rewards are greater.  It is necessary that the rewards be great for flat racing for breeding etc., but there is an anomaly there.  At some stage some Minister for Finance will have <Col N="1954" /> to inject money into the system to bring up the level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle and in principle the Minister might agree too, about total off course betting taxes and the one big pool for the whole funding of racing.  Ministers for Finance and Governments have an objection to this, but racing is in a crisis.  It has been a hobby of mine all my life.  Some Minister for Finance at some stage will have to take his courage in his hands and say, &ldquo;Here is X amount of money&rdquo;.  When it comes to reducing off course tax as is being advocated now and putting some of that into racing or the funding coming directly from an Exchequer fund, I say to whatever Minister will be doing it, it will be a waste of time giving it, say, to the Racing Board if it is not given under strict conditions.  If extra money is pumped into racing I do not want to see it channelled into flat racing.  There are enough sponsors out there willing to fund flat racing.  It must come at the other end of the scale.  The punter will not attend unless it is competitive racing and there will not be competitive racing unless the fellow owning the horse thinks he has a realistic chance of getting back his money, and unless someone is prepared to stop the cycle there will be no end to this.  It is not economic to keep a race horse in training.  I hope the Minister at some stage can take these matters on board.  I could talk for a long time on this.  There are other things I could say. I think it is not realised that one thing is linked into the other, someone has to use courage and break the circle.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to attracting English money and English punters over.  In recent years the Racing Board had the initiative to initiate Sunday racing which has being a huge success all over Ireland.  To continue in that vein, many English punters fly over, and that gives us an ideal opportunity to relieve them of some badly needed cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge on the Minister the wisdom of accepting this amendment. The advice he is getting here is of the best.  We have had impartial, by-partisan advice from Kildare, the home of the racing industry, we have had advice from punters in Louth, from Dublin SouthEast and some from Wexford where they are not too bad at it either and from Tipperary where they are beginning to catch up with the rest of us in the business. I would like to add one more thing. I think I can advise the Minister on this as the only former holder of the office he now has who went through the experience of reducing the tax on betting and who saw the effects of it.  I confess I was very sceptical starting out on the exercise but I am very glad I overcame that scepticism and did the job, because it worked out.  Within 18 months the effects had worked their way through the system and the revenue had increased.</P>
      <P>The amendment sets out to do a couple of other things, some of which cannot be included in the amendment.  One has to do with getting funding into the industry. A good deal has been said about that.  It needs to be injected into the industry, not just enterprise money and not just into facilities on tracks.  They are both extremely important, but for the great majority of breeders there needs to be a way in which the rewards can be accelerated or increased because that is going to be a very important part of keeping our industry healthy.  For those reasons we are pushing this amendment.  The experience shows that something of this kind can work, and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am still a happy man. I recognise the contribution Irish racing has made and will continue to make to this economy.  I recognise the thousands of jobs that have been created by the industry with no assistance from the State, good, bad or indifferent.  It is an industry that is synonymous with our country abroad.  Not alone are there problems on the racing side, there are problems on the show jumping side; there is a range of problems.  As Deputy McCreevy said tonight, throwing money at it is not going to solve all the problems of the horse industry.  I appreciate fully the contribution it makes and the problems there.  I have done a certain amount of work on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment came in only last night &mdash; I am not blaming the Deputy for that.  I am prepared to look at it and the various aspects of it, but I cannot in all honesty say here tonight I will accept this amendment as it is and then talk about committing the Government next January without the Government even having sat down while we decide here we are going to spend X amount of somebody's Estimate in such a way.  I could not buy that at this stage.  In case Deputies think it is all one way traffic, it is not. I admired Deputy Dukes at the time he referred to.  I thought 20 per cent was penal.  It did not work out quite as well as people think around here, nevertheless it improved significantly.  The decision was the right one at the time because evasion was horrific.  The year was 1985. In 1984 with £102 million turnover the tax take was £20.5 million.  In 1985 it was <Col N="1957" /> down to £16 million, in 1986 up to £18.3 million, in 1987 £19.5 million, correspondingly because 10 per cent turnover was taken, in 1988 with £224 million turnover the figure was £22.4 million. It cannot be said it was self-financing. Deputy Doyle made the point that it is self-financing, but it is not.  How much evasion or anything else takes place we will never know.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment as it stands this evening.  Maybe the Deputy wants to say a few words more about it. I am prepared to look at it.  I recognise the problems.  I do not see the passing of this amendment this evening as a simple solution and I am not prepared to go along that road tonight.</P>
    <P>The problem has been highlighted here by two Deputies already.  I want to give notice that I will be bringing forward a further amendment on Report Stage the purpose of which will be to make illegal the practice of so-called tax rebating offered as an inducement by a number of off course bookmakers.  The amendment I intend to bring forward will impose a legal obligation on all off course bookmakers not to accept a bet unless an amount equivalent to the amount of betting duty due in respect of that bet is paid to the bookmaker by the punter.  That is an attempt to restore a level playing field between the Irish indigenous industry and the outsiders who come in.  This is just to give notice for Report Stage.</P>
