      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his meeting with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 24 November, 1989; if the possibility of a second phase of the programme was covered; if any possible <Col N="3" /> changes to the terms of the programme were discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. I met representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 24 November, with my colleagues the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour, to discuss and review progress under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>As the joint Government/ICTU statement issued after the meeting made clear, the success of the programme in correcting the severe and unsustainable imbalances in the public finances, in returning growth to the economy and in reversing the disastrous trends in unemployment and employment were fully recognised.  We agreed to consider measures and actions which would, within the programme, intensify the progress being made particularly as regards jobs, tax reform, living standards and social equity.  That is the purpose of the ongoing review and monitoring provisions of the programme.</P>
      <P>These and the other matters dealt with at the meeting are covered in the joint statement, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Pat Rabbitte who has a question tabled on the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  May I ask him if he concurs with the views of the Minister for Labour that the contribution of the leading private companies to job creation has been a major disappointment, whether the recent statement by the Secretary of his Department congratulating the same private companies for their contribution reflects the Taoiseach's view and if he disputes the recent statement of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is general agreement that one of the problems we <Col N="4" /> face is to translate the very satisfactory rate of economic growth, which we are now achieving, into jobs.  Our efforts are directed to that end.  For that purpose the Deputy will probably have noticed that I met the chief executives of the principal semi-State bodies yesterday to discuss with them how they could contribute to creating more employment within their spheres of activity.  The position is that there has been a considerable turn around in the provision of employment in the private sector.  As the Deputy knows the ESRI, for instance, have indicated that their estimate is that 11,000 extra jobs will be created this year and 19,000 next year.  We would all agree that there is considerable scope for improvement in the private sector in the area of job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments concerning the public sector but my question related to the performance of the private sector.  May I ask the Taoiseach specifically if he is in agreement with the request put forward by Congress that there should now be a major review of industrial policy with a view to ensuring that the major private companies in particular make a more substantial contribution to job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would certainly support any possible examination of the private sector that would help us to translate economic growth into more jobs. Of course, in that connection we must always keep in mind that private sector enterprises have to be competitive and profitable and to some extent there is a conflict between the application of more technology, automation and so on and the provision of extra jobs.  The dilemma really is to find a way in which private enterprise corporations can become increasingly efficient and competitive and at the same time endeavour to contribute to the provision of extra employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Taoiseach has just said can he give the House an assurance that the question of the privatisation of a very successful and <Col N="5" /> competitive State company, the Great Southern Hotels, was not discussed at the meeting with ICTU or that they have not given their agreement to such a privatisation in view of less than 100 per cent responsibility of the private sector towards the maintenance and the creation of jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now coming to deal with a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any decision in regard to GSR hotels will be announced in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in the light of the clear failure of the private sector to produce the kind of jobs they had been expected to produce, because of some of the factors to which the Taoiseach referred, if the question of the privatisation of the Great Southern Hotels was raised at these two meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate matter in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not raised.  One of the areas in which the private sector is producing jobs is the hotel and catering industry and in the tourist trade generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach two questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As you wish.  First, may I ask the Taoiseach if he would agree with the statement made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions prior to the meeting with him that at the current rate of job creation 200,000 people will still be unemployed by 1992?  Second, may I ask him if his statement, made just a few moments ago, that private sector companies must be profitable applies also to semi-State companies and if he will state whether the agreements he entered into with the State companies yesterday in regard to job creation by them are subject <Col N="6" /> to the companies in question continuing on that basis to remain profitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first question, I would be much more optimistic than the statement which the Deputy made implies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Congress of Trade Unions made the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is exactly the position of the Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the statement here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The real position is that Congress and Government &mdash; and indeed the social partners generally &mdash; are working together to try to ensure that the level of economic growth, which we are happily achieving at the moment, is translated as widey as possible into more jobs. Of course, the chief executives of the State companies understand that they must be not just profitable but efficient as well.  In fact, we agreed between us that one of the best contributions they can make to the economy is to provide a cheaper and more efficient service for the rest of the economy.  That also applies to their own operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Taoiseach will sell them off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, they are conscious of that and are working assiduously to that end.  Subject to that we accept that it is possible for them &mdash; either through extensions of their core business or through branching out into totally separate enterprises &mdash; to provide more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Taoiseach says, he is more optimistic than the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to the level of unemployment in 1992 in that he believes it will be fewer than the figure of 200,000 suggested by the Congress of Trade Unions, will he please state his <Col N="7" /> view as to the likely level of unemployment in 1992 on the basis of the current rate of job creation?  Will he assure the House that his meeting with the semi-State bodies yesterday does not constitute political interference with the commercial management of those bodies in the interests of the taxpayer and those currently employed therein?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the Deputy, with the sort of convoluted mind he has, could possibly level that sort of criticism against me.  I would have thought he would have been all in favour of a good, helpful, constructive meeting between myself and the chief executives of State bodies with a view to promoting economic development and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a far better record than that of the Deputy and he is very foolish to talk about records.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that the report of the committee he established to examine the scope for curtailing the outflow of heritage material noted that the high level of VAT was &ldquo;the single factor contributing most to the outflow of works of art and heritage material from Ireland&rdquo; because it gave foreign buyers a market advantage over domestic buyers. That report was published in December 1985 and a 23 per cent rate of VAT was then payable on the sale and importation of works of art.  The VAT rate was subsequently increased to 25 per cent with effect from 1 March 1986.</P>
      <P>In the present year the Government have reduced the rate of VAT payable on the sale and importation of works of art and heritage material from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.  I am confident that that measure will help in curtailing the outflow of works of art from this country.  The question of legislation to control the export of works of art and of heritage items generally is still under examination. There are obvious constitutional problems involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the movement so far as VAT is concerned.  Can the Taoiseach recall that, shortly after being elected in 1987, he promised legislation arising out of the Hamilton Committee? The Taoiseach promised during each session of the Dáil since then, with the exception of the last, when I had given up asking, that we would have legislation during that session, that is, whatever session was in progress at the time.  Can he say when we are likely to have the legislation, particularly in view of the fact that the constitutional difficulties arising out of the Derrynaflan case, to which he referred, have now been solved?  When can we expect the legislation?</P>

      <P>The constitutional difficulties I was referring to in my reply are not the same as were raised in the Derrynaflan case.  They deal with the <Col N="12" /> rights to private property and the capacity to sell in a free market.  As the Deputy knows, it is not an open and shut case.  Legislation in this area might not necessarily achieve the objectives that he and I, would both have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said in my reply, I dealt at some length with that situation when I outlined Government policy on Northern Ireland in my statement on 23 November last.  I think <Col N="14" /> the Deputy will be well aware that the policy of this party is for the eventual unity of all Ireland and that, of course, would ultimately involve the withdrawal of the British presence from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that while every Nationalist would be in favour of British disengagement as quickly as possible from Northern Ireland, that disengagement should take place as part of an overall political solution which would give the necessary personal security, civil rights and guarantees as to their future livelihood to all sections of the community?  Furthermore, would the Taoiseach tell those who are lucky enough to live in the comparative safety of this part of the island that, irrespective of any other considerations, the lives and safety of those living in isolated areas of the North should be the priority consideration?</P>

It is quite commonly believed by many on all sides in Northern Ireland, and indeed here that such a statement by Britain could have incalcuable repercussions in Northern Ireland in regard to life and limb, that it would make it a virtual open season for the armed gangs operating there.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said before, my six monthly meetings with the British Prime Minister <i>en marge</i> of European Council meetings are valuable and have proved adequate to exchange views on current issues.  However, if a formal Summit meeting appears to be necessary or beneficial at any time it can, I am sure, be arranged.  Plans for any such meeting would be announced, in accordance with established practice, simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that meetings <i>en marge</i> of the European Council, of necessity operate within <Col N="21" /> the time constraints dictated by other agenda items to be considered by them? Would he agree that the importance of the Anglo-Irish relationship, and the many outstanding issues contained therein, require that in addition to there being regular meetings within an EC context there should also be an established practice of regular bilateral meetings outside the EC context to deal with these matters that do not naturally come within the EC ambit?</P>

Therefore, would the Taoiseach not agree that if there are outstanding matters in Anglo-Irish relations &mdash; on which his party constantly wish to harp &mdash; there should be bilateral meetings of an open-ended kind at which one is not constrained by time restrictions imposed by others, when such issues could be brought to a conclusion rather <Col N="22" /> than being kept at a point on the centigrade scale somewhat below the boil in order to maintain a degree of tension which may be of partisan benefit to the Taoiseach?</P>

In all these matters where the 12 members states are concerned very often the decision has to be to proceed as far as is possible to bring all the member states.  That is the position with the Social Charter.  We will have, I am sure, a final draft of the Social Charter before the summit meeting.  It may be possible to amend or subtract from it. I do not know at this stage what the procedure is likely to be.  The likelihood is that we will have a draft which commands unanimity among the member states. There will be a decision as to whether we adopt it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in assuming that I will necessarily be putting forward anything at the summit meeting. There may be no question of that.  As the Deputy knows from his own experience of Government, the normal procedure would be that we will have a draft before us.  It will almost certainly represent the limits to which all the Twelve are prepared to go and it will very likely be a question of accepting it or not.  I cannot say that will be the position but it seems very likely that is the way things will emerge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be the position at all.  The Social Charter has been before a number of Social Councils for a long time and has been the subject of the most protracted discussion, negotiation and compromise between all the member states.  I do not think there is a single member state that did not have difficulty of one kind or another with the original draft of the Social Charter.  As in all Community matters, we have to try to achieve progress on the basis of consensus. We must try to get all the 12 member states to advance as far as we can on any issue.  That is what is happening on this occasion.  It is quite wrong to suggest that this Government or the Minister for Labour at the Social Affairs Council have been in any way remiss in trying to secure the maximum progress.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is on record as stating a number of times that the social cohesion of the European Community is a fundamental of any progress towards a single market.  We have targets in relation to the single market, the opening of borders, monetary union and so forth.  Would the Taoiseach not <Col N="28" /> agree that it is essential that a strong Social Charter be put in place and that, unless the Council meeting which he is to attend this week establishes such a charter by way of a political declaration or otherwise, any action programme which the Commission will implement will not be worth the paper it is written on?  If it is not in the charter it cannot be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has adverted to a number of disparate matters. The position in regard to the Social Charter is that it has been the subject of protracted discussion, negotiation and compromise over a long period and now it is hoped that a final draft will come before the Strasbourg Summit and be adopted in the form of a solemn political declaration and that this will be followed by an action programme which has already been drawn up by the Commission. I suggest that it is the action programme which will be the reality, the practical working programme with which we will have to deal.  There is widespread agreement throughout the Community that the Community must not be just for big corporations, business or the private sector but should also be a Community for the peoples of Europe.  It is on that basis that this Social Charter has been formulated and brought forward.  There may be some criticism of the final draft of the Social Charter but I think the Deputy would agree that there will be an enormous amount of excellent provisions in that Social Charter, whole areas about which there is no conflict at all concerning the safety and health of workers and so on.  I hope that the summit in Strasbourg will be able to agree on the final draft as it comes before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Details of any official visit I might make to the United States will, in accordance with the normal practice, be announced close to the time of such a visit.  The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve met recently in Brussels and expressed the Community's deep concern at the deterioration of the situation in Central America, condemning in particular the fresh upsurge of violence in El Salvador which has brought in its wake the massacre of a great number of civilians.</P>
      <P>In line with the position which they have consistently maintained, the Ministers considered that the initiative to relaunch the peace process should come from the countries in the region themselves with the support of the international community.  They made an urgent appeal to the parties involved in conflicts in the area to return to the path of a negotiated solution which would, in the first place, allow an end to hostilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1984 Foreign Ministers of the EC have met annually with their Central American counterparts to discuss the situation in the region.  The next such <Col N="30" /> meeting will take place in Dublin during the Irish Presidency.  We and our partners in the Twleve consider that the conflict in Central America can best be resolved in the context of the peace process known as the <i>Esquipulas</i> process which was signed in Guatemala in August 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that United States policy on Central America is badly misguided to say the least?  Would he tell us if he has taken any steps personally to inform the United States Government that we feel disgusted at the manner in which United States-funded army death squads have indulged in an orgy of violence and death against people who are the potential leaders of society in El Salvador?  Surely, as a country which claims great authority in the area of foreign policy, we should at least make some effort to give our views on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the views of the Irish people on these issues are very widely known and have been expressed from time to time in different ways and by different means.  I think we can be most effective in this type of situation by acting through and in agreement with the Twelve.  The Twelve have much more power and influence when they act together on issues of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Taoiseach's original response reflects the policy of the United States, and that we do not have a major role.  May I ask the Taoiseach if, during his term as President of the European Community, he will put forward any Irish relics to the Twelve in relation to Central America or are we just going without a thought in our heads? Have we any policy in relation to technical and other developments in Central America that would uplift the people there?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has no justification for making a suggestion of that kind.  He knows full well that we are very active in the formulation of Community <Col N="31" /> policy in these areas.  We have a particularly close knowledge of the position in these Central American countries and, therefore, our contribution to the formulation of Community policy and Community actions is very valuable, and is recognised as such by our partners.  As I said in my reply, there will be a meeting of the Foreign Ministers on Central American issues during the Presidency, and there again we will have an opportunity of playing our part.  As I have said to the Deputy, I think we can be most effective through the Community and through the Twelve.  We can also, of course, take action through the United Nations, which we do.  We are far from being silent in these international fora on these issues.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the effects the 20 per cent reduction on the industry and services programme from the EC Structural Funds will have on the proposals contained in the National Development Plan; if he will outline the areas affected by this reduction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As <Col N="35" /> indicated by the Minister for Finance in a press statement on 27 November the Commission of the European Communities have adopted the Community Support Framework, CSF, under the expanded Structural Funds.  The CSF provides for assistance of 3,672 million ECU in 1989 prices, about £2,860 million, for Ireland over the period 1989-93. In addition to this amount Ireland will benefit from additional funding through Community initiatives yet to be announced which should bring the total Community funding to over £3 billion.</P>
      <P>This level of Community support to help improve the overall structure for economic development in Ireland represents a major injection of resources to help prepare for the increased opportunities and the more competitive environment which the completion of the internal market is creating.</P>
      <P>In the case of the industry programme the proposed level of total expenditure over the period 1989-93 on activities considered eligible for Structural Fund support under the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, at the time of the publication of the <i>National Development Plan</i> last March amounted to £941.3 million.  ERDF support of £510.1 million was sought towards this expenditure.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Support Framework the actual level of ERDF support allocated towards the industry programme amounts to £416 million.  It is expected that this will support overall public expenditure of a structural nature on industrial development of over £847 million over the period 1989-93.  Not all of this expenditure will be co-financed by the ERDF.  This is because ERDF resources available are limited or conventional practice in the administration of the ERDF has excluded certain developmental activities such as equity investment by State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the regulations governing the Structural Funds, the negotiation of the Community Support Framework is the first step in the process through which money from the <Col N="36" /> Structural Funds is transferred to Ireland. The CSF establishes the total level of support that will be available and its broad disposition between different programmes. These programmes have to be approved separately by the Commission of the European Communities within the framework established by the CSF.  The programmes form the detailed basis on which Structural Fund moneys are allocated by the Commission and drawn down by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the Commission in relation to the approval of the Operational Programme for Industry are at a more advanced stage than for most other programmes.  It is expected that Commission approval will be obtained before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The reduction in ERDF resources available to Ireland will mean that the level of expenditure increase on industrial promotion, technological development and marketing support for Irish industry will not now be as high as the 70 per cent increase in real terms by 1993 envisaged under the <i>National Development Plan.</i> The increase in expenditure that will take place, however, will still remain very significant, the increase envisaged at present being about 60 per cent.  Until such time as the Commission has approved the industry programme it is not possible to provide precise detail on how the £416 million of ERDF support for industrial development in Ireland over the period 1989-93 will be allocated between the various elements of the programme. I can say, however, that there will be a continuation of the relative shift in resources available for industrial development purposes towards those activities that will help Irish industry to operate more effectively in the more competitive environment that the programme for the completion of the Single European Market is already bringing about.  In particular, there will be very significant increases in the resources allocated to those activities which will help Irish industry to upgrade its technological and marketing capacity &mdash; areas which a number of objective analyses have indicated are a particular weakness in Irish <Col N="37" /> industry.  This shift in resources is reflected in the Estimates for 1990 published recently which show increases over the 1989 Estimates of 18 per cent for CTT and 29 per cent for the science and technology programme operated by my Department, compared with a 7 per cent overall increase for activities undertaken under the aegis of my Department.  It is expected that most of the expenditure involved will be supported by the ERDF. Once the industry programme has been approved by the Commission I will make details available to the House.</P>

A misleading indication of the price of goods and services may be anything which misleads a customer as to price.  The Act states that anything likely to be taken as an indication of a previous price shall be treated as such an indication. The most obvious of such indications would be &ldquo;was £10, now £5&rdquo; or &ldquo;usual price £20, sale price £15&rdquo;.

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the Consumer Association of Ireland do a very worthwhile job monitoring certain activities which perhaps his own Department are not in a position to carry out?  Would he agree that it is time his Department recognised the contribution this association make in monitoring such things as the non-passing on of reductions to the consumer investigating the insurance industry and so on? Would he also agree that it is time a proper grant was made to this association without their having to make any special request on an annual basis for such a grant?  We should recognise their importance and position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 26 and 27, Oral Question No. 41 and Written Question No. 128 together.</P>
      <P>The House, I am confident, will be aware that I have been active in ensuring that recent favourable developments in the exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling are reflected in lower prices for Irish consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the particular attention of Deputies to a press release issued by the Government Information Services on 24 November 1989.  That document indicated that I have been informed of a range of price reductions which have <Col N="43" /> occurred because the Irish pound has been strengthening relative to sterling.  A number of these changes have taken place very recently and others are expected in the near future.  On the basis of this information, I am satisfied that there is at present no need for the introduction of statutory price controls.  I am anxious to avoid that course, provided the thrust of normal competition in the market leads to price reductions for the consumer.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the benefit of currency movements in 1989 should not be confined to imported food and household items only.  I am anxious that goods such as footwear, clothing, vehicles, components etc. that are priced in sterling should also show appropriate reductions.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to complete an investigation into the impact of the changing exchange rate on prices.  The results of this study will enable me to assess whether the range and extent of reductions fairly reflect the favourable exchange rate movements taking place.  I expect to have the results of this study in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State tell us what steps he proposes to take to police the very wide differences in the price of commodities as between one supermarket and another?  In particular I am referring to the major supermarket chains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we have moved away from direct price control in this area and favour competition within the industry to bring about a reduction in prices.  This policy has worked very well and I hope to have the report from the Director of Consumer Affairs in a few weeks time, the details of which I will give to the House.  It is interesting to note that arising from Government action in this regard decreases have taken place in a wide variety of household goods ranging from 2 <Col N="44" /> per cent to 9 per cent and in some particular items even more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that his Department took absolutely no action until this matter was brought to his attention by this side of the House following a statement by Deputy Noonan, the Consumer Association of Ireland and me?  The question I asked was quite specific.  It asked would he please state what steps he has now taken to have in place a proper monitoring system to ensure what we have witnessed in the last few weeks will not recur and that we will not be dependent on Opposition Deputies to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister?  There should be some automatic monitoring system in place.  Can the Minister of State tell us what system is now in place, given that price control no longer exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot expect to have it both ways.  I have already explained to the House that we have moved away from the price control mechanisms which proved to be quite cumbersome and ineffective and which did not deliver price reductions in the way competition in the field has always done.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw your attention again, Sir, to the matter which I raised on Thursday morning, 30 November 1989, in relation to the manner in which you conducted the voting on the Criminal Justice Bill, 1989.  Since then a meeting took place between your officials and the Chief Whip of the Labour Party and members of my staff.  I received a letter from you for which I am grateful. However, my gratitude should not be taken as acceptance of the contents of that letter.  I believe it is a most serious matter given that there is no precedent in the rules of the House or in the history of this House for the manner in which the question was put on Wednesday last and, second, given that you invoked your constitutional role in your casting vote on that evening.  I would ask you to take the opportunity, perhaps on the Order of Business tomorrow, to clarify to the House exactly the reasoning for doing what you did last Wednesday night.  I believe the implications are very serious particularly because the calling of a second vote on a Private Member's Bill is unprecedented in the history of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say I am quite satisfied with the procedure adopted on the occasion.  The officers of my Department were with your representatives. I have communicated with you at some length in the matter.  I have nothing further to add.  If the Deputy wishes to pursue the matter further he may do so. Especially if he is in doubt I would welcome that he would proceed with the matter so that there would be no taint of suspicion attached to the Chair.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I find it extraordinary that the tenor of those remarks was not present last week when it was argued on your behalf, by your officials, that the situation that arose last Wednesday night was unprecedented whereas, in fact, a very similar situation had arisen in this House in the conduct of the Private Members' Business legislation, the Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill, 1987.  A similar situation occurred on that occasion yet it was argued on your behalf that this situation had never arisen before; two years hence, it should not have been forgotten; the precedent was there and it should have been conducted according to the Standing Orders of this House.</P>

      <P>On that issue I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Spring.  In your consideration of this matter I think it is proper to refer to the precedent which Deputy Spring touched on.  On 28 October 1987, there was a vote on that Private Member's Bill to which he referred, and, in fact the manner in which that vote was taken &mdash; column 1762 of the Official Report of 28 October 1987 &mdash; was different from the manner in which it was taken last week.  I am greatly concerned that the procedures of this House would be followed completely according to the letter and spirit of the Standing Orders.  From that point of view I would support Deputy Spring in his suggestion that you would look at the matter again and make a further statement to the House so that we can be absolutely sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have not much time at our disposal this afternoon.  I understand the debate is guillotined and will finish at 5 p.m.  However, I wish to ask the Minister about some points I raised on Committee Stage a few weeks ago.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware that on that occasion I went to great lengths to request the Minister to seek the considered views of the members of the advisory board, who had been appointed two days previously, on whether we should have licensing of stallions.  I felt the Minister did not particularly want to accede to my request, but I could not see any reason for this.  I would now like to know whether this matter was put to the advisory board and, if so, their views on the matter.  However, if the Minister did not seek the views of the advisory board, I would like to know why not.  As has been said, this Bill has been kicked around in all Chambers since 1985.  I sought certain guarantees with regard to the importation of semen, etc, but I will not go into that at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be much happier if I knew that the various sectors in the horse breeding industry were as near to unanimous as possible, that this legislation is good for <Col N="210" /> the horse breeding industry.  I would like the Minister to outline what he found as a result of these discussions.</P>

      <P>It was pointed out in the course of the debate that the legislation is very short.  One begins to wonder why we are spending so much time on it.  On Committee Stage I pointed out that the Bill was first circulated in 1985.  As a result of the recommendations of a sub-committee which Bord na gCapall had established at that time, the then Minister for Agriculture decided to circulate the Bill.  Quite frankly, Deputy Connaughton's assertion that it should be referred to the advisory committee does not stand up to examination. It is neither practical nor necessary to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We have outlined the reasons.  I might reiterate that the continuation of stallion licensing is a non-issue. This Bill is merely a technicality to deal with the reality, that licensing has not been operated since 1984.  There are really no compelling reasons for its continuance. Therefore, it is only right and proper that the 1934 Act be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the words I used about this on the last occasion were something to the effect that I would not remain awake at night worrying about the issue.  I can understand the Department's attitude to this whole question of the licensing of stallions.  We covered all of that ground on the last occasion here in so far as visual assessment was concerned. Incidentally, I wish the Minister's colleague, his senior Minister, well and I hope he will be back on his feet shortly. However, I cannot understand why the Minister should select a group of people &mdash; no doubt with great care and attention &mdash; involved in the horse industry from all over the country and then not consult them about the first Bill appertaining to their industry that has come before this <Col N="211" /> House in my time here.  I cannot understand why the Minister would not have sought their opinion and then inform the House fully in that regard.  I am surprised and disappointed he did not see fit to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not objecting to this Bill and will not be calling a vote on it.  Were I a member of that new horse advisory body I would begin to wonder why I had been appointed to it.  I would have assumed that matters concerning horse breeding and related matters would have come within their ambit.  I contend that that lack of referral is a bad start for them while accepting the concept and necessity for the establishment of that body, to bring all of the various vested groups together within the industry.  I thought I had made my views particularly clear on the last occasion on which we had this discussion.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may have felt we overstressed the point but that is neither here nor there at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that the Minister missed a valuable opportunity to avail of all of the expertise in that advisory group.  The Minister of State said he could not understand why it had taken so long for the Bill to be introduced in the House.  I might remind him that there were general elections and so on that intervened.  A delay of a day or two would do no harm at all to allow for an airing of the views of Members on the horse breeding industry.  I do not hear the matter being discussed very often and I would not consider it a waste of time.  I hope that Members' contributions over the past few weeks and before that will be of some use and help to those people involved in the Department and the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the Bill is a very short one, its main provision being the repeal of the Principal Act.  What that provision basically meant was that stallions which <Col N="212" /> had to be inspected visually heretofore will not be from now on.  I know there will be no uproar nationwide whether or not such an inspection is carried out. However, when discussing those matters I would have thought we would have seen fit to discuss other matters relating to the horse breeding industry, which was what we endeavoured to do to the best of our ability on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that all of the views expressed here will be taken on board by the people who count because, one way or the other, there is a huge task to be tackled in regard to horse breeding.</P>
    <P>There is great need for a shake-up in the entirety of the horse breeding industry particularly since the announcement of the five-year plan in agriculture, something about which most Government Ministers seem reluctant to speak.  That is another matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the horse enters into this in the sense that, hopefully, many farmers will derive a substantial part of their income from horse breeding.  It is my hope that the advisory group established by the Minister will work well in the interests of the industry as a whole.  It is also my hope that in the future more people, in particular, small farmers at the lower end of the scale, will earn more from horse breeding.  I hope we have managed to draw attention to that need in the House in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the nature of the Committee Stage debate on 22 November last, it is appropriate to recapitulate on the reasons for this Bill.  First, let me remind the House that this Bill was initiated by the Coalition Government of 1982 to 1987 and first came before this House in April 1987 following the change of Government in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for this Bill are straightforward. The horse industry has changed dramatically since the enactment of the 1934 Act.  The licensing inspection was confined to a clinical examination and <Col N="213" /> had little real impact on breeding improvement.  Once licensed, stallions were not reinspected.  The number of stallions licensed declined from 1,000 in 1970 to 500 by 1984.  On the advice of their sub-committee on breeding, Bord na gCapall recommened that licensing be abolished, stressing that the examination for registration of stallions &mdash; which, of course, is voluntary &mdash; is more thorough and effective from the point of view of breed improvement.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that licensing has not been operated since 1984.  The Opposition have argued that circumstances have changed since then, principally because of the dissolution of Bord na gCapall.  I shall deal with that issue in a moment.  Let me say there has been no demand whatsoever from any sector of the indudstry to return to licensing. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that the quality of horse breeding here has suffered over the past five years as a result of the cessation of licensing.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Bill to dissolve Bord na gCapall was enacted some months ago.  We need not waste time reiterating the background to the dissolution of that board.  Nonetheless it is important to dispel the notion that because of the demise of that board a vacuum in horse breeding matters has been created thus presenting an argument for retaining the 1934 Act.  Of course, that is a spurious argument.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the needs of the industry generally we felt it necessary to redefine policy on the one hand, against the background of restoring confidence to the sector and, on the other, that in the present economic climate the scope for financial incentives was limited.  In the event we believe a fair balance has been struck in the new national programme we announced last November.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I should like to reiterate the objectives of that programme, which are to maximise output and exports by exploiting to the full our national resources in breeding stock, soil, climate, expertise and reputation, to maximise returns to breeders <Col N="214" /> and to develop further the equestrian and leisure side of the industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to conservation of the Irish draught breed, I should say many of the qualities and much of the international reputation of the Irish sport horse derive from the breeding system whereby Irish draught and draught-type horses are crossed with thoroughbreds.  The continued breeding and production of such horses is dependent on the maintenance of a viable nucleus of the Irish draught population.  However, the future of the breed may be endangered if insufficient numbers of mares are being bred pure to maintain population size and enable selection within the breed for quality improvement.</P>
    <P>I should point out that a grant of £400 will be paid to the breeder of each pure Irish draught foal registered in the Irish Horse Register. This will compensate for the difference in value between pure Irish draught and thoroughbred horses.  The scheme will operate for a five-year period commencing in 1990.  From this year headage payments are made in respect of eligible registered mares in all disadvantaged areas in which cattle headage grants are paid, at an increased rate of £70 per head for up to eight mares and £66 for the next 22 mares.  These payments are calculated separately from any other headage payments to which the producer may be entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be <Col N="215" /> recollected that the Minister for Social Welfare, in the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Justice, had introduced this Bill.  Is it agreed that the Minister for Justice now continues?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Social Welfare has, on my behalf, formally moved that this Bill be read a Second Time and has dealt with some of the important provisions in the Bill.  Before continuing where he left off I think it would be useful if I were to summarise the issues that he has already covered.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to reform the law on sexual assault of offences in order to provide additional protection for women who suffer sexual attacks.  One of the major provisions in the Bill is the proposal to abolish the common law rule that a husband cannot generally be guilty of raping his wife. However because of the evidential difficulties that will inevitably arise and to guard against spiteful or mischievous complaints the Bill provides that prosecutions can only be instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The Bill replaces the offence of indecent assault, which has a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, by the two new offences of sexual assault with a maximum penalty of five years and aggravated sexual assault with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It was explained that the creation of the new offences of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, the trial of the latter, along with rape, in the Central Criminal Court and the extension to all sexual assault victims of the legal protection at present afforded to rape victims will, in the Government's considered view, meet all the criticisms of the existing law as it pertains to sexual assaults not amounting to rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds why the Government have decided that all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases should be heard in the Central Criminal Court were dealt with and it was indicated that consideration would be given to the question <Col N="216" /> of amending the Bill on Committee Stage to allow the existing position on the granting of bail to continue in these cases.</P>
    <P>To continue I would now like to turn to another important change which the Bill will bring about.  This relates to the question of corroboration of a complainant's evidence in trials of sexual offences. Under existing law it is mandatory for the judge in such trials to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. There are cases where such a warning would be superfluous and could raise unnecessary doubts and confusion in the minds of jurors.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the question whether such a warning should be given and, if so, its terms should be left to the discretion of the judge trying the individual case.  The Government accept this recommendation and section 6 of the Bill contains the necessary provision.</P>
    <P>To protect rape complainants the 1981 Act restricts the cross-examination of a complainant concerning her previous sexual history with any person other than the accused.  This protection is now being extended to the victims of all sexual assault offences and, in addition, will encompass the previous sexual relations of the complainant with the accused. The 1981 Act also provided for the anonymity of the complainant in a rape case and this provision is also being extended to the victims of all sexual assault offences.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill, apart from providing that all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be heard in the Central Criminal Court, also provides in section 10 that they will be heard in the absence of the public.  The exclusion of the public will lessen the embarrassment for the victim.  However, since it is important in the public interest that rape trials be reported, the press will not be excluded. They will, of course, still be subject to the reporting restrictions which prevent the publication or broadcast of any matter which might lead to the complainant or the accused, unless he is convicted, being identified by members of the public.  The press will also continue <Col N="217" /> to be excluded during any application to cross-examine the victim about her previous sexual history.</P>
    <P>This leads me on to another question which has given rise to some debate.  The Law Reform Commission strongly opposed a recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee that separate free legal representation be made available to complainants in rape cases. The commission raised the constitutional propriety of the proposal and went on to point out that in some cases separate legal representation might actually lead to unjustified acquittals of the accused.  The reason this proposal was put forward in the first place, as I understand it, was a perception that complainants were not being sufficiently protected by prosecution counsel and as a result they felt alienated from the legal process.  The commission expressed the view that these problems could be resolved within the confines of the existing legal system particularly in a climate of changing attitudes towards the rape victim.  The Government are in full agreement with the commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Director of Public Prosecutions agrees generally with the commission's approach.  He is in the course of taking certain steps which when fully implemented will be of practical benefit to complainants in sexual offence cases.  In particular these arrangements will ensure that the complainant in a sexual case will be furnished without delay with a copy of her statement and be afforded access to the solicitor and counsel acting for the prosecution before the hearing of the case in court.  In addition he also proposes that a familiarisation course be made available to complainants on request in which the layout and procedure of the court will be explained to the complainant and in which she will be advised in very general terms of the type of questions which she might be asked.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that these and other changes which the Director of Public Prosecutions has in mind indicate a positive and constructive approach towards lessening the ordeal which the court case <Col N="218" /> obviously presents for rape complainants and that they will be generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that section 8 of the Bill does not go as far as providing a statutory definition of &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.  The section is merely declaratory of the existing law that lack of physical resistance does not of itself constitute consent.  This issue was looked at very carefully and it became clear that an attempt at a statutory definition would be likely to confuse rather than clarify and could lead to unintended changes in the law.  The difficulties arise particularly in cases where consent is vitiated by the fact that it was obtained by fraud or threats.  For these reasons it was decided to take the limited approach set out in section 8.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome change in attitudes in recent years towards the victims of sexual attacks.  I believe the Irish criminal justice system is now more responsive to and more understanding of the trauma victims undergo.  I should like to pay tribute in particular to the Garda Síochána who are sympathetic and supportive in their dealings with victims of sexual assaults.  Legislative changes can only go some of the way to relieving the trauma and stress of victims of rape and other sexual assaults.  Everyone involved in the criminal justice system has a part to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to put on the record the debt we owe the Law Reform Commission and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights, consideration of whose reports preceded and assisted the preparation of this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Rape and sexual assaults are among the most horrendous crimes in our criminal code.  The number of reported rape cases in recent years has varied between 60 and 70 per annum. A decade ago the average number of reported rape cases varied between 40 and 50.  This indicates a substantial increase in the number of such cases now being reported to the Garda Síochána.  In addition the 1988 crime report records 226 cases of indecent assault on females. Indeed figures from the Rape Crisis <Col N="219" /> Centre, which now deals with over 500 cases a year, would suggest that there is a significant degree of under-reporting to the Garda of rape and similar offences.</P>
      <P>Clearly the figures confirm a very worrying trend and also confirm the need to examine the adequacy of our legislation dealing with sexual offences.  I am very strongly of the view that punishment for crimes of a sexual nature should reflect the abhorrence in which society holds these horrible deeds.  Therefore, I welcome the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill and in doing so compliment in particular the Law Reform Commission for their major research and reports which have been of tremendous help to us in considering the issues focused on in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are two basic principles to be borne in mind in considering the changes proposed in the law relating to rape and sexual offences.  The objective of criminal law must be to ensure so far as is humanly possible that those who are guilty of a crime are convicted and punished in a manner commensurate with its gravity. It must also ensure that only the guilty are so convicted.  The law must observe the constitutional requirement that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law which in turn demands the observance by the law of basic fairness in the trial of such persons.</P>
      <P>The second principle on which we should operate is that the law must also seek to avoid causing all unnecessary distress to the victim.  Rape is one of the most awful and obnoxious crimes in the criminal code.  It is a violation of a woman's bodily integrity and apart from the physical consequences of the crime it has enormous emotional and psychological effects on the victim.  These effects can be accentuated by the trauma associated with a criminal trial which can be distressing, humiliating and embarrassing for the complainant in a way in which other trial procedures are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission quite rightly stated there was an unfortunate tendency in the past to be over sceptical <Col N="220" /> about rape allegations and that, accordingly, it was important that the balance should be redressed.  At the same time they pointed out that it was neither just nor reasonable to move to the opposite extreme and they highlighted the principle that the accused must be presumed innocent until found guilty.  The basic rule there is that the onus is on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  Unfortunately, the operation of this principle means that in cases of doubt guilty persons may sometimes be acquitted.  On the other hand, if doubts were resolved in favour of a complainant innocent persons would inevitably be convicted.</P>
    <P>The challenge, therefore, is to establish a balance which will ensure the conviction of rapists but avoid the conviction of the innocent.  In cases where there is doubt as to where the balance should lie we have to revert to the basic principle of due process with the presumption of innocence until guilt is proved and the onus lying on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>In debating the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill we are touching on very serious issues indeed.  Different points of view in relation to these issues cross party lines.  Indeed in some instances the Law Reform Commission took a different approach in the initial consultation paper as opposed to the final recommendations in their report.  Furthermore, even in their final report the Law Reform Commission took the unusual step of publishing a dissenting view.  I mention these facts from the point of view of indicating the broad range of very strongly held views, crossing party lines and all other sorts of lines, held by people as to the best course of action which should be taken in relation to the different major issues raised by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I welcomed the Bill.  It is important that we discuss these issues.  I want to say that my approach to the Bill is not to oppose it on Second Stage but I want to indicate to the House very clearly that each of the changes proposed will need to be teased out fully on Committee Stage.  On Second Stage I <Col N="221" /> want to highlight some of the concerns which have been expressed to me, and some of which I share, in regard to the changes proposed.  In other areas I will be suggesting to the Minister that he should have a rethink about whether some of the changes proposed go far enough.  I think the Minister will accept that the views I am expressing here are not made in any party sense.  They are raised in the context of a constructive approach and trying to do what I think the Minister is trying to do in searching for the best solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and, as I have said, it is in that context I want to tease out in a preliminary way some of the issues we will have to deal with in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the major issues in the Bill I think it is important to say that irrespective of the results of trials and to a degree, outside the terms of the Bill, there is the clearest case for much more comprehensive support for the victims of rape and sexual offences.  This should be done by way of a change in procedures which would help to relieve the stress and humiliation suffered by victims.  Those changes in procedures could be introduced without in any sense affecting the fair trial of the accused.  In addition adequate funding should be provided for bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre who do excellent work for such victims by way of counselling and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to touch on some of the major issues raised in the Bill.  One of the major changes I want to refer to is in connection with marital rape.  The common law rule was that a husband could not generally be found guilty of raping his wife.  The Law Reform Commission proposed that the section incorporate a change to abolish the common law rule.  The view has been expressed to me that the number of cases of rape by husbands on wives has not been such as to call for the removal of the marital exemption.  We should be very careful not to bring about changes in the rape law unless they are really <Col N="222" /> necessary and that by doing so we do not run the risk of bringing the changes into contempt.  It has also been suggested to me that because of the changed conditions of modern life and disagreements between husbands and wives occurring more frequently there is a danger of the courts being flooded with rape cases.  A strong case has been made that any change in the law should only apply in cases where the parties are living separately under court orders, such as divorce, separation or barring orders.  On the other hand, the old common law rule has not prevented assault, or indecent assault or buggery by husbands on their wives being labelled criminal offences.  In that context it seems to be an anachronism that a charge of rape should not be permissible.</P>
    <P>I was also concerned that if this change were to be made it could result in a lot of late night charges being brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána as a result of family rows.  I have been advised that this has not proved to be the case in Australia where such a change has been made.  The police force there have not been inundated with such charges.  While I can foresee evidential problems arising in marital rape cases, on balance I favour the Minister's proposal that the marital rape exemption should now be abolished. I am to some degree affected in that positive view by the inclusion of the proposal that prosecutions of marital rape could only be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This would ensure that frivilous charges would not be made. I tend to support the view of the Minister on this issue.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the two new charges of aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault proposed in the Bill.  Of course this would incorporate a discussion on a very difficult issue, the definition of rape, and whether that definition should be widened.  It is proposed in the Bill to replace the offence of indecent assault which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment with two new offences, sexual assault with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and aggravated <Col N="223" /> sexual assault with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  It has been pointed out that there would be dangers in following this line which were highlighted in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper.  It has been brought to my attention that in establishing new offences we may open up an escape route for defendants.  The case has been made that the present law in relation to indecent assault has worked well over the centuries.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to point out that the Law Reform Commission said that there would be a danger in creating a specific definition of sexual assault, in that if one were to be too particular one could make an omission and if one were to be too general one could not be sure what the court would do.  In relation to labelling the offence indecent assault, I understand the view which considers this label as being too mild since many such cases involve an appalling level of sexual violence against women.  I understand the case which argues that the labelling of such conduct as indecent might indicate that one is taking much too mild a view of such appalling conduct.</P>
    <P>In considering this issue we should touch on the question as to whether the definition of rape should be extended. Here, there are two very strong opposing camps.  In fact, the Law Reform Commission split three to two in favour of changing the definition or rape.  A very strong view was also expressed by the Oireachtas joint committee who were strongly in favour.  The majority of the Law Reform Commission took as their extended definition the model contained in the Crimes (Sexual Offences) Act, 1980, adopted in Victoria.  There it was decided to extend the definition of rape. I gather that the Law Reform Commission in Victoria have since produced a further recommendation to alter the definition contained in the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>We also have to take note of the dissenting statement of the president of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, and commission member, Mr. Simon O'Leary, who stated that the <Col N="224" /> paramount objective of the law must be to ensure the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of persons responsible for rape and other sexual offences.  They went on to state that the proposed extension of the definition of rape will not assist in the attainment of this objective. They further pointed out that in the neighbouring jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, where conditions on the whole approximate more closely to conditions in Ireland than in other jurisdictions considered in the consultation paper, the existing definition of rape has been retained and that the criminal law commission in Britain so advised.  The criminal law commission in the United Kingdom took the view that while other forms of penetration are serious and degrading they are distinct from rape.</P>
    <P>We are left with choices.  We have to decide whether we should retain the existing provisions relating to indecent assault, extend the definition of rape or accept the proposal to establish the two new offences to be known as sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault in place of the old offence of indecent assault.  On reading the Bill, and in particular the definition of aggravated sexual assault, my own reaction was that in many ways the offence of aggravated sexual assault is even more horrific than rape.  Here in particular I am referring to the question of penetration by an object held or manipulated by a person.  This conjures up such an appalling image that the strongest definition would not suffice in indicating our abhorrence of such conduct.</P>
    <P>It has been very strongly suggested that women who have been traumatised in this manner feel and react as if they have been raped.  It was also suggested that it would be of some solace to women who have been treated in such an appalling fashion if the offence with which the perpetrator was charged was called rape.  I am strongly influenced by that case.  I wish to make the proposal that the Minister should have a rethink to see if an extension in the definition, to include such conduct, would bring some comfort and solace to women who have been <Col N="225" /> degraded in such an appalling fashion. There is a strong case for going along that road.  I suggest to the Minister that he consult further with his officials and seriously consider adopting such an approach.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the question of the trial in the Central Criminal Court of rape and aggravated sexual assault. The Bill provides that all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  This has come from a very legitimate standpoint. It is an expression of the seriousness with which such crimes are viewed.  It should be made clear that when the Law Reform Commission made their proposal, they did so in the context that it should be the beginning of a process of returning a wider criminal jurisdiction to the High Court.  In the Minister's speech he has accepted the proposal but has made it clear that he is not accepting the context. There are serious practical reasons as to why this proposal should not be adopted. The Minister referred to the fact that there are only just over six rape trials per annum at present held outside of Dublin. The up-to-date figures will show that the Minister's information is out of date.  We should also bear in mind that the proposal will include trial under the proposed charge of aggravated sexual assault.  My real concern is that if we implement this approach it will result in considerable delays.  This would be unfair to both the complainant and the accused.  There is an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied.  There is also the question that the longer the delays in the trial the greater will be the chance that memories will be not as fresh as they would be at an early trial.  In general, experience shows that trials which take place within a reasonable period after an occurrence tend to produce sharper and more exact accounts of what occurred.  I have never heard of any complaint about the conduct of cases in the Circuit Criminal Court. There are no delays there.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the transfer of practically all of the criminal jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court to the Circuit Criminal Court in 1981 was that there <Col N="226" /> was a tremendous delay in getting cases heard in the Central Criminal Court. Trials were delayed for years and this led to the scandal of defendants, who then had an option, having their criminal trials transferred to the Central Criminal Court simply for the purpose of delay.  This scandal was cleared up by the Courts Act 1981, transferring to the Circuit Criminal Court all criminal jurisdiction except murder and treason and the Circuit Criminal Court is completely up-to-date in its criminal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the backlog of cases in the High Court.  So far as I know there is no proposal to increase the number of judges.  I know it can take up to three years, after the service of notice of trial in a civil case in Cork, to have the case heard.  It is no harm to look at the figures. It would be a disgrace if we made a change which would result in delays which could bring miscarriages of justice and cause trauma to complainants.  In August 1988 there were 8,079 actions awaiting hearing in the High Court. During the following 12 months a further 6,222 new actions were set down for hearing, making a total of 14,301.  During the year the courts dealt with 5,363 cases so over the year from August 1988 to August 1989 the arrears increased from 6,222 to 8,938.  That was a very significant increase in the High Court jurisdiction to which we are now proposing to transfer rape trials.  Is this the jurisdiction to which we propose to transfer not just rape but aggravated sexual assault trials?  I cannot accept the bland assurance from the Minister that he does not envisage this procedure leading to delays in the holding of trials in the Central Criminal Court.  It is most important that rape trials should be held without delay.  It is clear that this is very much in the interest of the victims of rape and in the interests of some defendants who may be innocent.  It is intolerable that there should be delays in the hearing of serious crime.</P>
    <P>On the question of figures it is relevant to know the up-to-date position.  During this term, since 1 October to 30 November, there have been 13 rape or indecent assault trials either heard or to be heard <Col N="227" /> in the Dublin Circuit Court.  A similar number have been heard or are listed for trial on the country circuits outside of Dublin.  That is a total of 26 to date and this is just in the first two months of the legal year which commenced on 1 October.  If one were trying to get an assessment one would have to multiply that number over the entire year and one will then see the problems associated with transferring these trials into Dublin into the High Court where the situation is already totally overloaded.  I have the strongest reservations about that proposal, solely from the practical point of view.  It would lead to huge delays.  The President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice Roe, in a view endorsed by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hamilton, has strongly argued against this proposal.  They have experience, and very strong weight must be given to their views.  I will argue this point in more detail on Committee Stage but I am giving notice now that I will propose to have that provision deleted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of bail the Minister proposes that applications for bail in the case of rape and aggravated sexual assault may only be made in the High Court.  This proposal is probably consequent on the proposal to transfer the hearing of such trials to the High Court.  The Minister indicated in his opening speech that he had some reservations about this proposal.  The present procedures are well established. The law is clear and the preliminary examination of the charges will in any event be taking place in the District Court.  On that basis and in line with my view that the trial of rape and aggravated assault cases should not be transferred to the High Court for reasons of delay, this proposal should not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Another change in the Bill relates to corroboration of complainants' evidence in trials of sexual offences.  It is mandatory under existing law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the <Col N="228" /> complainant.  The Law Reform Commission recommend that the question as to whether such a warning should be given and, if so, its terms, should be left to the discretion of the judge trying the individual case.  Under present law the judge is also obliged to tell the jury they may convict the defendent even though there is no corroboration.</P>
    <P>If the jury were obliged to acquit when there was no corroboration it could be said that the law was too favourable to the defendant.  On the other hand, it has been suggested to me that the law requiring corroboration has evolved over the centuries as a result of the collective wisdom of some of the greatest judges who ever sat on the Bench.  It should also be said that the law evolved in times when little consideration was shown to accused persons.  Basically the law was not made to enable guilty defendants to escape but to ensure that an innocent person was not wrongly convicted.  In discussions and debate about miscarriages of justice we also have to bear that in mind, whatever the strong, emotional feelings we have in relation to the position of such horrendous crimes.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that it be left to the judge to decide whether the warning about no corroboration should be given. I want to put on record a strong view that has been put to me and which needs to be considered, that is, that this will allow the judge to usurp the functions of the jury.  The judge's view as to whether he should direct the jury that corroboration was necessary or unnecessary will depend on his view of the veracity of the evidence of the complainant and of the defendant or other witnesses.  It has always been the law at jury cases that it is for the jury and not the judge to decide whether witnesses are telling the truth.  The judge may think a witness is a liar but the jury may think the witness is truthful and, in such cases, the jury must act on their own judgment and not that of the judge.  This is the fundamental law governing trial by jury.</P>
    <P>At this stage I merely raise the issue of whether we should be slow to change a law that has operated well for centuries. The law requiring corroboration has done <Col N="229" /> this.  I cannot pretend to be Solomon.  I certainly will listen to the views of colleagues and other Members of the House on that issue.  I do not raise a red light here but put up an orange signal that perhaps we should be careful before we make that change.</P>
    <P>I next want to touch on the provisions of the Bill dealing with previous sexual history.  The 1981 Act restricted the cross-examination of the complainant concerning previous sexual history with any person other than the accused.  This protection is now being extended to the victims of all sexual assault offences and, in addition, will encompass the previous sexual relations of the complainant with the accused.  When the 1981 Act was passed, section 3 of that Act enacted that before a complainant could be asked questions concerning previous sexual history with men other than the accused, such questions should not be allowed unless permitted by the judge.  Again I put a view that has been very strongly put to me and has to be considered.  If the fact is that the complainant and the accused had sexual relations previously it is difficult to see the circumstance in which such a fact should not be brought to the jury's attention by the defence if the defence so wishes.  If the defendant contended that there was a previous sexual history between him and the complainant it was, presumably, by consent. The fact that there was a previous sexual history between the defendant and the complainant does not necessarily mean that an act of sexual intercourse now by the defendant with the complainant must be considered by the jury to have been with her consent because previously there had been sex by consent.  It may well be that the relationship has finished and that what the defendant did now is rape but, of course, this is a matter for the jury.</P>
    <P>Again, this is a difficult area in which to adjudicate.  We have to take into account the constitutional implications.  There is a strong view that counsel for the defendant should be entitled as a right to question a complainant in respect of her sexual experiences with the defendant <Col N="230" /> previously without having to get the permission of the judge.  On the other hand, it seems that if we do make a change we can expect judges to exercise their discretion in a sensible manner.  Perhaps I am reading too much into the provision. I merely raise the issue for consideration at this stage.  I suppose if the change is made, because fortunately here we have judges who adopt a sensible attitude in the interpretation of the law, we will find that it will not lead to great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on the question of the change proposed involving the capacity of young boys to commit offences of a sexual nature.  Section 5 proposes to make boys aged 13 and younger liable for rape.  The law at present is that all boys under 14 are considered incapable in law of committing rape.  This law is based on a presumption of physical impotence, not on any assumption that the boy is incapable of forming the necessary criminal intent.  This irrebuttable assumption as to the capacity of boys under the age of 14 to commit the crime of rape has been criticised on two grounds.  First, it disregards the basic scientific fact that boys may reach puberty before the age of 14.  Second, it assumes that puberty is a necessary precondition of rape whereas, in fact, this is not so; penetration without fertilisation is sufficient to grant the offence.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an issue that needs to be looked at before we make this change. That is the broader question of the age of criminal responsibility.  There is a strong view abroad that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to the age of 14.  Here we are with a proposal to actually remove the present law that considers somebody under 14 to be incapable of the commission of a rape offence.  This proposed change will have to be considered in relation to our attitude to the proposal to raise the age of criminal responsibility generally.  It is in that context that we have to tie in this particular proposal.  <i>Per se,</i> there is a lot of sense in the proposal; but it would be ridiculous if, in a piecemeal fashion, we made this change and perhaps, in a short time, on the broader issue, ended up discussing <Col N="231" /> a proposal to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14.  It is important that we consider that.  Perhaps a solution might be to allow this change to go through but, in the context of raising the age of criminal responsibility, to talk about raising it to 12 and not 14.  I raise that issue for debate and discussion at this stage.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a further point in relation to consent.  I agree with the thinking behind the section dealing with consent.  However, I think the section, as drafted, is faulty.  I presume what the section intended to say was that a failure or omission by the person alleged to be assaulted to offer resistance does not necessarily constitute consent.  That would be one interpretation of it.  The section goes much further than that.  It means that any failure or omission to offer resistance cannot, in any circumstances, constitute consent.  The Western Australian Court referred to by the Law Reform Commission provides, in effect, that consent means consent freely and voluntarily given and that a consent is not freely and voluntarily given if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means. This might be a better definition, coupled with an addition that failure to offer physical resistance to a sexual assault does not necessarily constitute consent to a sexual assault.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on an issue which we have to address here even if it is not included in the Bill, the question of separate free legal representation.  Strong views have been expressed from time to time on this issue.  The Law Reform Commission strongly opposed a recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee that separate free legal representation should be made available to complainants in rape cases.  When we are talking about providing support for victims of rape a number of approaches can be adopted from the point of view of providing aid or support.  In that context we have to look at what we do in relation to, say, separate legal representation.  I <Col N="232" /> take the view that the commission's arguments in relation to the constitutional propriety of the proposal are fairly compelling. The commission took the view that separate legal representation could lead to unjustified acquittals of people accused of rape and related offences. That is the last thing in the world we want.  If there is a serious argument that such an outcome could be the result of providing for separate legal representation, then we have to take due note of it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if our approach is that we cannot follow that route then we go back to the second basic principle I outlined earlier, that we must seek to avoid all unnecessary distress to the victim and provide whatever support and aid we can to the victim.  If we do not follow the route of providing separate legal representation, it is all the more compelling a reason for a more comprehensive package of measures by way of support for the victims of rape.  I am pleased the Director of Public Prosecutions is taking practical steps which will be of benefit to complainants in sexual offence cases.  These will include furnishing a copy of her statement and access to lawyers acting for the prosecution.</P>
    <P>There are two important occasions when the rape victim really needs comprehensive support, firstly, immediately after the rape and, secondly, when she is facing the ordeal of a trial.  An approach which will involve her being furnished with a copy of her statement, which will involve her having access to prosecution lawyers so that she will not be a bewildered stranger in surroundings which are totally <i>terra incognita</i> as far as she is concerned must be a help.  Much thought has to be given as to the strongest package of support measures possible in that situation and the strongest support possible for bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre. Somebody who has been traumatised in that fashion obviously needs sensitive counselling and bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre are best able to provide that counselling.  If we genuinely mean what we say in that regard, we must not be <Col N="233" /> stingy in our support for bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre.  They must receive adequate, regular support to ensure they can plan ahead to provide continuity of the excellent service they have given over the years.</P>
    <P>While we do not have complete figures, those available suggest that the number of rape cases reported increased by over 50 per cent in the past ten years.  As I mentioned, I believe there is strong evidence to suggest that many cases are not reported at all.  In those circumstances, it is not possible to be precise about the extent of the under-reporting, but we have to take into account the annual number of calls to the Rape Crisis Centre which, unfortunately, in the context of the extent of this offence year by year, I understand have increased. Whatever we do by way of changing the law is not going to solve the problem.  It may help to encourage an increase in the reporting rate, although there is evidence in the USA that that may not be so, and we should be aiming more towards a change in public attitudes.  The fact that we are discussing this Bill here will help in securing that change in public attitudes towards rape.  This, then, might be one of the most important influences in reporting trends and making progress in reducing the number of rapes and sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity to discuss and debate the various serious issues raised.  We will follow that up by teasing out the various proposals on Committee Stage.  I hope at the end of the day we will have made a major addition to the law of rape and related offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing back this Bill before the House so quickly.  It was dealt with in the Seanad and in this House in May of this year.  The spokesman for our party, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, dealt at length with the contents of the Bill on Second Stage.  Therefore, I need not cover the same ground because the Bill is as it was presented then.  No new features appear <Col N="234" /> in the Bill before us, so I will be very brief.</P>
      <P>I would like to record again that the Minister has certainly been bringing reforming measures before this House in rapid succession in the weeks since we returned.  He has had six Bills before us, which are being either dealt with or consideration on them has commenced, and today we are discussing a most important measure which we hope will deal with this very difficult problem.</P>
      <P>The crime of rape is appalling.  Everybody agrees on that.  There is no doubting that.  The primary purpose of the legislation before us should be to protect society from rapists or potential rapists.  Unfortunately, the number of rape offences reported and known since 1980 has been increasing.  In 1980, 46 cases were reported, and each year, with the exception of one year, since then there has been an increase.  The latest figure I have is 74 offences known or reported in 1986. That rate of increase worries the population and there is great concern about it, but I believe the figures I have quoted do not represent the problem that faces the country.  The cases that are not reported are not reported for a number of reasons not the least of which is the fact that women do not want to live with the stigma of rape for the remainder of their lives and there is a very strong reluctance on their part to bring cases before the court.  There is also the problem that the verdict may not be in their favour because of their traumatic experience and because of their lack of coherence in describing those traumatic experiences that occur in a rape case.  Therefore, the Minister in this Bill is making arrangements so that women who have been raped will find it easier to come forward and to be ensured that their case will be heard in greater confidence.  I welcome that provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the definition of rape goes back to the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  It is defined in section 2 very simply as follows:</P>
      <P>A man commits rape if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and</P>
    <P>(b) at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does nor does not consent to it, </P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken the opportunity to redefine that section of the old Bill rather than have introduced the new sections dealing with sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault. Indeed, the definitions are already in the new Bill under the heading of aggravated sexual assault.  I believe they should have been included as a new definition of rape in section 3 which states that the assault includes:</P>
    <P>(a) penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or</P>
    <P>(b) penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. </P>
    <P>That should have been included in a new definition of rape since that would make it absolutely clear why we all want to see this addition to the definition and would make it clear to people if they commit rape what is included in the definition.  It should also include buggery which is not referred to in this Bill or in the definition of aggravated sexual assault.  That is a suggestion to the Minister.  He is inclined to listen to some advice given to him from this side of the House and occasionally to act on it but on most occasions he does not act on it.  I am putting that suggestion forward for consideration on Committee Stage.  Perhaps we will see the definition expanded to bring the 1981 definition up-to-date and into the realm of clear speaking by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention another provision which should be included in this Bill to revise the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, in the area of indecent exposure.  That law is now 54 years old and has not been revised in any recent legislation.  I believe there is a connection <Col N="236" /> here and the Minister should take the opportunity to have a look at that Act and to include new penalties for that particular crime.  It is regarded as a less than serious offence but I can assure the Minister it is a shocking offence to many people and the fact that the penalty is something of the order of £2 or a month in prison is a little old-fashioned as regard penalties.  While this Bill is before the House the Minister should take a look at including a provision for a higher penalty and I will certainly facilitate him by putting down an amendment.  I would ask him to take the opportunity to update the penalty for that crime.  It is regarded as rather jocose but anybody who listens to commentaries or to statements made by women in a recent radio programme will accept that it is an offence that is apparently very common in this country. Indeed, it was suggested that one in three women in this city were victims of indecent exposure both on our public transport and on the streets.  We should take the opportunity in this Bill to say we do not want this type of offence on our streets and on our public transport.  It should be stopped as far as possible and the penalty should be increased for those who wish to commit such offences in our society.</P>
    <P>The Bill should make provision for the sexual history of the plaintiff to be deemed irrelevant in rape cases.  That should be included in any Bill dealing with rape and the Minister should take the opportunity to ensure that that is the case.  The sexual history of the plaintiff is often used to discredit that person.  It is an easy and simple way to defend a case but that should be discouraged in our legislation and separate legal representation should be allowed for the plaintiff.  I know the Law Reform Commission have some doubts in this area.  I feel very strongly that the defendant in the present situation has an unfair advantage over the plaintiff who has had no preparation for the court and, indeed, is suffering a great trauma at this time.  She is really a witness in her own trial on these occasions but, unfortunately, she is not treated in that way.  Therefore, she <Col N="237" /> should be given all the assistance and legal aid possible in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Secton 4 introduces a new addition to the rape law in that the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape is being proposed in the Bill.  I think all of us are happy to see that included in the Bill. This is something that is necessary.  It has been dealt with in the Law Reform Commission's excellent consultation paper on rape.  Obviously, there are difficulties in this area but unless we who ask eminent people to consider this area do not take their advice then we are lacking in our approach to our legislation. The Law Reform Commission have dealt with the problem and they have instanced where the difficulties are but the balance comes down in what the Minister proposed to do under section 4 of this Bill. We welcome it.</P>
    <P>Section 9 has caused great controversy in that it deals with the trials of persons in the Central Criminal Court presided over by a High Court judge.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to this matter in his contribution.  I agreed with the position he has taken on that.  As I said earlier, offences of this nature are increasing; from 1 October to 30 November 13 rape or indecent assault trials were heard in the Central Criminal Court; a similar number were listed for hearing in the Circuit Courts outside Dublin and therefore a total of 26 cases have been heard in various Circuit Courts throughout the country.  I cannot be accurate in this regard but it seems that at the end of this year there will have been at least 100 of these cases before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that cases on indictment should be transferred from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court. We all agree with the Minister in this regard; rape is a very serious crime and should be treated accordingly.  However, hearing trials for rape in the Circuit Court means that justice will be meted out much more quickly than having them all heard in one court.  It can be strongly argued that if this is not done the Central Criminal Court will not be able to handle them as there are already great delays in that <Col N="238" /> court, with the result that justice will be delayed.</P>
    <P>The best way of showing how seriously we regard rape is to have such cases heard as quickly as possible and I am sure the Minister will deal with this point in his reply.  The provision in the Bill &mdash; unless the Minister can convince me to the contrary &mdash; will mean that there will be great delays in dealing with rape cases.  One must remember that some people charged with this crime may be innocent but the ignominy and the delay in waiting for a &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; verdict will mean that the case will be hanging over them for several months and they could also be in jail awaiting bail.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (b) deals with the problem of getting a person out on bail, as things are he could be kept in jail over a weekend. I hope the Minister will look at this area.  We do not want those people on the streets but until the person is proved guilty, and if the Garda feel a person should get bail, he is entitled to bail.  A transfer of all these cases to the Central Criminal Court will mean more demands to let out people on bail because of the delay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill excluding the public from hearings in rape cases and I compliment the Minister for introducing it.  As a result, many more people will be encouraged to bring charges against rapists.  I should also like to raise the treatment of rapists who are committed to prison.  We all agree that sex offenders should receive significant prison sentences so that society can be protected from them.  However, they should get proper treatment in prison as well as being punished because punishment without treatment and counselling is very short-sighted.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's speech on the Estimates last week and I look forward to the extension of treatment in prisons as a result.  We know from experience that when a rapist has served his term of imprisonment he may return to the community and again commit the crime.  Unless proper treatment is effected in prison punishment is counterproductive. Research has shown that <Col N="239" /> experienced people working with sex offenders have been able to help them to avoid committing the crime again.  Statistics in the area where an enlightened approach has been taken show that such a system works.</P>
    <P>The Bill is complex and will be gone into very thoroughly on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will examine some of the points made in the earlier debate and in this debate.  I also hope he will consider my point in relation to indecent assault and that he will introduce penalties which are much more in keeping with the up-to-date situation rather than applying remedies which are 54 years old.</P>
    <P>I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage so that my points will be further debated.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party welcome the introduction of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 and recognise that it constitutes a positive step in an area long warranting reform. The Workers' Party, though their Committee on Justice and Civil Liberties, have been actively engaged in the drafting of proposals specifically in the area covered by the provisions of this Bill.  In that regard in January of this year, at a press conference in Dublin, the committee launched their document in response to the Bill.  I am sure the Minister and his Department have had an opportunity to examine our response and will appreciate at this stage that, in general terms, we are in agreement with the major drift of the proposals contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless we have a number of reservations with which I propose to deal later in my contribution in the hope that the Minister will be in a position to accede to some, if not all of our suggestions, on Committee Stage.  In establishing our position for reform of the law in relation to rape and other forms of sexual assault submissions from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Law Reform, the consultative paper prepared by the Law Reform Commission, the submissions of <Col N="240" /> the Irish Association for Victim Support, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and of the probation of welfare services have been examined in detail.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre must take substantial credit for the debate that has taken place outside this House and which prompted us to re-examine the legislation, particularly bearing in mind that a substantial amending Act was passed by the House in 1981. The fact that we are returning to this House so soon to address the shortcomings of that Act and previous legislation of 1861 and 1935 is an indication of the degree of activity and enthusiasm of people working in the area of victim support.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill before the House are broadly in line with the views outlined in The Workers' Party October 1988 discussion document in our submission published in January this year. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, in a document published in 1986, dealing with the legislation then obtaining, entitled Rape Legislation and Investigative Procedures, sub-titled, A Submission from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights, published in May 1986 adequately reflects the inadequacies of the law under the 1981 and earlier Acts.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining some of the major areas of concern outlined by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in that submission. Their critique and review help us to address what needs to be done with regard to the law, throwing the current Bill into critical relief in order to ascertain whether its provisions measure up to their requirements.  In relation to the 1981 Act they say that its provisions purport to cover three main areas: (a) restriction of admissibility of certain evidence; (b) anonymity of complainant and accused and (c) increased penalty for indecent assault.  They went on to say that it is a very weak piece of legislation, being vague and unspecific in many of its clauses and leaving all important legislative decisions to presiding judge.  They contended it was a shortened version of the British Sexual Offences Act of 1976 which, they said, was worth noting was <Col N="241" /> currently under review and extensively criticised by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in their working paper on sexual offences published in 1980.  They say that report was available before the Dáil enacted the Irish Act and might usefully have been considered by the Minister for Justice before presenting his Bill to the Dáil.  They go on to make the point that the 1981 Act fails in a number of important areas: (a) to criminalise rape within marriage; (b) to define rape in its broadest sense; (c) to protect the anonymity of the victim; (d) to restrict the admissibility of irrelevant evidence as to the complainant's past sexual history; (e) to protect the complainant from feeling that she is on trial and that she is being raped again in court.  Their submission highlighted five major areas not addressed by the law then obtaining.  It has to be said that the Bill now before the House does attempt to address at least four of these areas, three of them adequately and one disappointingly.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, in taking credit for the prompting of this Bill, must be mentioned also in the context of really putting to test our legislative commitment to tackle the problem of the heinous crime of rape in the broadest possible sense.  It is a matter of record in this House that over the past 18 months efforts have been made here to help that centre survive in the face of incredible financial difficulties, working under very stringent conditions.  For example, in November 1988 on an Adjournment Debate I made a plea on behalf of the centre, at that point facing imminent closure, advocating that the Minister of Justice and Health should act to protect and ensure that the budget of the centre was guaranteed.  I understand that since then the Government have made a very limited, inadequate response.  This means that the centre is not in any way guaranteed or secured in its future.  I understand also that, in a number of provincial areas, rape crisis centres &mdash; similar to that operating in Dublin over the years &mdash; have been forced to close their doors.  None of us can be happy with that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> In the context of our responding fairly to the issue of amending the relevant legislation we cannot walk away from the fact that there are agencies out there doing as important, if not more important; work in combating the crime of rape not being assisted.  In fact the whole record of this and the previous Government in regard to victim support has been dismal.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, to all intents and purposes, has been shut down with the exception of mopping up outstanding applications since 1986.  The Irish Association for Victims Support have complained continuously that they have not been properly or adequately funded and are obliged to work on a voluntary, thin shoestring.  As I pointed out, the rape crisis centres in Dublin and elsewhere are simply working on a day-to-day basis with no security for the future.  In the sense that they represent a very important contribution in combating the heinous offence of rape and indecent assault and in the important related function of helping victims legislatively in respect of their evidence in court very little has been done to support them at counselling stage subsequent to the offence having been perpetrated at the time of their appearance in court, when they are required to give testimony, and later.</P>
    <P>We must also have special regard to the work of the Law Reform Commission. They were asked on 6 March 1987 by the then Attorney General to examine the law with regard to rape as it then obtained.  Again the date is significant because it would appear that the Attorney General was then responding to the very cogent submissions made to him by people working in the field.  One would do well to examine the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's submission of May 1985 and the Attorney General's response to the Law Reform Commission in March 1987 asking them to address the very questions highlighted in that submission and which showed deficiencies in our law.  The Attorney General asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the matter.  They sought, first, in their consultative paper extensive information <Col N="243" /> from the Garda Síochána with regard to the problem.  In time they issued a consultative document for the benefit of all interested parties.  They also acknowledged the work of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights in their publication on social violence.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission convened an all day seminar in January 1988 to which they invited all who were involved in drawing up the consultative papers so that they could make their views known.  I had the opportunity to participate in the seminar and found it particularly useful to listen to the wide ranging views of people working in all aspects of the law, from the Bench, lawyers, the court clerks, the Garda Síochána, social workers, the victims and people involved in counselling.  Following the seminar, the commission received a large number of written submissions.  In May 1988 they issued their final report with 21 recommendations.  They also provided a very useful addendum to the report of a general scheme of a criminal law rape Bill.  It has to be acknowledged, although the same cannot be said for the Larceny Bill, that the Minister has followed very closely the format suggested in the Law Reform Commission report and has paid high regard to the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Needless to say there are aspects which the Minister has not followed, but I am sure we can tease them out on Committee Stage, and I have to say The Workers' Party would not adopt some aspects of it also.  However as a working formula for amending the law &mdash; I have spent a little time tracing the history of what happened &mdash; it has been a remarkably good exercise.  People working on the ground, dealing with the problem at first hand, made their submission and were listened to by the primary law officer of the day who then referred it to the Law Reform Commission who issued a report.  We, the legislators, were presented with a document that had regard to all that.  That is very useful and we should try to have more regard to this practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The Law Reform Commission have made the valid point time and again that we the legislators do not give due regard to the many reports they have issued on the reform and improvement of the law. However, we are now giving due deference to their work and recommendations. However, one must ask whether a process which began in 1985 and sees the light of day in the closing weeks of 1989 has moved quickly enough.</P>
    <P>I must mention as an aside that earlier today I had the opportunity to meet a delegation of parliamentarians from Nova Scotia, Canada, who were here to observe the proceedings of this House. How they must have been entertained as they sat and watched the proceedings. They told me they were.  However, they also told me that in a single year they can address up to 90 pieces of legislation, having available to them 150 Bills prepared by a draftsman's office provided by the Legislative Assembly, an assembly of 52 Members.  It seems a remarkable performance by such a small House.  Perhaps we should look at the possibility of having the draftsman's office help us to prepare Bills or even amendments, as amendments to legislation must go through the draftsman's office before they see the light of day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mentioned it in the context of wondering whether we could speed up the legislative process so that legislation initiated through the Attorney General's Office or the Law Reform Commission could be addressed more quickly in this House than we have achieved in dealing with the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are features of the Bill that must be addressed item by item.  The first is the definition of rape as carried under the 1981 Act which repeated in legislative form the common law definition up until then, namely, rape would be committed if the man responsible had unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman, who at the time of intercourse does not consent <Col N="245" /> to it; and that is qualified further by reference to whether the man knew that consent was not forthcoming or was reckless as to the consent.  This relates only to natural intercourse, that is penetration of the vagina by the penis.  It has long been accepted that the failure to recognise the seriousness of many other types of sexual assault and rape was a major flaw in existing legislation and would have to be addressed in any new amending legislation. The Workers' Party and many other organisations have argued for the broadening of the definition of rape to encompass other serious crimes, such as forced oral and anal sex, penetration by bottles or other objects, etc.  The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill deals with this by creating two new offences: sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault.  First, sexual assault will encompass the less serious sexual assaults and will replace the offence of indecent assault on both men and women.  The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for sexual assault will be five years' imprisonment.  On the other hand, aggravated sexual assault is defined under the Bill as an assault which includes or involves serious violence or a threat of serious violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted, or includes penetration, however slight of the anus or mouth of the person, assault by the penis of another person, or penetration, however slight, of the vagina of the woman assaulted by an object held or manipulated by another person.  The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for this offence will be life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>We recognise that there are technical difficulties in broadening the definition of rape but we feel it is a better option than the approach taken in the Bill.  It is crucial to public understanding of the nature of the crime of rape to emphasise that rape is a crime of violence and not sexual passion.  The Bill should reflect that. There is a grave danger in creating the categories set out in the Bill that we will perpetuate the notion or myth, call it what you will, that there is something <Col N="246" /> different and apart in the crime of rape from other serious sexual assaults.  There is not.  Rape is a horrendous crime of violence in all its aspects and should not be set apart from other forms of serious aggravated heinous sexual assaults that are for all intents and purposes rape.  We in The Workers' Party, see rape as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To make a major distinction between rape by natural intercourse and other horrific forms of assault seems to undermine this understanding. Second, it seems that the offence of aggravated sexual assault will be viewed as less serious than rape, and for that reason we are not happy with the approach taken in the Bill.  In the final <Col N="247" /> report prepared by the Law Reform Commission they discussed at length the majority recommendation to broaden the definition of rape.  Paragraph 14 states:</P>
      <P>We accordingly recommend that the crime of rape should be defined by Statute so as to include non-consensual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus and mouth of a person by the penis of another person, or of the vagina and anus of a person by an inaminate object held or manipulated by another person. </P>
      <P>In this form the crime could be committed against men and women.  The Workers' Party fully support that view in terms of a definition and I would urge the Minister, in looking at the Bill before Committee Stage, to again consider amending it to meet with the majority view of the Law Reform Commission. There is dissent in regard to that recommendation by two members of the commission and that is outlined on page 22 of the report.  Their view is primarily that &ldquo;Changes in the definition of the crime will not result in the more efficient realisation of the criminal law's primary objective, namely, the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty&rdquo;. They tend to the conservative view that is reflected in the gradation approach of the Minister in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criminal law must have a wider, more positive and active role to play than merely the primary objective as set out by the two people who comprised the minority dissent.  There must be more to our legislation than merely the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty.  As legislators, we should use our legislation to attempt to lay down social parameters and directives from this House.  It is important in this context, particularly as we are addressing a definition of rape for the second time in this decade, that we get it right on this occasion.  The basic argument of those who seek the broader definition is that we should mark our disapproval of all forms of aggravated sexual assaults on women and men by a broad definition <Col N="248" /> and use of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, recognising that that has, in its connotation, serious and emotive regard the community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the crime of rape, to be called a rapist, to be made answerable in a court to a charge of rape and, most of all, to be found guilty and sentenced for it is a very serious and emotive event to occur, and so it should be.  We argue it should not simply be confined to the very limited sense as contained in the Minister's current definition. We think that all of those other inanimate penetrations referred to in the definition by the Law Reform Commission's majority report are as heinous and as violent on the woman or man as the classical current definition.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting debate and argument outlined in the consultative paper and also in the deliberation on the concept that perhaps conception could result from the act of &ldquo;pure rape&rdquo;.  I do not think that can be a factor in defining what can amount to the act of rape as we should define it in this House.  It is an act of serious, aggravated assault, of violence towards the person in the first instance and that is the approach we should take in seeking to achieve a definition.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a matter that we will obviously have to address on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will have regard for the views of all Deputies on this side of the House, for the majority view of the Law Reform Commission and indeed the views not just of women but of all the organisations referred to in the reports right across the spectrum who are concerned about this problem.</P>
    <P>We recognise obviously that there are drafting difficulties, that it is a problem that will have to be very carefully looked at but I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of the Minister and his officials to come up with a formula that would receive the support of this House.  There exists in a number of other jurisdictions such broadly based legislative proposals that could well be borrowed and used as the yardstick to work with.  Certainly The Workers' Party will seek to assist the Minister in every regard should he pursue this line of approach.</P>

    <Title>Estimates for Public Services 1990 and Public Capital Programme 1990: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on 30 November 1989:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1990 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1990 Summary Public Capital Programme. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To add the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann considers that the 1990 Estimates will do nothing to reverse the trend of inequality and disadvantage that has been the consequence of Government policy since 1987.  Dáil Éireann considers that improved economic growth must be equitably distributed, must lead to the creation of jobs through the creation and retention of wealth in Ireland, and must be accompanied by social improvements in the areas of health, education, housing and social welfare here at home, and by an improved contribution to the alleviation of famine and poverty in the world around us.  Against the background of an improved outlook for the economy, Dáil Éireann considers that the failure of the Government to make additional resources available in the following areas is particularly deplorable, and condemns the Government in respect of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its failure to provide any specific programme to combat the continuing scandal of emigration;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its decision to reduce the Capital Allocation for the provision of health facilities by 8.5 per cent in real terms, notwithstanding the increasing and urgent demand for additional hospital wards and beds and notes that such a cut will <Col N="250" /></P>
    <P>inevitably delay, for instance, work on the Tallaght Regional Hospital;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its failure to provide sufficient current resources in the health allocation to allow for the reopening and adequate staffing of hospital beds and wards, notwithstanding the fact that the use of accident and emergency services as the only means of access to hospital beds for a great many people is leading to a resurgence of long waiting lists for elective treatment in public hospitals;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its failure to make any additional allocation available for the development of additional residential, training and employment opportunities for people with a mental handicap, even though it is now reliably estimated that in the Eastern Health Board area alone, for instance, a total of 328 residential places are needed immediately, with a further 567 places needed in the years after 1990;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its decision to maintain capital spending on the provision of educational facilities at the same deplorably low level as last year, which was the worst year for capital investment in education in the 1980s;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its decision to cut Exchequer current spending on First Level Education by 1 per cent in real terms, and to freeze expenditure on Second Level Education, having regard to the growing level of inequality within our education system, and its decision to use European funding to replace Exchequer expenditure at all levels of our education system;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its continuing covert approach to restricting access to Social Welfare programmes, and its lack of adequate funding for programmes <Col N="251" /></P>
    <P>whose main aim is to combat poverty;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Its deplorable decision effectively to force local authorities to finance their housing programmes out of the sale of local authority houses, thereby ensuring that the housing crisis already evident will become worse this year;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" />&mdash;Its scandalous allocation to International Co-Operation, which now represents the smallest proportion of GNP of any year since 1980.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the lack of Government planning and provision of adequate services for mentally handicapped persons; calls on the Minister for Health to provide adequate residential, day-care and community care facilities for all age groups of mental handicap and to bring forward legislative proposals to give specific legal rights to such disabled persons. </P>
      <P>In total there are some 100,000 handicapped people in this country.  Of these, 23,000 are mentally handicapped.  There are four categories of mental handicap: mild, moderate, severe and profound. Most significantly, of those who are handicapped 850 become adults each year.  We have seriously neglected adult mentally handicapped persons who are living at home with ageing, geriatric or dying parents.  The crisis they face is that there is little or no prospect of finding residential places for those adult mentally handicapped persons.  The parents' greatest anxiety and fear is that after they die there will be nowhere for handicapped persons to go.  That is a very big burden for those people to carry to the grave.  Having minded their children all their lives there is no prospect of finding a place for them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine the statistics we find that at present in the Dublin area alone there is urgent need for 330 residential places, and there is a need for an extra <Col N="257" /> 800 residential places for adults generally. It is quite obvious that the Government have no overall plan to provide for the special needs of mentally handicapped persons.  When we take a look at the current climate in relation to the provision of services and Government policy we see that resources have been frozen and curtailed in real terms, that staff numbers have been severely restricted and that families with members who are mentally handicapped face the future with uncertainty and fear.  Not only do we not have extra resources to meet extra needs, but the number of persons with mental handicap are increasing and they also have an increased life expectancy. Fine Gael are proposing an integrated five year investment plan to meet those needs.  This would include the provision of extra residential places, a national provision for day care centres, adequate places for vocational training and adequate respite facilities for families plus a wide range of ancillary specialist services.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that we now look at the statistics in relation to need.  One of the big problems has been the absence of proper statistics.  Through the work of the central planning committee of the Eastern Health Board we now have a proper assessment.  I accept that there were people on a waiting list to get into St. Michael's House, St. John of God's and other centres, but we now have accurate State figures as to the need in the Dublin region.  The EHB cover 40 per cent of the population and provide the best service.  The service deteriorates once one moves outside of the Pale. According to the figures, there is a need for 29 residential places for children in the EHB area.  In terms of adults and adolescents there is a need for 253 places.</P>
    <P>We have a total of 16,000 mentally handicapped persons of all ages living in family settings.  The quality of their lives depends not only on the loving environment in their homes but on the dignity they acquire through day time activities so that they can lead full and active lives. They should be able to go to a day centre where they can receive therapy that will <Col N="258" /> improve their wellbeing and welfare. The waiting list for day care centres comprises 57 children and 334 adults and adolescents. It is estimated that the financial resources required by the EHB amount to £7 million &mdash; £2 million capital and £5 million for current uses.  These are the figures of the central planning committee, they are not my figures.  They are very telling and they relate only to the requirement for 1989-90.</P>
    <P>One must ask what will be the position in the future.  All of these mentally handicapped people are already in society and their parents are getting older.  Figures of residential places in the EHB area between now and 1992 show the need for a startling 1,645 additional residential places.  I inquired how many places had been provided this year in the EHB area and to the best of my information I found that only five additional places have been provided in the Dublin area this year in St. Michael's House.  The discrepancy between what the Minister is doing and the requirement is incomprehensible, and it is no wonder that the Parents' Association for the Mentally Handicapped will be taking to the streets this Friday to protest to this House at the inaction of the Government.</P>
    <P>The quality of life for the mentally handicapped at home depends on access to specialist centres on a daily basis.  It is estimated that some 360 day places are now required for the Dublin area and 1,000 such places are required nationally. There is a total of 6,000 people with mental handicap living in the community in the EHB area.  The establishment of an integrated set of services for the mentally handicapped, based on guidelines laid down by the Department of Health, to be operated in each health board area is essential.  This would include day care centres with the back-up facilities of speech therapists and physiotherapists. In relation to speech therapists, it is undoubtedly the case, given that mental handicap cannot be cured, that of all the specialist services, speech therapy can be of enormous benefit.  I know that some cases are waiting three years before they are even assessed.  I know of one child <Col N="259" /> who had speech therapy for a couple of years and then there was a break of two and a half years with no speech therapy although the child was responding very well to speech therapy.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister commissioned a report on communication needs, a discussion document on needs and services for people with mental handicap in Ireland. The foreword of the report was written by the Minister this year.  The working party report, in their recommendations on speech therapy, stated that there should be an additional 371 speech therapists appointed and they recommended that there should be the immediate creation of 20 new posts each year for the next three years.  It is obvious that all the other recommendations in the report pale into insignificance when the central recommendation of additional manpower is neglected.</P>
    <P>The research, career structure, guidelines, therapy assessment, intervention and the setting up of multi-disciplinary teams are Utopian in relation to what is provided in the 1990 Estimates.  There is no point commissioning an expert analysis of the situation to assess the speech therapy and communication needs and then leaving the report to gather dust.  In a national integrated plan, we envisage adequate physiotherapy and speech therapy services.  A standard component of the community care element of our services requires that there should be monitoring and assessment units involving the local director of community care, the National Rehabilitation Board and a consumer input from the parents of mentally handicapped persons based in each catchment area.</P>
    <P>Genetic counselling is not available on a regional basis, and it should be.  There is a lot of talk about preventive medicine but nothing has been done in this area.  I have heard of parents who have not been told professionally and diplomatically in the early days after a baby is born that the child is mentally handicapped.  It is vital to have experts to counsel parents in these situations.  If families are to cope <Col N="260" /> in a community care setting we must urgently put in place proper counselling facilities.  If we talk about providing comprehensive care for the mentally handicapped we are not just talking about the Department of Health.  The needs of mental handicap extend beyond the duties of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>There are some crazy anomalies in our social welfare code.  If one is a mentally handicapped person one is entitled to a free travel pass, that is very important, but there is a catch in that one can only use one's free travel pass if one is accompanied by a spouse.  How many mentally handicapped persons have spouses?  Surely if there was any charity in the system, we would allow that a mentally handicapped person would only have to be accompanied by a companion instead of a spouse to avail of the benefits of a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>In that regard also, under the law, a mentally handicapped person is entitled to a free travel pass only on reaching 16 years of age.  I cannot understand why a mentally handicapped infant is not entitled to free travel.  A particular grievance in relation to that &mdash; and perhaps the Minister would address this because it is directly within his own control &mdash; is that a mentally handicapped person is, on his 16th birthday, automatically entitled to a medical card irrespective of means.  Surely, on compassionate grounds again, a medical card should be issued at birth because the most serious expense in relation to medicines and GP visits etc.  occurs in the formative years. I ask the Minister to amend that to ensure that mentally handicapped people get these benefits at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>Also, in relation to the social welfare code the position is that if a mentally handicapped person is taken into a residential centre he is given not one penny of pocket money, irrespective of means. Some small amount of disabled person's maintenance allowance should be paid to those mentally handicapped persons who are in residential homes.</P>
    <P>The principal social welfare benefit we have for mentally handicapped children in the community is the domiciliary care <Col N="261" /> allowance.  Unlike other social welfare payments this has not kept pace with inflation and is at a very meagre rate.  I ask the Government to reconsider this and increase it and, in the case of mentally handicapped persons, to abolish the annual medical test, because it is patently obvious that those people are not going to get better.</P>
    <P>There is a real crisis developing in relation to the educational needs of the handicapped.  Some years ago there were attendants and assistants in the class with the special teachers.  There was a ratio of 12 pupils to one teacher.  With the cutbacks the attendants have gone, the assistants have gone and the teachers are left to manage on their own.  Because of the cutbacks and restrictions there are groupings of the more severely and even profoundly handicapped children in the same small class as those with mild and moderate handicap.  This is totally unacceptable and restricts the educational opportunities for those children.</P>
    <P>In the motion we make reference to the legal rights of the mentally handicapped. Currently those legal rights are inadequate. The Health Acts do not give the handicapped the right to service.  Under law it is stated that a health board &ldquo;shall provide&rdquo; certain services.  That has been interpreted by CEOs in health boards as meaning that maybe they will provide the services and maybe they will not, according to the financial constraints on them.  It is absolutely true that there is no civil right of mentally handicapped persons to medical services.  They are dependent on vague generalities as to the provision of care.  This, essentially, means that the quality of service, the access to service depends on what part of the country one lives in.  Access to speech therapy and physiotherapy services clearly depends on where one lives and how extensive the health board's services are in that area.  It is unacceptable that we do not have a standard of health care that is enforceable across the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to the law, we should introduce a system of guardianship where appropriate for mentally handicapped adults who have lost their parents.  I am <Col N="262" /> thinking of a mentally handicapped adult in his thirties or forties in a residential home whose parents are deceased, where there is nobody to look after his best interests, nobody to be consulted.  The Down's Syndrome Association have lobbied for it, and it is only reasonable that we establish a legal system of guardianship for adult mentally handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the important area relating to the moderate and mildly handicapped and their need for human dignity, their need for employment, for training.  Right across this country we have a proud tradition and an excellent record of rehabilitation centres, of community workshops and other vocational training centres that do an excellent job. It is a source of great regret to me that our mainline services, formally AnCO, the National Manpower Service and now FÁS have totally washed their hands of the disabled.  They are just not interested. This work has fallen mostly on voluntary bodies such as the community workshops and Rehab.</P>
    <P>The problem is twofold.  First there is a huge waiting list to get into community workshops.  People who have come out of schools at 17, 18 and 19 years of age are sitting at home doing nothing when they could usefully be involved in community workshops.  However, there are no places available because there are no opportunities in open employment for the people who have completed the training in the community workshops.  The system of funding is through the European Social Fund.  There is a grant for five years for participants in the community workshops but after the five years the money ends.  Because there are no employment opportunities for these people after the five years they are staying in the community workshop so that there are no new places to let in new entrants.  This is a critical situation for these adolescents and young people who are at home and quite capable of participating but who have no opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There is only one solution.  The Minister has a golden opportunity now, <Col N="263" /> coming into Ireland's Presidency of the European Council of Minister on 1 January. Ireland should take an initiative to ensure that sheltered employment and participation in sheltered employment projects get ESF funding.  We have only one centre for sheltered employment here &mdash; and by sheltered employment I mean subsidised work that is, perhaps, up to the productivity of one-third of industrial performance and that needs an economic subsidy.  We have one centre in this country for the blind which is quite costly but we need a national programme which, given Exchequer constraints, can only be found by ESF funding.  We should take the initiative in this area and seek ESF funding for sheltered employment. That is absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>There are other recommendations in the report on training and employing the handicapped.  It is a lovely document with some very worthy analyses and some excellent recommendations.  It clearly says that there should be, at local level, integration between the national rehabilitation board, FÁS and the director of Community Care to establish a register of persons who are suitable for training in sheltered employment, that would assess them, place them appropriately and monitor their performance thereafter. The establishment of proper activation and training centres is the way to go. It is not good enough to give mentally handicapped young people a special education either integrated into the overall education system or in a special school up to 18 years of age, put them on a waiting list and after that basically forget about them.  We need to maintain education services beyond 18 years of age and make available some 3,000 or 4,000 extra places in sheltered employment.  That would have a very beneficial effect on the whole community.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific areas that I would like to refer to briefly as it often takes a specific case to highlight a situation.  Most of the centres dealing with the handicapped across the country are facing severe restrictions at present. When we scrutinise the 1990 Estimate we <Col N="264" /> will see that, at best, extra money is being made available to meet the inflationary demands of pay and so on but if we make a closer analysis of the extra £111 million that has been granted in the health Vote in 1990, what do we see?  The extra £15 million for our acute hospital programme, the decision to keep beds open during the summer, the decision as regards accidents and emergency services in Dublin and Mullingar hospitals, apply to the last quarter of this year.  Multiply those by four for the cost of those policy decisions in a full year and throw in pay increases, and we find the health budget for 1990 is some £35 million short of meeting the real needs.  That is without improving in any way the needs of a component such as the services for the mentally handicapped.  Instead of an increase of £111 million, when we annualise the cost of the policy decisions taken in the last quarter of this year we find after inflation, after medical inflation, after all the built-in added costs, we are £35 million short on the opening position in 1989. A great misconception has been created that the health crisis is over.  The health crisis is alive and well, unfortunately, and will linger as long as this Government remain in office.</P>
    <P>As is the case with so many areas such as the dental policy that we have discussed here, there is no stated policy for the mentally handicapped.  There is no stated policy on the input of all the different components of training day care and residential care.  We have no norm set down of so many per thousand of the population put in place.  We are dependent on the crumbs from the national lottery for mental handicap on a hand to mouth basis over recent years.  The 23,000 people in this country who are mentally handicapped because they are so voiceless and vulnerable deserve much better than to be dependent simply on the lottery.</P>
    <P>We need a special sex education programme for adolescents with mental handicap because they perhaps could be more vulnerable to sexual abuse than any other group.  Within our education system and our specialist education <Col N="265" /> system we need a national educational psychologist service for all children attending to get the proper assessment.</P>
    <P>In relation to paediatric nursing we need special revision for their training incorporating the work of An Bord Altranais to deal with the specialist needs of the mentally handicapped.  That, with a comprehensive costing service, would form the basis of what is required.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this is a somewhat truncated debate by virtue of the votes and, as I said, I wish to share my time with Deputy Jimmy Deenihan and I will summarise as follows.  For the last half dozen years we have had a freezing of resources for the mentally handicapped. We have been told that within the overall context of the health cutbacks the services for the mentally handicapped have been protected.  This is a not true.  Services have not been maintained, and at a time when there are increasing numbers, increased life expectancy and increased demand, no provision has been made in a planned way to provide the extra 800 residential places now required and double that within the next three years, and the 1,000 extra day care places required across the country.  We have made no arrangements to put in place with those mainline and residential day care places the back-up services of speech therapy, physiotherapy and counselling. No steps have been taken to integrate a system of assessment and monitoring for mentally handicapped places.  There has been no new initiative in relation to vocational training and sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>All in all there is a crisis of neglect. There is a predictable need.  We are not talking about an epidemic, something like the AIDS virus that is beyond technology at this stage in terms of a cure. We are dealing with an inevitable and predictable need of the most vulnerable and voiceless section of our community. The parents and families of this sector are now saying that enough is enough. They have carried this on their backs for so long and now extra money is being made available for the health services in Supplementary Estimates this year, and <Col N="266" /> next year there is no extra provision for the mentally handicapped.  I appeal to all sides of this House to support this motion and I hope, arising out of this debate, we will have a five year investment plan and policy strategy put in place to ensure that the mentally handicapped are no longer the forgotten Cinderella sector of our health services but are put in their rightful place at the top of the political agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who had experience in working with the handicapped for a time before I came into this House I can identify with the call by the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped for a better deal.  I can also understand their feeling of hopelessness and the feeling they are being let down and ignored by the present system and the present Government.  If one looks at the progress made in the early eighties and compares it with recent progress one can understand fully that these people have every right to be frustrated and to feel bad about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Yates pointed out, there is an urgent and immediate need for an additional 328 residential places and 360 day places in the greater Dublin area alone.  Nationwide approximately 800 residential places and more than 1,000 day places are required.  The organisatìons, most of which are voluntary, providing services for persons with a mental handicap cannot cope with this huge demand.  The problem is just basic lack of resources and finance.  Many of the persons with a mental handicap are with specialist training able to acquire vocational and social skills.  This enhances their dignity and sense of self worth.  As a result the quality of life for persons with a mental handicap and their families is greatly improved.  Many have the ability to be trained for open employment and are then in a position to contribute to the economy.  Others will thrive as employees in supported enterprise type ventures.  An activation programme <Col N="267" /> will benefit other.  The funding crisis has halted the development of suitable programmes for such people.  Roughly these programmes can be divided as follows. As regards training, specific work skills and general social skills are required by trainees with a view to competing for and holding down a job in the open labour market.  Training takes place in vocational training programmes and in pre-vocational post-school programmes. These programmes are totally curtailed at the moment and the resources are not there to expand them.  They gave the opportunity for all our handicapped people who would fit into this category an opportunity to improve themselves and expand their personalities.</P>
    <P>Community-based enterprises can be established successfully to give long-term, meaningful employment to persons with more limited ability.  While some enterprises can be commercially viable, many will require financial support. Again, the people involved in providing enterprises, especially community-based enterprises, for handicapped people are curtailed in their efforts by basic lack of resources.  They could do far more and they are crying out for more resources in order to provide more enterprises for this most vulnerable section of our population.</P>
    <P>Community-based activation units can increase greatly the quality of life for persons whose capacity to work is limited. The focus of these programmes is on recreation and social skills.  The possibility for community-based activation units again is greatly curtailed by the lack of resources.  Because of cutbacks and lack of resources many persons with a mental handicap are sitting at home living lives of poor quality and are often an emotional and economic drain on their parents and siblings.  Were additional resources available many of these people could take part in a meaningful day programme which would not cost very much. Frequently the buildings are already available but more funding is needed to pay staff and running costs.  Certainly, this is the case in my own county of Kerry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I would like to refer briefly to the problems in Kerry, with which I am most familiar. The biggest crisis involves those over 18 years of age.  There are no services available on demand for people leaving school.  The facilities are there but the resources are not available to provide additional staff to operate the facilities.  We have one of the finest facilities in Ireland in Tralee which is managed by the St. John of God Brothers, but they do not have the human resources to keep it open long enough and to operate a number of programmes which they could if they had the resources.  Middle age handicapped people living with aging or single parents are particularly vulnerable. Deputy Yates singled out this group specifically.  There are about 60 people in this category in County Kerry alone. Over the next five years these people will be looking for residential care.  As Deputy Yates rightly pointed out, the major fear among old people who have handicapped children is what will happen to them when they are dead.  There are no seven day residential care facilities for handicapped people in County Kerry except St. Finian's Hospital.  As the Minister has often pointed out, it is stated Government policy that handicapped people should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are in County Kerry with no facilities to cater for this most vulnerable section of our population. The voluntary agencies are prepared to co-ordinate efforts to provide the necessary service if given the resources.  I would point out here that the grant given to the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped in County Kerry by the Southern Health Board this year was derisory and an insult to their work and efforts on behalf of the handicapped in the county.  In Listowel at present the Department of Education are building a special school for the handicapped &mdash; I welcome the initiative &mdash; which will take over from the Nano Nagle school for the handicapped in Lixnaw. <Col N="269" /> By some strange coincidence the school for the handicapped is being located upstairs whereas a local primary school is downstairs.  Surely it would have been far better planning if the school for the handicapped was located downstairs.  To add insult to what was already a grave injustice, they have refused to provide funding for a lift for this school; in other words, the parents and friends of the handicapped in County Kerry will have to provide, from their own resources, funds for this lift.  This is showing a total disrespect for the handicapped people in our county.  I appeal to the Minister to take up this matter with the Minister for Education.  The cost involved is £36,000; not a huge cost.  It is only right that this lift should be totally or partially funded by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Yates said, we need a clear definite policy from the Government on the future development of educational and health services for the mentally handicapped in Ireland.  This is an immediate and urgent priority.  Such a policy should be formulated in consultation with all the voluntary agencies, the various health board workers, teachers, parents and friends of the mentally handicapped at all levels and all those other people involved with the handicapped.</P>
      <P>Research is urgently needed to determine the nature and extent of the overall education and health problems of mentally handicapped people, otherwise planning will continue to take place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as at present.  The Minister has a constitutional obligation to cherish all the children of this country equally.  I call on him to exercise his responsibility on behalf of this most vulnerable section of our community.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with my amendment I want to deal with one point raised by Deputy Yates and I will come back to other points raised by him as we progress. He stated that in the £11 million extra gross there was no money for any development whatsoever and he said the £15 million which was spent in a quarter <Col N="270" /> in the acute hospitals became £60 million for a full year.  The reality is that it becomes £34 million for a full year.  As the Deputy is well aware, I have given a breakdown many times of the £15 million and some of it was for equipment which is a non-recurring expense.  This is the sort of arithmetic that got the Coalition into trouble and they grossly over spent during the years they were in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

After that we will be asking that Deputies, especially in respect of the subject we are discussing, exercise some restraint and listen to each other from whichever side.  If they do not I shall have to remind them of the consequences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Commends the reports of the Minister for Health to improve the level of services available to mentally handicapped persons despite the severe overall limitations on Exchequer resources and the intention to make further resources available for the development of these services as budgetary circumstances permit. </P>
      <P>May I say first of all that I am fully conscious of and sensitive to the needs and fears of the families of mentally handicapped people, as evidenced in the considerable debate and publicity which is accorded to this general subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> I am glad to have the opportunity to put on the record the Government's policy in relation to mental handicap services.  In summary, this policy aims to ensure that services appropriate to their requirements are available to people with mental handicap and specifically, that the necessary support services are made available to enable persons with mental handicap to live as normal a life as possible.</P>
    <P>While few would question that this policy is correct, some may question, however, whether there is a gap between the policy and the service on the ground. I recognise the gaps and I fully accept that there are further developments in the services required to bring about the full realisation of the aspirations of that policy.  Neither do I underestimate the challenge in achieving that result in financial and, indeed, in attitudinal terms.  I do not accept, however, that the service has been at a standstill over the recent past.  Significant improvements have taken place during the past three years.  My priority is to ensure that the pace of these improvements is accelerated.</P>
    <P>To put this problem into perspective the Government are spending about £130 million on services for people with a mental handicap in the current year, this is about 10 per cent of total public spending on all health services or about 22 per cent of what we spend on acute hospital services.  Indeed, Deputy Yates suggested twice that the amount of money being provided was frozen over the last number of years but that is not the case. There has been quite a substantial increase in the amount of money provided over the last three years.  Other services had their allocation reduced but that did not happen in the case of services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>As soon as mental handicap is suspected in the case of an infant, referral is made to the appropriate local agency, voluntary or health board, for detailed assessment and advice and support to parents.  Thereafter a range of services is <Col N="272" /> available.  About 2,400 families get domiciliary care allowance of £79 per month for mentally handicapped children, at a total cost of £2.2 million.  At age 16 the young adult is eligible for disabled person's allowance, maximum £47.20 per week.  Up to 8,000 mentally handicapped persons are in receipt of this allowance, about one third of the total number of recipients of the allowance.</P>
    <P>There are 53 special residential centres catering for 4,679 persons, 210 hostels with 1,205 residents, 80 day care centres catering for 1,967 persons and 90 training centres with 3,309 places.  The 90 training centres came on stream since the publication of the Robins' report in the seventies and it is an indication that my predecessors and I have worked to implement as many of the recommendations of the report as possible. There is a steady programme of location of persons with a mental handicap from the psychiatric institutions to more appropriate settings.  There are now fewer than 1,600 residents in such institutions but, pending their transfer, special units within the hospitals are being designated for them and appropriate programmes implemented.</P>
    <P>To continue our economic development a restraint on public spending needs to continue.  I am sure the House accepts that the only way to develop our social services on any sort of a sound basis is to make sure that we can produce the finance for that purpose through a healthy economy.  The House has seen the value of the Government's policies over the last two and a half years.  As a result of this, health spending, unfortunately, cannot be radically increased over the next few years.  Close management of the funds will be necessary to cater for the needs of people as they arise.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, taken positive steps to meet this challenge.  To do so requires that in my planning I must ensure that all funds allocated to me are distributed carefully to ensure the greatest return, ensuring the best quality of service to the people in need.  I must also ensure that where additional funds become available, people in greatest need of services have <Col N="273" /> priority.  To do this requires two things. Firstly, it requires accurate information on individual needs, and secondly, it requires agreement between service providers, statutory and voluntary, as to how those needs will be met.  These, essentially, are the reasons behind my decision to reactivate the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in each health board area.</P>
    <P>The main function of these committees is the development, implementation and monitoring of a plan of services for their respective health board areas in which statutory and voluntary agencies co-ordinate their services.  This includes not only agreement on such matters as catchment areas and content of services to be provided by each agency to ensure no overlapping of duplication occurs.  It also requires rationalisation of services, the determination of, and planning to provide for, unmet needs.</P>
    <P>I know this is not an easy task.  It is not easy to agree on the degree of priority of one proposal relative to another.  All proposals have their merits and I can assure the House there is no shortage of proposals.  Indeed, Deputy Yates referred tonight to an excellent report on speech therapy.  I did not commission the report, it was produced by a special interest group in speech therapy for the mentally handicapped and they are based in Galway.  It is an objective report and it points out the needs in the area of speech therapy.  The reports stated that 371 speech therapists are necessary but it is fair to make the point that that requirement did not just become necessary in the past two-and-a-half years, it has been there for many years.  Perhaps there was not a need for 371 speech therapists but many were needed and we will be looking into that area.  This highlights the value of the co-ordinating committee who will be able to decide on the priority needs in the various areas.  I know that decisions on priorities are difficult but they must be made.  It would, as I have said, be unrealistic to expect resources to meet all demands immediately.  Good choices must be made if the best value is to be obtained from what we have.  In general, <Col N="274" /> our first priority must be to provide services to people who currently have either no service or a completely inadequate one.  This must involve the use of all the resources which are available to the sector, including the use for capital purposes of resources collected from private sources.  All resources should be used to ensure the thrust of the overall policy.</P>
    <P>The work of the co-ordinating committees has advanced more quickly in some areas than in others.  I have been particularly impressed by the work of the co-ordinating committee in the Eastern Health Board region.  The committee identified a wide variety of unmet needs for individuals.  These range from children and adults with no day services, shortage of crisis intervention respite care facilities and shortages of residential facilities.</P>
    <P>This committee have now provided me with hard information on the needs of people with mental handicap in the Eastern Health Board area, backed by cost estimates and a blueprint for meeting these needs.  The committee's proposals, together with proposals from other areas are being considered by me and I hope to be in a position to respond to them in a positive way in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have always been happy to acknowledge the significance of the role played by the voluntary organisations in the provision of services for the disabled people and in ensuring that the quality of the care provided is fully in line with modern thinking about the needs of these people and the obligations of society to meet them.</P>
    <P>We are particularly fortunate that we had the core of the services long before the health boards were developed, due mainly to the religious orders.  Since the commission's report in 1965 there has been tremendous development in this country of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>I am quite clear about the need for the maintenance and strengthening of the voluntary area and the importance of good relations between the voluntary and public sector in catering for handicapped persons.  The reconstitution of co-ordinating committees in each health board <Col N="275" /> area comprising representatives of the statutory and non-statutory bodies, including a representative of my own Department, in each case is designed to promote this mutual understanding and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I very much regret, therefore, to have to say that my experience with Cheeverstown in the past year has been a disappointment.  I dealt with this matter in my reply to a question by Deputy Flood this afternoon.  However, its relevance in the context of this debate is such that I may perhaps be allowed to recapitulate.</P>
    <P>The Cheeverstown complex was built at a cost of £8 million to play a central role in meeting an acute need for up to date provision for handicapped children and adults in the Dublin region, an area which is generally accepted to have special problems at the present time.  The revenue funding of this centre is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board, which have the statutory obligation of ensuring that there is an adequate and properly managed service for the people of their area and for seeing that these services are dispensed in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>It is quite reasonable, therefore &mdash; indeed it is an obligation upon them &mdash; that the health board should wish to be satisfied about the manner of operating of the agencies they fund and their contribution towards meeting the priority needs of the people on their waiting lists for residential and day places.  The health board expressed themselves as dissatisfied in this regard with Cheeverstown.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the disagreement between the board of that centre and the health board in an attempt to reach an accommodation between the two parties which would allow for due progress with the development of the badly needed facilities in this fine centre.  The two criteria which I had regard to were (1) Cheeverstown should be developed to its full potential as a matter of urgency and (2) neither the Eastern Health Board nor Cheeverstown would be allowed to dominate the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> My sole concern was to ensure that the resources allocated to Cheeverstown should be made available to those handicapped people who needed them and their hard pressed families.  I also made it clear that I would not give any support to a takeover of the centre by the statutory authorities.  After a series of meetings and negotiations with all of the parties involved, an interim management board was established representative of the existing Cheeverstown board, the Eastern Health Board, the voluntary sector and parents representatives under the chairmanship of former Garda Commissioner, Eamonn Doherty.</P>
    <P>The constitution of this interim committee was such as to ensure that no one party had a predominating voice.  The committee consisted of three representatives of the Eastern Health Board, three representatives of Cheeverstown, one representative of the major voluntary orders running a service for the mentally handicapped, one representative of the parents and Mr. Eamonn Doherty as chairman.</P>
    <P>The prospect in view was that by working together in pursuance of a common aim of service to the handicapped and the full utilisation of Cheeverstown, a spirit of understanding and trust would develop which would enable the old Cheeverstown board to resume control after a year or two in an atmosphere which ensured good relations with the health board.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, my formula was not implemented.  The old Cheeverstown board retained the running of the affairs of the centre and have refused to accept my further suggestion for an impartial board which would have been representative of the main voluntary organisations in Dublin, together with representatives from Cheeverstown itself and the health board.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in my dissatisfaction with this state of affairs.  Three members of the Cheeverstown board have already resigned in protest at the recalcitrance of its chairman and other members, and the representatives of the parents, who are so anxious to see places opened for their <Col N="277" /> children, have also voiced their discontent with the attitude of Cheeverstown board.  I can say that the other major voluntary organisations were not happy with the response of that board.</P>
    <P>In short, given the identified need for places in residential accommodation I cannot any longer tolerate a situation in which there are 60 such places unused in Cheeverstown.  I have initiated a certain course of action to deal with the situation, in view of the seriousness of the need for this facility to come into full use and the substantial investment of scarce and badly needed funds in its construction and running.</P>
    <P>There is no other similar experience in other parts of the country.  In fact I would like to place on record my acknowledgement of the excellent relationships which exist otherwise between the Department, the health boards and the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the concern of parents of mentally handicapped people earlier. Deputy Yates, in his opening remarks, highlighted one such fear.  A fear which is often expressed is that their mentally handicapped child or adult will not be cared for when the parents die.  Such a strain and such a prospect would be intolerable and is one of the issues concerning the lives of the disabled which needs to be dealt with in an unambiguous fashion.</P>
    <P>It is most important that a close relationship is established in every individual case with the agency in whose area of responsibility that handicapped person and his or her family are living.  This will ensure that when the parents are no longer living there is the assurance that he or she will be cared for in a setting, and by people, who understand their particular needs.  I believe that this is not simply an ideal but is in fact the practice in every case.  If, however, there is any parent who is not satisfied that an arrangement of this kind is apparent in their case, they should contact their family doctor, the health board and my Department to assist them in establishing a satisfactory promise of continuing care for their family member.  No parent <Col N="278" /> should have to worry about this.  I am satisfied that if a crisis arises, it would be dealt with.  I am unaware, in fact, I could not envisage a situation where if the parents or a parent died or something happened suddenly that a mentally handicapped child or adult would not be looked after.  In fact it has been my experience that children were taken into care and received the best of attention.</P>
    <P>It is far from the truth to say that there have been no developments in mental handicap services in the past few years. There are now some 11,000 people with a mental handicap in receipt of day or residential services.  This represents an increase of 12 per cent on the level of activity in 1985.  Since 1986 the allocations to voluntary agencies funded by my Department have increased from £58 million to almost £69 million in 1989, an increase of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline some of the salient features of these developments. Approximately £500,000 has been made available to St. Vincent's centre on the Navan Road in Dublin to facilitate the movement of some 200 residents from the centre to alternative accommodation. In this connection, I must pay special tribute to the Daughters of Charity for the manner in which they responded to the urgent need which arose, following the serving of a fire notice on their premises at the Navan Road.  The co-operative spirit in which the order worked with my Department in meeting this emergency was most heartening.  This urgent task involved the relocation of several hundred severely handicapped people to a range of alternative facilities over a short period.</P>
    <P>Progress in this matter has been most satisfactory from many points of view, with a substantial improvement in the quality of life of the residents concerned. This achievement is a splendid example of the flexibility and enterprise of a voluntary body who have traditionally provided an excellent caring service for people with mental handicaps.  With a long tradition of providing such care in an institutional setting, the Daughters of Charity services have moved into the <Col N="279" /> community with a rapidity and professionalism which sets an example for the whole country and indeed, for the rest of Europe.  I have also recently conveyed my approval to a new purpose built unit on the Navan Road which will serve as the resource centre for the services provided from the St. Vincent's complex.</P>
    <P>This unit will have facilities for respite care in addition to long term care.</P>
    <P>St. Michael's House also received resources which enabled them to open their adult special care unit for 50 people at Belcamp.  In addition they were given resources in 1988 to provide ten residential places, five of which were for short term or crisis relief.  Funding was provided in 1988 to enable Phase 1 of Áras Attracta, Swinford, consisting of 66 residential places, to come into operation. There are currently 40 places occupied. When fully operational the centre will provide residential places for 140 adults and 50 children, and 60 day care places.</P>
    <P>Important developments which have taken place in the North Eastern Health Board include the development of a special mental handicap service at Clogher House to cater for persons formerly within St. Davnets.  The St. John of God Brothers provided ten hostels for 43 people.  Through redeployment and rationalisation the order are also involved with the health board in expanded day services in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It is now accepted policy that people with mental handicap should not be admitted to mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>Following the successful relocations of clients from a number of psychiatric hospitals, all health boards are being encouraged to have assessments carried out by the mental handicap agencies in relation to people with a mental handicap who are currently in psychiatric hospitals, with a view to providing more appropriately for their needs.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I provided funds for the opening of ten residential places in Dawn House, Wexford.  I also provided funds to the Brothers of Charity and the Brothers of St. John of God to open <Col N="280" /> hostels in Galway and Monaghan respectively.</P>
    <P>In total over £4.8 million was paid in capital grants for mental handicap services during 1987-88 for a variety of projects, including renovations and improvements to existing facilities and development of new community facilities. In addition to the projects which I have mentioned, a further £1.5 million has been made available from the proceeds of the national lottery for the provision of community based accommodation for people in institutions and renovation work to existing facilities. A large number of agencies working with the mentally handicapped have received financial assistance from this source.  For example, I have granted a total of £400,000 from the lottery to agencies working with the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Kerry Parents and Friends Association have received a grant of £100,000 as a contribution towards the development of services for the mentally handicapped in Killarney.  The Brothers of Charity in Galway also received a contribution of £100,000 to assist with the development of community based services in the Galway region.  In Kilkenny, the Kilkenny Association for the Mentally Handicapped received a grant of £36,000 to provide community based accommodation for young adults with severe mental handicap from St. Patrick's, Kilkenny while a further grant of £30,000 was made available to provide day space in St. Patrick's for people with multiple handicaps.  KARE, the County Kildare association of parents and friends of handicapped children have also received £70,000 to date from the lottery to develop services for mentally handicapped children in the Kildare region.</P>
    <P>In making the 1990 allocations for the mental handicap service, I will ensure that resource is available to permit of the commencement of a planned expansion of the services taking account of the changing nature of service requirements. I would like to emphasise my commitment to meeting the acknowledged needs of people with mental handicap and my determination to press ahead with <Col N="281" /> the planning and development of necessary services.</P>
    <P>The question of legislation to give specific rights to persons with mental handicap is being considered.  Deputy Yates referred to this matter.  I intend to engage in wide-ranging consultations with various organisations including the National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland on that issue.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with some of the issues raised about there having been no development in this area.  For example, the hostel provision in 1985 amounted to 127 and at the end of the year 1988 there were 210 hostels, nearly double, with the number of places increasing from 773 to 1,205 residents, and an increase of 83 hostels.  In 1985 there were 99 day care centres and workshops whereas, at the end of 1988, there were 170 centres, representing an increase of 71 centres with provision for 2,352 attenders. Therefore the House will note that, despite the constraints, there have been some developments of which we can be justifiably proud.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to St. Michael's House creating five places only.  I should point out that they created ten places in Ballymun alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The 850 persons annually reaching adulthood is another tribute to the development of our services and indeed to the development of the health services generally, illustrating that more and more of our mentally handicapped are living into adulthood.</P>
      <P>I take the point that we must be very sensitive with regard to the people who inform parents that their child is handicapped. Generally that is done in the hospitals.  Also, there are now nurses trained specifically in mental handicap working in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of medical cards, the cost of expensive medicines and so on for the mentally handicapped, I should say that the mentally handicapped are automatically entitled to long-term illness cards.  Probably the majority of them <Col N="282" /> would hold medical cards but those who do not are entitled to access all of their medicines free of charge.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, will be speaking in this debate tomorrow evening.  I am sure she will correct the Deputy on the matter of the reduction in the number of remedial teachers because she has stated many times in this House that those who are disadvantaged did not suffer any reduction in their number of remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Deputy on the amount of money available from the European Social Fund, that such money should be available for sheltered workshops in the same way as it is available for training workshops.  I should point out that that money was expended on sheltered workshops until 1983.  We were not in power in 1983 but, in that year, there was a change, following which money from the European Social Fund was provided only for training the handicapped and not for sheltered workshops. I agree with the Deputy that if money can be made available from that fund it should be for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan talked about there having been progress in the early eighties and none now.  He gave an example of the development of the late eighties, that being the St. John of God's facility in Tralee.  I will have examined the question of whether there should be a lift installed in the school in Listowel.  It should be remembered that the mentally handicapped are not physically handicapped and are well able to use stairs.  Indeed, we might well add to their handicap were we to encourage them to use lifts rather than stairs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the calibre of the organisations of parents and others devoted to the interests of people with mental handicap is such as to ensure that none of us is allowed to forget or overlook the need for continued attention to this important area of service provision.  I say to them it would be my wish to work with them and co-operate fully toward the objective of improving the quality of care of handicapped persons.</P>

      <P>I also give the House notice that I propose to make the following amendment No. 2 to the motion in the names of members of the Labour Party which I now read into the record:</P>
      <P>To add to the Motion:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann endorses the United Nations Convention on the Rights of persons with a mental handicap; and calls for legislation to enshrine those rights.  Dáil Éireann notes with alarm that:</P>
      <P>&mdash;According to the most reliable estimates, 328 residential places are required for persons with a mental handicap in the Eastern Health Board area alone, and they are needed immediately, with a further 567 places needed in the years after 1990;</P>
      <P>&mdash;At least 1,000 residential places are needed in the country as a whole;</P>
      <P>&mdash;The special national schools for persons with a mental handicap are under-staffed and under-funded;</P>
      <P>&mdash;There is an acute shortage of training places available for persons leaving special national schools, with the consequence that many are on waiting lists, and others have to travel long distances for training;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Many of the support services, such as breakaway services and crisis <Col N="284" /></P>
    <P>intervention, are in danger of collapse for lack of adequate funding;</P>
    <P>&mdash;There are fewer and fewer employment opportunities for persons with a mental handicap, either in open or in sheltered employment. </P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann further notes that neither the Estimates for 1990 nor the Public Capital Programme contain any additional allocation for new services or facilities for persons with a mental handicap, and that an immediate substantial allocation of resources is required in terms of both capital and current expenditure.  In deploring the lack of Government planning and provision in this area, Dáil Éireann considers that the parents and families of persons with a mental handicap have the right to be involved and represented in all planning for the future. </P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be vigorously endorsing and supporting the Fine Gael Private Members' motion this week on the subject of mental handicap.  I commend Deputy Yates and the Fine Gael Party on having identified this subject as one of tremendous importance and on having identified this time as opportune for a full-scale debate in this House on this issue.</P>
    <P>Since we tabled a motion on this subject ourselves some two months ago a great deal of information has come to light about hardship in this area caused directly by Government policy.  That is why we have tabled such a comprehensive amendment to the Fine Gael motion, aimed at highlighting some specific aspects of what is now a growing crisis.  Hopefully, both the motion and the amendment I have read into the record will receive cross-party support.</P>
    <P>This Government, together with their immediate predecessors, are primarily responsible for the cutbacks which have affected this most vulnerable section of our community.  As we participate in this debate this evening the Minister and Members of this House will be aware that a meeting of the parents of people with mental handicap is taking place a short <Col N="285" /> distance away in the Mansion House. That meeting is motivated by a growing sense of anger among parents, anger that is caused by the way in which they and their children have been patronised and ignored, anger at the way in which the rights of people with a mental handicap have been trampled on in recent years. The conveners of that meeting have released a press statement.  The organisation is called the Parents' Association for People with a Mental Handicap and their press statement adequately sums up the case I wish to make.  I look forward to reading the contents of that press statement into the record tomorrow night.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, Minister O'Kennedy is unable to be with us today.  In his unavoidable absence the privilege rests with me of introducing this very significant Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The net amount to be voted is a sum of £26,110,000.  This consists of an additional sum of £21,830,000 for various subheads of expenditure, plus a deficiency of £18,445,000 in appropriations in aid, less savings on a number of expenditure subheads totalling £14,165,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> I propose to follow the traditional approach by speaking on the main subheads, that is on those subheads in excess of £1,000,000 where additional expenditure or deficiencies in receipts or expenditures savings arise.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side I will begin with subhead B.4 where I am happy to be able to provide an additional £8 million for Teagasc this year.</P>
    <P>The Government's main objective in setting up Teagasc was to ensure better co-ordination and cost effectiveness in the operation of the agricultural advisory, training and research services.  The legislation places a special emphasis on the training of young farmers and on food research, matters to which this Government attach great importance.</P>
    <P>On the one hand our young farmers need to be at least as well trained as their international competitors and on the other hand the raw materials they produce should be processed to the maximum extent possible to provide maximum returns.</P>
    <P>In combining the considerable resources of the former An Foras Talúntais and ACOT under a high calibre authority and a strong unified management, the Government's objective was to deliver the agricultural research, training and advisory services in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.  I am heartened by the manner in which Teagasc have set about reorganising and restructuring the services and much has been achieved in their first year of operation. They are now well on the way to becoming a streamlined organisation with greater commercial orientation, capable of meeting the current and future needs of the agriculture and food sectors. In this way, Teagasc can greatly assist our major industry in responding to the challenges of the nineties.</P>
    <P>In order to undertake the various activities, it is essential that the finances of Teagasc should be put on a sound footing.  This £8 million will ensure that Teagasc end the year with a clean slate and can plan for a balanced budget in future years.</P>
    <P>I turn now to subhead C2 &mdash; bovine <Col N="287" /> tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication &mdash; where I am providing an additional £4 million to cover increased expenditure by ERAD.  Deputies will be well aware of the determined way in which ERAD are tackling the problem of disease eradication. By bringing together all interested parties to accelerate the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis, ERAD are proving to be a successful initiative that has resulted in a dynamic coherent and forward-looking approach to the eradication of the diseases.  In the course of 1989, the board of ERAD formulated a comprehensive strategy for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis, the primary thrust of which was to increase the reactor extraction rate, with particular emphasis on those sources acting as persistent reservoirs of disease in the national herd.  Intensive testing for TB has resulted in the identification of in excess of 37,500 reactors in almost 10.7 million tests to date, an outcome fully in accordance with the target of the eradication drive for the year.  With regard to brucellosis, a full monitor of the national herd has been undertaken to guarantee the continued officially brucellosis free status of the national herd.  Brucellosis testing comprises approximately 2.1 million individual blood tests on eligible animals in addition to bulk milk ring testing of all dairying herds at six week intervals during the year.  Earlier this year, agreement was reached with the farming organisations that an additional £8 million, to be funded jointly by Exchequer contributions and increased levies, would be provided for the years 1989 and 1990 to cover increases in grants paid under the eradication schemes.  Of the additional £4 million required for 1989, £3.106 million will be provided through savings from the 1988 allocation.  I have recently made an order under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979 increasing the rates of levy payable.</P>
    <P>There is a link between this subhead C2 and a particular Appropriations-in-Aid Subhead M8 &mdash; receipts from farmer contributions towards the cost of eradicating bovine disease &mdash; where, due to <Col N="288" /> an 11 per cent reduction in the numbers of cattle slaughterings at meat export premises, the levy receipts will not reach the estimated amount of £22 million.  It is expected that a shortfall of £900,000 will result.  The estimated levy receipts are now £21.1 million.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead L1 &mdash; farm, improvement programme, farm modernisation scheme and western measures &mdash; there is an additional rquirement of £8 million for various schemes aimed at encouraging on-farm investment as well as such measures as the young farmers' installation premium.</P>
    <P>This year the demand for grants under these schemes has exceeded the budgetary allocation and the additional amount is required to meet the additional claims that are likely to mature between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This high level of demand is encouraging. It is an indication that farmers are investing heavily in improving the efficiency of their enterprises.  They are thus expressing their confidence in the future of the industry.  This investment also has important spinoff effects locally. The demand it generates for materials and services creates valuable employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that much of this investment relates to measures to control farmyard pollution.  This is in response to the very attractive grants which were introduced for this purpose in the past two years.  Last year we succeeded in getting the EC to approve a scheme providing for grants of up to 55 per cent for animal housing, fodder storage and waste disposal facilities in the disadvantaged areas.  Seventy per cent of the cost is funded by the EC.  This year I got this scheme extended to the whole country.</P>
    <P>The protection of the environment is vital, not alone for aesthetic reasons but from the point of view of the national economy as well.  The image of a clean unspoilt environment is a major factor in boosting our tourist industry.  It also helps to sell our agricultural products abroad. It is important therefore that it is not damaged.  I think that the majority of farmers are realising their responsibilities <Col N="289" /> in this respect and are taking the necessary precautions.  With the level of grant aid now available there is no excuse for any farmer not undertaking the investment required to ensure that his farming activities are environmentally friendly.</P>
    <P>There is a link between this subhead and a particular Appropriations-in-Aid subhead, M18 where there are additional EC receipts of £9,580,000.  These receipts were originally estimated at £9,980,000 but are now expected to amount to £19,560,000.  The improved receipts are due to a supplementary sum of £8 million which was approved in the Supplementary Estimate 1988 and which was spent last year, together with the maximisation of EC advance payments this year.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other expenditure subheads in the structural area &mdash; L10 and L11 &mdash; where, although the extra amounts involved are less than £1 million, it would be appropriate to give some explanations.</P>
    <P>An additional £180,000 is required on the original Estimate of £400,000 under subhead L10 for the operation of the pilot programme for integrated rural development. Expenditure covers the cost of the salaries of the 12 co-ordinators who were appointed to the 12 pilot areas throughout the country, their office and administration expenses, the costs of engaging training and design consultants, conducting workshops and of providing a limited amount of funding for feasibility studies on projects which are emerging. The EC Commission recently agreed to increase its contribution to the cost of the programme to 75 per cent.  The programme is advancing according to plan and the results to date are quite encouraging. It represents a very important stage in devising a national programme for the development of all rural areas.</P>
    <P>In so far as subhead L 11 &mdash; set aside of land &mdash; is concerned it is mandatory on member states to implement the Community's scheme for the set-aside of agricultural land.  The estimate for this item was prepared at a time when the EC Commission had not decided on the full details of how the measure <Col N="290" /> would operate so that a token provision had to be made.  An additional amount of £163,000 is now required to meet payments to participants in the scheme this year.</P>
    <P>As regards the deficiencies in Appropriations-in-aid, the main deficiency arises under subhead M22 &mdash; receipts from the EC in respect of market intervention expenses.  The Department of Agriculture and Food are the designated EC intervention agency for Ireland and, as such, purchase such products as beef, dairy products and cereals in order to support producer prices.  The capital involved to make these purchases is borrowed by the Department.  The Department also arrange for the necessary handling, transport and storage of these commodities.  In turn, the EC makes payments to the Department in respect of all these operations at rates which are standard for all member states.</P>
    <P>The drop of £15 million, from £61,625,000 to £46,625,000, is due primarily to lower stock levels than were originally anticipated.  This in turn resulted in reduced EC receipts.  The other two subheads where deficiencies arise are subheads M25 and M28.  Subhead M25 provides for receipts from the United Kingdom Government in respect of the special premium on exports of beef to the United Kingdom.  The scheme concerned was terminated on 2 April and as a result receipts will be £13.75 million below the amount originally provided for in the Vote.  As indicated in the Supplementary Estimate there will be corresponding savings of £13.75 million in expenditure under Subhead L.7 and so the overall effect on the Vote will be neutral.  The abolition of the scheme was part of the reform of the EC beef regime and coincided with an increase in the level of the suckler cow premium from £37 per head to some £52 per head.  The suckler premium is paid directly to producers in all areas and, in my view, the increase will encourage expansion in the national breeding herd.  A year ago we saw the first increase in the breeding herd since the introduction of the milk quota regime in 1984.  This trend was confirmed by the June livestock enumeration, which <Col N="291" /> showed an increase of some 64,000 head compared with June 1988.  The increase occurred despite some decline in dairy cow numbers and I look forward to seeing an increased supply of calves coming on-stream in the run-up to 1992.</P>
    <P>Receipts from meat inspection fees collected by my Department are credited to subhead M28.  Receipts in 1989 are expected to be £1.1 million below the amount provided in the original Estimate. This reflects the reduced level of cattle slaughterings for much of the year and the fact that some provisions of an EC directive on meat inspection fees will now be implemented next year.  I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to respond by saying that I am delighted to see that £26 million is being provided in this Estimate.  I will have some fairly hard words to say as to why part of this money has not been paid already nevertheless I welcome the Estimate.  There was an under-provision of about half that amount for payment to farmers for works undertaken to farm buildings under the control of pollution programme and so on.  The question must be asked as to why, in this age of technology, farmers cannot be paid on time for the work they do.  I am getting a little tired of hearing about all the planning that goes on in the Department &mdash; I have also seen it for myself in my day.  When a farmer in any part of Ireland decides to undertake a particular project, his understanding is that as soon as the payment has been approved he will be paid for it promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will argue that many people are paid promptly but I could give him a list the length of my hand of people who, through no fault of their own, are unable to get the grants.  There is a lot of talk about planning for 1992 and that is important in its own way but surely it should not be beyond the ingenuity of people in Agriculture House to send out grants to people who have committed themselves financially.  As an aside, I <Col N="292" /> cannot understand why, when a commitment was given to every sheep farmer a couple of months ago that they would get the first instalment of the ewe premium before Christmas, the payment has not been made.  I have been reliably informed that the vast majority of farmers will not receive this money until January or February.  I know that, with computerisation, a lot has been done in the Department over the years but, as Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture, I get complaints from all over the country about these matters.  Not a week goes by but I get four or five letters from outside my constituency.  I know that the Minister and the officials in the Department always do the best they can but all I am asking is that if a person is entitled to a grant and the grant has been approved and authorised for payment, it should be paid promptly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the £4 million provision for disease eradication which I will come back to.  I know of at least six people in east Galway whose herds have been locked up and they have been waiting five months for their money.  It was not the understanding of ERAD when they were set up that that should happen. I brought this matter to the notice of ERAD but I was told that there was not enough staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food to physically get the cheques out.  Now we find that there has been a shortage of money in the last month or two.  There is a Minister and two junior Ministers in Agriculture House and I wonder if any of them are taking particular note of what I am talking about.  This matter is very important. I do not want to labour the point but it is not right that there should be a delay in payment to a person whose herd has been locked up for four or five months and who has no way of making a living. It is highly unfair that that should happen to even one in every 100.  This is one of the reasons I was delighted to see the allocation of £26 million.  I would not want to stop this Estimate going through because I want the money to go to the people who have been waiting for it for a long time.  I do not know of people in <Col N="293" /> any other walk of life who would actually wait five or six months for money which is rightfully theirs.  What man would sell property and wait six months to be paid? I do not think this is good enough.  It might be the aspiration of everybody in Agriculture House to get this money out to the people who rightfully own it, but it is not being given out.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the disease levies. I want to again put on the record my objection to the method by which the last Estimate was brought before us a few weeks ago.  The Minister said an additional £4 million is being made available for the bovine TB/brucellosis eradication scheme.  We welcome that provision but it should be said that far more money is coming from the agricultural community. When this Estimate was going through the House we gave the nod to the sums of £6.90 per animal killed or exported and £1.20 per gallon of milk supplied. We agreed with those charges on the day, but I had not left this House two hours when I was informed that the board of ERAD had decided to cut the payment for certain types of reactor cattle.  If we had known this was going to happen we would certainly have had a different debate on that occasion.  The Minister must have known this was going to happen.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food a straight question during Question Time last Thursday.  I asked if a complete round of brucellosis testing would take place in 1990 and the cost involved.  I did not get an answer.  I found out that there would be a round of brucellosis testing but I did not find out the cost.  I was told it was tied up in the £35 million for the entire eradication scheme but I already knew that.  I want to tell the House why I was not told the cost involved.  I was not told because the subhead for brucellosis testing is likely to be paid for by the actual reduction in the price for reactor cattle.  I want to say loud and clear that I do not like that type of accounting.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of what ERAD are doing, everyone is at one with them in hoping they will get to grips with the problem of <Col N="294" /> animal disease.  I have had a remarkable feedback from farmers all over the country who genuinely believe that, not alone under this Government but under every other Government they were never paid the true value for their reactor cattle.  Basically what happened is that there has been a fairly biggish cut in the price of reactor cattle because cattle reached a certain price in the last couple of months.  If this ever happens again, all relevant information should be put on the floor of the Dáil where it can be discussed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Teagasc.  There is no shortage of comments one could make about the farm advisory body.  I welcome the Government decision to allocate them an additional £8 million, but no thanks is due to them for this because they took out far more than that during the past couple of years &mdash; that organisation had to deal with a reduction in their allocation of 44 per cent.  Their role bears no resemblance to what I understood the role of a farm advisory body should be.  I will refer to this point in a moment.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that their accumulated debts over the past two years have been crossed out tonight because of the £8 million being pumped in by the Government.  As I said, I welcome this allocation because if they did not receive it they would have to close their doors altogether.  However, when we look ahead to 1990 the first thing they will have to contend with is a 2 per cent reduction in their estimate.  One might say that a 2 per cent cut is not bad, but taken with the earlier 44 per cent cut we can see how the &ldquo;surgery&rdquo; is trickling down the line.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £27 million being made available in the Estimates, Teagasc will not have this sum for operational activities in 1990.  A sum of £5.5 million will have to be provided from the £27 million for their pension fund.  I want to make a very important point in this regard.  Because of the age profile of many of the research staff in Teagasc and the people who left in the past year or two, the actual pension provision of £5.5 <Col N="295" /> million for 1990 &mdash; this means that £21.5 million of the £27 million will be available for Teagasc to carry out their work &mdash; will be £6 million in 1991, and will increase each year.  It is very important that people who retire or become redundant get what they are entitled.  All of us here, and many other thousands of people will be paid our pensions by the Paymaster General's Office, and there is an onus on the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance to provide for Teagasc in the Estimate. Basically what they are doing is making farmers pay directly for their pensions. This means that Teagasc will not be able to carry out their functions because they have to make provision for their pension fund.</P>
    <P>There is more bad news which is not spelt out in this Estimate.  There was an overrun of £4.5 million by Teagasc in carrying out their activities in 1989.  I am not privy to whether they will have a neutral budget in 1990 but if they have to trim their activities by another £4.5 million to keep within their budget, it could mean that another research farm will have to be sold or that some of their area offices will have to be closed.  This Estimate is far less satisfying than one would believe from the way the Minister introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>That is a pity because I had a lot more to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to farmer training, I believe there is a huge bias against every boy and girl in rural Ireland who wants to get agricultural training in FÁS or any other training school.  Quite rightly, these students are paid in a certain way but it is scandalous that that does not extend to farmers' sons and daughters who are being trained.  I know that this year Teagasc looked for £9 million from the EC Social Fund and got £5.6 million and <Col N="296" /> £4.5 million last year.  This is an indication that they are not going anywhere this year either.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to integrated rural development, a subject which warrants a great deal of comment. I hope that in the next four weeks Teagasc will be allowed play a leading role in the rural development section.  Their advisers are almost trained and I wonder why it is considered necessary to recruit people and train them when we have the expertise available.</P>
    <P>I accept that rural development is a slow way for farmers to get extra income into their pockets, but a start must be made.  This was a bad week for farmers so far as headage payments and so on were concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to allow Teagasc play a greater role in the integrated rural development set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by wishing the Minister who cannot be with us this evening a speedy recovery to full health.  I am sure he will be back with us shortly.  I should like to take the opportunity to restate Labour Party policy on the agricultural industry. We recognise agriculture as the greatest natural resource available to the Irish people and their greatest single source of wealth.  The details of how we see that and how agriculture might be developed are contained in the Labour Party agricultural policy document.  I recommend that the Minister, and other Members who are interested in agriculture, should read that document.  Our objective is to develop that natural resource to achieve a number of aims.  We want to maximise the number of people and families engaged in agricultural activities.  That would mean the protection of the small and family farm units from the cheque book speculators.  There is no movement, as far as I can detect, from the Minister in his statement in that regard.  Our objective would also ensure that policies are put in place on quotas in the interest of the small holder, on prices in the interest of the small holder and on markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I am acutely conscious of the flaw in the system of quotas whereby the co-ops are subject to impossible pressures.  I shall deal with that issue at a later stage. The second objective of the Labour Party is to maximise production.  Again, we see the use of the small unit as desirable in that regard.  There are facts and figures available to show that the maximum production per acre is available on units between 70 and 80 acres and that above that level production per acre decreases. Support for small units is called for but there is no evidence of Government action on them.</P>
    <P>We believe that those policies and objectives would lead to the creation of additional wealth.  The primary producers, farmers and their families, would gain from that.  The wealth created should be for the benefit of all and should lead to the creation of jobs in the spinoff industries that would materialise.  We have put forward a suggestion that there should be a fair system of taxation from the additional wealth created.  We have argued in support of the position of the Irish Creameries Milk Suppliers' Association on a land tax or a product tax and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have taken a position in favour of land tax combined with other tax systems.  I can see a merging of opinions in the farming and non-farming areas on the vexed question of taxation of farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to protect the small farm units and policies which they support, such as CAP, benefit not the small farmer as was the original intention but the ranchers.  That has led to thousands of small farmers being forced off the land, and will if continued &mdash; present policies seem to indicate that they will continue &mdash; lead to thousands more leaving the land.  I have experience of the countryside being denuded as a result of those policies.  People are being replaced by fat cattle who roam up to their bellies in grass producing beef that nobody wants which we store at huge cost in intervention stores.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is possible for producers to sell into intervention at high prices, for the same people to subsequently buy out <Col N="298" /> of intervention at cheaper prices and for the same people to subsequently sell that meat on the market at high prices.  I put that question because I did not receive a reply to it when I put it to the Minister during Question Time recently.  If the Minister does not have the answers to the questions the Fine Gael spokesman and I put to him, he should carry out a further investigation.  There is a need to examine that matter because there is a danger of some excesses.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in the area of processing.  They hung their case on what I would describe as the Goodman-Government sweetheart deal but that is in a shambles and we have not heard of anything to replace it.  That is widely recognised and it appears that there is no possibility of that deal being implemented.  Tuam has been officially abandoned by that organisation despite the many promises made by the Government.</P>
    <P>We believe in maximising the number of people in agriculture.  The maximising of production does not exclude the protection of the environment or the protection of the consumer.  The Government have failed in both areas. As far as the protection of the environment is concerned, we are aware that many Irish rivers are dead of all forms of fish life.  That has occurred because we do not have any effective legislation or meaningful policies to deal with pollution despite the many promises made by the Government and the near threat to finalise legislation.  We have the crazy position that a household housing human beings is required to obtain planning permission to erect a small separate tank unit while a person anxious to erect a unit to house 10,000 pigs does not require planning permission.  He can set up such a unit at will and is not subject to any controls.  That is highly undesirable as far as planning is concerned.  It is time that was put right.</P>
    <P>As far as the protection of the consumer is concerned we have the ongoing row on the airwaves between the vets, who say that huge amounts of hormones are being used illegally, the farmers' <Col N="299" /> wives agreeing with them on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and other programmes, and the IFA disagreeing strongly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know the answer because he does not have an effective inspectorate to get it for him. The reason there are contradictions is that the Minister has failed to provide an effective inspectorate to investigate the use of hormones and other additives such as tenderisers, and the use of them.  I should like to refer to a booklet published recently by the CII about additives and food additives.  It is scandalous that the Minister for Health wrote a welcoming foreword to that booklet because it unscientifically, and incorrectly, stated that any additives with &ldquo;E&rdquo; numbers were implicity safe.  It is worth noting that 25 per cent of the &ldquo;E&rdquo; numbers allowed here are banned in the USA and other EC countries.  I wonder why the Minister for Health added his name to a booklet that stated that &ldquo;E&rdquo; numbers were implicitly safe.  That is not correct but it is an indication of the inaction of the Government in this regard.</P>
      <P>Arising from the misinformation and lack of information in regard to this we have reached the stage that if we cook a steak we are talking about a cocktail of unknown, unchecked and illegal drugs. That is serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the Government's failure to initiate debate and discussion in regard to agriculture, and because of the lack of an effective agricultural policy, that the Labour Party tabled a motion on today's Order Paper requesting the Government to establish an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture.  We are suggesting that that joint committee should be made up of 20 TDs and Senators, that they should have wide ranging powers to discuss and debate all issues within the agricultural and food sectors, would provide the widest possible participation and political accountability over developments in this sector <Col N="300" /> at both national and European level and would eliminate panic measures such as this Estimate.  The national planning board, the National Economic and Social Council, have criticised the lack of a coherent national policy on agriculture. They have specifically pointed to the lack of policy on land use, education, investment, industrial development and farm incomes.  The Oireachtas committee on agriculture would begin with these policy areas which have for so long been neglected.</P>
    <P>Land structure is another area where seemingly there is no movement on the part of the Government, except their stated position that they will abolish the Land Commission.  This should be a matter of serious concern for all those who have an interest in agriculture.  The reason behind the proposal to abolish the Land Commission is political interference, jobbery and something close to corruption in the allocation of land.  Possibly, the Land Commission needed to be reformed but certainly it did not require abolition.  We believe the handing over of the allocation of land to the cheque book invasion is not in the interests of farming and will lead to non-nationals moving in with their cheque books to buy up land.  This is not in the interests of farming and I do not see how under that proposal, which is what is being suggested, small farmers can increase their land size or how landless persons who are qualified can compete to get into agriculture. Again, the Labour Party are tabling a motion in this regard and will be seeking all party support for it.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not announce the provision of £26 million earlier.  If he did so it would have allowed for planning in the agricultural area, in particular by Teagasc.  We are aware of the crisis in the education, advisory and research area and I believe if Teagasc's very capable chairman did not put a gun to the heads of the Government he would not have got this £68 million.  We told the Minister at the time he made the original provision that it was inadequate.  Effectively what he is doing now is responding to very severe pressure and I am pleased <Col N="301" /> that it has proved successful.  However, it is not sufficient.  Basically, what we are dealing with is a panic measure from the Government to prevent a collapse.  As long as there is no structure and no policy &mdash; there is no evidence of either &mdash; in relation to the primary industry in this country we are really pouring money into a black hole.</P>
    <P>My final point is that when we pay farmers to leave land idle and fallow there is something radically wrong and we are doing this at a time when we are making provision for the reclamation, drainage and the bringing into use of other land. This year we are paying out £165,000 to farmers to leave their land idle.  This may be the thin edge of the wedge.  We must have gone mad somewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the remarks of other Deputies in wishing the Minister a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>One of the principal elements in this Supplementary Estimate is the allocation of an additional £8 million to Teagasc. While this is likely to bring some relief to the staff of Teagasc it is not going to be enough to deal with the major crisis now facing that organisation.  While it will go some way towards clearing that organisation's accumulated deficit it will still not be enough to provide the level of service agriculture needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional money provided in this Supplementary Estimate has to be viewed against the background already outlined by Deputy Connaughton, including a 7 per cent cut in its allocation in the recently published Book of Estimates for 1990.  At a time when it should be expanding and developing its services Teagasc will still enter 1990 with a deficit of some £2 million.  This will almost inevitably mean yet more cutbacks. When An Foras Talúntais and ACOT were merged to form Teagasc in 1988 it was hoped that the new organisation would form a new and dynamic force in agriculture and contribute to the sort of development needed at a time when the days of the CAP were clearly numbered and when there was a need for farmers <Col N="302" /> to adapt and diversify.  We warned at the time the Bill was going through the Dáil that unless it was provided with adequate staff and resources the new organisation would make little impact.  Unfortunately, not only was Teagasc not provided with additional resources, it was subjected to particularly vicious cutbacks as part of the Government's policy of cutbacks at any cost.  It has suffered especially from the Government's ill-considered voluntary redundancy programme.  Indeed it has been so stripped of staff that its capacity to do its job must be in grave doubt.</P>
    <P>Since October 1987, for example, its staff has been cut from 2,300 to just over 1,500.  One of the results of this is that in areas like Louth, Cavan-Monaghan, Dublin and Tipperary there are not enough staff to service contracts entered into with farmers.  Farmers in these areas have paid money but they are not getting a service.  As in many other areas of the public service the staff cuts have cost money rather than saved it.  In Limerick, for instance, I understand there are no clerical staff to even look after wages and salaries and a person has to be brought from Ennis on each pay day to make the payments.</P>
    <P>I also understand that little real progress has been made in integrating the two old organisations, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, that they still tend to operate as fairly distinct and separate units.  This has contributed to a high level of demoralisation among staff.  Another factor which has contributed to undermining staff morale is the recent remark of the Chairman of Teagasc when he compared the organisation's employees to cattle.  He did not even have the decency to apologise to his staff when their unions protested at his remark.  Mr. Rae's own knowledge and ability to manage cattle is beyond dispute, however it is this kind of comment which calls into serious question his capacity to manage people and, especially, to be chairman of an organisation like Teagasc whose success largely depends on the commitment and education of the workforce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> I note there is a small additional provision of £51,000 for testing of hormones in meat.  This weekend the comments of the President of the Irish Veterinary Union, Mr. George Lane, in which he claimed up to 50 per cent of our meat exports were contaminated by illegal hormones, have highlighted once again this appalling and irresponsible practice.  Mr. Lane's comments were quite frightening. Even if they are only partially true the implications for our meat exports are appalling as they are for the 4,000 workers in that industry.  It has been accepted by all sides that the illegal use of hormones is going on.  What is at issue is the extent of their use.  There is an inexplicable conflict between the statement of Mr. Lane and the position of the Department of Agriculture and Food who, so far as I know, said in a statement today that less than half of one per cent of samples are found to be contaminated.</P>
    <P>I do not think one can dismiss Mr. Lane's comments entirely as I understand his organisation represent a good number of the veterinary surgeons employed in the meat plants to carry out these tests. There is, therefore, a clear need to establish beyond any doubt the extent of the illegal use of hormones and growth promoters. Nothing is to be gained by attempting to sweep this problem under the carpet.  That is potentially a disastrous approach.  One way of tackling the problem is to significantly increase the number of random samples taken by the Department. Another way might be to seek independent scientific sampling.</P>
    <P>I find it appalling that a small minority of farmers and meat plant operators should be so desperate to make even bigger profits that they are prepared to use illegal hormones despite the enormous damage this could do to the industry but it is going on.  For example, the Minister told my colleague, Deputy McCartan, in the Dáil on 26 October that the illegal use of hormones had been detected on 98 occasions within the past 12 months but many people outside this House believe that that is only the tip of the iceberg.  In December 1987, for <Col N="304" /> example, 400 animals showing <i>prima facie</i> evidence of illegal hormone implants were detected in the feed lot in one well known plant in County Kildare. According to a recent Dáil reply prosecutions have been taken against 39 people over the past two years.  The fines imposed are generally small and they are an inadequate deterrent.</P>
    <P>Those engaged in this practice stand to make huge amounts of money.  There have been strong rumours about the involvement of the Provisional IRA in this and the penalties must be made more severe.  The level of penalties available to the courts in these cases must be reviewed and strengthened.  Farmers and all involved in the meat trade must realise that anyone involved in this activity threatens the welfare of the farming community and those working in the meat industry.  The whole attraction of Irish food products abroad especially throughout the rest of Europe is their clean and healthy image.  All it would take is one major scandal to cause possible irreparable damage to the meat trade.  That is not to take at face value the charges made over the last weekend.  There are sufficient bases, from people who work in the industry, to believe that the truth lies somewhere between what seems to be the drastic under-estimate of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the rather wild assertions made at the weekend.</P>
    <P>A related area is the repeated allegations of widespread fraud in the meat trade.  The Minister confirmed in the Dáil in reply to Deputy Sherlock on 26 October that four of the seven major firms involved in the aids to private storage scheme had been in breach of regulations, but the Minister has consistently refused to publish the report of the investigation.  The Minister is clearly determined to withhold information and his reply on October 26 left many questions unanswered.  The Minister's refusal to name the firms involved in the irregularities is most unfair to firms which have been honest and have complied with all the regulations.  The Dáil and the public have the right to know the full details of <Col N="305" /> this affair and the extent of the irregularities involved.  The Minister's reply confirmed that the concern expressed by The Workers' Party and other public representatives about illegal practices in the meat industry were well founded.  It reinforced the case for a sworn public inquiry into all aspects of the meat industry to establish beyond doubt the extent of the illegal practices, to identify those responsible for activities which would cost the taxpayer millions of pounds, and to make recommendations to ensure that such irregularities are not repeated.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the provision in this Supplementary Estimate for disease eradication and specifically to the provision of £4 million for bovine TB and brucellosis eradication.  I support this additional requirement but I would remind the House of the words of Dr. T. K. Whitaker when he said recently that the money spent to date in disease eradication was the greatest financial scandal in the history of the State.  The amount of money spent was in excess of £1 billion. Indeed, 25 years ago in this House, the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, announced that the country was virtually free of TB.  We are now no closer to being able to substantiate that claim.  We have a lot to answer for now when we are correctly questioning the spending of every pound of taxpayers' money.  We should question the fact that that amount of money could have been spent and that we are still in the circumstances we are in today.</P>
    <P>Earlier, in relation to the use of hormone growth promoters I commented on the role of the veterinary surgeons and on their right to ventilate that problem publicly.  In respect of the bovine disease eradication programme a majority of veterinary surgeons have a lot to answer for.  The earnings of veterinary surgeons down through the years in this area have been extraordinary in that about one-third of the money spent goes directly for veterinary fees.  In a parliamentary question information was elicited that earnings totalled £10.6 million in 1983, £8.3 million in 1984, £11.5 million in 1985, £11 million in 1986, £12 million in <Col N="306" /> 1987 and so on.  The veterinary surgeons have used their muscle to resist measures that could have contributed to a solution of the problem.  I cannot understand why for instance, if a human being goes to a hospital to give a blood sample, the sample is usually taken by a nurse rather than a doctor but technicians are not used for taking samples from animals.  There is resistance from the veterinary lobby, but it is about time, in the interests of spending prudently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I regret that when the Bill establishing Teagasc was going through the House that procedures that could be carried out by qualified technicians were not included in the Bill because of the veterinary lobby and because of their manifest formative influence in the legislation that was eventually enacted.  It is one of the scandals involving misuse of public money and it is about time some Government faced up to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to support the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I am disappointed that the Minister cannot be with us and I join with other speakers in wishing him a speedy recovery.  It is an opportune time to say that he has been doing an exceptionally good job as Minister on behalf of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State who is with us tonight the dispute at the Department's veterinary office in Portlaoise where there is now an all-out picket.  The dispute is having serious repercussions for farmers who are unable to get private tests done or to get certificates to enable them to sell their livestock.  The Minister of State should take immediate steps to have this dispute resolved as it is causing serious inconvenience to farmers in County Laois.  Certainly, the staff who <Col N="307" /> are on strike have no desire to walk the streets in Portlaoise at this time.  This matter is relevant to the Estimate because we are making provision in the Estimate for disease eradication and so on.  I do not have to remind the Minister that without administrative difficulties the livestock industry is already in crisis, with farmers having to dispose of livestock at margins which are minimal or in many cases non-existent.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before the House is significant to the future development of agriculture.  We all welcome the increased provision for Teagasc.  It is important that we recognise the work this body has been doing in promoting the development of agriculture.  There is no doubt that significant development has taken place in the performance of our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>Having disbanded the old county committees of agriculture and having observed the performance of Teagasc in the meantime, I feel there is now a need to re-establish some form of committee or structure at local or regional level to bridge the gap between the statutory authority and the farmers.  As one who served on the old county committee of agriculture I realise the valuable contribution it made, particularly in agricultural development and educational programmes.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the prices in the livestock industry.  It is hardly necessary to remind the House that in talking about the livestock industry we are not talking specifically about farmers and farm incomes but the overall contribution of the industry to our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with particular reference to the potential of an expanding food industry for job creation.  This Government, more than any other in the history of the State, has attached considerable relevance to the importance of examining every aspect of economic development for the purpose of creating jobs.</P>
    <P>As is the case in almost every area of economic development where targets have been achieved, we have seen the <Col N="308" /> achievement of those targets.  In almost every area where these targets have been achieved there has been a partnership and a high level of co-operation between all of the agencies involved, including the Government and other structures.  In the meat industry, the food industry there is a need for partnership.</P>
    <P>The Minister has his job to do.  He must continue to maximise the opportunity for expansion and development within the framework of European marketing.  It is essential to find and expand new markets. We cannot afford to lose out in the international markets which have been available to us in the past and which, hopefully, will be available again in the future.</P>
    <P>In any reference to marketing one must acknowledge the contribution of CBF which has made a significant contribution to developing our international meat trade.  We must ensure that it gets the necessary resources to continue that work in the future.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for responsible comment, even in this House, concerning the various aspects of beef production and marketing.  While no one wishes to interfere with the concept of free speech, nevertheless some of the comments made in relation to some aspects of marketing and the development of the beef trade here were not helpful and certainly did nothing to assist the development of the meat industry.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to the need for private investment in the economy. Yet when an Irish entrepreneur is prepared to invest millions in the development of a modern meat processing industry he and his proposals come under attack for reasons which are not in the national interest.  We have spent millions of pounds trying to attract that size of investment to our country. Yet a successful Irish entrepreneur who is willing to invest in his own country is made the target of suspicion in relation to his operations.  That is regrettable at a time when we are examining every possible means of developing and expanding <Col N="309" /> not only agriculture but all of the associated industries and the agricultural service industry for the purpose of job creation.</P>
    <P>One must express concern at the failure of the beef industry in the area of marketing.  Far too often they have resorted to the soft option of seeking refuge in the marketing safety valves of intervention and aids to private storage. In my view they are not entitled, except perhaps as a last resort, to adopt that form of escapism in relation to their failure to go out and research and develop international markets.  There is a urgent need for all the agencies involved to come together to work out a more effective production and marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with any Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food one must comment on the investment to date in disease eradication.  I want to express my concern at our failure to deal successfully with that problem.  It is nothing short of alarming to find an increasing incidence of TB and brucellosis in herds that have been free since the scheme was first introduced and also to find that herds, some of which were closed herds and which would be regarded as the safest herds from the point of view of the incidence of disease, are experiencing a serious breakdown in their health status.  What is wrong in Ireland?  Other countries have successfully eliminated disease at a fraction of what it is costing us here.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and this Government towards making adequate funding available to combat the serious evil which is a threat to the industry and our economy.  Yet for some unknown reason in herds which are enclosed, where there is no obvious reason that they should be contaminated by either TB or brucellosis, we are finding a breakdown in the health status of these herds.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State the serious situation existing in the cereal industry where profit margins are at an all time low. Unless some order is brought into cereal <Col N="310" /> production and marketing we will not have a cereal industry in the foreseeable future.  If a quota system is necessary to safeguard sectors like milk and sugar beet, we cannot go on indefinitely ignoring the need for similar safeguards for other sectors where profit margins are diminishing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his efforts in the preparation of our submission for the extension of disadvantaged areas.  He set targets in relation to various stages of the survey which have been achieved and I look forward to an acceptance of these proposals when they are forwarded to Brussels. Again I urge the Minister and the Government to ensure that the maximum possible land area is submitted and approved.  While there might be some short term problems in funding, in the long term the benefits to the country will be significant in terms of increased viable farm units with a corresponding improvement in the overall urban-rural balance. This is a social consideration which must be taken into consideration in relation to any serious plans for the future development of Irish agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are witnessing an extraordinary situation in the House tonight.  It is amazing that in 1989 with modern technology and computer equipment in all the offices the Minister has missed his budgetary target by a massive £26 million.  This is outrageous and nothing short of a scandal. Not only is it in the dying weeks of this year; as early as last September it was obvious that there were not sufficient moneys provided to run the Department. We have been well aware from representations made to us that there was <Col N="311" /> a deliberate policy of dragging out the payment of grants, and I have no doubt at all that if it had not been for our front-bench spokesman, Deputy Paul Connaughton, and our backbench TDs raising the matter here in the House at every opportunity and seeking to have it raised as a matter of urgency on the Adjournment and by questions for written and oral reply the Minister would not have come in here to move this Supplementary Estimate tonight.  He had to be dragged in by the heels to do so.</P>
    <P>I challenge the adequacy of £26 million to meet the commitments of the Department up to 31 December this year.  I have no doubt that the policy of withholding grants will be continued up to and after 31 December, that they will be brought into next year's budget without clearing up the backlog of payments due.  This is outrageous on two fronts.  Farmers, both big and small but in particular small farmers, are being asked to carry the debts of this country on their backs and are being put in the embarrassing position of not being able to meet their ordinary, everyday commitments.  I have the greatest regard for the rural population and for small farmers in particular, people who have always paid their way.  They make a commitment and pay on the day, and they have made commitments.  They queued up in their hundreds to bring about improvements in their farms whether by way of measures to prevent pollution, improve housing needs for their stock or whatever, on the understanding that when the job was completed their grant would be paid.  They gave an undertaking to the man who contracted to carry out the work for them. The work was carried out in good faith, the undertakings were taken in good faith from the Department but these farmers were left in the embarrassing position of having to turn their heads when meeting their neighbours or their contractors or whoever supplied them with the materials to bring about the improvements. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Worse than all that, this Estimate here tonight will not solve the problem.  I was <Col N="312" /> told as recently as this morning by a senior official in the Department of Agriculture and Food that because of the acute shortage of staff it will not be possible to deal with the backlog until well into early next year, February or March, at the earliest.  That is not acceptable.  We support wholeheartedly the additional moneys being made available by way of this Supplementary Estimate but it should have been brought in last October. The Minister should have faced up to his responsibilities and admitted that, instead of a 12 month year, he had targeted for only an eight month year.</P>
    <P>Either extra staff must be drafted in immediately or the Minister must follow the line taken by other Departments when moneys are owing to them.  They charge interest on overdue accounts. That is how the Revenue Commissioners, for instance, operate.  If it is to be a case of paying interest, the Department should pay it from the date on which the grant was due to be paid.  That is only fair.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Why should these people have to carry this burden of debt?  It is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to go into great detail, but in relation to the whole range of policies, there were major shortcomings in budgeting.  I saw a headline in the &ldquo;Farming Independent&rdquo; section of the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week about something that is nothing new to me, as I have been quite well aware of it and have been stating it in the House since I came into it.  I refer to acute poverty that exists in small farms all over the country with 70 per cent of small farmers living on an income of less than £50 per week.  These are people with pride, honesty and decency, they are probably too decent to seek help from the Department of Social Welfare, not that it would be available for them, anyway.</P>
    <P>There are officials in the Department who will have to answer to somebody for their activities some day judging by the way some farmers are driven to seeking help, something that is totally against their nature.  They are being hounded and questioned about every little goose, duck <Col N="313" /> or chicken around the farm and what it is worth.  Inflated values are being put on cows that are not due to calve until spring. We saw the carry on of these officials last spring and what happened in the autumn when there was a total collapse in cattle prices.  Let them value the farm on the basis of the income from it the day they arrive.  It is irrelevant to talk of what its future income may be.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of an outrageous case of a widow and her son whose farm was wiped out by TB and who switched then to deer farming with the help of grants from the American Fund.  Within a short time an official from the Department of Social Welfare arrived &mdash; these people had sought help in the meantime &mdash; and by way of assessing their income he asked what the fauns would be worth when sold two years later.  Who in the name of God knows what they will be worth?  That is not acceptable.  The Government's policies will have to change.</P>
    <P>Obviously the policies are wrong when the Government cannot budget for a 12 month year but miss their target by four months and £26 million.  The Government must gear themselves towards helping small farmers.  The Land Commission were a great ally of the small farmers but they are in a state of limbo now with the result that there is nobody to help these people.  When they seek extra land to build up their holdings they are outbid by larger farmers and complete strangers, by foreigners coming in and buying up land.</P>
    <P>We were told that an agency, a land authority, would be set up in place of the Land Commission but nothing is happening. Land is lying there and still not being divided.  I do not know the acreage of such land in my constituency but it is substantial and there is very little movement on it.  I am not blaming the officials because they simply have not got the staff.  Coming up to Christmas I ask the Minister to put in extra staff and get this money out to the people who deserve it.</P>

      <P>I will have to stick to my brief on this occasion.  I cannot but refer to the contribution of Deputy Stagg, the Labour Party spokesman on agriculture. He has added to the unfounded statements of the president of the veterinary union.  It is not correct for anybody to come in here and say that when we are cooking a steak we do not know what kind of a cocktail we are unfolding. That kind of throw-away remark should not be allowed go unchallenged because as Deputy Stagg and everybody else knows the home beef market is supplied from the heifers which were never given hormones.  To make that kind of statement in the Dáil is not helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an increased Estimate of £26 million on the original budget of £154 million, an increase of about 16 per cent or 17 per cent.  It is stated that it is to be used for the payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants in aid.  I would like to ask the Minister if the underestimation in the original budget is the cause of the serious delay in the payment of grants for farm buildings, silage layouts, silage slabs, etc.  On the one hand, we have the Department of the Environment encouraging, compelling and even prosecuting <Col N="315" /> farmers to improve their farmyard facilities to avoid the possibility of farmyard pollution, and rightly so.  How can one Department ask farmers to provide such facilities when there is such a serious delay in the payment to the same farmers of the legitimate grants due to them for the work carried out?  I have on my file, as have other Deputies, various letters from farmers indicating that they will not be paid their grant for legitimate work carried out for three or four months down the line.  Deputy Boylan told us what the Department told him today.  In many of those cases the improvement work was carried out on borrowed money, on which high interest is being paid, and contractors are still waiting for their money and farmers are under severe pressure in this regard.  If we pass this Supplementary Estimate can the Minister assure me that the grants due will be paid?  Farmers have been waiting many months for reactor, cattle headage and ewe premium grants which are not being paid until February or March.</P>
      <P>In relation to the ewe premium grants, no grant is paid for ewe hoggets of the Connemara hill sheep simply because the mountain ewe hogget will not produce a lamb in the first year.  This is serious discrimination against hill sheep farmers. As everybody knows, the lowland ewe will produce a lamb in her first year but the hill ewe will not.  A subsidy can be obtained for a ewe with no tooth in her head, yet a ewe premium cannot be obtained for a ewe hogget in the hill sheep area.  This is a serious disadvantage because the ewe hogget is the foundation of the ewe herd.  It does not make sense that that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finnucane Mr. Finnucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finnucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the sentiments to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and wish him a speedy recovery.  The area on which I want to concentrate has been touched on by my colleagues, that is, the £8 million for the farm improvement programme.  I want to concentrate on <Col N="316" /> that because of my limited experience as a Dáil backbencher.  One of the most frustrating areas I am involved in is dealing with the local agricultural office.  I consider it frustrating because it seems to be impossible to get a decision or action out of them.  The reason given in most cases is shortage of staff, nobody to type literature and nobody to send out written approval forms.  In this day and age I do not know where we are going with sophisticated technology when that pathetic, lame excuse is given.</P>
      <P>When one analyses the position &mdash; and I listened to Deputy Hyland earlier saying job creation was the primary target of the Government &mdash; I cannot understand how the Deputy could be referring to the agricultural scene.  On 26 October in reply to a question I was informed that from 1987 to 1989 the number of professional staff engaged in agricultural advisory services has been reduced from 567 to 398, a reduction of 169.  The administrative staff, which I think is the most important when it comes to approving forms and ensuring that grants are eventually expedited, have been reduced from 146 to 95, a reduction of 51.  When I studied the figures I could understand the problem in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The professional, agricultural and advisory service in Limerick has been reduced from 27 to 20 and the administrative staff from six to two.  Deputy Hyland's words ring a little hollow when I see those statistics in front of me.  In this specific area it is frustrating for farmers because, as my colleague quite rightly said, when speaking about industry, industrialists would not wait a long time for their capital and training grants; they would put pressure on the Ministers and everybody else in the interests of the survival of that business, to actually expedite the payment of those grants. Why, therefore, are farmers left to wait a considerable length of time?  Is it because of the £8 million?  Is it because the money is not there?  Is it deliberate coat-trailing in order to delay the whole <Col N="317" /> process?  Perhaps the Minister could answer those questions.</P>
    <P>One would hope that, because of the extra £8 million, we could expect efficiency, something which is extremely important as we face 1990.  Where are we going with the type of service we got in the past?  We are going down the tubes. One would expect a more efficient operation and in this Estimate there is no subvention for an increase in staff.  On 18 October I wrote to the Minister outlining the staffing problems in Limerick but when I did not get a satisfactory reply I raised it in the Dáil.  The reply I got was that there are no plans to expand the staff in the Limerick office, but they will, if possible, second people on a part-time basis from other Departments should they become available.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Limerick is only a mirror image of every agricultural office throughout the country.  They all have the same problems. It is frustrating and farmers will not put up with it.  The Minister will have to improve efficiency.  Even if some of the £8 million must go towards improving the position and a few computers have to be installed to improve the situation, that should be done but, for God sake, what is going on?  If there is a staff problem down in Limerick or in other offices, the Minister should get to the root of them. The most important thing is that farmers are paid the grants.  As a Deputy, I cannot get satisfactory answers from anyone about that matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter mentioned by Deputy Hyland.  He referred specifically to disadvantaged areas and said that so far the Government have achieved the targets in the survey. Possibly they have and I compliment them on that, but the most vital target the Government have to achieve is that the submission goes to the EC before 31 December.  If it does not, there is a strong possibility that farmers who are included for the first time will not receive any grants until 1991.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="318" /> expedite that process and ensure that the disadvantaged areas, or whoever is to be included, is included before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in wishing our Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, a speedy recovery.  I thank him for the tremendous effort he has put in since he took over the portfolio of agriculture. With his Ministers of State, Deputies Kirk and Walsh, he has one of the strongest teams I have seen since I came into Dáil and the results are there to be seen, even though some people claim that that is not the case.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate especially as it covers a number of very important areas.  The subheads provide funds for Teagasc, bovine levies, farm improvement and the pilot programme for integrated rural development. On a previous occasion the Minister moved that an extra £8 million be included in the Estimate.  This shows the Government's commitment to research, advice and education.  The £8 million should put Teagasc on a firm footing.</P>
      <P>Before commencing I should have said I wish to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Nolan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of research and advice. We have only to look at the young farmers who, over the last couple of years, got involved in the green certificate and the one year course in agricultural colleges to see how they have made progress on their farms.</P>
      <P>Many speakers mentioned bovine levies.  At one time my constituency was practically free of TB and brucellosis but that is not the case now.  In some areas up to 25 per cent of the herd is infected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Heretofore, people had small herds which meant that not many cattle were affected but now, with large herds, more lesions are appearing on cattle which means that the complete herd has to be replaced.</P>
    <P>Despite all the programmes, veterinary surgeons and farm inspectors do not seem to be able to pinpoint the problem. We talked about intermixing and badgers causing TB, but this is not certain and the programme is costing an awful lot of money and not showing a result.</P>
    <P>Members mentioned the disappointing prices for cattle.  The root of the problem is the small farmers who did not have a milk quota but were making a reasonable livelihood for years out of store cattle. Then they began to purchase calves by way of young stores and prices were inflated because there was a fear that there would be a scarcity of cattle.  The margin of profit is not there now and if the balance is not right we will have a problem in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the farm modernisation scheme and the western package.  A previous speaker criticised the Minister for not reaching his target but I do not think that any Minister could have budgeted for the spectacular success and unprecedented demand for the scheme which Minister O'Kennedy introduced in 1988, including the farmyard pollution grant.  The demand for this grant has been massive and in farmyard after farmyard there are underground tanks and slatted houses.  In spite of the cries from the Opposition: &ldquo;We'll all be ruined says Hanrahan before the year is out&rdquo; there is confidence in these schemes. Otherwise there would not be the building and development which is evident all over the country.  That confidence was created following the atrocious weather in 1985 and 1986.  There is no doubt that the success of these anti-pollution measures was evident much more quickly than any of us could have anticipated. One would have expected that it <Col N="320" /> would take many years for the results to be seen, but that is not the case.  People have used this grant in a practical way and I am sure that, before long, pollution will be controlled in every farm in the country.</P>
    <P>A pleasing feature of the Minister's speech was the mention of the increase in beef cow numbers.  He increased the level of the suckler cow premium from £37 to £52 per year which had the effect of restoring confidence in the industry, and statistics prove this as they showed an increase of 64,000, the first increase since our entry to the EC.  In 1973 the prediction was that our cattle herd would reach the figure of nine million in 1990. We have failed in that regard &mdash; the figure is about six million &mdash; as there was a very serious slump in the intervening years. However, there is now a positive approach to the problem, we are coming to grips with it and I hope the numbers will soon rise.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the pilot programme under subhead L 10 for integrated rural development.  The initial results from the reports of the co-ordinators are encouraging.  Structural Funds will be coming on stream, which is very important, as they can be used to further the gains made in the pilot scheme areas and could be applied to small farms to good advantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is widening the young farmers installation aid grant to allow farmers with intensive enterprises to divide up their farms because there were serious anomalies in that scheme.  The Minister and the Department examined the scheme and, as it was a worthwhile project, it was taken on board.  Indeed, all schemes about which serious representations were made were also examined in this way.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister secured an extra 1 per cent in the milk quota.  I hope young farmers and small milk suppliers will benefit from this and ensure that it will increase their quota to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> Other speakers mentioned beef production, which is one of the black spots in agriculture.  In the area of poultry, pigs and milk production there has been organisation and forward planning and they have been examined in detail. However, the meat factories have not been responsible for the failure in beef production.  In my county a meat factory can close for nine months of the year, and six miles down the road 300 people are working in a poultry processing plant exporting a wide range of products on a continuous basis.  From now until Christmas they will be working round the clock because they have orders for somewhere in the region of 300 live turkeys.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Leonard, for giving me five minutes of his time to speak on this very important debate.  Like previous speakers, I wish to be associated with the good wishes of the House for a speedy recovery to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy.  Of course, both his junior Ministers are well capable of filling in for him while he is indisposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the Minister's commitment of £8 million in Teagasc.  In the Minister's opening remarks he outlined the benefits that this money will bring to them.  The legislation setting up Teagasc places special emphasis on the training of young farmers and on food research.  It is important that a body such as Teagasc should have a solid financial base.  I believe that now the Minister has provided the additional £8 million, the finances of Teagasc will be put on a solid footing.  The allocation of £8 million will <Col N="322" /> ensure that Teagasc ends the year with a clean slate and can plan to balance the budget in the years ahead.  The announcement of an additional £4 million to ERAD, to cover increased expenditure, is also very welcome.  The problem of disease eradication has haunted this country for far too long.  Nobody can dispute the fact that a great deal of money has already been spent, some would say misspent on the eradication of tuberculosis but we must do everything to endeavour to continue this programme and the £4 million granted to ERAD will go some way towards that.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that agreement was reached with the farming organisations that £8 million which would be funded jointly by Exchequer contributions and increased levies, would be provided for the years 1989-90 to cover increases in grants paid under the eradication scheme.  This was a very positive move forward.</P>
    <P>As we go into the nineties, public awareness of our green image and the beauty of our surroundings is coming more into focus.  The control of farmyard pollution has been brought to the fore over the past year and a half.  Farmers have played a very constructive role in trying to do what they can to control pollution.  With the assistance of various grants we are slowly but surely moving towards the control of farmyard effluent and pollution.  This year, the demand for grants under the farm modernisation scheme has exceeded the budgetary allocation, and the additional resources required to meet the extra claims which are likely to mature between now and the end of the year have been provided.  It is important not to miss the opportunity of complimenting the Minister on setting up An Bord Glas.  It was set up initially as a non-statutory interim board in 1987.</P>
    <P>It is well known on the continent that although we had the facility to produce the best horticultural produce in Europe, we did not have the correct marketing approach.  The findings of some of the <Col N="323" /> inquiries of the interim board showed the marketing weakness in our horticultural business.  It also showed that producers needed to be guaranteed a certain minimum price for their produce.  One of the main findings in their report was that 60 per cent of the demand for the produce came from the supermarket groups.  If they did one thing, they emphasised that the relationship between marketing and producers needed to be consolidated. The fact that the Bord Glas Bill will be enacted shortly by the Oireachtas will improve confidence in farming.  There are a great many areas where we could do a great deal more.  Potato production has been a black spot for a number of years. If one looks at the Order Paper frequently one sees a number of questions tabled on the volume of potato imports. The potential for glasshouse products and mushrooms can be studied by An Bord Glas.  I am sure that the Minister of State is only too well aware of the benefits this would bring to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>While speaking on the Bord Glas Bill, the Minister said he was thinking at one time of making An Bord Glas a subsidiary of Teagasc.  I am glad that he did not take this option and that an independent board was set up.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister continued success in his portfolio.  I welcome the opportunity of lending support to the Department and the Minister in their endeavours for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>At the outset I take the opportunity of thanking the Deputies who contributed on the Supplementary Estimate.  I thank them also for their messages of good wishes to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr. O'Kennedy, which I fully endorse and I <Col N="324" /> will pass the Deputies good wishes on to him.</P>
      <P>I will now respond to a number of points which the Deputies raised during the course of the debate.  Deputy Connaughton, who was the first to contribute after I spoke, referred to the delays in the payment of development and ewe premium grants.  He also cited instances where payment of ERAD grants was delayed over five months.  I assure the Deputy that with the taking of this Supplementary Estimate, the main obstacle to expediting the payment of development and reactor grants has been removed.  With regard to the advance of the ewe premium, payments are in train and we expect that flock owners will receive the advance payment over the next month or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy, but I am sure he is aware, that decentralisation has been in train for some time and the accounts branch of the Department is now located in Cavan. Inevitably there has to be a settling in period in the new environment and that must have a bearing on the payment of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Emmet Stagg referred to the question of quotas for the small milk producer and the small farmer generally.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, say at Question Time the other day that it was his clear intention that the milk quotas that become available within the Community will go to deserving categories, to small farmers, young farmers and farmers with a quota under a certain gallonage.  I believe that all Members will be in broad <Col N="325" /> agreement with the thrust of that statement. Milk quotas constitute a very valuable asset nowadays in that they can provide farmers with the wherewithal to earn a reasonable living.  It is only reasonable that deserving categories be considered when surplus milk is being distributed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ewe premium and the failure to pay on hill hoggets while old sheep without teeth are paid grants as mentioned by Deputy McCormack, I should say that the regulations under which the ewe premium is paid are laid down by the EC and are applicable to all member states in the Community.  These regulations specify that ewes must have lambed once or be visibly in lamb in order to qualify.  With regard to older sheep, the Department's inspectorate examine the teeth of all sheep inspected.  I can assure the House that sheep without teeth will be disqualified from payment of a grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton welcomed the £8 million provision for Teagasc and then went on to criticise the provision in next year's Estimates, contending that they represented a reduction of 2 per cent.  It is fair to say that this provision for Teagasc &mdash; which I might add has been welcomed by the Authority and its chairman in particular &mdash; will constitute a saving for the Authority, via the payment of the £8 million, and should eliminate the 2 per cent shortfall in 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of EC funding for Teagasc, the level for 1990 has been increased by more than 15 per cent, from £4.8 million in 1989 to at least £5.6 million next year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food very early in the year gave an undertaking to put Teagasc on a secure financial footing.  He clearly indicated that if additional finances were necessary they would be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that I deal with a matter raised by a number of Deputies and which has been the subject of some controversy over the past day or two, that <Col N="326" /> is the matter of the use of illegal growth promoters.  For the sake of the beef industry, for the reputation of our exports and for the benefit of the public at large, it is appropriate that a press release issued by the Food Information Section of the Department of Agriculture and Food yesterday evening be read into the record.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food today referred to allegations of widespread use of illegal growth promoters in meat being exported.  The Department said that these allegations are not borne out by the results available to it from a sampling programme.</P>
    <P>All meat produced for export is inspected and certified before leaving meat factories by veterinary practitioners employed by the Department and acting under the supervision of veterinary staff of the Department. There are detailed regulations in place controlling the use of hormone growth promoters in order to ensure compliance with EC Directives.</P>
    <P>The Department operates an ongoing programme of sampling of meat and live animals for residues of hormones as well as for antibiotics.  In the last 12 months 5,834 samples were tested of which 160 were positive.  In the case of samples taken from suspect meat, the carcases of the affected animals were condemned; in the case of samples from live animals the animals concerned were freeze-branded and cannot be used for human consumption.  Court applications are in train for the destruction of 35 such animals.  Since the ban on the use of hormones for growth promotion was introduced in Ireland in 1987 the classification of Irish beef has shown a trend from leaner to fatter carcases indicating that the widespread use of hormones had declined.  That trend continued in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Department is aware of the existence of a trade in illegal veterinary products generally and is actively <Col N="327" /> engaged in combating such activities. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has extensive powers to deal with this matter.  To date 42 successful investigations have resulted in 162 convictions for illegal sale, possession or use of veterinary drugs.</P>
    <P>The Department warned that farmers should be fully aware of the risk associated with the use of such substances.  Apart from the danger of detection through the monitoring programme and the loss arising from having animals and carcases condemned the good reputation of our exports is paramount and should not be jeopardised by short-term considerations. A growing number of consumers are unwilling to purchase meat from animals reared with the aid of hormones.  Unless we can be seen to produce to those consumer requirements we risk the permanent loss of very important markets. </P>
    <P>On the question of hormone and residues, I should add that under subhead B.2 &mdash; which provides for the expenses of my Department's Meat Control Laboratory &mdash; I propose additional funding of £40,000.  This amount is required to finance the higher level of testing of meat for harmful residues, antibiotics, hormones etc.  The laboratory carries out testing of animals and of meat for the domestic and export markets under our random sampling programme submitted each year to the EC and also testing of samples taken on suspicion.  This additional funding will contribute towards protecting public health and ensuring the continued access of our meat products to export markets.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to provide an additional £10,000, under subhead A.4, to meet the cost of miscellaneous equipment for the meat inspection service.  It is important that that information be read into the record.</P>
    <P>The value of the beef industry to our economy is too significant to allow scares <Col N="328" /> to upset it or damage in any way the image of our meat exports.  Indeed, it behoves every Member of this House, and people directly involved in the industry outside, to be careful in what they say about these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having allowed me raise this matter which has been the subject of much discussion by the ordinary person in the street and in the media.</P>
      <P>There have been numerous promises made by the current Minister of State at the Department of the Environment since she assumed office in relation to environmental matters but in their impact on what is happening on the ground none of those promises has had any realistic or positive effect.  The time for talking is over.  For the past two to three years we have known that this city was threatened by an endemic major, recurring smog problem.  This is no surprise, this is no environmental earthquake that has occurred without prior warning.  This has been forecast for quite some time.</P>
      <P>I have to say that a very courageous, young Minister, who has taken on the responsible of Minister of State in the Department of the Environment &mdash; has been given a very dirty political job in more ways than one.  She has been hung out, not to dry but to choke by the present Administration and choking she is because the reality is that this Government have no real, immediate answer to this problem.  We have had promises for the future, we have heard all sorts of promises about what they will do at some stage in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the seventh cavalry has now arrived in the person of the Minister for super smog, the senior Minister in the same Department who, in the security of <Col N="329" /> smoke-free Mayo, is able to look on at the choking of Dublin citizens.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension to this problem.  Who is benefiting from the hype in coal prices and in the price of coalite? We have a private enterprise sector monopoly on the distribution of coal which is causing certainly more than 50 per cent of the problem.  This is the deregulated market economy, much beloved of the Progressive Democrats and of the born-again Republicans in Fianna Fáil.  On the one hand there are the semi-State bodies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis who can actually deliver a clean environment.  On the other hand we have private monopoly &mdash; Coal Distributors Limited &mdash; who have gobbled up the only competitor who surfaced for a short period of time &mdash; who are exploiting the choking misery of Dublin citizens in the way in which they have monopolised coal prices in this city.  It is an absolute out-rage, compounded by Government inaction, compounded by the problems of administering the provisions of the Air Pollution Act and by the failure of the present Administration to introduce the necessary amendments which they promised frequently outside the House. However, since they never effectively promised them in the House, the Taoiseach on the Order of Business today was able to evade a proper and legitimate response to a legitimate question.  I am saying to the Minister of State, who must know there is an emergency, and to the Minister for the Environment, who is an unhappy partner in this new and surprise Coalition Government, that between them they have to work out a solution.</P>

I am asking them to do four specific things to prove their sincerity and commitment.  There are friends of mine who cannot come out tonight.

      <P>I will observe it.  The Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection is totally negligent in the execution of her duties.  I have reason to say that she has been politically spancilled by the senior Minister in that Department, who belongs to another party and whose attitude to the forced marriage in the summer was not exactly unknown.  I am asking them to put behind them the clear political and personal differences that are getting in the way of the delivery of an effective emergency programme for the citizens of Dublin.  I want the following to be initiated tonight by the two Ministers. There is nothing stopping them but their own political timidity.  First, there should be the declaration of a smog emergency to last for the rest of this winter.  Let us agree on that.  Second, the Government should order CDL to reduce the price of <Col N="331" /> coalite to a level 25 per cent below the price of coal.  Let them do it now.  It is a private enterprise monopoly.  If Bord na Móna, the ESB or Bord Gáis were involved, the Government would be able to do it.  Let us see if the deregulated market in which the Government have so much faith can respond to human needs. Third, the burning of bituminous and other excessive smoke solid fuels should be prohibited by emergency order until the end of the winter.  The Ministers have the power under the safety and public health legislation if they have the political will.  Finally, in the event of CDL refusing to co-operate with the Government in the exercise of their private enterprise monopoly which is choking the citizens of Dublin and pumping poison into the air, the Government should instruct the ESB to commence the importation of smokeless fuels.  This they were about to do but the project was terminated.  The time has come for action rather than attending seminars, as the Minister of State has been doing.</P>

Perhaps there are dual controls in the environmental car they are driving.  Her steady-as-she-goes policy has not worked.  We have been in breach of EC regulations for a number of days and the prospect is that between now and the end of March Dublin citizens will have their lives shortened, if not terminated, by the political inaction of this Administration, who cannot claim that they were not forewarned. I have made four specific suggestions to the Minister of State, an emergency declaration, a reduction in the <Col N="332" /> price of coalite, the banning of the burning of bituminous coal and permission to the ESB to bring in and distribute non-heavy smoke coals if CDL are not prepared to co-operate in the public interest.</P>

      <P>The present smog problem is very serious and I have never sought to minimise how vital an issue it is.  It is important that Members should be honest and realistic in appraising the problem and proposing solutions. The smog problem has been around for a decade.  We must remember that in 1982 Dr. Luke Clancy produced his report highlighting the possible health hazards of smog in the city and county. That was a period during which we had a Coalition Government of Labour and Fine Gael.  They were in office for four-and-a-half years.  What did they do about the smoke problem?  They extended grants for open fireplaces and chimneys. Those grants were not abolished until the present Minister took office.  They did not even get the Air Pollution Act successfully through the Oireachtas.  The first air pollution legislation was put through when the present Minister took office.</P>

      <P>It is a bit much for members of the Opposition to make glib name-calling remarks at me in an effort to get empty headlines in tomorrow's newspapers.  I thought Deputy Quinn was going to make some suggestions which I could put into practice but he did not.  He asked us to declare a smog emergency; we can certainly do that.  He asked us to order CDL to bring down the price of coalite.  It was because of the huge increase in the price of coalite during the past year by up to 27 per cent that I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate the price increase.  He has asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Fair Trade Commission to do that.  Perhaps it will be possible following that investigation to make an order to reduce the price of coalite.  Deputy Quinn asked us to ban the burning of bituminous coal in Dublin for the rest of this winter. That certainly would be a very simple solution.  We could announce in the morning a ban on the burning of coal.  If the Government did not really care about the householders of Dublin and simply wanted to be perceived to be doing the right thing we could certainly do that, but what would be the consequences?  In the Dublin area 177,000 householders rely on solid fuel as their main source of heating and 160,000 of these can burn coal only.</P>

      <P>I would encourage householders to switch to briquettes and to the low smoke fuels, many of them can afford to do so.  If we were to give those householders a grant, on the basis of the grants we have been giving already, to <Col N="334" /> convert to gas or whatever, it would cost up to £110 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if this money was available, how long would the conversion take?  I do not think the building industry and the energy utilities could respond. For example, Dublin Gas at present can convert only up to 14,000 houses per year.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion is that we could tax coal.  A possible tax on coal to reduce the differential between it and coalite and enhance the price competitiveness of other low smoke fuels seems an attractive option but what of the implications?  It would have to be applied nationally and there would have to be a reasonable subvention for social welfare recipients. Would it even be effective in changing attitudes?  If you look at the price differential, for example, in relation to unleaded petrol, which is 5p a gallon cheaper than the premium top grade leaded petrol, sales of unleaded petrol stand at only 11 per cent despite the fact that 50 per cent of the cars could drive on this fuel.  Price alone does not change people's habits.  A VAT reduction was suggested. A full subsidy to bring the price of coalite down to the same price as coal would cost £18 million a year and that would be simply a temporary deferral of the problem. It would favour one main supplier, one private company, and that would be the equivalent in cost to grant aiding nearly 26,000 permanent conversions per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have recently established a working group who will consider and report within three months on policy options for fuels in the Dublin area.  This committee, consisting of representatives <Col N="335" /> of Dublin Gas, the ESB, Eolas and several Government Departments, is being chaired by the Department of the Environment. It is currently examining such questions as the feasibility of extending the gas mainlines throughout the city, the steps that need to be taken to maximise the domestic use of natural gas and also the greater use of electricity, LPG, peat and other smokeless and low smoke fuels. This committee, which was established about a month ago, will, as I have said, report within three months.</P>

      <P>Realistically, as the Deputies in this House know, the best we can do is work towards the 1993 deadline and that is what I and my Department are doing.  The Government are considering a number of options including a possible tax on coal, a subsidy in respect of low smoke fuels, a reduction in the rate of VAT on those fuels or the banning of coal.  All of these are under consideration.  I am optimistic that decisions will be made as soon as possible and that once and for all we can deal with this problem in the only way which is practical, that is on a permanent basis.  I <Col N="336" /> would urge Deputies in the Opposition to be helpful and co-operative instead of making glib, smart comments about myself and the Minister for the Environment. I was interested to know that they thought there were two Ministers for the Environment; obviously we are doing such a good job that it appears there are two people doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekend of 27, 28 and 29 October was one of the most devastating in the history of County Mayo and particularly for the residents of Crossmolina.  Twenty four hours of incessant rainfall led to a deluge which <Col N="337" /> literally left Church Street, Chapel Road and Erris Street, Crossmolina, under almost five feet of water.  Houses, businesses and properties were under water for over 24 hours but thankfully there was no loss of life.  The Minister is aware of the problem because he visited the area to see it at first hand.  I, like other people who also visited the scene, want to pay tribute to the local authority, Mayo County Council, for the marvellous relief work they carried out and in particular to the Mayo fire service which, above and beyond the call of duty, did enormous work, first, in ensuring that there was minimum danger to life and property and, secondly, in ensuring that the flood waters were taken away as soon as possible. They literally worked around the clock and they did us all proud in ensuring that the minimum discomfort ensued for those involved.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, the damage was quite substantial.  The total estimate of damage for the town of Crossmolina alone is £352,000.  I can assure the Minister that this is a reasonably accurate assessment of the damage.  This assessment was carried out by a monitoring committee headed by an extremely responsible group of people who handed out survey sheets, monitored and assessed the degree of damage at first and second hand and ensured that no inflated figure was arrived at.  Fortunately, £230,000 worth of the damaged property was insured but, unfortunately, damage to the tune of £122,000 was sustained by uninsured property holders.  One business, for example, sustained losses of over £15,000.  The average losses for householders vary between £6,000 and £8,000 which is considerable.  This is an extreme disadvantage to people who are very average, ordinary citizens.  These people, without notice or any prior warning, were faced with having to carry out relatively substantial works to their properties arising from circumstances totally outside their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 20 individuals involved in <Col N="338" /> Crossmolina alone but, as the Minister will be aware, there are also other individuals scattered throughout the length and breadth of the county who, unfortunately, have not received anything like the publicity that ensued in the case of Crossmolina, Newport, Westport or Ballina. These people have been considerably disadvantaged and have had to fork out considerable amounts of money to carry out the necessary remedial works.  The vast majority of them are not insured but that is through no fault of their own.  The reason for this is that they have gone to insurance companies but, because of similar occurrences in the past or because of their proximity to rivers which have overflowed on previous occasions, the insurance companies simply will not give them the necessary cover.  It is the plight of these people in particular that we want to highlight in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be receiving a deputation from Crossmolina tomorrow. That deputation will be under-pinning and substantiating the case we put before the House tonight.  In the light of these events, Deputy Kenny and I brought before the House last week two questions in relation to possible compensation for these people.  The Minister gave a fairly long and detailed reply in relation to the overall position but unfortunately the final paragraph of the reply states: &ldquo;There are no funds available to me to compensate for any damage to private properties occasioned by the flooding&rdquo;.  That has a fairly ominous ring to it and particularly so when one considers that the Minister's only redress seems to be that he is looking to the task force on special housing aid for the elderly to remedy the householders' living conditions.</P>
    <P>The special task force for the elderly is under the jurisdiction of the Western Health Board which is already working with greatly diminished resources and in this case it is not the answer.  What we are asking is that the Minister do what was done a number of years ago in <Col N="339" /> relation to the Dodder flooding when, thanks to the Minister for the Environment on that occasion, Dublin Corporation received a total grant of £185,000 in order to enable contractors to carry out essential remedial works to buildings on Anglesea Road.  What we want is the Minister to agree to the principle of compensation for the people of his native Mayo.  We are more than optimistic that the news the Minister will give to the deputation tomorrow will include this general principle.</P>
    <P>I again want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for enabling me to raise this matter.  At this juncture I should like to facilitate my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this matter to be raised on the Adjournment and to thank Deputy Higgins for giving me a portion of his time.  I also want to thank my colleague from County Mayo, the Minister for the Environment, for coming in here to listen to the debate and to give his response.</P>
      <P>I want to endorse everything Deputy Higgins has said in this regard.  We cannot determine the weather conditions and nobody is to blame for the exceptionally heavy rainfall in County Mayo during the October bank holiday weekend.  I am well aware that the Minister for the Environment understands intimately the problems which have arisen as a consequence of the severe flooding and that he has received a report from Mayo County Council which sets out in general terms the consequences of the severe weather conditions.  I also know that the county council do not have legal responsibility for the damage caused, except in terms of road conditions and road maintenance, and it would not be their desire to become involved in any intricacies beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Higgins said about the people from Crossmolina and <Col N="340" /> Ballina who were not insured.  I request an explanation why, when there was a precedent in 1986 for special funding in respect of the Dodder and the Little Bray areas, this type of funding cannot be given to needy and hardship cases in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw to the Minister's attention to two cases of which he is well aware.  I recently attended a meeting of an action committee from the Kilmeena area of Westport at which this matter was discussed.  This meeting was also attended by Deputy O'Toole from Louisburgh, who is also present in the House. I understand the Minister for the Environment visited the area in question. There were landslides in both cases and the consequences were unique in the context of the damage to households that weekend.  A technical report from consultants has been received and sent to the Minister for the Environment on one of these cases.  This report deems it necessary that a budget of at least £30,000 to £35,000 will be required to provide a retaining wall to stop the movement of soil from a hillside on to the commercial premises concerned.  I should point out that the proprietors of that premises are in no way interested in compensation in respect of the building which was separately insured.  The Minister also visited the farm involved in the second case where a very large landslide caused damage of between £80,000 to £100,000. This landslide had to be seen to be actually believed.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Minister the necessity to deal in a different way with these two unique and isolated cases.  The Minister can take it that whatever he does in this regard will be fully backed by all the public representatives from the area. I do not understand from the reply given on 21 November why, when a precedent exists for funding in cases like this, similar arrangements cannot be made for the appropriate amount necessary in both these cases.  I am sure the Minister for <Col N="341" /> the Environment understands the representations which have been made to Deputy O'Toole, Deputy Higgins, Deputy Morley, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, myself and others in this regard and that he will take these representations into account when he is making a final decision in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to thank my colleagues, Deputy Higgins and Deputy Kenny, for raising this matter.  I am sure they have expressed the views of my colleague from West Mayo, Deputy O'Toole, on these matters.  I want to assure all the Deputies that I share their concern for the people who have been affected by the very severe weather conditions experienced in parts of County Mayo and other parts of the country during the October bank holiday weekend.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins rightly said, I have first hand knowledge of the problem in most parts of County Mayo, which appears to have been the area most severely affected by the bad weather conditions. I have witnessed some of the difficulties.  I understand, for example, that the rainfall recorded in Belmullet on the Friday and Saturday of that weekend exceeded the rainfall which would normally be experienced in that area for the entire month of October.  This big downpour caused a lot of damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both I and, at my request, officials from my Department were in contact with the local authorities in the worst affected areas during that weekend.  They were advised of the general position in those areas and the action which the local authorities were taking to alleviate the difficulties.  I am perfectly satisfied that the various local authorities responded magnificently, very quickly and effectively during the period in question.  I, too, would like to commend them for the way in which they carried out their functions on that occasion.  I witnessed the workforce of Mayo County Council <Col N="342" /> and the fire brigade in action and one could only have the highest of praise for the efficient and effective way they dealt with the worst of the flooding.  We are all at one on that.</P>
    <P>Reports have been received in the Department about the extent of the damage to all the public roads and bridges.  The question of providing special funds for the restoration of public roads and bridges affected by the flooding will be considered when all the reports have been received and assessed.  I intend to examine the reports in the near future and to decide what special funds for remedial works to roads and bridges are warranted.  I should point out to the Deputies that other counties suffered as well during that particular weekend.  I do not know what funds are available to me at present but I will look at these cases in as favourably a way as I can.  This area of County Mayo suffered very badly and I will be looking as sympathetically as I can at these cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing it is as well to say here that we have had no reports on the extensive damage which the Deputies say occurred on that occasion, but I am meeting a deputation from one area tomorrow.  This was not the only area affected; Ballina and some isolated areas around Newport &mdash; there was a very serious case in the Newport area &mdash; and the Westport area were also affected.  I am meeting that deputation tomorrow and I will hear at first hand their attitudes and opinions on the matter.</P>
    <P>The funding provided in 1986 in respect of the damage caused by the flooding of the Dodder has been mentioned by both Deputies.  This is a case in point.  This funding which was made available by the Department related exclusively to remedying extensive damage which was caused to housing and the accommodation of persons who, as a result of the severe flooding, were faced with very severe hardship and had to leave their homes for long periods of time.  Householders would normally be expected to <Col N="343" /> have their property and its contents insured properly against losses, flooding and adverse weather conditions.  While it is of no comfort to the two Deputies opposite, they know full well that there is no fund available to the Minister from which compensation for damage to private property can be paid.  Such a fund does not exist.  We must not minimise the role the Western Health Board can play in this regard.  They have funds which were made available to them by the Department of the Environment to deal with these emergencies so far as elderly people are concerned.  I will be advising the deputation about this tomorrow.</P>
    <P>With regard to the compensation for losses of the kind mentioned in so far as livestock, disruption of business and loss of livelihood are concerned, this is the responsibility of another Minister.  It is not my responsibility, and I am not just passing it on to anybody else.  I have to put it clearly on the record that in so far as business premises are concerned, it is a very long established practice that the Exchequer cannot meet the losses incurred by businesses as a result of their being uninsured.  That is not just my opinion or the attitude of this Government, it is the attitude which has existed since the very start, and has never been broken.  The same attitude existed and was recognised by the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government in their response, <Col N="344" /> for example, to Hurricane Charlie.  There is no advantage to be gained by my quoting letters written by senior politicians and leaders of the Coalition Government at that time explaining that position in very explicit terms to Deputies and organisations throughout the country. That particular attitude has never been broken and it is not recommended that I do so now.</P>
    <P>Having explained the position so far as commercial property, compensation, the loss of livelihood or any other adverse consequences are concerned, I have to say that I am concerned about the whole business and I intend to look as carefully as I can at the resources which are available to me to make good whatever damage has been caused.  Something will be done in this respect.  I am satisfied so far as our infrastructure there is concerned and I will listen very carefully to what the deputation have to say tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and if there are any funds available to me for the specific areas they have mentioned I will use them to the best advantage possible.  I cannot go any further until such time as the assessments are completed.  The Deputies will hear the news at that time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 December 1989.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware detailed price control procedures have been allowed to lapse since early 1986.  The purpose of this was to encourage competition and to allow market forces and consumer reaction to dictate prices.</P>
      <P>Re-establishment of the price control mechanism is something I want to avoid. It discourages competition and fuels an inflation mentality.  Therefore, I do not propose to re-introduce price control in respect of bread.  In any event, the retail price of bread at present is substantially lower than at this period last year.  I am anxious to encourage healthy competition in this and other sectors.  I would be concerned, therefore, at the emergence of any undesirable trading practices such as concerted action affecting prices. I have, accordingly, asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to closely monitor developments in this area.</P>

      <P>This Government welcome the proposed product safety directive which will reinforce consumer protection policy and place an obligation on manufacturers, importers and retailers in member states to adopt effective product safety procedures.  This policy should bring about a number of significant improvements on the present position in that it will strengthen consumer protection policy and enhance the safety of the citizens of member states; it will help to reinforce the principle of mutual recognition, as it will contribute to strengthen member states' confidence in each other's surveillance, control and test procedures; it will speed up the process of establishing appropriate certification bodies in member states which do not already have them; and finally, it will bring about a clearer notion of what may constitute &ldquo;appropriate measures&rdquo;, in the event of hazards, to be taken by member states under various vertical directives, and it should have a harmonising effect in this respect.</P>

      <P>For this reason, I have instructed the IDA and Shannon Development that grants should not be paid to industries which are in breach of environmental requirements.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, the National Prices Commission was disbanded in 1986 in order to encourage price competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers. This action was not taken in isolation. It was associated with measures designed to strengthen the regulation of competition in the market.  An extensive press release was issued on 17 January 1986 on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism detailing these measures.  Competition legislation was subsequently strengthened with the enactment of the 1987 Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, which came into effect in January 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I have no plans for the re-establishment of the National Prices Commission.  The reintroduction of detailed price control is something I would wish to avoid, as I consider it tended to discourage competition and served to establish what were often minimum rather than maximum prices.  All of the ministerial powers under the Prices Acts continue in being and I can use these powers should I consider that any particular situation warrants such action.</P>
    <P>However, the emphasis of the Government is to further strengthen competition legislation.  I intend to bring new legislation before this House as a priority.  It will be designed to ensure that the forces of competition are not in any way hindered by restrictive or anti-competitive practices in the market.  This legislation will significantly alter the basic approach of our competition law.  The Fair Trade Commission are currently completing a study in this regard which will provide a significant input to the formulation of this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have been taking action to ensure that Irish consumers benefit from favourable movements in the Irish pound sterling exchange rate.  I would drawn the attention of Deputies to a press release, issued on my behalf on 24 November, 1989, which indicated that I have been informed of a range of price reductions due to favourable exchange rate movements. The director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is carrying out an investigation, at my request, which will enable me to assess whether these reductions are adequate.  I expect the report of this investigation shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>With its traditionally rigid economic structures and lack of hard currency, Eastern Europe has been a very difficult market for Irish exporters.  In 1988 Ireland had a trade deficit of £52 million with the Eastern European countries of Poland, Hungary, USSR, Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Yugoslavia, on a total trade of £193 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the picture is now changing. <Col N="55" /> The increasing democratisation and economic reforms in Eastern Europe together with the massive aid programmes envisaged will hopefully lay the foundations for economic growth in that region.  I am most anxious that Ireland will play a significant role in such growth.</P>
    <P>I have asked officials of my Department to prepare the groundwork for an early meeting with the relevant semi-State organisations and private sector representative bodies with a view to advising them of the evolving opportunities in Eastern Europe for producers of Irish goods and services.  While it is clear that much remains to be undertaken in the countries concerned on both a political and economic level, I am convinced that given Ireland's historical situation in the political architecture of Europe, we are now in a better position than ever to contribute significantly to the future economic development of the region.</P>
    <P>In addition, a major East-West economic conference is planned for Bonn next spring under the aegis of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It is my intention that Ireland will have a strong business and governmental presence at that conference to demonstrate our commitment to East European reform.</P>
    <P>CTT currently services Eastern Europe through its offices in Dublin and Moscow and its trade consultants in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest.  While CTT's operational presence in Eastern Europe is now being kept under special review in the light of developments in that market, there are no plans at present to expand the role of the organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement giving details of our total trade with the US and with South America as provided by the Central Statistics Office.  This statement also gives a breakdown of trade as between imports and exports.</P>
      <P>Total trade between Ireland and the US increased by 9.4 per cent in 1987, 7.7 per cent in 1988 and by 24 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.  Exports to the United States improved by 1.8 per cent in 1987, following very low growth in the previous year, and by 13.9 per cent in 1988.  Exports for the first ten months of 1989 are showing an increase of almost 20.5 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1988.  CTT advise me that they expect a similar rate of export growth for 1990.</P>
      <P>Imports from the US have increased by 13.9 per cent in 1987, 4.37 per cent in 1988 and by 26 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.  Ireland has a large trade imbalance with the US, primarily due to importation of raw materials, components and subassemblies by US subsidiaries in Ireland.  This imbalance grew by 32 per cent in 1987, decreased by 7.2 per cent in 1988 and grew by 33.9 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.</P>
      <P>While understanding the reasons for the high imports, there is in my view considerable scope to reduce our deficit with the USA by increased and sustained attention to that market.  For example, I have noted the considerable success of CTT's strategy for the development of the UK market in recent years and I am confident that a similar effort will succeed in relation to the USA.  I have, accordingly, asked CTT, in consultation with my Department, to develop a detailed medium term, three-five years, strategy for the US market covering sectors, companies, regions and promotional events. I intend that this intensified US strategy will commence in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total trade between Ireland and South America decreased by 3.6 per cent in 1987, increased by 9.1 per cent in 1988 and decreased by 0.7 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.  Exports to South America improved by 6.8 per cent in <Col N="57" /> 1987, and decreased by 15.4 per cent in 1988.  Exports for the first ten months of 1989 are showing a decrease of almost 16.9 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1988.  Imports from South America decreased by 18.2 per cent in 1987, increased by 45.4 per cent in 1988 and by 12.2 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.</P>
    <P>Ireland had a trade surplus with South America in 1986.  This surplus grew by 201 per cent in 1987.  The trade balance went into deficit in 1988, a change of 163 per cent.  This deficit increased by 141 per cent in the first ten months of 1989.</P>
    <P>The political instability and economic difficulties experienced by many South American countries are well documented. These difficulties together with the distance to the marketplace have naturally tended to depress trade with South America generally.  I do not expect that South America will be a significant focus for our trade efforts in the coming year. <Col N="58" /> On the other hand, as some South American countries have immense economic potential, I will ensure that developments there are kept constantly under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has studied the recent changes in the car insurance market covering young drivers; and if he has taken any steps to prevent an increase in the premia chargeable to such drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some motor insurance companies are tending to be more selective in the type of risk for which they are prepared to quote. This more selective approach tends to apply to new business rather than to existing policyholders.  While I sympathise with the situation of young drivers, statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents, and, therefore, to cause claims.  Nonetheless my information is that a number of companies are continuing to offer insurance cover to young drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years insurers have suffered large underwriting losses on their motor accounts.  In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million, these losses have increased from £32 million in 1987.  The claims experience of underwriters is worsening largely because of an increase in the number of claims. Faced with losses of this magnitude insurers have had no option but to adjust <Col N="59" /> their premiums and to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience. There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any manner or at any particular level of premium.</P>
    <P>Cases of inability to get motor insurance cover can be dealt with under the declined cases agreement.  This is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The declined cases committee, established under the agreement, examines cases referred to it by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.  Let me assure the Deputy that the Government are committed to improving the environment for motor insurance and it is my intention to ensure that should the claims experience of underwriters of motor insurance improve, whether on foot of the Courts Act 1988 or any other Government initiatives, appropriate benefits will be passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Current Government policy in relation to the provision by the State of industrial land and buildings is to intervene only where private sector finance is not forthcoming or is inadequate and where State investment is likely to yield significant beneficial results.  The strategy, therefore, involves a two-pronged approach which seeks to maximise the private sector input, while complementing this, where necessary, with State support in essential areas.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall programme for industrial development which has been submitted for EC Structural Fund support it is envisaged that £106.8 million will be spent on eligible building activities over the five year period 1989-1993 towards which ERDF support of £32.04 million is anticipated.</P>
      <P>One of the aims of national development policy is to promote and foster local economic initiatives by encouraging local development of facilities and job creation opportunities.  Support is primarily provided by FÁS through its various support programmes &mdash; community enterprise programme, the enterprise scheme and the enterprise training programme.  In addition, grant support of up to 45 per cent is available from the industrial promotion agencies towards the cost of providing community-owned enterprise centres in areas of high long-term unemployment where the provision of advance factory space by the State or private investment is not at present a reality. Support will only be provided in areas where there is evidence of demand for such space and of the ability of local people to manage and run the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980, provides for the control and regulation of casual trading and for connected matters. Section 2 of the Casual Trading Act, 1980 sets out what constitutes casual trading. In addition it also states what does not constitute casual trading.  I am aware that the exclusions provided for in section 2 in respect of the selling of agricultural and horticultural produce by the producer thereof or their servants or agents acting as such and the selling of fish by the person by whom, or a member of the crew of the boat from which they were <Col N="64" /> caught, have given rise to some difficulties in the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the legislation has been in force for some time and that difficulties have arisen in its implementation I have decided that a review of the Casual Trading Act, 1980, should be undertaken.  The question of the removal of the exclusions provided for in section 2 will be considered as part of this review.</P>
    <P>In so far as the trading in the vicinity of the Dublin Corporation fruit market is concerned, if the traders are farmers or market gardeners selling their own produce they are not required to have casual trading licences or to trade in designated areas.  I have no plans to introduce regulations to prohibit this type of trading at present.  As I have already stated a full review of the Act will be carried out by my Department and I will await the outcome of this review before proposing any changes in the legislation. The local authorities and the Garda Síochána, who look after the enforcement of the Act, will be consulted as part of this review to establish their views on the operation of the Act.</P>

CCT provides assistance to exporters and by way of trade information, overseas promotion and marketplace services. The services are supplied through CTT offices at home and abroad and through a network of trade correspondents in the relevant markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> In relation to the specific regions referred to by the Deputy, the position is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Middle East</i>
    </P>
    <P>CCT maintains an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and employs the services of trade consultants in Jordan, Lebanon, Israeli, Kuwait, Algeria and Cyprus.  In addition, CTT head office staff travel on specific projects to markets such as Iraq, Iran the United Arab Emirates and Libya.  CTT's investment in Middle East markets is commensurate with market opportunities and with the commercial interests of Irish exporters of goods and services.</P>
    <P>Over 100 Irish exporters availed of CTT services in Middle Eastern markets both in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central/Eastern Europe</i>
    </P>
    <P>By Central Europe I am taking it that the Deputy means Austria and Switzerland i.e. those countries not in the EC nor in Eastern Europe.  These countries are covered by the CTT office in Dusseldorf and CTT also engages trade consultant in Switzerland.  110 Irish exporters availed of services in 1987 and 70 in 1988.</P>
    <P>By Eastern Europe I take it that the Deputy means Poland, Hungary, USSR, Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany Czechoslovakia, Albania and Yugoslavia. CTT maintains an office in Moscow and employs the services of trade consultants in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</P>
    <P>Approximately 50 Irish exporters of goods and services availed of CTT assistance in Eastern European markets during each of the years 1987-1988.</P>
    <P>
      <i>United States</i>
    </P>
    <P>CTT provide assistance to Irish exporters through offices based in New York and in Chicago and through trade consultants based in Boston, Atlanta and San Francisco.</P>
    <P>Over 650 exporters were assisted in 1987.  Approximately 600 exporters were assisted in the US during 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Latin America</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> CTT provide services to a very small number of Irish exporters to Latin America through its head office, its New York office, through the Irish Embassy in Argentina and through a trade consultant in Ecuador.</P>
    <P>During the two-year period 1987-1988, less than ten requests for assistance were received in relation to this market region.</P>
    <P>Further details in respect of the issues raised by the Deputy is contained in the Annual Review and Outlook for 1988-89, as published by Córas Tráchtála, a copy of which I will forward to him.</P>

These set out respectively the requirements relating to toxicity and cellulosic content of toys, the toxicity levels of pencils and other graphic instruments and prohibit the sale of nonfood products resembling food, such as erasers which look and smell like sweets.</P>
      <P>From 1 January 1990 Ireland, in common with the other member states of the Community is required to introduce regulations implementing the Toy Safety Directive.  This will increase the level of safety of toys on the Irish market.  Regulations translating the Directive into Irish legislation will be made shortly.  The effect of these regulations will be that in order to show that toys meet the safety requirements of the Directive, they will have to carry a CE (i.e. European Community) mark when placed on the market after 1 January 1990.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for inspections and prosecutions under the IRS Act, 1961, has been delegated to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade since January 1988.  At the request of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, surveys were carried out in 1986 and 1987 on toys and Christmas tree lights prior to the Christmas period.  At my request a similar survey is under way at present. When an unsafe toy is discoverd, it has been the practice to seek the assistance to the retailer or wholesaler involved in having the toy removed from the market. Court proceedings are only initiated as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Detailed statistics on toy shops inspected are not readily available for each of the last five years.  However, the number of prosecutions instituted in those years is as follows:</P>

      <P>I did receive a request from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment to consider the setting up of a prices advisory committee to examine coal and coalite prices in Dublin.</P>
      <P>At this stage I am not convinced of the case to establish a prices advisory committee which would be a step towards price control.  It would be likely to take quite a time for a prices advisory committee to complete an investigation and furnish a report.  Action by means of such a committee would therefore be unlikely to deliver results sufficiently quickly, particularly as we are now in the winter heating season.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, price control generally lapsed in early 1986 and reestablishment of the formal price control mechanism is something I want to avoid. It discourages competition.  It serves to establish what often are effectively minimum rather than maximum prices.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I decided instead to request the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to look urgently into the price structure of coalite as compared to coal.  I expect his report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the British Government proposes to include in the 1991 census a question on ethnic origin; that representatives of the Irish community in Britain have requested that Irish be included as a separate distinct ethnic category in the census form; that the British Commission for Racial Equality supports the case put forward by the Irish community; if he or the Government have raised this matter with the British authorities; if not, if he will have the matter raised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question on ethnicity that will feature in the 1991 British census has evolved from tests carried out before the 1981 census and more recently in a series of tests carried out in 1985 and 1986. While the exact wording of the question on ethnic origin has not yet become law it is likely to seek ethnic breakdown among the following categories: White, Black Caribbean, Black African, Black Other, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and Any Other Ethnic Group.  It is not envisaged that any further breakdown of the &ldquo;White&rdquo; category will be sought in the census or that &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; should feature on the census form as a separate category. The census will, however, continue to include a question on country of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are aware of the fact that a number of Irish groups in Britain as well as the British Commission for Racial Equality have supported the inclusion of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; as a separate category in the ethnic question in the census.  The Government are aware also that there <Col N="76" /> are differing views within the Irish community on this issue.</P>
    <P>We understand that the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, with whom the embassy in London has been in contact, have had a number of representations on this matters from among the Irish community in Britain but that they have since confirmed that the relevant regulations, which will issue shortly, will not specify &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; as one of the categories in the ethnic group question. They have, however, indicated, in response to these representations, that it may be possible to develop this matter further after the 1991 census.  They have also drawn attention to the potential value of the country of birth information which will continue, as previously, to be sought in the census.</P>
    <P>Our embassy in London will maintain contact with the Federation of Irish Societies and with other Irish groups in Britain on this issue.</P>

      <P>The USA and the USSR have the largest arrears in respect of UN peace-keeping.  I avail of every suitable occasion to raise with their representatives the desirability of paying these arrears at an early date and this point has been made to them many times.  I have also discussed the question with the UN Secretary General who is, of course, concerned about the financial situation of peace-keeping forces.</P>
      <P>Both the USA and the USSR have stated their intention to pay their assessed contributions to UNIFIL in full and to repay the amounts they owe over a number of years.  The amount due to Ireland in respect of UN peace-keeping operations now stands at £18.2 million, of which £17.5 million relates to UNIFIL and £0.7 million to UNFICYP.  We expect a considerable reduction in the UNIFIL deficit as these arrears are paid.</P>

      <P>Economic growth may be defined as growth in any gross domestic product, gross national product or, of course, gross national disposable income. A detailed statement of the constituent elements of each is incorporated each year in the Central Statistics Office publication &ldquo;National Income and Expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In layman's terms gross domestic product, GDP, is a measure of the total income derived from output within the economy &mdash; but without regard to the ultimate ownership of that income.</P>
      <P>Gross national product, GNP, is a measure of the total income derived by Irish-resident entities, individuals and corporations, from output &mdash; but without regard to the location of the output. Unlike GDP, it includes trading and investment income payable to Irish-resident entities from overseas output, and excludes trading and investment income payable out of Irish output to foreign resident entities.</P>
      <P>Gross national disposable income, GNDI, is a measure of the total income at the disposal of Irish-resident entities. It differs from GNP by including current transfers to Irish resident entities from abroad, and excluding current transfers to foreign resident entities from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each concept, when expressed in real terms, is a valid measure of economic <Col N="84" /> growth, of course, subject to the obvious difficulties of compilation.  Which represents &ldquo;true&rdquo; growth depends on the concept of &ldquo;economic growth&rdquo; relevant to the issue at hand.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out annual volume change in GDP and GNP from 1984 to 1988 as published by the Central Statistics Office, average of output-based and expenditure-based estimates; and the forecasts for 1989 published by my Department in <i>Economic Review and Outlook,</i> expenditure-based estimates. For completeness, the table includes the Central Statistics Office' estimates of annual volume change in GNDI, from 1984 to 1988.</P>

At the end of January 1989 the value of the cheques remaining unpaid was £3,100,000.  Since January 1989 the pursuit of amounts outstanding in these cases has been integrated with the Collector-General's ongoing collection and enforcement activities.  While overall pursuit has been vigorous through 1989, separate information on its particular <Col N="85" /> impact on the cases in question is not available.</P>
      <P>The value of cheques which were unpaid only marginally affected the outcome of the amnesty as is illustrated by the fact that the total amount of revenue received on foot of the amnesty and related factors was £497 million.</P>

      <P>The EC Common Market organisation which was agreed from 1 January 1983, contains provision for a market intervention system for fishing.  While the system is similar in operation to those in the agriculture sector, the main difference is that due to the perishable nature of the products, there is no storage of the fish, that is disposal takes place immediately after withdrawal from the market.  Irish fishermen benefit from the measure to the tune of approximately IR£800,000 per year.</P>

      <P>While my Department have no direct function in relation to the provision of processing plants, they do, of course, keep in close touch with the other agencies concerned to ensure that all possibilities for economically processing fish are fully examined.  A number of possibilities for additional fish processing in the south-west are currently under review and the situation in relation to herring processing will be kept in mind in this context.</P>
      <P>The current situation regarding herring fillets is due, I am informed, to marketing conditions being weak due to heavy supplies being available, both at home and abroad especially from Scandinavian sources.  However, there are now I understand some signs of improvement in the market for herring in Western Europe as the volume of landings generally eases.</P>

      <P>Córas Tráchtála, which is the agency charged by the Government with the promotion of Irish exports, maintains a network of 20 offices in Ireland's major markets throughout the world.  In addition, this network is expanded by the employment of over 30 trade consultants in secondary and tertiary markets.  CTT also maintains specialist technical and information units at its head office in order to identify opportunities relevant to the capabilities of Irish exporters of goods and services.</P>
      <P>The establishment of new export markets for Ireland is of great importance. Nevertheless, the defence and further enhancement of existing export markets aimed at strengthening and increasing market share is critical to the maintenance of long-term, broad-based and profitable export operations.</P>
      <P>During the past six months, Córas Tráchtála has developed specific programmes under their regional development programme in order to improve the access and success rate of Irish exporters into selected areas in continental European markets.  This followed a similar export offensive into Britain during the preceding two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this programme, CTT had targeted growth regions in Europe for the establishment of linkages between Irish and continental SMEs.  Projects are now running in the Lombardy region of Italy and in the Catalonia region of Spain. These areas are the strongest and most rapidly growing regions in their respective countries.  The objective is to avoid diluting scarce national and company promotional resources and support services over a wide geographical area. <Col N="99" /> These are then concentrated in those areas which show the greatest potential. Though too early to produce firm results, the response from Irish manufacturers and their potential European partners has been excellent.  For 1990, it is proposed to expand the programme to Germany and into France.</P>
    <P>Marketing alliances are also being developed with Danish and North American SMEs.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the rate of contact between European industrial buyers and relevant Irish suppliers, a source Ireland programme commenced in 1989 in Britain and Germany.  The programme highlights specific product sectors of Irish industry &mdash; electronics, engineering and pharmaceuticals &mdash; through the medium of advertising campaigns, trade fair participation and direct mail.</P>
    <P>Increased export potential has also been identified in the US and Eastern European markets and further details of plans in these areas are being given by me today in response to questions specifically dealing with these regions.</P>
    <P>On a general level, Córas Tráchtála provides market information, market development, design, group promotion and other support services to Irish exporters anxious to develop overseas markets.  In addition, limited financial assistance is available to indigenous exporters in support of agreed marketing plans.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to expand the role of Córas Tráchtála.  Neither is there any question of establishing further export promotion bodies.</P>

      <P>Details relating to import substitution are not compiled by reference to geographical areas of the kind listed by the Deputy and to undertake to do so, for the purposes of the question, would not be justified in view of the time and cost involved.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council, however, which has a primary role in the import substitution area, has identified new business secured by Irish firms, in the way of import substitution generally, amounting to £130 million over the period 1987-88. The council expects further new sales of £81 million to be secured in 1989 and has targeted further sales of £250 million over the next three years.  The bulk of this business would previously have been serviced from abroad and as such it represents a significant gain by Irish firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 additional resources were provided to the Irish Goods Council to enable it to further intensify its efforts in this area.  Under the council's new marketing development programme Irish firms will be assisted to develop a new level of competence and professionalism <Col N="101" /> in the marketing area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The only significant currency movement against the Irish pound in recent weeks has come from the weakening of sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> In so far as exports are concerned I am not aware that the fall in the value of sterling has created any serious problems for Irish exporters generally.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of Irish firms exporting to the UK has improved considerably in recent years as a result of lower inflation, lower interest rates, improvements in productivity and reductions in some important costs to industry such as electricity and telecommunications. The Government's pursuit of sound economic policies aimed at fostering a more competitive environment for Irish business, and the availability of Córas Tráchtála's marketing support services, are, in my view, the most effective ways in which the Government can assist exporters to compete in overseas markets.</P>
    <P>As regards imports, the House will already be aware that I have taken steps to ensure that recent favourable developments in the exchange rate between the Irish pound and sterling are realised in lower prices for Irish consumers.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would refer Deputies to a Press release issued by the Government Information Services on 24 November 1989, which indicated that I had been informed of a range of price reductions which had occurred recently because of the strengthening Irish pound relative to sterling.  Other reductions are expected in the near future.  On this basis, I am satisfied that there is no need for the introduction of statutory price controls, for as long as the thrust of normal competition in the market leads to appropriate levels of price reductions for the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to complete an investigation into the impact of the changing exchange rate on prices.  The results of this study will enable me to assess whether the range and extent of reductions taking place fairly reflect the favourable exchange rate movements.  I expect to have the results of this study in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary results of the labour force survey recently published by the CSO showed a growth of 6,000 in manufacturing employment in the year to April 1989.  This, together with increases in excess of 1,000 in commerce, insurance and finance and in excess of 2,000 in transport, communication and storage, indicates a strong growth in self-sustaining jobs.</P>
      <P>The decline in total employment shown by the survey is primarily due to declines in public sector employment, in numbers in employment schemes and in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>I believe that the fundamental policy of the Government in relation to the generation of employment is correct.  This involves building competitive strengths in the economy so that sustained growth can be achieved in output and in jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial costs and interest rates are <Col N="105" /> kept under control and the benefits of corrections in the public finances will flow through reductions in personal taxation. All of these steps support the momentum of job creation.</P>
    <P>Industrial policy promotes the development of strong, internationally trading companies here with an increasing emphasis on the management, marketing and innovative resources necessary to achieve this.  A wide range of development supports are available for this purpose and will be supported under the enlarged EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Modifications to industrial policy will take place as they prove to be necessary or desirable and my Department is at present undertaking a review of industrial performance under the Industrial Development Act, 1986 which will take such factors into account.</P>

      <P>Irish energy policy is based on exploiting secure, economic and diverse energy sources.  The diversification of fuel requirements in all sectors, including the transport sector, is of great importance and in this light I consider LPG has a role to play in the Irish scene.  The scale of future LPG activity as a motor fuel depends on the industry's ability to win customers on the basis of the relative attractiveness of its product.  It is only on this basis that LPG can continue to be a viable fuel for the transport sector.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the environmental benefits of LPG as a motor fuel and successive Ministers for Energy have highlighted these factors and supported the LPG's industry's own similar view, at seminars organised by the industry.

As the rate of means <Col N="115" /> assessed against him from a previous assessment, £51.28 per week, derived from the profit from his holding, exceeded the rate payable in his case, he was not entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>He appealed the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer on 22 September also assessed him with means of £51.28 per week.  The facts regarding the purchase of the animal referred to were known to the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>He completed a further application on 13 October and this claim was also disallowed by a deciding officer on 7 November on the basis that the rate of means assessed against him exceeded the rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.</P>
      <P>As a smallholder, his means are calculated by reference to the normal annual net income accruing to him from his holding.

      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous <Col N="117" /> Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1988, &mdash; S.I. No. 263 of 1988 &mdash; which came into effect on 13 October 1988 gave entitlement to old age (contributory) pension on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis to certain persons who failed to qualify for pension because of gaps in their insurance records prior to April 1974. These gaps occurred because, prior to April 1974, social insurance coverage for non-manual workers applied only if their earnings were below a certain limit.  This limit was increased from time to time and, as a result, some persons found themselves being intermittently in and out of insurance, thus causing gaps in their insurance records.  These gaps affected entitlement to old age (contributory) pension for which a minimum average of 20 contributions since the date of entry to insurance is required and in some cases, as a result of the gaps, people failed to qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>The provisions do not apply to persons such as employees of semi-State companies who in the course of their working lifetime move from full to modified insurance and, as a result, fail to qualify for the old age contributory pension due to gaps in their social insurance records in respect of that pension, which occurred while they were insured at the modified rate.  This is an ongoing feature of the social insurance system.  The question of pension coverage for persons in this sitution is being examined by the National Pensions Board as part of their review of pension provisions generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is satisfied with the rules and regulations obtaining where prisoners are being given early release due to the fact that prisons are over-crowded; and if he is satisfied that due care and consideration is given in order that persons who have only recently been sentenced for very serious offences, including attacks on individuals, are not released before at least a certain amount of their sentence has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Rules made under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 provide for the temporary release of prisoners and I am not aware of any difficulty to which these rules give rise.</P>
      <P>Each case being considered for release is carefully assessed with particular regard to the nature of the offence, the length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody, previous criminal history and the Garda view of the likely threat to the community which a particular release might involve.  All releases are made subject to conditions and a person in breach of these is liable to rearrest and return to custody.  The Deputy will appreciate that pressure on accommodation is only one of a number of factors which may give rise to temporary release of prisoners.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment, with regard to the bridge across the main Dublin to Belfast railway line, beside Baldoyle Industrial Estate, Grange Road, Baldoyle, Dublin 13, if (a) he has received a proposal from Dublin County Council to widen this bridge, (b) if Iarnród Éireann have requested his Department to make finance available to have the bridge widened and (c) if it is the intention of his Department to make finance available and to instruct Dublin County Council and Iarnród Éireann to carry out widening of this bridge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In June 1984, Dublin County Council submitted proposals to my Department for the provision of a new link road between Grange Road, Donaghmede and the railway bridge at Baldoyle, together with the widening of the railway bridge and the improvement of Grange Road, Baldoyle.  The road/bridge are not located on a national road.  The local authority was informed at the time that special Exchequer finances would not be provided for the scheme and that the cost of the works would fall to be financed from the local authority's own resources.</P>
      <P>Following the revision of the Dublin city boundary in 1986, the Grange Abbey estate was transferred to the functional area of Dublin Corporation.  On 1 March 1988, the corporation submitted to the Department outline proposals for road improvement works including the provision of a new bridge at Baldoyle to be located partly in the city area and partly in the county area.</P>
      <P>The Department have had no communication from Iarnród Éireann in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The local authorities may, at their discretion, use the block grant for roads paid annually by the Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources on such works.  Block grants totalling £3.969 million were recently notified to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation for 1990.</P>
    <P>Because of competing demands for other important road schemes in the country, I do not propose to make special road grant assistance available to the local authorities in this case.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3322/88 of 14 October 1988 is binding in its entirety on each member state of the Community and its provisions are directly applicable in Ireland.  The Regulation implements the Community's obligations under the Protocol to control production and consumption within the Community of controlled substances.  As there are no producers of the controlled substances in Ireland, the provisions of the Regulation controlling production are not directly relevant here.  As regards consumption, the Regulation prohibits imports into the EC of the controlled CFCs unless the importer has been granted a quota by the European Commission and holds an import licence.

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989, which came into force on 13 November, the function of issuing of certificates of fitness, required for the purposes of a driving licence, has been, effectively, devolved to local authorities.  Henceforth, those over 70 years of age need only submit a medical report, on the statutory form, direct to the local authority together with the application for a driving licence.  This is the only additional requirement for those over 70 years compared with younger applicants.</P>
      <P>The time taken to process applications varies as between local authorities but should normally take a matter of days only.  However, because of the changes connected with the new regulations, including the introduction of the new Euro-model driving licence, some delays may be experienced for a limited period.</P>

The question of considering an extension of recognition to any other body acting on behalf of medical personnel would depend on the body concerned successfully obtaining a negotiating licence or being registered as an excepted body under the terms of the <Col N="142" /> Trade Union Acts, 1941 to 1971 or being admitted to the local authority and health services conciliation and arbitration scheme as a recognised staff association.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided that these funds should be used for the benefit of former employees, pensioners and others, of Hospital Trust (1940) Limited. The preparation of the necessary legislation to allow this is in hand and will be processed with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the development of health services in the Cork city area is primarily a matter for the Southern Health Board.  I have written to the Chairman of the Southern Health Board and the Boards of the Mercy and South Infirmary-Victoria Hospitals proposing that a working group be established to prepare a plan for the development of hospital services in Cork city and county for the next decade.  The question of providing additional funding for the Mercy Hospital, Cork will be examined in the light of the 1990 health allocations.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to announce recently that the Government has made an additional £300,000 available to the health board orthodontic service, which has permitted orthodontic treatment to begin immediately on 500 top priority cases drawn from the eight health boards.  I am aware that there is a need to provide further additional funds for the health board dental <Col N="147" /> services.  I would hope to be in a position to make some additional resources available as soon as possible in order to bring about an improvement in the health board dental service, including the orthodontic service.</P>

As a result each year all children in second and in sixth standards will be examined for dental defects and will be treated if necessary.  For children who are pupils of primary schools which are not national schools it is a matter for the school governors to make application to the health board which has discretion with regard to the provision of child health services including dental services for these children.</P>

      <P>At present some 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and therefore receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioner services entirely free of charge.  Significant ongoing medical expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that my experience with Cheeverstown in the past year has been a personal disappointment.  The Cheeverstown complex was built at a cost of £8 million to play a central role in meeting an acute need for up to date provision for handicapped children and adults in the Dublin region, an area which is generally accepted to have special problems at the present time.  The revenue funding of this centre is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board, which have the statutory obligation of ensuring that there is an adequate and properly managed service for the people of their area and for seeing to it that these services are dispensed in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board have an obligation to be satisfied about the manner of operation of the agencies they fund and their contribution towards meeting the priority needs of the people on their waiting lists for residential and day places.  The health <Col N="153" /> board expressed themselves as dissatisfied in this regard with Cheeverstown.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the disagreement between the board of Cheeverstown and the health board in an attempt to reach an accommodation between the two parties which would allow for due progress with the development of the badly needed facilities.  I emphasised from the outset that I was not coming down in favour of the case made by either side.</P>
    <P>My sole concern was to ensure that the resources allocated to Cheeverstown should be made available to those handicapped people, and their hard pressed families, who needed them.</P>
    <P>After a series of meetings and negotiations with all the parties involved, I eventually devised a formula aimed at the establishment of an interim board for Cheeverstown representative of the existing Cheeverstown board, the Eastern Health Board, the voluntary sector and parents' representatives under the chairmanship of former Garda Commissioner, Eamonn Doherty.  The constitution of this interim committee was such as to ensure that no one party had a predominating voice.  The prospect in view was that by working together in pursuance of a common aim of service to the handicapped and the full utilisation of Cheeverstown, a spirit of understanding and trust would develop which would enable the old Cheeverstown board to resume control after a year or two in an atmosphere which ensured good relations with the health board.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, my formula was not implemented.  The old Cheeverstown board retained the running of the affairs of the centre and have refused to accept my further suggestion for an impartial board which would have been representative of the main voluntary organisations in Dublin, together with representatives from Cheeverstown and the health board.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in my dissatisfaction with this state of affairs.  Three members of the Cheeverstown board have already resigned in protest at the recalcitrance of their chairman and other members, and <Col N="154" /> the representatives of the parents who are so anxious to see places opened for their children have also voiced their discontent with the attitude of the Cheeverstown board.</P>
    <P>In short, given the identified need for places in residential accommodation I cannot any longer tolerate a situation in which there are 60 such places unused in Cheeverstown.  I have taken steps to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>Up to 1985 separate programmes of financial assistance were in operation to assist university students and students in teacher training colleges.  The financial programmes in question are (a) the higher education grants scheme and (b) the colleges of education grants scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the 1984 higher education grants scheme, a higher education grant, for either undergraduate or post-graduate courses cannot be made available to a person who has been a student in the teacher training college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from the 1985-86 academic <Col N="162" /> year, the number of courses recognised for higher education grants purposes was extended to include courses in primary teacher training colleges.

      <P>In the case of St. Anne's Convent N.S. there were 228 pupils enrolled on the 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus six assistants for the current school year, 1989/90.  The school also has the services of a full time remedial teacher, two special class teachers and five special class teachers for intinerant children.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements for national schools are in the case of developing schools or where a school would be in breach of the guidelines on maximum class sizes laid down by my Department.  St. Anne's does not qualify under either exception, therefore the appointment of an additional assistant is not warranted.</P>
      <P>The staffing of the school for the 1990-91 school year will be determined by the enrolment in the school on the 30 September 1989.  A new staffing schedule will come into effect on 1 September 1990 which will improve to pupil/teacher ratio in the school from that date.</P>

New applicants for such licences will be examined by officials of my Department and, if successful in the examination, will be issued with a licence <Col N="170" /> endorsed with a rating showing the particular class or classes of aircraft on which they are licensed to work.</P>
    <P>The proposal to facilitate the achievement of approved status by aircraft maintenance organisations is in line with established international practice and follows on recommendations made by the consultants, Price Waterhouse, who reviewed the Air Navigation Services Office of my Department in 1986.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that there is no question of any diminution in safety standards as a result of these proposals.</P>
