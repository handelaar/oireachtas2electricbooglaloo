      <P>In page 5, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`solvency certificate' means a certificate issued by the Minister to an undertaking attesting its compliance with the solvency requirements specified in the Regulations of 1976 or the Regulations of 1984 as appropriate;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a definition of &ldquo;solvency certificate&rdquo; here is to clarify what is meant by the term &ldquo;solvency certificate&rdquo; in sections 7 and 12.  Section 7 provides <i>inter alia</i> for the charging of a fee for the issue of a solvency certificate. Section 12 provides that the Minister may make regulations governing the procedure, conditions and forms to be involved in the issue of a solvency certificate. The 1976 non-life regulations and the 1984 life regulations set out solvency requirements for the non-life and life companies respectively.  As the Irish supervisory authority, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible <Col N="1076" /> for monitoring the solvency of companies with their head office in Ireland.  Such companies would require a certificate of solvency if they wished to apply to the supervisory authority of another State to establish a head office there.</P>

From the point of view of codification of law it is undesirable to make fundamental changes by regulation in that those who wish to consult the insurance law have to refer both to a lengthy publication of regulations as well as to the relevant statutes.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  These amendments concern fines and jail sentences which may be imposed under section 3 of the Bill.  In the case of financial offences, frequently the people concerned are relatively well off so the use of fines is a much more appropriate method than the use of a jail sentence in that it hurts the people in their pocket, where they have been seeking to hurt others.  The imposition of a fine does not cost the Exchequer money which can be used for better insurance supervision among other things.  Conversly the use of a jail sentence costs the Exchequer a substantial amount of money and provides free accommodation for the people concerned for six months and does not necessarily reduce the wealth or assets of the people concerned. My amendment seeks to increase the maximum fine from £1,000 to £3,000 in the case of summary proceedings and from £5,000 to £10,000 in the case of proceedings on indictment.  In order to indicate that the imposition of fines is the direction in which the House would wish to go I propose commensurately reducing the prison sentences so that the total penal effect is the same but the emphasis as between fines and imprisonment is changed.  That is a desirable improvement to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 6 is to ensure that in the imposition of fines the judge would take account of ability to pay.  If a body corporate commits the offence, a body corporate cannot be sent to jail.  If one is looking at this in a jurisprudential sense one must recognise that this Bill poses greater penalties on individuals than on bodies corporate in that it is only the financial penalties that bear on the body corporate whereas the financial and the prison penalties bear on individuals.  My amendment would allow the judge to impose a commensurately more severe financial penalty on a body corporate in view of its corporate status and its non <Col N="1078" /> liability to imprisonment.  That also is a desirable improvement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the case of crimes generally but particularly with regard to financial crimes one must have regard to ability to pay.  A fine of £500 on somebody on low income or on social welfare is one thing but the same fine on a millionaire is only petty cash.  There is a reasonable case for requiring the judge in setting a level of penalty to take account of ability to pay so that the penal effect would be equivalent at different levels of income and wealth.  That is not a revolutionary or a new idea.  It is not even Left wing.  It just relates to the fair treatment of individuals.</P>

That is the essential pragmatism that informs the views of the Fine Gael Party in matters of this kind. Perhaps there are other parties who are similarly endowed.  I make these proposals in the hope that the Minister, who has shown himself to be receptive in other legislation, will accept these amendments and we can go on to the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr Cullen Mr Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this section I came to the conclusion that it comes down to a matter of choice and on balance the greater the fine the greater is the deterrent.  There is some merit in imposing fines in dealing with financial matters.  Nowadays the sums of money that can be involved can be quite large and if the deterrent is not sufficient there is less reason for a person not to behave wrongly.  On the question of prison sentences there is no need to reduce the terms suggested in the Bill because the terms there are limited.  It is a matter of discretion for the judge whether he imposes a sentence of one, two or three months or whatever.  The terms of imprisonment suggested are sufficient.  If we <Col N="1079" /> reduce the terms of imprisonment I do not think we will be doing anything substantial. The higher the possibility of suffering for committing a crime the greater the deterrent for not doing so.  I have an open mind on the fines and I support the increases proposed by Deputy Bruton in his amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the financial services area is an area of tremendous fraud and criminal activity and fines of £1,000, £5,000 or £10,000 are meaningless. They are the same as a £5 note to someone in that area earning a wage packet.  If there is criminal activity in that area we are talking of sums of hundreds of thousands of pounds and maybe even millions of pounds and I do not think increasing the fine from £5,000 to £10,000 will make the slightest difference. However, a jail sentence is a deterrent to committing crime.  A term in jail puts the real stamp on what is happening &mdash; it is a criminal act.  The criminality aspect must be emphasised and I would not support a reduction in the prison term under any circumstances.  I agree with Deputy Cullen that we should by all means increase the fine.  As it is, it is a maximum term which probably will be seldom imposed in court and perhaps some minimum term should be provided for also.  I would oppose any reduction in the prison term as proposed in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to Deputy Cullen and Deputy Mac Giolla who criticised the suggestion I made for reducing the terms of imprisonment.  My purpose in drafting the amendments as I did was to have the same penal effect as had been agreed by the Seanad and to shift the balance from jail sentences to fines.  Obviously if that was to be achieved, there had to be both a reduction in the prison term as well as an increase in the fines.  I take Deputy Mac Giolla's point on board, that going to jail emphasises the criminality aspect for some people more so than paying a large fine, however large it might be.  I think I have <Col N="1080" /> taken account of that point by referring to the need to relate fines to ability to pay so that the wealthier people are, the more fines they will pay.  Also, we should bear in mind that prison terms cost the State and the taxpayers money whereas fines get money for the State and the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Bruton's suggested amendments in regard to fines, I should point out to him that under the Constitution the District Court is the court of summary jurisdiction.  The proposal to increase the fine in section 3 (2) (a) to £3,000 as suggested by the Deputy would put such fines beyond the meaning of summary and, therefore, outside the ambit of the District Court.  The figure of £1,000 in section 3 (2) (a) at present is within the top end of the range of fines which can be imposed by the District Court and is the norm.  I am aware that section 43 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1914, requires the District Court among other things to take into consideration in fixing the amount of fine the means of an offender and I imagine the District Court would probably do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposed new paragraph 3 (2) (c) has very wide implications for fines provided under legislation and could best be dealt with in the context of the Administration of Justice Act, 1914.  The ideas put forward by Deputy Bruton this morning are interesting but are matters probably for other general legal policy legislation and perhaps not suitable to be decided under this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that companies cannot go to jail and so on.  I would refer the Deputy to section 3 (3) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and the offence is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body or any person who was purporting to act in such capacity, he, as well as the body, shall be guilty <Col N="1081" /> of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one can get behind the company and individuals can end up in prison. As a general rule there has been a move internationally to submit financial crime to prison sentences and, as one can see by what has happened recently, that is certainly the case in the USA.</P>
    <P>I believe the balance we have is the correct one and particularly for the technical reasons mentioned in regard to the District Court and so on I could not accept the amendments as drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different thing. It is not what the Minister regards in the final analysis but what the House regards as the appropriate figure that counts.  As I understand it, the Minister was making <Col N="1082" /> what purported to be a technical objection to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 by suggesting that they were impossible to give effect to because they would be breaking certain District Court limits and a case would have to be heard other than in the District Court.  If I do not misunderstand the Minister and Deputy Taylor who has much experience in the matter, that objection does not really exist now in that it is possible to impose a maximum fine of £3,000 and still have a case dealt with in the District Court.  If that is so then we should proceed on that basis.</P>
      <P>It would appear that I do not have the support of two of the other Opposition parties for my proposals to reduce the jail sentences but that I have support for the proposals to increase the fines and reluctantly, therefore I will modify my stance in order to get support for what I want to do.  I would be inclined to press amendments Nos. 2 and 4 and I would ask the other Opposition parties to look at amendment No. 5 again.  Just because the proceedings are on indictment, two years in jail is still a long time and perhaps we could agree to reduce the sentence to two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister was somewhat ambiguous in dealing with amendment No. 6. He said that the 1914 Act covered this but then he said my amendment would be a very radical change.  It cannot be both: it is either covered already, in which case it is not a change, or it is not.  I do not accept the argument that we should not have a different procedure in regard to insurance legislation as to how fines should be settled.  It is for the House to look at each area of action it is dealing with.  I think it is fair to say that if it is, for example, a fine for personal injury it is probably not unreasonable that basically the fine should be the same across the board in the sense that it is not a financial offence and people should suffer more or less similarly for it.  One could make that argument, and I am not making it particularly, but certainly in the financial area there is a case for proportionality of sacrifice because financial gain was the motive for the activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1083" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right to this extent when he says that the District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction but, as he subsequently correctly clarified, where fines are concerned no specific definition is given anywhere so far as I know as to any particular maxima the District Court may impose.  There may already be cases on the books in which fines in excess of £1,000 were imposed.  This may happen where penalty clauses are concerned, even under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>I would not have thought that a fine in excess of £1,000 should be ruled out on the basis that it would not be regarded as a summary penalty at this time.  When one takes modern values into account in the type of offence envisaged here, a fine of up to £3,000 is reasonable enough to be regarded as a summary one.  It is a matter for the House to fix the amount and if the House decides to accept the amendment so far as the increase in fines is concerned &mdash; and I hope that it will &mdash; I shall support it.  It would be perfectly legal, perfectly in order and in no way would detract from the correct and appropriate jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is quite right in saying that fines &mdash; indeed any penalty, but particularly fines &mdash; ought to be related to the means of the person who has to pay the fine.  This is a point that I have made in this House on many occasions. The Minister refers to the Act of 1914 under which a district justice is supposed to take into consideration the ability to pay but, by and large, in practice that does not happen.  Many district justices operate a rule of thumb according to the offence rather than take into consideration the means of the person concerned. For example, driving without insurance can bring a fine of £500 and that is that, irrespective of means, and very often the district justice does not want to know the means.  The amendments dealing with the increase in fines are reasonable and I support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Bruton's amendments is to reduce prison <Col N="1084" /> sentences on offences.  We can argue as between fines of £3,000 and £1,000.  Some offenders here could be insurance companies and for them the amount of the fine is probably neither here nor there.  It may matter to some offenders, but to many under this Bill the real deterrent is a prison sentence.  Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to reduce the prison sentence and increase the amount of fine.</P>

      <P>I see the point. However, the effect of the amendments on a prison sentence will be to reduce it. The import of the amendments taken together is to change the balance in favour of the money fine and away from the prison sentence.  Given the seriousness of the offences which could be committed here &mdash; we are talking about an industry which affects hundreds of thousands of people &mdash; these prison sentences are appropriate.  Also, they are maximum sentences.  The court has jurisdiction to impose lesser sentences if they feel, as Deputy Bruton does, that the sentences are too high.  With Deputy Bruton's amendments the balance is not correct. Because of the nature of financial crime today, one day in prison can be a very strong deterrent with regard to some senior executives in an insurance company, whereas in many cases the amount of money is not of significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The District Court has tended to operate &mdash; but I take Deputy Taylor's point of view as he is more experienced in this field than I am &mdash; on the imposition of fines of around £1,000 on summary conviction. My information is that the trend in the District Court is to stay at around that figure.  This is not the legislation on which to start pushing up the target in the District Court.  It would not make sense to try that change here.  We have the balance right as between prison sentences and fines.  I do not see any good reason for reducing the amount of time available to the court to send an offender <Col N="1085" /> to prison, particularly when you could be talking about very substantial financial offences.  You must take these amendments together because there is a balance in them.</P>

      <P>In order to simplify the debate, I wish to withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 5 and to continue with the debate on amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 6, which, as Deputy Taylor has correctly pointed out, are separate.</P>
      <P>The custom in the District Court requires the imposition of a fine of no greater than £1,000, but as this is new legislation the House is entitled to set the fine at any level that it wishes.  As a maximum fine, £3,000 is not unreasonable on summary conviction.  No substantive argument has been made by the Minister against amendment No. 4, nor has there been any convincing argument made by him against amendment No. 6, which requires a judge to take due account of ability to pay.  I hope that the Minister will agree to these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister puts it correctly when he says that there is a balance between the imprisonment and the fines.  What the section does is to give a discretion to the district justice to impose either a fine or imprisonment, or both.  In a suitable case district justices may impose both the fine and the imprisonment.  The fact that a maximum fine of £3,000 would be provided for would not affect the district justice's decision and cause him to impose a higher fine and not a term of imprisonment either, instead of or with the fine. The ideal is to give the maximum possible discretion to the court because the nature of the cases, the type of offences and the degree of culpability can be so wide and varied.  That is why the Oireachtas generally gives a wide discretion to the courts as to the manner of penalty prescribed.  I cannot see that there should be any great objection to increasing the maximum fine.  In a serious case, the fine procedure may not be used at all by the court, or may be applied in addition to a prison <Col N="1086" /> sentence.  Deputy Bruton has now withdrawn the amendment regarding proposed reductions in prison sentences, which was the correct thing to do.  I cannot see that any harm would be done by giving an increased discretion to the court to impose quite a substantial fine of up to £3,000, in addition to a prison sentence if that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I shall try to be helpful to the House on this matter.  However, I would need to be met at least halfway. I would be disposed to consider accepting amendment No. 4 &mdash; I would need assurances on this.  I would not be in a position to look too closely at amendment No. 2 because I am strongly advised by the Attorney General's office that this is not the legislation under which to move away from the trend in the District Court with regard to fines.  I am informed that the trend is around £1,000.  I would have little difficulty in accepting Deputy Bruton's amendment which would change the amount from £5,000 to £10,000.  I would make the point, however, that we are talking about an ordinary individual who might be an insurance agent and have a family to look after and who could be dragged into the District Court for some offence under this legislation.  It applies to an ordinary agent to the same extent as to a large company.  A fine of £1,000 could be quite meaningful.</P>

Will it be easy <Col N="1088" /> to discover who is really responsible?  A body corporate normally acts with corporate responsibility.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an attempt to get behind the body corporate in regard to offences committed under this legislation. The subsection is quite clear and refers to an offence by the body corporate which is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate. It is an important weapon to have in the Bill.  It may be quite obvious that a particular director was conniving or that the offence was committed with his consent. It would be a pity if we did not have the provision to deal with cases which can easily be proved.  There will always be difficult cases.</P>

      <P>This subsection is necessary and appropriate.  It may be that difficulties could arise with regard to proof but that would be a matter for the prosecution. If proofs were not available, that would be the end of the matter.  If evidence is available that a director, manager or secretary was actively involved in conniving in the offence, it is entirely appropriate that a prosecution should lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection refers to any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer.  It might be appropriate to add the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; as an additional category. The company might employ an agent who <Col N="1089" /> would not be an employee of the company but nevertheless act on behalf of the company.  If such a person was conniving in the commital of an offence under the Act, it would be appropriate to include that category.  The Minister might consider that suggestion for a later stage.</P>

      <P>It is a well established rule of legal interpretation that when a number of categories such as director, manager or secretary are set out and there is then a reference to another similar officer, the courts always interpret that to mean that the officer must be of a similar category to those named before. It would have to be a person of the category of director, manager or secretary. &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means company secretary, <Col N="1090" /> not office secretary.  It is the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule.  That being so, we need not have any concern that it would affect anybody very low down the scale in the insurance scene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the office-holder has been defined as holding an office that has been created by an Act of Parliament, a charter, a statutory regulation, the articles of association of a company or a body corporate and that only if the office was referred to in the articles of association of the company would it be an office in that sense.  Circumstances will arise in which a senior employee would be involved in the commission of an offence of this kind and he might not be an office-holder within the meaning of Deputy Taylor's definition or the one which I have just quoted from an authoritative work on the subject.  That could be a lacuna in the legislation.  If employees are engaged in activity on behalf of the company they should also be brought to book if the activity is criminal.  I wonder if the Minister should not consider extending the terminology to bring in all relevant people exercising responsibility within the company, directors, managers, secretaries, or within that category.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was worried earlier about people acting on orders and you would certainly get that from employees, probably legitimately.  I am not talking here about office-holders, I am talking about people who have a certain rank and authority similar to a director, manager or secretary.  That may vary from company to company but it should be obvious, when looking at a particular person's role in the firm, whether they have a similar type of rank, authority or clout in the firm as a director, manager or secretary.  It is the correct way to leave it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is to give the courts some latitude to decide what a <Col N="1091" /> similar office is.  The intention is pretty clear; we are talking about directors, managers, secretaries or people of similar authority, rank or clout in the firm.</P>

      <P>Why not say that?  The words are &ldquo;or other similar officer or body or any person who was purporting to act in such a capacity&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Purport&rdquo;, as I understand it, implies holding oneself out to act in such a capacity.  It could well be that people would not be holding themselves out to be or acting as directors, managers, or secretaries but who would still transact business in a fashion that would be criminal without reference to higher authority in respect of each individual act.  It would be better if one were to substitute for these words something like &ldquo;secretary or other similar officer of the body or any person who was acting in a responsible capacity with delegated authority&rdquo;.</P>

Could he really see the State locking up the secretary for a couple of years because the people at the top of the company did not fulfil their requirements to lodge certain documents? She may not have typed or posted it on the particular date or something like that.  That is not the intention behind this section; it is to tackle people who have a level of authority who should be able to comply.</P>

Is there no need to be more specific in regard to a specific category of people?  Where do they fit into the scale of things?

We are talking here about people who do not comply with the Insurance Acts and it is not practical to lay compliance with the Insurance Acts with the thousands of people who work in the insurance industry, unless they work in a very senior capacity where one would expect them to have the kind of authority and rank which would mean that they should have seen to it that the Act was complied with.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a brief point to make on this section.  In dealing with the service of documents subsection (e) states:</P>
      <P>in the case of any other person, by leaving it at, or sending it by pre-paid ordinary post to, the address at which that person is known to reside. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a rather unusual format which I cannot recall seeing before.  The more usual provision to cover that kind of situation is &ldquo;to sent it by pre-paid, ordinary post to the last known address of the person in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  When <Col N="1093" /> it says &ldquo;the address at which that person is known to reside,&rdquo; who is it known to? Is it known by the person who is sending it, known generally or will the person get into difficulty by having to plead knowledge of where the person is residing? This is very important because the whole question of service of documents can be crucial to proper enforcement of proceedings and availing of remedies.  Therefore, it is very important to get this right. I do not know why the normal format has been changed.  Very often people change their address to evade service of documents, to escape their responsibilities and so on under legislation.  The normal approach up to now &mdash; which is not an unreasonable one &mdash; was that if a person held out that such and such was the address from which they were corresponding and known to be at and that if they moved about, it should not be their responsibility and it should be possible to serve the document at their last known address.  The fact that their present address is not known would mean that, under this subsection, the document could not be served on them because their address would not be known, whereas it would be a person's own fault for having held themselves out as being at a particular location, disappearing and telling no one, with the result that the documents could not be served.  The old formula might be a better one and I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could argue that a formula comprising the words &ldquo;last known address&rdquo; is the wrong one because there would still be the difficulty of finding out the last known address.  The word &ldquo;known&rdquo; is also included in that formula. We would argue that this is a better drafting, including the words &ldquo;the address at which that person is known to reside.&rdquo; Therefore, there would be a duty on the Minister's officers in serving a notice or requisition to ensure that the person resides there.  The formula comprising the words &ldquo;the last known address&rdquo; has many defects and, as the Deputy has rightly said, in many cases problems have <Col N="1094" /> arisen.  My advice is that this is a better drafting in that it is a stronger wording. There would be an onus on the server to ensure that the person resides there. Using the formula comprising the words &ldquo;the last known address&rdquo; could mean in many cases finding empty buildings or addresses one or two years old.  We could argue this point at length but I have been advised that this is a better and clearer drafting than the formula comprising the words &ldquo;the last known address&rdquo; the use of which in many cases could mean finding an empty flat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it could mean finding an empty flat but one could look at this from the point of view of the person to be served with a document or from the point of view of the innocent person seeking to bring a claim or prosecution or whatever it might be.  If a person lives in a flat and conducts their business from there, that would be their last known address.  In order to evade their responsibilities they move and tell nobody where they have gone.  From their point of view, that is fine as they have evaded their responsibilities but is that what we want to happen?  What is the person who seeks to bring a claim going to do?  All they know is that they have received correspondence from such an address and that the person has now disappeared.  If we leave it this way the person who has been wronged would be stymied.  Our concern and sympathies should be for the person who has been wronged rather than for the fly-by-night who has disappeared and told nobody where he has gone, otherwise the operation of the Bill could be stymied because one would not know where to serve the documents.  One would not know where the person was but would have his last known address.  The idea is that there be an onus on a person with responsibilities under the Bill, and who is moving to tell people he has been dealing with where he is moving to.  He should not disappear from the scene and thereby escape his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a bit like the position in regard to the registered office of a company.  We <Col N="1095" /> all know that any company can be served with documents at their registered address.  In most cases a company become aware of documents which are sent to their registered address but it is not unusual for the registered address of a company to turn out to be an unoccupied office with a caretaker.  Even so the company can still be properly served with documents at their registered address even though all points of contact are gone from there.  Why does the law allow this to happen?  It is quite proper that it is allowed and the reason is that there is a responsibility on the company in changing venues to notify and file a change of address.  What applies in the case of a company equally ought to apply in the case of an individual.</P>

      <P>We now come to deal with amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy John Bruton, I observe that amendment No. 9 in the name of the same Deputy is an alternative.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 8 and 9 together with separate decisions if required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;appear to the Minister to be expedient&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Minister is satisfied are necessary&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 5 states that the Minister may make regulations to cover such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be expedient for any purpose of the Act. I think this could allow a very wide field of law making by way of regulation on the part of the Minister in the sense that he could interpret the word &ldquo;consequential&rdquo; quite widely and the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; quite widely also.  I think the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; is the most flexible word in the English language.  Here it is used to give the Minister power to make laws by way of regulation rather than by debate and agreement of this House.  My amendment proposes to tighten this up and I suggest that the Minister must be satisfied that the regulations are necessary for achieving any of the purposes of the Bill rather than he deciding that it is expedient to do so.  Essentially those are the purposes which both of these amendments are designed to achieve.  I do not wish to choose between them and if the Minister has any preference he may choose the one he prefers.</P>

      <P>The two amendments tabled by the Deputy overlap somewhat in so far as the second amendment incorporates the Deputy's concern as stated in his first amendment.  The present wording of the section would allow the Minister to include in enabling regulations provisions which he would see as suitable and desirable for achieving any of the purposes of this Bill.  The revised wording suggested by the Deputy would on the other hand limit the Minister to including in enabling regulations only those provisions which are unavoidable for achieving any purpose of the Bill.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that there is a subtle difference and I would not be inclined to amend the wording which is marginally more appropriate.</P>

      <P>The apparent intention in one interpretation of subsection (2) is to confine the Minister's regulation-making powers to incidental, supplementary and consequential matters, but the use of the term &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; opens that up.  That is why I would prefer to say &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for the consequential, supplementary or incidental purposes of the Bill.  I think it is better wording and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to make much comment on Deputy Bruton's amendment because I think the entire section is wrong and inappropriate.  If the section is to stay, and I hope it will not, his amendment will help a bit, but only a little bit.  I will speak in more detail on the content of the section in general when we have disposed of Deputy Bruton's amendment but I think the whole section ought to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that, life being what it is, there probably is a need for the Minister to have some tidying up powers with regard to making regulations. I would not go along with the purist view that it is not right to give the Minister such powers.  I accept he has to be given them, but I think this section is <Col N="1098" /> too wide.  I would prefer the term &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to be included rather than &ldquo;expedient&rdquo;. The Minister should be satisfied because if the Minister has to justify something subsequently in court the test that he was satisfied is a more severe one than the test that it appeared to him to be expedient, which is very subjective indeed.</P>
      <P>The proposals I make, or an amalgam of them, would be a distinct improvement and would, I hope, eliminate at least some of the objections of those who oppose the section altogether.  I hope I can meet the Minister some distance on this subject because I do not want to find myself opposing the section altogether. In practical terms there is a need for something of this kind.</P>

      <P>I oppose this section as well.  I support Deputy Bruton's amendment as at least giving something more definite.  The whole section is very vague.  It provides: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for enabling this Act to have full effect&rdquo;.  That means if he makes regulations under the Act they may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be expedient. That is very vague.  Any Minister can make mistakes and something might appear to him to be expedient at a particular time and in that regard at least Deputy Bruton's amendment firms up the matter.  The Minister must be satisfied that it is necessary rather than it appears to be expedient.  I support Deputy Bruton's amendment but I am definitely opposing section 5.</P>

      <P>I am advised the section as drafted is marginally more appropriate.  Deputies are talking about the Minister making incidential, supplementary and consequential provisions. They are very marginal supplementary decisions or regulations, we are not talking about something substantive. Maybe this is unfair but perhaps the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; has been devalued in the political system particularly.  The <Col N="1099" /> worst thing you could say about a politician is that it was expendient for him to do something.  I wonder whether we are taken in by that.  The definition of &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; is &ldquo;suitable and advisable&rdquo;. I am happy that the Minister can make supplementary, incidental and consequential provisions which are suitable and advisable.  I think the necessity is to be satisfied, not necessary or expedient.</P>

      <P>My advice is that this word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; is appropriate for this kind of section.  I have already read into the record of the House that the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; in dictionary terms includes &ldquo;advisable&rdquo;, and means &ldquo;advisable&rdquo;, and I am quite satisfied that is the correct thing to do.  I do not think it necessary to make a song and dance out of this rather minute part of a major Bill which we must discuss between now and 7 p.m.  If the House must divide, so be it, but I would prefer to get on with the more substantive sections of the Bill.  My <Col N="1102" /> advice, without substantial discussion with the Attorney General's Office, is not to depart from this wording.  I think it would be foolish of me to do so under the woeful threat of a division in the House.  If there is to be a division, let us have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section, which I submit is entirely inappropriate and should not be adopted as part of the Bill.  In the area of delegated legislation this form of clause has been appearing in virtually every Bill that comes before us.  It is entirely wrong that the House should be asked to give blanket power to the Minister to make regulations enabling the provisions of this Bill to have full effect and to contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provision as appear to the Minister to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be matters of substance arising under this section.  We all know that it is standard for Ministers to be given powers to make regulations under Acts.  The Minister gives the power to himself to make laws without having recourse to the House.  It is appropriate that the House delegate power to Ministers because the House does not have the time or the resources to deal with all the minutiae of legislation.  This has been a time honoured principle but the extent and range of the powers being given to the Minister ought to be clearly defined as is done, for example, in section 12 of this Bill under which the Minister may make regulations for the exercise of his functions in respect of eight categories in <Col N="1105" /> all.  I accept that.  In fact I do not mind if there are ten, 12 or 15 categories that the Minister is to have power to make regulations in respect of, but let us specify what the Minister's powers are to be so that we in this House can delineate and quantify the areas where he is to be allowed to make his regulations without having to have recourse to the House.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in his reply, will not talk about coming before the House with a negative resolution.  We will be talking about that in a minute because we all know that for most parties in the House the value of negative resolutions is virtually nil for all practical purposes. There is a great will on the part of Ministers and departmental secretaries to slot in to every Bill a kind of blanket power to bring in regulations for whatever may be necessary to enable an Act to have full effect.  They seem to think it is very convenient but it is a matter for the draftsman and his staff and the Minister and his staff to work out now what is necessary to give the Bill full force and effect.  If the Minister needs powers on any specific items to make regulations to ensure that the Bill will have full force and effect, those items should be specified here and now.  We discussed this same measure on another Bill only last week and I made the comment then that what it amounts to is lazy draftsmanship. In other words, they just do the best they can on the Bill and then put in a catchall regulation in case anything has been forgotten or something turns up.  That is not good enough.  It is a dangerous precedent to stitch into every Bill that the Oireachtas is called upon to enact.  If we are going to give the Minister those kinds of powers, why bother bringing in the Act at all?  Why not just put in a few general headings and say that the Minister can do everything else he wants by regulation?  In the history of parliamentary democracies, going back to Tudor times in Britain, there has always been this push by the executive, then represented by the King and now represented by the Minister, to increase their powers as against the powers of the legislature. In the time of Henry VIII there <Col N="1106" /> was a clause known as the Henry VIII clause which was a blanket clause to bring in whatever he wanted on any general defined area.  That kind of thing is creeping back and it is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that a curb is put on ministerial powers.</P>

      <P>I have very little hair left to be any kind of head at all.  We have a responsibility to watch this and we would not be doing our duty as legislators if we allowed these blanket provisions to find their way back into the legislation.  If the Minister wants to take powers to do certain things under the Act that is fine, but let us spell it out and put in the categories.  There are eight different categories in section 12 where the Minister is taking power to make regulations.  I take no exception to that whatever and I do not mind if there are additional categories but it is wrong to put in a blanket provision which could cover items which we could not possibly conceive of here and now and give power to the Minister to bring in regulations under such provision. That is the function of the Oireachtas and not the Minister.  For those reasons I am totally opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>I will be brief. Deputy Taylor made the basic points so there is not much more to be said on the issue.  Having regard to his legal experience, I can understand his annoyance but even to the layman it is an extraordinary section to put into a Bill.  It is taking unusual powers to the Minister.  We are trying to get the best regulatory system we can into the insurance business, and we are either satisfied or dissatisfied with various sections but when we come to this we see that it does not make much difference what we say because we find that the Minister may or may not make regulations to enable the Act to have the effect we thought we were putting into it.  Many people think that many more supervisory powers are required than are in the Bill, but even in regard to what is <Col N="1107" /> in the Bill now the Minister need not necessarily enable that part of the Act to have effect if that is his desire.  Under section 5, as we discussed in the amendment already, what the regulations may or may not contain or what may or may not appear to the Minister to be expedient is much too vague.  I do not like it when a Minister reverts to a dictionary. it reminds me of de Valera's dictionary republic, and a dictionary republic is the worst of all republics.  It is no use reverting to a dictionary to explain that when we say &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; we really mean advisory and assuring the House that that is what it will mean because a judge will not judge words on what the Minister said they should mean but will have his own meanings and precedents and so forth.</P>
      <P>There is a terrible vagueness about section 2 but it is really section 5 (i) that is the most frightening, and we are definitely opposing this section of the Bill.  As Deputy Taylor says the power to make regulations is in all sorts of Bills. Section 12 demonstrates the types of powers the Minister needs and much of it consists of technical regulations in regard to the particular Bill.  Under section 5 the Minister may make any regulations he wishes to enable the Act to have full effect.  We are very concerned about what the possible meanings of that would be.</P>

      <P>This is a very common provision in legislation.  It has been used down the years and has not given rise to the kind of concerns which Deputies have expressed.  For example, it is used under the Insurance Act, 1936.  The provision is necessary to ensure that as far as possible very full use can be made of each of the provisions in this Bill.  It is also necessary to ensure that the intentions of the Oireachtas in enacting legislation are not evaded on very incidental items or mere technicalties.  Therefore, I see it in a more positive light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to remind the House that regulations made by the Minister under this section cannot add to the <Col N="1108" /> substance of the Act.  That clearly would be <i>ultra vires.</i> Such regulations would simply assist in giving the fullest effect to the existing provisions.  Of course under the provisions of section 8 all regulations made under this Act will be required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should try to reassure Deputies that this is not a blanket power. The Minister cannot go beyond the powers given to him in the Bill.  The House can also annul any such regulations which the Minister might wish to make.</P>
    <P>In an industry like the insurance industry, as Deputy Bruton will appreciate very much, speed can be of the essence. It would be a pity if some minor incidental item in the legislation, something that a regulation could deal with fairly quickly, frustrated the intention of the legislation. Speed and flexibility are very important in this industry because it moves at such speed and there are such large sums of money involved.  I would argue that flexibility is required.  I want to repeat that we are talking here about regulations that are incidental, supplementary and consequential.  By supplementary I mean that the supplementary aspect cannot be substantive.  It would have to, as stated in the first part of section 5 (1), give effect to the Bill, to make sure the Bill has full effect.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the House did not agree with the arguments put forward by Deputy Taylor, Deputy Mac Giolla and myself on the last amendments. It would have been a reasonable half way house if the House had agreed to something between getting rid of the section altogether, which I would not support, and removing some of its troubling excesses.  Therefore, I regret to say that I will not oppose the section if it is put to the House.  It is a pity we have to bring in regulations to convey the intention of the House in making legislation, that literal considerations can be used to the degree that they are used to frustrate the clear intentions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we approach 1992 we are moving towards a common European legal <Col N="1109" /> system.  My understanding of the legal system on the Continent is that intentions are construed by the court as part of the matter used in interpreting the meaning of a particular section, whereas the common law system which is to be fused in the European legal system after 1992, our system and that of Britain, takes a much more literal approach and looks not at the intentions but at the actual words.  This is one of the reasons European law, for example, contains a lot of &ldquo;whereases&rdquo;.  They are designed to recite the intentions and are to be interpreted in conjunction with the literal meaning in the sections that follow them.  Our law, on the other hand, does not take attention into account and contains no &ldquo;whereases&rdquo; for that reason.  It seems there is a case for moving our legal practice closer to that on the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think predominance would suggest it would be easier to move in the other direction.  In any event, one of the side benefits of this move if it were to occur would be that the courts would not make it necessary for the Minister to bring in regulations simply to clarify what is meant, when it is clear from the outset what is meant but those seeking to frustrate the Oireachtas decision simply rely on literal considerations.  That is a factor, in the light of 1992, the Minister might like to respond to at some stage.  Perhaps he could inquire if a movement along these lines would be useful and would remove the necessity for putting sections of this kind into legislation which, I agree with Deputy Taylor, is inherently undesirable.  If the judges were to adopt a different interpretative practice it might not be necessary and we might also be moving towards what would be more the norm within the European legal area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only deal with legal practice of the courts as it is before us at present in deciding what we will go at any time.  It may be that this provision <Col N="1110" /> has been used more and more but it is time we stopped and thought about what we are doing before we give it a rubber stamp.  The next stage in this process will be that the section 12 type clause will not appear at all.  It could be argued that section 12 is not needed at all when section 5 of the Bill provides that the Minister can make regulations to enable this Act to have full effect.  All the items in section 12 would come within the general category.  The next stage will be that blanker powers will be given to the Minister to implement the Act any way he wants.  That trend will just creep in and become the norm and the whole supervisory and legislating function of the House will be gradually and invidiously eroded.  That should not happen.  It should not be beyond the ken of the draftsmen, who take long enough to prepare these measures, to examine the powers they think the Minister will need and to give him specific powers to implement them.</P>
      <P>The trend is invidious.  The way the smaller parties in particular in this House are denied the opportunity of dealing effectively with delegated legislation highlights that.  This negative clause, which has now become the order of the day, for practical purposes deprives every party in the House other than the Fine Gael Party, by reason of the time they have for Private Members' Business, of the opportunity of bringing any such delegated legislation on to the floor of the House for examination.</P>

      <P>During the time of the previous Government when negative resolutions were included in measures, I remember Fianna Fáil spokesmen who are now Ministers arguing with great force that the positive-type resolution was required.  Now that they have become Ministers they refer to the old bad practice and forget what they were arguing about when they were in Opposition, although they argued it then with great effect and great force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general principle involved <Col N="1111" /> here.  I know about draftsmanship because I spent many years drafting documents of all descriptions.  They require care and thought and that is right and proper.  The draftsmen are professional people so let them draft their documents carefully.  Let them produce to this House, and let the Minister introduce, legislation which is forceful and effective. Let the draftsman and the Minister when introducing the legislation decide on what powers the Minister will need. Then let the House look at the powers which are being sought and decide whether they are appropriate.  If they are appropriate so be it, let the legislation be passed.  By using this lazy method you say to yourself: &ldquo;I do not need to worry all that much about it, I do not have to rack my brains that much to make sure that I specify it in detail because even if I have overlooked a few things the catchall clause will pick it up and under the catch-all clause our Minister will be able to deal with the matter by regulation.  I <Col N="1112" /> do not have to go to the trouble of spelling out properly the way it is to be done.&rdquo; That is not acceptable.  It is not good enough.  It is a serious matter when the House delegates to a Minister the power to make regulations.  Regrettably, it has to be done but it is a very serious and important matter that a law making power should be exercised by a single individual, other than the Oireachtas which is given the primary legislative function under the Constitution, but at least it should be specific in the powers that are given.  General powers, such as those envisaged in section 5, should not be given.  Consequently, we could not accept that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may wish to make regulations putting a figure on what surplus may be distributed to policyholders. There is an enabling power in <Col N="1116" /> this section for the Minister to lay down regulations governing the distribution of surplus.  This measure is designed to protect policyholders in that the Minister could ask to be notified if a reduced allocation or no allocation was to be made. Either of those actions could indicate that an undertaking was experiencing some financial difficulty or perhaps the manipulation of funds in favour of distribution to policyholders or away from them.  The Deputy will agree that such enabling powers are desirable.  The Deputy is probably aware that they are covered in some detail in UK legislation.  For these reasons it is wiser to leave that enabling power there in relation to the question of the overall percentage of the distributed surplus which would be allocated to policyholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not readily have a set of circumstances to give the Deputy, but it is no excess baggage to have that enabling regulation in relation to the surplus which goes to policyholders as opposed to the surplus which might be available for shareholders.  It is in that area that I imagine a Minister might wish to make regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this.  We should know what the Minister wants the power for.  In the normal course of events policyholders are not affected by whether the company is making a profit.  They are paid in respect of claims made which relate to events covered by the policy.  It is not a matter of any consequence to them whether there is a surplus. The only time it would be relevant is in the case of this unusual category of life assurance policy, known as a with-profits policy, which is something Irish Life still have some of.  It is not very common, but if that is the case, perhaps the Minister would indicate that it is.  If <Col N="1117" /> it is the case I still do not understand why the Minister has to make regulations about it, because if the company has a surplus it would appear to be financially sound and if it does not have a surplus, this will not arise, and it can only have a surplus on the basis of accounts that have been agreed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister already has powers to regulate what may and may not go into the accounts or how the accounts may be prepared.  One assumes that it is a genuine surplus and if it is, the company is in sound circumstances.  If that is so, I do not see why the Minister must make regulations about how much or how little should be distributed to policyholders.  It looks as if the Government want to have the power to act as a sort of nanny for insurance companies in regard to how much they should give out on particular policies.  The Minister and his officials have plenty to do without making regulations about that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>I do not want to speculate too much in this area.  The Deputy will be aware that where a surplus would be available, the company can decide what percentage would go to policyholders. Normally this would relate to a with-profits policy.  The company can decide what percentage of that surplus to allocate to with-profit policies and this paragraph will ensure that that percentage is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of normal commercial judgment.  When someone takes out a with-profit policy it is up to them to protect themselves by ensuring that the policy contains adequate assurances as to how the profits will be determined and distributed.  If the small print of a policy does not give adequate assurances on that point people should not take out the policy. They should take out some other type of life assurance policy which is not related to profits but to some other index of performance or whatever of the investments. I do not think the Government should get involved in regulating this area.  This is an arms length transaction between two people and nobody is forcing those people to take out a life assurance policy.  Presumably they are adults capable of making their own decisions and just because the British have done it is no reason why we should take the power to regulate the proportion which should be given.  It seems to be throwing in more work and more activity for the Department of Industry and Commerce in this area when the world knows that the Department of Industry and Commerce have plenty on their plate in regulating the solvency of these companies without having to regulate commercial relations between people who have entered freely into those relations.</P>

      <P>It is important that we are clear on this point.  This provision will give the Minister power to make regulations to effectively prevent abuse. When people take out with-profit insurance policies they do not know in advance what the bonus element on those policies will be.

      <P>What I am trying to do in this paragraph is ensure that if there is a substantial surplus the policyholders get their fair share of it and the Minister would only use this power if this was being abused.  The UK legislation is interesting and we are not blindly aping it.  I have some experience in this area.  In the UK the requirement is that if the bonus decreases by a certain percentage, then the supervisory authority must be notified because one cannot get these assurances in advance.  Arguably an insurance company would have a very substantial surplus. If someone takes out a with-profit life assurance policy with a company who have a major surplus but they only distribute 2 per cent of the surplus, are we to stand back and say those policyholders <Col N="1120" /> knew what they were doing?  Their policies said they would get a bonus and even though their investment may have earned a fund of a couple of million pounds they may only get 1 per cent, 2 per cent or 3 per cent of it.  The intention behind the UK legislation &mdash; and it is the clear intention behind this paragraph &mdash; is to ensure that policyholders are not abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made <Col N="1121" /> his point well.  We are not interested in interfering with commercial practices but if a surplus is earned which belongs to the policyholders, which surplus they were substantially promised when they signed the policy, we want to ensure that the surplus is distributed to them.  I do not think Deputy Bruton was quite right in what he said; no self-respecting insurance company would sell with-profit policies and, if they have a surplus, not give those profits to the policyholders to a substantial degree.  We do not want to control surpluses but we want to ensure that policyholders are not shortchanged.</P>

Under insurance legislation an insurance company have full power to distribute their surplus to their policyholders and this provision is to ensure that they get their fair share of that fund, in other words, to ensure that they do not get less than is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I must again remind the House of the legislation in the UK jurisdiction, which I think is very sensible, and which provides that if the bonus decreases this year over last year the supervisory authority must be notified.  It is a red light to the supervisory authority and ensures that companies which earn substantial surpluses which belong to policyholders and are committed to them in their with-profit policies make these surpluses available to policyholders.  That is the clear intention behind this paragraph.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the Minister another way.  Supposing serious competition breaks out between a number of companies in the life area and the way they promote their campaign is to over-allocate the surplus to the policyholders, is the Minister saying that he can interfere in that sense and say &ldquo;No, this is unfair to the shareholders&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The main intention behind this provision is to prevent abuse. In a most extreme and unlikely commercial situation where say, a company sat down and decided they would give the policyholders much more than they were entitled to or deserved, there might be circumstances in that regard which could threaten the solvency of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The company have to allow for reserves out of surpluses.  One cannot give out all the surpluses; one has to put something in reserve and as the Deputies know under insurance legislation reserving is what the game is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am talking about the distributed surplus.  If a company distribute all their surplus they will not have a reserve and there might be a most unlikely circumstance where a company decide to give out 100 per cent of their surplus and leave nothing in reserve.  This might threaten the solvency of the company and the Minister could use section 12 (h) in those circumstances. There is nothing sinister about that section; it is to ensure that there is no abuse of the policyholders and no danger to solvency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister has plenty to do in looking after the solvency of companies without getting involved in making rules about the distribution of surpluses.  I have heard many <Col N="1123" /> cases being made that the Department of Industry and Commerce are understaffed and do not have enough people to deal with supervision, yet here they are taking on additional powers which truthfully they do not need to take on, as far as I can see from the debate which has taken place so far with the Minister.  The fact that the British have taken action along these lines does not mean very much because they have much larger resources for supervision of insurance companies than we have.  They have not, perhaps, had as many substantial collapses of insurance companies, either.  Perhaps they can afford to become involved in all sorts of esoteric matters like setting out the appropriate distribution of a surplus as between policyholders and shareholders. To my mind, the Irish insurance supervision authorities should stick to what really is important, without taking on such powers as these.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) the use of uniform accounting periods by insurers to assist in the comparison of the performance of insurers.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if this amendment is necessary. However, it seems that the Minister should have a regulation-making power to allow him to require all insurance companies to present accounts for the same <Col N="1124" /> accounting period on a uniform basis, to allow ease of comparison between the accounts of various insurance companies. If one company's accounting year ends on 31 December, another's on 5 April and another's on 30 September, it is not easy to compare their performances.  It may be that the Minister already has this power or that accounts, for all I know, are presented on the same basis.  If they are not and if the Minister has not the power, it is reasonable that he should have it and I am proposing this in amendment No. 17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In both the life and non-life sectors, only a small number of undertakings have different account ending years from December 31.  This arises principally because those companies are subsidiaries or branches of overseas companies and, in general, the dates are chosen for consolidated accounts purposes.  Such a small number of exceptions is not likely to lead to problems with comparison of performance.  I see what the Deputy is trying to do and certainly it is something we can discuss with the industry.  I am quite happy to bring it to their attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect. There is merit in this proposal.  In other parts of the Bill, for instance in section 46, there are historical references to the previous accounting year for the implementation of other aspects of the Bill.  If there are different accounting year endings, that makes things obviously much more difficult.  I am thinking particularly about section 46 subsection (2) (b). If you want to make changes, the different accounting year endings will make it much more cumbersome administratively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is trying to do and it is a good idea in many ways to try to tidy things up.  Companies, in many cases, have their own year endings.  We can do many comparisons without necessarily bringing them all to the one date.  As I said, there is only a small number of insurance <Col N="1125" /> undertakings that have different year endings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already said he is prepared to discuss this matter.  This amendment is merely giving him the power to do this; it does not require him to introduce regulations of this kind.  It may be that the Minister, having discussed the matter with the companies, will decide to leave things as they are.  If that happens, he just does not use the power.  I am quite prepared to accept that, if that is his decision.  On the other hand, I would not be very happy that the Minister would come to a conclusion that there should be a uniform accounting period and then find that he can do nothing about introducing such a regulation and would have to accept the companies continuing with their different accounting periods.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment but to keep an open mind as to whether he is going to make use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much the spirit of the Deputy's amendment. I have, however, two difficulties in terms of its inclusion.  First, nowhere to my knowledge in company legislation elsewhere do we, or could we, impose on an industry a common year end date. Take the banking side of the manufacturing area.  For the sake of neatness and comparison we could not impose on the industry at any stage that particular requirement.  It would be a difficult imposition on industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second area of difficulty relates to the fact that this is not just a domestic situation.  In this industry, in particular, there are many international companies operating.  These companies have gone to great trouble to consolidate their accounts and they have branches all over the world.  The Deputy is asking me to take the power in any case and see whether it can be used.  That might be unwise.  A wiser course of action might be to discuss the matter with the insurance companies in the first instance.  I do not see much point in putting something into <Col N="1126" /> the regulations which would, perhaps, turn out to be impossible to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just insisted on keeping paragraph (h) of the regulations and never mentioned in the course of the debate that he would ever use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>You could use this regulation, too; perhaps you might not use it but I do not think that is a very good argument.  I shall come back to this when speaking on the section because I want to ask the Minister, if it is his argument that he must use every power he has.  To my mind that is not the case.  We will discover, when we get to the debate on the section, that the Minister has not used many of these powers and they are simply there as a facilitative measure.  I do not see anything wrong with facilitating the Minister in the matter of requiring a uniform accounting period.  He does not have to enforce it, but it is no harm that he should have the power to do it if necessary.  I urge on the Minister to accept the amendment.  It cannot do any harm; it can only do good.  The Minister retains complete discretion not to use the power if he deems that there is even the slightest danger that its use could do harm.  This amendment is very reasonable in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted the object of the amendment as reasonable and have undertaken to try to work with the insurance companies to bring about a uniform accounting period approach.  I could not see our using a regulation which imposes on an industry a requirement to do all their accounts at the same year's end.  That would not be tolerated in the manufacturing industry, for example.  It would not be tolerated in the banking industry.  The Deputy would probably be on his feet telling me that it was an unnecessary intrusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we use that regulation we are ultimately imposing a requirement on the industry to have a particular year end date.  I do not think that we would get away with that in any industry.  It is not something that one should lay on industry by legislation. However, I shall work with the industry and bring this matter to their attention to see if we can bring them to as common a position as possible.  I am again emphasising that it is only a small number of companies that have different year ends from 31 December.  The vast majority of undertakings have that date.</P>

      <P>While supporting the Taoiseach in every way in his efforts with the Administration and Congress in regard to the rules and regulations, I very strongly urge him to provide funding to the movement of the order of about $100,000, less than $1 for every Irish illegal immigrant there.  Will he consider suport of that kind to provide services for our emigrants?  The amount is very small and there would be unanimous support for making it available.</P>

      <P>I am very surprised that the Taoiseach has not yet decided on the answers to the questions I asked, which were, what stage has been reached in the planning process and with whom does the responsibility lie?  Is the Taoiseach aware that Glasgow which has been nominated as European City of Culture 1990 has been planning for four years for this event and has already announced its programme? Is it the Taoiseach's intention that a chief organiser with expertise in the Arts and in administration would be appointed very soon to head up this programme which could do an enormous <Col N="1132" /> amount for Dublin's standing culturally and internationally and in particular in regard to tourism?</P>

The Deputy referred to Glasgow but I noticed that some press reports have been very critical of the preparations in Glasgow.

      <P>The details mentioned by the Deputy in respect of a gift received by my wife in her personal capacity, specifically indicated by the very gracious and generous donor to be in a totally personal capacity, are widely exaggerated and way above the mark.  Perhaps I might explain to the Deputy my personal view on this matter.  In so far as I am concerned, over a long period of years, I have been given gifts of one kind or another, varying from a piece of Waterford Glass from a Fianna Fáil Cumann to perhaps more significant gifts from visiting dignatories.  I do not attribute any monetary value to these gifts. They will never be disposed of and I will never profit from them.  So far as I am concerned they represent a collection of very great sentimental value to me.  They are a record of my public life and are mementoes of different occasions in that public life.  What will eventually happen to them as a collection I do not know at this stage but I can assure the Deputy that they will never be used for the personal profit of myself or any member of my family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept totally what <Col N="1135" /> the Taoiseach has said, that they will not be used for personal profit in the way he mentions but there is a different aspect to this and that is that a value should be put on gifts because of the political influence they could have on members of any Government.  In this respect I would like the Taoiseach to outline whether he considers it appropriate that there should be no guidelines for the handing over of gifts of a certain value to the State in some instances?  I understand from the Tánaiste's reply to a similar question last October that there are guidelines in respect of commercial gifts.  The Tánaiste stated that the donor determined in the instances I outlined whether a gift was to become State property.  Does the Taoiseach not think that a certain value should be put on gifts to be kept for personal purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would require much thought on the Deputy's part to realise that that would have one very serious disadvantage and, that is, if lists with values were published invidious comparisons would be drawn between different dignatories and visitors. However, I have no objection to further guidelines being brought forward if they are of general application.</P>

It was the first day back and everyone was glad to see the Tánaiste at the top of his form and <Col N="1136" /> enjoyed his performance but it was an evasive performance.

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated a line of development which apparently is not so.  Would he not agree that the fact that his predecessors may have taken a certain position does not necesarily make it right or proper and that, rightly or wrongly, many people would be drawn to the conclusion that some political pressure might be brought to bear on the Taoiseach as a result of the Taoiseach of <Col N="1138" /> the day having accepted a valuable gift, even though that might not be so, but in the public eye it would appear so?

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice, in view of the alarming decrease in Garda numbers, the proposls, if any, he has to increase resources available to community groups for example neighbourhood watch, community alert and also to schemes such as the juvenile liaison officer scheme, involved in crime prevention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion in the question that there has been an alarming decrease in Garda numbers.  The reduction in the overall numbers in the force over the past few years has been of the order of 5 per cent, which has brought Garda strength back to the level that applied six or seven years ago.  A reduction of this order cannot, I consider, be regarded as unreasonable, taking into account the major improvements that have been <Col N="1139" /> introduced in the areas of Garda communications and computerisation in recent years.  The reduction that has taken place was, of course, necessary in the overriding interests of getting the finances of the country back on a sound footing.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, 1,000 new Garda trainees are being recruited under the current competition and the first group of selected candidates will commence training in April next.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes do not require an increase in resources to ensure their continued promotion and development.  The most important element in the success of these schemes is the willingness of local communities to play their part, in association with the Garda Síochána, in preventing crime and building better and more secure communities in which to live.  During 1987 a total of about 205 new schemes involving some 43,000 households came into operation, while in 1988 there were about 175 new schemes involving some 25,000 households.  There are at present about 730 schemes in operation throughout the State, involving over 165,000 households, and a further 20 schemes are currently being organised.  I am confident that the success of these schemes will encourage more and more local communities to become involved.</P>
      <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme is essentially a scheme to supervise young people with the intention of weaning them away from involvement in crime. The Garda authorities inform me that existing manpower resources available to the scheme are adequate to meet the current level of referrals of young people and that an increase in the present number of juvenile liaison officers is not a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, a reply I expected given he was defending his corner.  Would he not agree that the number of members of the Garda Síochána has been reduced by in the region of 800 in the last few years? <Col N="1140" /> Will he further agree that the 1,000 recruits he speaks about will be taken on over a three year period and will be barely enough to replace the natural wastage that will take place over that period? Would he not further agree that the juvenile liaison officer scheme has been affected seriously as a result of the cuts in resources available to these officers to enable them to work at weekends, the very time they can make contact with young people and with their families? Would he not further agree that he is living in a different world from most of us?  Any magazines or papers we read quoting Garda representative authorities say they do not have the resources to deal with the growth in the neighbourhood watch schemes organised by the community and to service those schemes which is vitally important for their success. Finally, would the Minister not agree that, having recognised there is a limited cake to go round, which we have accepted, how you divide that cake in the Department of Justice is the question at issue?  Will he not agree it is better to put more resources into crime prevention than into dealing with the problem after it has occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his generous welcome to the very comprehensive reply I have given and I am sure he shares my pleasure at the success of the Garda Síochána in recent years in the number of areas I have listed, in particular with regard to the success of the neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes.  The Garda have established in all nearly 400 new schemes in the last two years and these are extremely successful.  That is to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett is correct in saying there is and has been a reduction in Garda numbers.  That reduction is there; it is a fact.  There has been a decrease of about 5 per cent in the overall strength of the force over the last couple of years.  We are back to the levels of about six years ago.  In an effort to improve the situation for the Garda, the Deputy acknowledges, <Col N="1141" /> there is a recruitment campaign at present under way for an additional 1,000 new recruits.  Of course, he is correct in saying that is over a period of time, but he is not correct in saying that will barely stop wastage.  Even for this year alone the intake of new recruits into the force will more than make up for natural wastage. I am open to correction on this but I think the wastage figures are in the region of 560 or 570.  There is a genuine difficulty being experienced here and I am not saying this for the first time.  At long last we are doing something worthwhile about the training of Garda recruits.  As it was the previous Government who established the Dr. Tom Walsh Committee on Garda training the Deputy knows well that, when they made recommendations for an improved training course for Garda recruits, I readily accepted all of those long overdue recommendations on their merits.  The difficulty in accepting the recommendations of that committee is that we do not now have Garda recruits trained within the normal 22 week period as obtained before; it will now take much longer.  The Deputy has a point in that respect.  However, I was faced with the dilemma: in the short-term interests should I put aside the recommendations of the Walsh Committee and adhere to a 22-week Garda trainee course or should I, in the long-term interests of the force, have all of the recommendations of that committee &mdash; with which this House fully agreed &mdash; implemented.  I had to take into account, when taking that decision that because of recent reorganisational efforts within the force, computerisation and new technology which was introduced at great cost, it would lead to greater efficiency, and there is evidence that that has been the case.  I have illustrated that in regard to the number of neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes which are in being at present.  There was an almost 60 per cent increase: I gave the figures a few moments ago &mdash; 205 in one year and 175 in another; in other words, a total of almost 400 schemes established within two years.  That is positive proof that the <Col N="1142" /> Garda are doing the job that has to be done.</P>
    <P>I have noted fully what the Deputy said with regard to the juvenile liaison scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is essentially to supervise young people with the intention of taking them away from a crime-ridden atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner advises me that the deployment of manpower for that purpose is adequate to meet present demands.  I think that covers all of the points the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>Arising from a review of policing in the Tallaght Garda sub-district, which included consideration of reports prepared by the local district officer, arrangements have been made to provide an improved Garda service in the area.</P>
      <P>As I announced earlier this month, the largest community policing scheme in the State is now in operation in the Tallaght sub-district.  The scheme operates in nine areas in Tallaght and one inspector, two sergeants and 15 gardaí are assigned to it, all of whom have received special training for the purpose.  The overall Garda strength at Tallaght station has been increased by 12 to its highest ever strength of 105.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the initial reaction to the introduction of the community policing scheme in Tallaght is very positive and that there are already encouraging developments in the <Col N="1143" /> area of Garda-community relations.  The authorities are keeping the policing needs of the Tallaght area under close review. The question of further improvements in the Garda service there will be considered in the light of available resources and overall demands on Garda manpower.</P>

The Deputy should know that, within the short two years in which I have been Minister for Justice, 27 additional gardaí have been made available to Tallaght over and above the complement obtaining there at the time the Government the Deputy supported left office.

Would the Minister agree that it is virtually impossible now to obtain convictions in such cases?  Is he aware that, in a survey undertaken some years ago, of 94 cases in the Eastern Health Board region, one offender only received a prison sentence and that only 43 of those 94 cases were reported?

      <P>I agree with what the Deputies says.  Indeed in the past she will know that, when similar views were made known to me, I agreed also.  I know that the previous Government agreed with those sentiments as well which was why they referred this complex area to the Law Reform Commission for examination. As far as the Law Reform Commission are concerned, my two priorities to them were child sexual abuse and the law in relation to rape.  The legislation on rape is at present before the Seanad, we have completed Committee Stage and I should imagine that, if the Whips agree the Bill will be introduced in this House very soon after Easter.  In fairness to the Law Reform Commission I do know that they will be in a position very soon to publish a consultation paper on this matter about which they know there is a great deal of urgency.  I should imagine that the time factor between our receipt of that consultation paper and the presentation of legislation to the House, for which I will be partly responsible, will be minimal.  I can assure the Deputy that I will give the matter top priority recognising the urgency involved.</P>

However, I am sure the Minister will accept that the murder of Mr. Keyes was exceptional in that the organisation who claimed to have carried it out also claim that they do not carry out such activities in the Republic of Ireland.  They have said that they direct their attacks against what they choose to term as the British security forces.

      <P>I assure the Deputy is referring to the statement by the Minister for the Environment on 26 January that the Garda Síochána would be asked to intensify roadside checks of tax discs in 1989 and to pinpoint &ldquo;black spot&rdquo; areas using computerised data furnished by his Department relating to non-payment of tax.</P>
      <P>This procedure is already being put into effect.

      <P>All uniformed gardaí are involved in the enforcement of the law in relation to road tax and they will continue to give this matter as much attention as possible having regard to the many other demands on their services.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>I understand that in 1987, 77,164 fine on the spot notices for non-display of tax were issued by gardaí and traffic wardens appointed by the Garda Commissioner.  In that year court proceedings were taken in respect of 143,330 offences in relation to motor tax. Approximately £17 million per annum, or between 10 per cent and 14 per cent, is regarded as evasion.  The extent of evasion has been substantially reduced. At one time the evasion rate was between 15 per cent and 20 per cent and it is expected that the new measures will substantially reduce the evasion rate level from between 10 per cent and 14 per cent which is costing £17 million.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy's statement that 20 per cent of those in prison are there for non-payment of fines for untaxed cars is incorrect.  I do not think it is anywhere near that figure but I will get the correct figure and pass on the information to the Deputy.  I agree with the Deputy that it is not in the interests of the community to have to provide extremely expensive prison accommodation for those who do not pay <Col N="1150" /> car tax and that we should find some other way of dealing with that problem. I had informal discussions with members of the Judiciary to get their views on a number of matters, and this was one of the areas we discussed.  I was pleased to get their approval for the community service order scheme which is operating very successfully.  Under that scheme people who might find themselves in prison under normal circumstances are doing community related work.  I should like to add that I introduced that scheme in my previous term as Minister for Justice and I am glad that it is going so well.  I would hope to expand that scheme considerably because it is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Barrett's view that it is not in anybody's interests, taxpayers or offenders, to have the State provide extremely expensive prison accommodation &mdash; it costs about £500 per person per week in normal circumstances &mdash; for those who do not pay their taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues under consideration are extremely complex and I am not in a position to indicate when this country might be in a position to ratify the convention.  There are a number of difficulties which stand in the way of ratification.  A major difficulty about ratification in present circumstances is that the potential number of transfers under the convention to our prisons is far higher than the potential number of transfers from our prisons.  As things stand at present our existing prison accommodation is under severe pressure to meet present requirements let alone cope with an inflow of prisoners under the terms of the convention, and the likely imbalance in transfers to and from our prisons is substantial.</P>
      <P>At present in our prisons there are only about 70 offenders who could apply for transfer out of this jurisdiction under the convention if they wished and it is likely that the number of Irish citizens in prisons in Britain who would be covered by the convention is much greater than this. Obviously it is impossible to predict accurately the number of prisoners in British prisons who would wish to return here and one group advocating ratification of the convention has put forward an estimate of between 40 and 50 in the first year and about ten to 15 each year thereafter. But it is not at all clear on what this estimate is based and there are obvious difficulties in making such an estimate. Even that level of transfers would pose a substantial problem for a prison system which is already very much stretched to cope with the present offender population of about 2,000.  Clearly it would be unacceptable if the convention could only be implemented by resorting to an increased level of early releases for the existing prison population which would probably be the only practical option, and I am not prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am continuing to examine this matter and one of the options under serious consideration is the possibility of entering declarations at the time of ratification to the effect that in considering any request for the transfer of a prisoner regard would <Col N="1152" /> be had to the availability of prison accommodation and also to the closeness of the prisoner's tie with this country.  This latter point would be intended to deal with prisoners who, while technically Irish citizens, no longer have any close links with this country, say, through being born to parents residing in a foreign country.</P>
    <P>However, there are clearly difficulties with any attempt to define what would be regarded as close ties and in formulating an appropriate declaration.  It is the case that under the terms of the convention both Governments and the sentenced person have to agree to each transfer.  However, it is doubtful that it would be appropriate to simply ratify the convention simpliciter with the intention of relying on this provision alone to control the number of transfers in the context of the shortage of accommodation.  The position in relation to accommodation can be reviewed further in the light of the provision during the coming months of 120 places at the new prison centre at Wheatfield and 50 additional places which have been recently made available at Fort Mitchell.</P>
    <P>Aside from the problem of accommodation there are complex legal issues to be teased out in relation to legislation which might be necessary to enable the convention to be ratified.  The idea of one jurisdiction administering a sentence imposed in the courts of another jurisdiction where there can be substantial differences in their respective criminal law is a novel one and the nature of possible legislation will only emerge after very detailed consideration of the issues which arise.</P>
    <P>These are some of the complex issues that are facing me and were facing my predecessor in relation to the ratification of this convention.  We are trying to find ways and means of dealing with those issues and, if we can, we will go ahead with it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether the Garda Síochána Legal Section has been re-established, either in whole or in part; if not, if there are any plans to re-establish it on a different basis to that which operated prior to its recent disbandment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána legal section was disbanded in April of last year as part of a reorganisation of structures at Garda Headquarters which arose from an internal Garda review of the general organisation of the force.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 20 on 23 June 1988, the functions formerly performed by the legal section are now divided between the force's Crime Branch and Training and Research Branch.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the change has made for more efficient and effective use of resources and they inform me that they have no plans to re-establish the section.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that there have been no moves recently to re-establish the legal section in part?  Could the Minister confirm that he personally is satisfied that the day to day changes in law, including case law, affecting a garda's duties are being communicated to gardaí on the beat?  I have in mind a particular example in relation to the recently passed Intoxicating Liquor Act where I am quite convinced that there are a great number of gardaí around the country who are not aware of the extension of their powers under that Act. Is the Minister satisfied that the legal changes which are occurring on a day to day basis are being communicated to gardaí on the beat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The change which came about here with regard to disbanding the legal section was part of the reorganisational structures and was recommended by the Garda as a result of a major inquiry into organisational matters conducted on behalf of the Commissioner of the day by three newly appointed assistant commissioners.  The present Garda Commissioner informs me that he is satisfied that the change has made for more efficient and effective use of resources and they have no plans whatsoever to re-establish the section.  They are quite happy that the new effort is going quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to whether or not <Col N="1155" /> members of the force get information about new legislation, I understand that local superintendents and inspectors can seek advice on particular issues that arise in their areas from the Chief State Solicitor's office or the local State solicitor as appropriate.  There has been no change in the arrangement whereby details of new legislation and court judgments relevant to the Garda Síochána are circularised to the force, except that this is now done from Templemore and not from Dublin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 39 together.  I have recently established a committee to examine the adequacy of existing statutory controls over fund-raising for charitable etc. purposes and to make recommendations to me for any necessary reforms in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> The terms of reference given to the committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>To examine the adequacy of the existing statutory controls over fund-raising activities for charitable etc. purposes and to make recommendations for any changes considered necessary having regard, in particular, to the need to justify any consequential costs as well as any extra interference with individual freedoms. </P>
    <P>The Hon. Mr. Justice Declan Costello is Chairman of the committee.  I propose to circulate the names of the other members of the committee in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>No representative of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests was appointed to the committee because the commissioners have no functions in relation to fund-raising.  They are primarily concerned with matters of a technical legal and financial nature in relation to areas such as the administration of charitable trusts, the appointment of trustees, the authorising of the sale of property for charity purposes and the advising of charity trustees where difficulties arise in the administration of their trusts.</P>
    <P>However, the Rev. Canon Charles Carter who is a member of the committee is also a charity commissioner &mdash; his appointment to the committee was not as a charity commissioner but as the representative of one of the two main churches.</P>
    <P>In advance of the committee completing their investigation and making such proposals for reform as they see necessary it would not be appropriate for me to comment on what specific legislative changes might be introduced.</P>
    <P>The ordinary committee members are:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the plans, if any, he has to set up a Garda task force to combat the increasing incidents of vandalism, hooliganism and attacks on persons and properties which have become a feature of life in urban societies in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that crime task forces are already established in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and that the members attached to these units are actively involved in measures to combat the types of offences referred to in the question. Special measures are being taken to deal with particular offences against persons and property, such as attacks on bus crews and on buses and trains.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to establish task forces to deal with vandalism and attacks on persons and property in urban areas outside the DMA.  The Garda authorities report that the present arrangements for deployment of Garda manpower in these areas make the best use of resources and allow for greater flexibility in providing an effective response to local crime trends.  The authorities assure me, however, that the situation is kept under regular review and that special measures are taken to deal with any specific crime patterns that are seen to be emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just told us there is a special task force in Dublin. Has he any plans to set up a similar type force in Cork and other urban areas?  Has he any exact information as to the annual cost to the taxpayer of repairing damage to schools, telephone kiosks and other public property as a result of vandalism? Has he any information as to the cost that has to be borne by the ratepayers in repairing their property in urban areas, in any of the cities outside Dublin and also in Dublin, as a result of vandalism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda manpower is, as the Deputy knows, a matter for the Garda authorities. They review the policing needs of every area, urban and rural, and they decide on the best approach to the policing of each individual district.  The Garda Commissioner believes there is a special need for crime task forces in Dublin at present to deal with the problems that exist there.  These problems do not arise on quite the same scale in other urban areas such as Cork and Limerick. Of course all urban areas have their own crime problems but the problems in different places demand different approaches.  The Garda authorities are in the best position to determine the most effective means of policing in different districts and that is why the responsibility for detailed deployment rests with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been no increase in the overall level of vandalism in Cork in recent times.  Two serious incidents occurred last year involving arson to schools in Farranree on Christmas Eve and damage to Ballincollig schools last April.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that charges have been brought in respect of both incidents.  The persons charged were youths.  The involvement of young people in serious acts of vandalism is most disturbing.  The Garda point to evidence of a lack of parental control in many of the vandalism cases which come to their attention.  I believe there is a clear moral obligation on parents to control and supervise their children and to know their whereabouts every hour of the day.  This is a role that the Garda, as protectors of public property, cannot undertake.  I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to parents to exercise <Col N="1159" /> greater control over their children, control which will express their concern for them and their wish to steer them clear of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the prosecution of juveniles there is no requirement on the Garda to serve a copy of the charge sheet on parents and therefore there are many parents who will not be aware that their children are being charged or appearing in court until after it has happened?  While I agree with the Minister that parental responsibility is required, would he not agree that the regulations and the rules applying to juveniles should reflect that and should require that parents be informed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of Deputy Colley's question, I note what she has said with regard to the procedures that exist.  I will inquire into the matter and see what we can do about it.  With regard to the second part of the supplementary, I will briefly answer that by saying that recently I spent some time with men who are working in the force in a particular part of Dublin Central. Three members of the force told me that the previous night they had been stoned by a group of youngsters, none of whom they believed were over 12 years of age, within sight and sound of their parents. If the parents take upon themselves the responsibility of bringing these young children into the world surely one would expect that they would take the further rsponsibility on themselves to try to steer them clear of that sort of activity, knowing that it will probably eventually lead them &mdash; I hope I am wrong in this &mdash; into much greater difficulty in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept in part what the Minister has said and I fully accept that the responsibility for the elimination of vandalism on our city streets cannot be put wholly on the Garda.  I must ask the Minister to accept that the absence of a high degree of community policing and the absence of the man on the beat in <Col N="1160" /> certain city streets is an element that created the kind of environment in which vandalism can take place.  The Minister must feel that he has a responsibility to look at the role the Garda must play in the elimination of vandalism.  Surely we have not arrived at a stage where we are beginning to accept that there is a tolerable level of vandalism and violence against property and against the person as we seem to have done in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to continued breaches of the gaming laws by some arcade owners in Dublin; if the Garda intend to take any action to deal with this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of allegations in the media of breaches of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956-1979, by arcade owners.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that all allegations that are brought to their attention are investigated in a thorough manner and will continue to be so.  They are aware of the allegations in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the Garda pursue reports which they receive in relation to these arcades and are quite active in doing so when they can.  The Minister will be aware that the <i>Evening Herald,</i> for instance, has carried out an investigation and has listed at least seven arcades, six of them in the Dublin Borough area and one in the Dundrum <Col N="1161" /> area, the county area, which are, according to the investigators, in breach of the law.  In the Dublin Borough area these arcades are paying out money which they are legally not supposed to and in the Dundrum area they are allowing bets of more than 2p and pay-outs of more than 50p.  Could the Minister indicate if he has any proposals to review or reform the law in relation to these machines to make it more difficult, particularly for young people, to have access to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda are aware of the allegations that have been made and are investigating them.  I am giving attention to the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, but I am not in a position to say when I will have any proposals to amend same.  I must say, and I am sure the Deputy will agree with me, that there are quite a number of legislative proposals before this House, and before the other House, sponsored by me.  This is probably the greatest number of Bills any Minister for Justice ever had before both Houses at any one time.</P>
      <P>The Bills I brought before the House were given priority which in many instances was requested by Members of this House.  It was a priority I recognised and responded to where I could.  In one or two instances my response was not fast enough and I was tripped up by Private Members' Bills &mdash; I notice Deputy Barrett is smiling.  I think that Deputy Barrett was one of the first to bring in a Private Members' Bill on under age drinking, and at the end of the day we succeeded in doing something worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is being examined.  It is not and certainly could not be regarded as having priority over any legislation &mdash; and I have ten or 12 Bills at different Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas now.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act if it were to be amended could not be given a priority over and above anything I have done.  It is a matter in which I have a personal interest.  It is a area where I see tremendous danger to young people, possibly because there is not sufficient parental control and they have so much <Col N="1162" /> money to play the slot machines.  That I find unbelievable.</P>
    <P>I was informed that one gaming machine was worth £600 tax free per week to an illegal operator.  One wonders where all this money comes from.  It is a serious social matter.  I have had discussions with the Garda about it recently. As I said to Deputy De Rossa I am aware that this is a very serious matter and it is one on which we are trying to get proposals before you as soon as we can.</P>

      <i>Deputy De Rossa rose.</i>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>A number of Deputies have offered.  I am anxious to facilitate three Deputies, including the Deputy in possession, before 3.45 p.m. Perhaps Deputy De Rossa will be brief. I will call Deputy Barrett and Deputy Tony Gregory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this matter is before the House and Dublin Corporation chose to have these machines banned specifically because of the concern of parents in relation to the danger to their children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy De Rossa said and we all agree that local authorities faced up to a very serious problem.  Perhaps other local authorities would view it in the same light.  As far as I am concerned, the Garda are aware of what is going on.  They are aware of the importance of it and are investigating certain allegations and I hope these investigations will be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the present system only shoves <Col N="1163" /> the problem from one area to the next, depending on the stand taken by each local authority?  Arising from the Minister's earlier reply, would he consider setting up a gaming board, as I mentioned during the Estimates debate, which would play a role similar to that played by Bord Fáilte in relation to special restaurant licences?  The gaming board would have to issue a suitability certificate in relation to premises, would have extensive powers in relation to the control of machines, the pay out, the age limit, the confiscation of machines and so on.  Would he consider in his proposals the introduction of a gaming board with very strict controls, particularly in relation to age limits, pay outs and the type of machines?  The gaming board would have power to carry out inspections by removing machines from premises so that they could be thoroughly checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bearing in mind what Deputy Barrett has said and having regard to previous occasions when we have had discussions in this House on important social issues &mdash; issues which are not party political as such &mdash; where each of us would be concerned for the welfare of children.  I am thinking particularly of something I mentioned already this afternoon, the Private Members' Motion put down by Deputy Barrett in relation to under age drinking; I am thinking of a debate which the Members of the other House had recently on the charities question.  That Seanad debate led to convincing me that there was a need for a charities board, as that referred to in reply to a question from Deputy Birmingham.  That new commission is operating under Mr. Justice Declan Costello.  I should like to say specifically to Deputy Barrett, that during the debate on that issue, reference was made to the possible abuses of money being collected for charities.  As the Seanad debate went on I was convinced that it was about time we did something worthwhile about it.  I invite Deputy Barrett, or any other Member, to initiate a <Col N="1164" /> discussion here in Private Members' time in which I would fully participate, and perhaps we would hear the views of a number of people on this area.  I would hope that something will emerge from it and that something worthwhile would happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he recollects that on 14 December last I raised this specific issue by way of a Dáil question &mdash; the Minister was not here to reply.  I named a specific amusement arcade in Talbot Street in Dublin Central. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, was here to answer the question and he gave an undertaking that it would be investigated.  Subsequently the Garda were in touch with me.  The approach of the Garda was that they were aware of what was happening in this particular premises.  They did not dispute that.  They asked if I could produce any evidence that would enable them to deal with the matter.  I would have thought it was the job of the Garda to produce the evidence. Given that it is a number of months since I mentioned that arcade, the abuse still continues there, openly and on a very large scale, what is the problem?  Where is the difficulty for the Garda because they know and they admit what is happening, and yet they cannot take any effective action to stop it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>I cannot say I know what the Garda views are on any particular investigation.  If allegations were made, I presume it is the duty of the Garda to question those who make allegations and see what are the reasons for making those allegations, and if there is any evidence to substantiate them.  Of course, I recognise that Deputy Gregory is not in the business of providing evidence unless he has same, but in my invitation to Deputy Barrett, who raised the issue, or to anyone else who wants to initiate a full scale debate where every Member would have a free rein to voice their views and opinions, I will have the views of all <Col N="1165" /> Members in their entirety conveyed to the Garda Síochána for their consideration.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned on Deputy Bruton's amendment I had just been saying that there were very few companies involved.  I had given an undertaking to discuss the matter with the insurance companies as soon as possible to see if we could bring additional uniformity to the accounting periods. Having considered the matter since we <Col N="1205" /> discussed it before lunch, I think that is the most sensible thing I could do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister cannot do anything about the matter if he does not have the power.  This amendment proposes to give him the power to do something about it.  Before lunch the Minister rejected allegations that he was taking on excessive powers in regard to making consequential orders under an earlier section, now he is being offered the opportunity of taking powers to deal with something which would make the insurance company accounts easier to compare both by his Department and outsiders who must assess them also.  The Minister is showing remarkable reluctance to accept this.  To my mind he is not reasonable and I do not think he is behaving as he should in regard to the responsible suggestions being made by the other side of the House.  If the Minister could demonstrate that some adverse consequences would flow from accepting this amendment, one would have to accept his judgment.  The Minister has not said that but simply that he proposes to consider the matter further.  If the amendment required him to take certain action and he was not sure whether he wanted to take it, one could understand that, too, but the Minister has not said that either.  All he has said is that he will consider the matter but not take the power to do anything about it.  To my mind that is not an appropriate attitude for him to adopt.  I do not think it is the sensible or intelligent attitude to take. It does not show the flexibility of mind necessary to deal with legislation of this kind, which everybody agrees is complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to let the matter rest here and in order to ensure that I have the opportunity of raising it again and also in order to give the Minister an opportunity of perhaps reconsidering his position on the issue &mdash; because I feel this is a matter that he could well deal with and perhaps his officials will be able to think a little more on the matter before Report Stage &mdash; I propose to withdraw <Col N="1206" /> the amendment but I will be reintroducing it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to rehash old arguments but it is clear as a result of those questions that no regulations have been made on paragraph (h) and I persist in my view that there is no need to take this regulatory power in hand.  We have got along fine without it for a long time and it only applies to a very limited category of life policies, namely, with-profits policies.  My understanding is that Irish Life are using this type of with-profits policy much less now than they used to. In fact, most of their policies are the conventional type and not the with-profits policies.  As Irish Life have survived in their present form since 1936 without the State having to regulate how they distribute their surplus to policyholders as against shareholders I do not know why we need to take power at this point to regulate this by Government <i>fiat.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this section been in existence before in other legislation?  I take it that it is only necessary now because companies are being empowered <Col N="1209" /> to conduct both life and non-life business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It has not been in legislation before.  The purpose is to ensure that policyholders and shareholders funds are separated.  Section 25 introduces the right to amalgamate industrial branch and ordinary branch with the combined funds being liable for all life assurance liabilities of the undertakings. This subsection introduces the requirement to separate the assets representing the combined fund from the assets representing the shareholders fund and requires sufficient accounting and other records to be maintained so that we can identify the assets represented by the combined fund which is the fund being established.</P>
      <P>The effect will be that the asset representing the combined fund may only be used for the purpose of life assurance business and that a transfer out of that fund can be made only after a surplus has been established in an actuarial investigation. What we are trying to do is to isolate and protect policyholders' funds as far as possible.  The 1986 regulations already require life assurance companies to submit separate returns in respect of policyholders and shareholders' assets and liabilities, but the essence of what we are doing is to ensure that policyholders' funds and shareholders' funds are separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that really what section 4 says?  So far as I can see it does not seem to refer to the separation of actual assets or funds.  All it says is that an account should be kept showing the life assurance items or funds.  The funds could be mixed with other funds and it would not be in breach of section 14 as long as an account was kept separately.  Does the Minister intend to ensure that life funds will be kept in a completely separate account rather than just having them mixed, with some book arrangement under which one could list the funds under the various life assurance policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1210" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that the section does not require a separate bank account to be established. Perhaps my phraseology was not tight enough in explaining it.  When I say that policyholders' and shareholders' funds are separated, I mean that one can identify separately the assets backing policy holders' funds.  The important thing here is that in relation to policyholders' funds we can accurately identify the assets, gilts, property, cash and so on backing the liability to the policyholders.  We are talking about separate accounting here, not necessarily separate bank accounts.  I want to be clearly able to identify the assets which represent the fund which belongs to the policyholders.  This touches on what we were talking about earlier today.  As the Deputy appreciates, the shareholders' funds are entirely separate to be dealt with only after the assets backing the policyholders' funds have been clearly identified and whatever surplus is decided by the company to distribute to policyholders is a matter for shareholders.</P>
      <P>There are two separate groups in insurance companies which are essential &mdash; policyholders and shareholders.  We want to make sure that at the end of the day, shareholders get shareholders' funds and that policyholders' funds are clearly seen to be separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there are two categories but is he quite accurate there?  Should there not be three categories, the policyholders' funds, life assurance business funds and other insurance business as distinct from life assurance business?  What escapes me is the great benefit of simply having separate accounting of funds unless hand in hand with that we required the physical cash and investments to be kept separate. If we have them <i>en bloc</i> and if we have to have a first call then by life assurance policy holders, it will not be possible to identify or break them up.  If the intention is to protect the policyholders and their life assurance policies surely we would have to have those assets maintained separately.</P>

    <Col N="1211" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misunderstanding something.  Life companies cannot do general insurance so there is no need for three funds.  A life assurance company cannot insure motor cars and so on.  Life companies do life assurance only.  Therefore, there is only one policyholders' fund.  Up to now there was a kind of averaging system where companies would average out which assets backed the policyholders' funds and which were available for shareholders of the company.  We are trying to specifically make sure that the assets which back policyholders' funds can be clearly identified.  If someone takes out a with-profits policy, the company takes in that money and invests it.  We are trying to make sure that what it has invested in cumulatively, is visible.  That would probably be gilts, property and various types of modules and so on.  It is important that for every penny a person puts into a life policy with or without profits, the assets which back that investment are visible.  To do otherwise would be extremely dangerous.  Once we are satisfied that policyholders' funds are fully backed by assets everything else after is a matter for the shareholder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are into terminology here and it is also took me a while to come to grips with this terminology. In insurance companies &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; is actually the term used for the money due back to policyholders.  If I pay a life assurance premium that is a liability of the insurance company.  It is a liability back to the policyholder in that they owe the policyholder the combined benefit. Similarly, if one goes into a bank and puts up a deposit, that is not an asset for the bank but a liability for them.  It takes a while to come to grips with that terminology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would.  If one takes out a policy, the insurance company owes one, therefore that is their liability. When talking about assets here I am talking about what the insurance company does with the money.  The insurance company takes the money and goes out and buys gilts for example.  It is those gilts that are the assets of the policy holders' funds, so that one knows that that fund backs the policy one just bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the liability then considered to be what the person has paid in, because it might not necessarily be what the policy is worth and what will be paid out?  How is it rated?  Is it rated on what the person has paid in total or what they think the fund is worth at that time, because there could be a big difference in a large number of policies and the size of the fund?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the full figure one would pay into the company be considered in total to be the liability or is a different figure put down because the fund may not be valued?  There is a risk element involved and I want to find out how they value the difference and which figure they use.  Do they use the gross income figure or what they think the net payment will be at any given time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties I have in giving the Deputy a straight answer is that this is where actuaries come in.  They put a certain valuation on the liabilities and the assets.  We are very much into actuarial land here, an extremely complicated area.  Section 14 (b) (ii) says that every undertaking authorised to carry one life assurance business <Col N="1213" /> shall maintain such accounting and other records as are necessary for identifying the assets representing the fund and the liabilities attributable to that business. Assets would be attributable to the business, which would probably be gilts and so on, and liabilities would also be attributable to the business, which would include premiums owed or whatever figure the actuaries come up with would be due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that totally within the realm of the actuary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is an actuarial valuation at the end of the year because assets change in value and so, too, do liabilities.  It depends on life spans and things like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that include actuarial calculations on each policy as to the likelihood of the death of a person so that a premium sum would have to be paid? Does that aspect have to be gone into to calculate the liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be careful what I put on the record about how an actuary does his work because obviously this is a difficult area.  I am told an actuary ascribes an actuarial valuation to a class of policies or group scheme more so than to an individual policy, or whatever the working method of the actuary is.  I am happy with the principle which provides that when policyholders hand over their money to insurance companies, the company will keep a separate record of the assets which back that money and a separate record of the liabilities which that money brings the company.  That liability may not perhaps be the exact premium but it is some actuarial measure of it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Under this section the Minister has power to intervene in cases of doubtful solvency and he can make directions of a sweeping kind as to the conduct of an insurance company.  One of the grounds on which he may do this is if it appears to him that there has been a substantial departure from any proposal or forecast submitted to him by the company.</P>
    <P>On a literal reading of that provision, the Minister could make an intervention if a company had exceeded their forecasts in terms of doing better than they had expected to do in the forecasts they had made.  To my mind that is not the intention of this section and that should be made clear.  I put down this amendment to make it clear that what is in mind is a substantial adverse departure, not just a substantial departure, from any proposal or forecast.  I hope the Minister can accept the amendment on the basis that it more fully expresses what I am sure is intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes some sense to have the power to intervene in cases of doubtful solvency in either case, adverse or the opposite, for the reason that additional funds in, say, a very positive departure from the business plan originally submitted and cash flow agreed could mean the company taking on business which perhaps they should not take on.  They could be engaged in activities designed to tackle the market in a particular way and take on additional business, and there may be a case in which the solvency of the company could be rendered doubtful.  I think the Deputy could envisage situations where companies taking on additional business and departing from the forecast on the positive side could ultimately be dangerous to the solvency of the company, and in those circumstances we would wish to intervene.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may require insurers to display information on policy conditions and rates so that people know what they are letting themselves in for, so to speak. Under the Consumer Information Act, powers exist not only to require certain information to be given but also to require that it be given with a certain degree of legibility in terms of type size and so forth, to get away from the abuse of small print by companies selling to ordinary consumers, where people have to exercise a great mental effort to know exactly what they are agreeing to by reading very densely printed material.  This would extend such a power clearly to the insurance area by allowing the Minister to require companies to print certain information in a certain type face or size of type so that people clearly would be able to read it and would have what was relevant drawn to their attention in a way that would not be concealed by the use or abuse of small print.  In contracts of insurance, in particular, this is very important.  Later Deputy Taylor will bring forward amendments to this Bill to deal with certain abuses of small print by companies where they have relied on minor non-disclosures of information <Col N="1217" /> about previous claims to justify refusal to pay out, say, a fire policy.  This was the case in Keenan and Others, a recently reported case of 1987.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the power should exist to require that the material be in large print so that people can see clearly what they are agreeing to and what they will be obliged to do if they are to sustain a claim against the company.  The Minister should have the power to regulate the size of the print used and require clarity in printing of certain categories of information. I would hope the Minister will accept the amendment on that basis.</P>

      <P>I strongly support Deputy Bruton's amendment.  It is quite clear that intending policyholders should have drawn to their attention in a proper manner what it is they are letting themselves in for.  Indeed, I wish it was going further and covering advertisements for business by insurance companies, and I believe life conditions should be set out. In supporting the amendment, might I inquire what section covers the sanction in the event of any company's failure to comply with a requirement that the Minister might issue under section 19? Could we have that detail?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is &mdash; and I have asked parliamentary questions about this matter &mdash; that the section in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act to which the Minister refers has never been used by any consumer.  The reason is that the Department have been so busy with substantive legislation that they have not got around to using some of the <Col N="1218" /> regulation-making powers that they have taken on themselves in the legislation. They have not done anything, for instance, about small print in insurance contracts.  If the Minister is going to use the existence of the unused provision in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act as a reason for not accepting this amendment, then he should at least give a commitment of some kind that he will use the existing powers to deal with the abuse of small print, particularly in liability insurance cases where there is a risk that people will not realise they can lose the right to claim, as Deputy Taylor will be outlining in detail later, by failure to disclose relatively trivial information.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take the power to require companies to highlight any conditions of that kind which are potentially adverse to the consumer and which the consumer might not normally have drawn to his or her attention.  If the Minister would give me an assurance that he would be prepared to discuss this specific issue with the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Consumers' Association with a view to examining how the existing provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act would be used to protect the consumer more effectively against the abuse of small print, then I would be more than happy to withdraw my amendment. I acklowledge it may well be legally superfluous, but certainly not politically or socially superfluous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Section 19 (3) in reality appears to say nothing.  It says that the Minister may require insurers to display or provide information on their policy conditions and rates in such manner as may be prescribed.  That is precisely what a policy does, a policy has the small print and the conditions.  I do not see that it adds a great deal unless as the Minister insists, and Deputy Bruton requests &mdash; it is done in a particular way and is clearly drawn to the attention of the unfortunate member of the public who has to cope with these things and is at a great disadvantage in dealing with insurance companies. I cannot quite recall the wording of the provision in the Sale of Goods and <Col N="1219" /> Supply of Services Act the Minister is talking about, and perhaps he could read it to us to refresh my memory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we receive many complaints on insurance matters in the Department of Industry and Commerce but we have had remarkably few about the size of print and the layout of the documents.  I thought we would have had more.  I share Deputy Bruton's objective of ensuring that nothing is hidden in the famous small print. However, that small print, from our experience, in getting larger so the problem does not appear to be as great as it originally was.  I shall give the undertaking to Deputy Bruton to discuss the better use of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act with the Director of the Fair Trade Commission as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Section 53 of the Act has as a marginal heading &ldquo;Size of type in printed contracts and other documents&rdquo;.  The section is as follows:</P>
      <P> (1)  The Minister may by order prohibit, in relation to goods or services generally or in relation to any specified class of goods or services, any seller of such goods or supplier of such services in the course of a business from making use of any printed contract, guarantee or other specified class of document unless it is printed in type of at least such size as the order prescribes.</P>
      <P>(2)  In subsection (1) references to printing include type-writing, lithography, photography and other modes of representing or reproducing words in visible form.</P>
      <P>(3)  A person who contravenes an order under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.  </P>
      <P>I am fairly satisfied with that section. I take Deputy Bruton's point and will discuss the matter with the Director.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Minister shall, as soon as possible after the coming into effect of this Act, publish an outline of the criteria under which he will make judgments on the qualifications and experience of directors, managers and agents under this section.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Under this section the Minister will make decisions about the qualifications and experience of directors of insurance companies. In all other areas of commerce there is no rule which says that somebody who has not got a degree and a smart suit and comes from the right part of town cannot become a company director and do relatively well in business.  In this case the Minister's advisers &mdash; a very reputable body of men and women &mdash; will decide on whether a particular person has the qualifications and experience to be a director of an insurance company.  It has all the unfortunate potentialities of élitism that one could ask for, that the Department of Industry and Commerce would decide who should be a director. The Department, like all Departments, act on the basis of precedent and where a precedent is not available they act on the basis of caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will only, therefore, be where somebody has exemplary qualifications and experience, so obvious that nobody could quarrel with them, that that Department would ever take a chance of allowing him or her to become a director of an insurance company because if somebody young and not qualified in a particular <Col N="1223" /> academic discipline were to become a director of a company and something subsequently went wrong, the Department would feel extremely embarrassed that they had allowed this individual to become a director.  To avoid that accusation at all costs the Department will tend to adopt an extremely conservative approach as to who may be a director of an insurance company.  That means in effect that area of commerce will be closed to newcomers because of the unusual powers the Department are taking to themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not sure &mdash; I would be interested to know &mdash; if such powers exist in other jurisdictions.  They certainly do not exist in respect of other areas of commerce.  I do not know if the Central Bank lay down rules about who may be a director of a bank.  For instance, a farmer was appointed as a director of one of the major banks and nobody asked whether he could be appointed.  Did the Minister have to consent to his appointment on the basis of his qualifications and experience? I am afraid that if this happens the Department will say that the only people who may become directors of insurance companies are those who worked in insurance companies for the last 25 years and who have a third level degree.  That unduly narrows the number of people who might become directors of insurance companies and is undesirable.</P>
    <P>For that reason I ask the Minister to explain how he proposes to use this power by accepting the amendment.  This amendment would require the Minister to publish the criteria on which he would judge whether particular directors are suitable or not.  If this power is going to be exercised then people should at least know, and the Minister should have to think out for himself and write down on paper, what the actual criteria are going to be on which the level of experience and qualifications required for the position of director of an insurance company would be terminated.  That is the purport of the amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <P>I also hope that he will be able to give <Col N="1224" /> in the House some assurances in respect of the exercise of this power.  We would not want to see ordinary people of initiative who might have something useful to contribute as a member of a board of directors being prevented from becoming members of a board of directors because a Department have adopted an unduly conservative approach.  Obviously, a Department might want to have some power to say that all members of a board of directors should not be from a particular background so that the board would function in a fashion where the skills of the different directors complement each other but that is not what this is about.  It would allow the Minister to adjudicate on the qualifications of particular directors individually.  This is rather an extensive power to be taking and ought to be explained more fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton calls the power to be taken under this section extensive.  That is perhaps an understatement; &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; might be a better word to apply to it.  I wonder if the section has been thought through sufficiently. Deputy Bruton in his amendment asks for the Minister to publish as soon as possible the guidelines on which he would make directives under the section but I would have thought that the terms of the directives ought to be included in the section.  That would have been a better way of going about it.  I do not know how this section is meant to be interpreted.  The word &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; is used but I do not know what this word means.  Deputy Bruton spoke as though it meant a third level degree but there is no evidence to suggest that it means that. It could mean anything that the Minister decides.  We all know what the word &ldquo;experience&rdquo; means, but as to what number of years constitutes experience would vary from person to person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thought that struck me on reading the section is that a person who is eminently well qualified, who might have the best degrees in the world and a lot of experience, who would be fine within the terms of the section, might fall down completely on another matter.  He could <Col N="1225" /> be thoroughly dishonest and fraudulent of intent.  I wonder therefore if this is the best way to go about it.  This section not only relates to a director or chief executive but any management position of responsibility.  This makes the provision very wide-ranging.  It is not by any means confined to directors.  A significant number of levels of administration could be caught by this section right down to ordinary managerial level.</P>
    <P>Where is the provision which would enable a candidate to be heard and to make representations or would the decision be made behind closed doors?  I thought we were supposed to be moving towards open government.  We now have data protection legislation in place and people are supposed to know what is going on.  One could visualise a person, up and coming in an insurance company and going for an appointment, finding himself blocked with no reason being given and with no opportunity of being heard.  Would he even know that the matter had gone before the Minister for his consideration, what was said and how it was put?  This is all very strange.  I would have thought that it would have been more appropriate to give some independent tribunal or some independent person the power to determine an issue of this nature rather than to the Minister. I am aware that provision has been made for an appeal to the court but appeals are always on a different basis from a first hearing.  This could have very serious implications for a person who might not have the opportunity to put his case or to be heard.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks a protection in sub-section (6) that nobody else in this wide world who has responsibilities can avail of quite so simply.  Deputy Bruton tried to remedy this as I tried to do in an amendment on a later section relating to the discharge of the Minister's functions not only under this section but under all other sections of the Bill but that amendment was also ruled out of order for the same reason as it could impose a charge on public funds.  Quite frankly, I find this a bit strange and I object to the Minister seeking to take extensive powers and <Col N="1226" /> including a provision which would allow him if he exercised those powers wrongly, badly, negligently, without foundation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>He thereby puts in very neatly a disclaimer of any responsibility or liability to compensate a person who may be wronged.  Who in the wide world can do this?  There ought to be a general principle that if a person takes powers and responsibilities they ought to be obligated to discharge those powers in a proper, careful and prudent manner. That should apply in the case of everybody, to the doctor who undertakes an operation, to the solicitor who undertakes a law case, to the architect who examines a house, to the dentist who attends to a person's teeth and to every skilled occupation which carries responsibilities not to mention the taking of draconian powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concomitant with that there is the provision in law that if one fails to discharge those functions and powers in a proper, prudent and careful way, with the result that one does damage to somebody, one pays but it appears that the Minister is a very special person, judging by the powers he proposes to take.  The old saying goes, every power and every responsibility also has its liability attached to it or should have.  If the Minister gravely wrongs a person, which can happen on occasion, or if he maliciously does so &mdash;<i>a fortiori</i> if he does so maliciously &mdash; through carelessness, negligence, by not paying proper attention or relying on wrong information, without having it checked, with the result that a person loses his job, reputation or prospects that person would have no claim. The Minister seeks to include such a provision in the Bill.  It is entirely wrong in principle that any person should give himself vast powers of control over people and to then say that if they make a bags of it, too bad, that a person will not be able to sue them as there is a provision in law which will allow them to exonerate themselves.  No matter how <Col N="1227" /> much of a mess they may make of it and no matter how careless or malicious they may be they will not have to pay up as they make the law and are slotting into the law a nice cosy condition to provide for this eventuality.  It is a bit much and I resent it.  I think it is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>We are trying to ensure that the supervisory authority, the Department of Industry and Commerce, have means to satisfy themselves that the companies are being run by people with experience and knowledge.  It would not make sense for a supervisory authority not to have adequate powers to supervise. Certainly there is no intention of interfering, being a busybody or having a veto on every personnel decision a company makes.  That is not the intention behind this.  A great deal of this is existing practice in that companies already supply us with full lists of directors and managers and there is very full co-operation between the supervisory authority and the companies.  That co-operation is very much there and I could not see what is in this section being used, except in extremely exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>If somebody else should be supervisor then that person should have the powers, but as long as the Minister is the supervisor of the industry, only in very exceptional circumstances which I cannot see arising very often may a company have a board structure in which, say, there is no insurance experience of any sort or an individual with a criminal record is being appointed to an insurance company board.  We are talking about a multibillion pound industry which employs thousands of people, and all this provides is that the supervisor of that industry is able to object to an appointment.  If a supervisory authority has serious reservations about a person it is important that they have the power to object to that person because not to do so and still carry the name of supervisor would put them in the position of knowing something was wrong and having little power to do anything about it.  For that reason the provision is here.</P>

      <Col N="1228" /> If the Minister objects to an individual then obviously, as Deputy Taylor says, that person can go to court.  It is important in dealing with this question of loss of office to remind ourselves that subsection (7) provides specifically that the appeal may be heard in chambers.  To that extent somebody's good name or reputation would not be put in danger.</P>
    <P>This is to make sure the companies have a balance of experience and the supervisory authority have the facility to ensure that that expertise is on board in each company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors leave me to wonder about the draftsmanship of this section.  The Minister is talking about a person who might have had a criminal record.  You could not say a person who had enormous experience in the insurance business and who had the highest qualifications &mdash; doctorates, insurance studies from the university of this, that and the other &mdash; was not well qualified or did not have enormous experience.  He might have a criminal record, but nothing is said in the Bill about criminal records.  it is strange that the one word which would cover that kind of situation is not in the section &mdash; that word is &ldquo;suitability&rdquo;.  I wonder why.  The section talks about qualifications and experience; it does not talk about suitability. That word is not in the draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> There is another strange factor when it comes to the appeal in subsection (7). It provides that an undertaking may appeal to the court against a direction under the section.  In other words, it is the company who can appeal but the person who is being disbarred, who has lost his office or is not getting his office, is given no powers as far as I can see.  It is as though he is a non-event, yet his livelihood could be at stake for some reason not known to him.  Why is no right of appeal given to the aggrieved person? One would have thought he should have a right of appeal to make representations. I have some doubt whether it would even be constitutional if it purported to take away the rights of a person to have access to the courts on a matter that affects his livelihood.  That could have constitutional implications.  I do not think this has been well thought through.  If the Minister is undertaking these tasks, he should do them properly, but he should be amenable if he gets them wrong.</P>

      <P>I will remind the House about the existing experience.  We are already given a list of directors and senior personnel when an insurance company apply for authorisation.  To the best of my knowledge and advice we have never had occasion to query any of the large number of people on those lists.  We have never had an occasion to query the qualifications or expertise of members or raise any worries with the companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The power in question will be exercisable only when it is proposed to appoint somebody.  The Minister might come to the conclusion under subsection (2) in respect of a director who had been there for ten years that this director was not suitable and he would direct the company to do a whole range of things that are set out in section 18, like refraining from taking on new business, limiting his premium income to a specified amount, refraining from making investments of a specified class or description, realising certain investments, maintaining assets within the State and taking any further measures as might be specified in the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of those things could be required of the company for no other reason than that one individual was on the board.  Clearly that is putting the spotlight in a big way on that individual.  If a company start doing some of the things referred to in <Col N="1231" /> section 18 it will be obvious to their competitors and others in the business that they have changed their whole conduct of business.  People will ask why and, in the small town atmosphere in which we operate here, it will not be long before it is known that this is being done because company A has individual B on its board and individual B, it would appear, is not well liked in the Department.</P>

I am interested in the Deputy's argument about the individual and would not like the provisions of the Bill to militate against him.  Therefore what I will do within the next few hours &mdash; if we have an opportunity &mdash; is ascertain whether we can include an individual's right to take a case under the provisions of subsection (7).  If I can do that as neatly and quickly as possible, I will this evening.  However, if it proves administratively impossible or if my legal advice within the next few hours is strongly against it, unfortunately I will not be able to, but that is the best undertaking I can give the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making the point that I take the view that the sanction of the High Court to the amalgamation or transfer of insurance business has always had the effect of transferring all the assets and liabilities, including liabilities to policyholders of the transferor company to the transferee company.  While the most recent case law supports this view it has come to our attention that earlier case law is inconsistent and might give rise to doubt in the matter.  In turn this could raise doubts as to whether we have fully implemented the relevant EC directives which require member states to provide that a scheme of transfer, once approved by the competent national authority, shall affect directly the policyholders concerned.</P>
      <P>This section is intended to put the matter beyond doubt by simply providing that, where the court has sanctioned a transfer or an amalgamation, it shall, by order, transfer the relevant property and liabilities, and that any such order shall be effective in making such transfer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a few observations on this section and explain to the House why I consider it to be so important?  I have listened to the Minister of State explain why this amendment is being introduced.  Nevertheless it is a new, very comprehensive amendment, on the part of the Government.  I want to ask the Minister some questions in relation to one specific set of circumstances. I will be happy if he gives an assurance in that respect but I need to have that assurance.  Otherwise we would not be happy with the amendment and would be opposing it vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 36, as proposed by the Government, if agreed now, would allow a company &mdash; and I am thinking here in particular of the PMPA, which would be one of the companies at the heart of this Bill, one that is of immediate and pressing importance &mdash; to be dissolved without <Col N="1236" /> winding it up.  Therefore, without winding it up, having no automatic reference to creditors and anybody else with a claim, seems to me potentially to leave the door open for a very dishonourable course of action.  I am thinking particularly of the PMPS creditors, that is those people who over many years invested sums of money in good faith in the PMPS and were then left high and dry, such sums of money totalling in the order of £8 million or £9 million.  Surely it is not the intention of the Government to suggest that they would, almost covertly, give <i>carte blanche</i> to a provision which would allow creditors of the PMPS to be denied what is certainly their moral and, probably, their legal entitlement.  That would be the effect of the section proposed by the Minister.  However, if the House accepted the broadly similar proposal from Deputy Cullen and myself the result would be different though nevertheless achieving the principal target of compliance which, I understand, is at the heart of the Minister's concern.</P>
    <P>The question of the PMPA is a vexed one and, as the Minister of State will know, some of us have been trying to get information about it for some weeks.  I do not wish to make a song and dance about this but there is an issue involved. If the Minister will say publicly that it is not the intention nor will it be the eventuality that the PMPS creditors will be let go by default I will be relatively happy.  However, I believe in my heart that section 33, which the House agreed to &mdash; in our case we objected to it but due to the order of the House we had to go along with it &mdash; and these sections are specifically facilitating an eventuality with which I do not thing any right-thinking person could agree.  I am certain the Minister will agree with my broad view on that.</P>
    <P>In principle my party have no objection to the sale of the PMPA.  Indeed, I wish those negotiations every success but I trust that the sale will be pursued and monitored by the Government with a view to ensuring that the decent thing is done, that those with genuine liabilities &mdash; assuming they can be proved &mdash; will <Col N="1237" /> be paid.  Many of us condemn, companies in the private sector which evade their responsibilities by using the up to now outdated company law mechanism of establishing companies, running up bills and then simply dissolving themselves and moving on to fresh fields and pastures new.  I want an assurance from the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PMPS creditors.  I am not asking for an assurance that the State will pick up the tab and it is important to stress that.  That is sufficient potential in the capacity of the liquidators of the PMPA and the PMPS, and the Minister's officers, to be able to devise a mechanism which will facilitate the expeditious sale of the PMPA, if that is the Government's wish and I have no doubt it is, and deal with the moral and legal entitlements of those creditors who have been defrauded.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage at any stage that the levy which motorists are paying due to the debacle of the PMPA will be lifted, particularly if there is to be some revenue generated from the sale of the PMPA?  It is not appropriate to raise the question of jobs in the PMPA at this stage but the issues of the levy on the people paying motor insurance and of the creditors are germane to this section.  I would be grateful for some assurances from the Minister of State in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This new section will not in any way affect the position of the PMPS which is a matter for the courts. The PMPS claim against the PMPA is a matter between the court appointed administrator of the PMPA and the court appointed liquidator of the PMPS and is at present <i>sub judice,</i> I understand that the question of the impact of a sale on the action taken by the PMPS has been raised in court and that as a result the administrator had agreed to inform the liquidator if he decides to sell the business of the PMPA.  That is a matter for the court to deal with and as I have no function in it I do not wish to comment further. In regard to the levy, there is nothing in the legislation dealing with a reintroduction or an abolition of the levy <Col N="1238" /> and, as such, it does not arise.  It is a matter for other legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been painstakingly conscious about that matter over the last number of weeks when trying to elicit information on this but I have to say that either the Minister of State is being disingenuous or is simply ill-advised, with respect to everybody involved.  I have a letter from the liquidator of the PMPS indicating that the only issue that is <i>sub judice</i> is the precise relationship between the PMPA and the PMPS.  There is no suggestion that many aspects of the broad controversy, that is the sale of the PMPA which the Minister is blithely proceeding with, negotiations being well advanced, are being impeded.  The discussions relating to the sale of the PMPA and which are at this moment proceeding have not been impeded.</P>
      <P>I will not facilitate the passage of a Bill which allows asset stripping of a major company, like the PMPA, when I am not able to get either assurances or basic information in regard to it.  The Chair's office last week &mdash; I have no fault to find with the courtesy extended to me by that office at any time &mdash; was misinformed and ruled out of order questions by me on this issue on ill-advised grounds.  The matter which was the basis for the rejection was not true.  I do not intend to read into the record the letter I have in my possession but it is available for Members who wish to see it.  The PMPS liquidator has advised me of what is <i>sub judice</i> and he is a person who is living with this day-to-day. I have also taken independent legal advice on this.  The <i>sub judice</i> matter, therefore, is peripheral to the issues I am raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State say if the <Col N="1239" /> passage of this section will facilitate the sale of the PMPA and the disposal of its central assets without reference to its liabilities or, in this case, without reference to the PMPS depositors' claims? That is a straight question to the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy my assurance that this section does not affect the rights of the PMPS <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PMPA.  I should like to remind the Deputy that it is a matter for the court, and not the Government, to decide whether business should be transferred and how that might be transferred and disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes two of us.  I have the same obligation in regard to <i>sub judice</i> as the Minister of State but the Government are responsible for law and that is what we are seeking to implement. I did not ask the Minister what claim or rights the PMPS have because I am aware that they have the same rights to the court as any other organisation.  However, there will not be much point in pursuing an empty shell.  Will the passing of this section facilitate the disposal of all of the assets of the PMPA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot envisage that; it is a matter for the courts.  I cannot envisage a court permitting unwise disposal of assets in this insurance company which is under the protection of the courts.  The only comment I should like to make is that I could not envisage a court considering it wise to permit the unusual or large-scale or unnecessary transfer of particular assets.  I am reluctant to use the word the Deputy put on the record; it would be unwise of me to do so.  The courts have the final say on <Col N="1240" /> whether assets, representing the business, should be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State suggesting that a court decides on the day-to-day disposal of assets within the PMPA?  Is that not a matter for the liquidator? Is it not a matter for him to frame his negotiations and, in the event of this section being passed, to dispose of whatever he wishes with the broad blessing of the court who will not intervene unless called on to do so?  Am I correct in that assumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment states that the court shall have the power to transfer the whole or any part of the undertaking and of the property or liabilities of any transferor company.  It further states in an order made under this section that the court may vest in the transferee company those liabilities which shall by virtue of the order be transferred to and become the liabilities of the transferee company.  The same applies to property.</P>
      <P>We have to decide what criteria this House should lay down to guide the court in coming to a conclusion as to what are the appropriate properties and liabilities of a company to be transferred and which properties and liabilities should be retained, given that the section clearly envisages the possibility that some may be transferred and some may not.  Unfortunately, the amendment put forward by the Minister appears to be silent on this subject.  It is essentially saying that the court, wherever the court sanctions an amalgamation, has <i>carte blanche</i> in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that it is an issue of public policy that we are deciding, that is not appropriate. My understanding of the Constitution is that it is not the function of the courts to decide public policy.  Public policy is a matter for the Government through this House.  We cannot say that we have a difficult decision and cannot decide it and hand it over to the courts to decide on the distribution of liabilities and assets as between different claimants in a matter of public policy.  There is no <Col N="1241" /> basis in law or jurisprudence on which the court can make such a decision.  They do not have anything to guide them.  It is not an issue of liability or anything of that kind; it is simply an issue of public policy as to whether or not it is the view of the House that the assets of a particular company, which have been contributed to by a levy collected from all motor insurers, should be available to compensate those who deposited savings with a company which was associated with a company which got into trouble.</P>
    <P>There are two schools of thought about this.  There are some who would say that if people deposited money with a particular society associated with a company giving very competitive motor insurance, and did so of their own volition, that those who were insured with other motor insurance companies have no particular responsibility to compensate those people.  It is not even a matter related to motor insurance; the matter ultimately related to the safety or otherwise of particular savings institutions.  The use of a motor insurance levy to build up the assets of a company so that that company's assets may be available to claimants against a subsidiary is not what that levy was set up and imposed on motor insurers for in the first place.</P>
    <P>There are others who would say that this is a legitimate point of view, that many people concerned were induced to make these deposits because of the way in which the motor insurance market was conducted at that time, the way in which a particular motor insurer was allowed to conduct his business at that time or was not at least prevented from so conducting his business at that time, and that it is reasonable that money collected by way of levy from other motor insurers should be used to indirectly provide a possible source of compensation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is taking the view that this is a matter for the courts, I do not see how the courts are going to decide this point.  I must confess I am not so sure how the Oireachtas is going to decide it either because it is not a very easy decision; but if we are going to delegate it to the courts, the Oireachtas should at <Col N="1242" /> least set out some schedule of criteria under which the courts would decide the issue so that the public policy elements, the general concepts of fairness that we want to see established, would be set out by us rather than the whole dreadful problem being simply thrown over to the courts for them to decide.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being unfair because this is a very serious matter, but it seems to be, to some extent, what the Minister is doing in this amendment.  I do not envy him the job he has to do in this area, but I feel that the amendment does not really meet the case.  I would ask the Minister to respond carefully to what has been said by Deputy Keating and, to some extent, by myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to be as helpful as I can but I am circumscribed by a lot of difficult areas, some of them very controversial.  In regard to the Government deciding public policy, the Deputy is right.  It is the Government, through this House, who should make those decisions.  Occasionally there are grey areas on which various courts in the land make decisions which could be called public policy and that is something that is part of our system.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest that perhaps Deputies are reading too much into this amendment.  Let me try to put it as simply as I possibly can.  I should remind Deputies that in any sale of an insurance company a court agreement would be necessary.  I am not pointing the finger at any particular insurance company, what I am trying to do here is to make sure that whenever the shares of an insurance company are sold, it will be possible to transfer the assets and liabilities with the company.  When I came across this first I was as flabbergasted as the faces of the Deputies opposite seem to suggest they are, but a legal point has been raised here &mdash; and the Attorney General agrees with it &mdash; that in the event of a sale of an insurance company, one may be able to transfer the shares and sell the company but one may not be able to transfer the business.  That has never been challenged but it has raised serious legal doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> What we are trying to do in this amendment is simply to ensure that if the court decides to approve an amalgamation or a takeover, the court can go the next step and approve the transfer of the assets and liabilities involved in such takeover.  That is extremely logical because a very serious but highly specific legal point has arisen which suggests that it could be put forward, in the event of the sale or amalgamation of an insurance company, that the company could actually be sold but the assets or liabilities in the company could not be legally transferred.  That has been put forward.  The amendment provides that if the company are being sold the court can ensure that the transfer of the assets and liabilities can also take place.  This is a very specific targeted legal point and it is important in the sense of having flexibility and removing doubt in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said may be possible but if there is no obligation to take on the liabilities who will want to take them on?  That is the key point here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a perfectly good insurance company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It may or may not be that is not the point.  Our amendment gives a clear guideline that the court must satisfy itself as to the provision being made for outstanding liabilities &mdash; that is what we are trying to get at here &mdash; so that the company cannot be asset stripped and sold off and the liabilities just left to one side.  Surely that is a reasonable amendment. What are the Minister's views on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To reiterate the point, we go all the way with the Minister of State in introducing an amendment which will ensure that there is clarity on what the sale may encompass.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is an enabling word.  The people now in negotiation for the PMPA are not interested in liabilities.  I would not be interested in liabilities.  The fact that after <Col N="1244" /> this Bill is passed they may take on liabilities is interesting but very academic. The problem is that there are liabilities. Because of the evolution of this whole issue and the way in which it has impacted in terms of public policy and the rights of the people involved, bearing in mind the long history of this company and their satellite company, the PMPS, it seems there should be an expressed commitment, if not in the Bill then by the Minister here today as a token of good faith, that the specific liability of the PMPS depositors will be acknowledged. The fact that it may be is neither here nor there.  The Guardian Royal Exchange or any other organisation interested in acquiring the PMPA, if they have anything at all between their ears and undoubtedly they have, will say: &ldquo;Thanks, we will take the assets but we are damned if we are going to take the liabilities&rdquo;.  That is what any of us would do.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cullen has said, our amendment is identical to the Minister's except it adds the words which Deputy Bruton has already said would be helpful.  These are to provide for the dissolution, without winding up, of any transferor company &mdash; which is the same as the wording in the Minister's amendment &mdash; provided the court has satisfied itself that provision has been made for outstanding liabilities. It is a reasonable request that there be at least some acknowledgement that a company which are at the heart of these sections will not be able to operate in what I would call a fly-by-night fashion, which fashion it could otherwise operate in and which facility is being extended to it if we do not agree to that amendment or to similar wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position might be clarified if the Minister said that the Government had taken a decision in principle to sell the PMPA, that discussions are on-going at present, which the whole country knows about, and that we do not want to jeopardise those discussions.  It would be far better if he would put it on the record that nevertheless there would have to be an acknowledgment in relation to the PMPS depositors.  That would put the <Col N="1245" /> cards on the table.  This issue is not going to go away.  It is not one that we should simply sweep under the carpet and pretend does not exist.  There is a significant problem of £8 million or £9 million relating to the PMPS depositors.  These are virtually all people who have saved a few shillings over the years and put them into the PMPS.  They are not big time speculators. They have hung in for the last six years during which time every motorist in the country has been asked to pay money to put right the debacle left in the wake of the PMPA.</P>
    <P>We cannot just blithely come in here and naively suggest that this amendment is not about that because it is.  It is central to it.  I do not care what words the Minister uses.  I do not even mind if he does not include it in the Bill &mdash; I am sure his draftsmen have greater expertise in this area than I have &mdash; but if he says today that it is the Government's intention that in the event of the PMPA being sold and the case not being proven, that is the PMPS establishing their right, the Government support the right of the PMPS depositors to have their claim acknowledged, I would accept that.  The fact is that this section as proposed does not even advert to that.  That is not acceptable and that is why we have put down this amendment.  I would be grateful if the Minister would comment specifically on whether he finds our amendment acceptable and, if not, why not.</P>

Unless it is passed, doubt will remain as to whether, when a company is sold, the assets and liabilities can also be transferred.

It does not change existing practice but some legal people have queried whether it would stand up.  Deputy Keating says this is what he wishes would happen.  This is what the Government wish would happen.  Now we are arguing whether the words allow it to happen.

      <P>What are the criteria and the guidance given to a court in deciding whether to sanction a particular amalgamation and why was the court involved at all in amalgamations of insurance companies? Does one have a situation in which amalgamations of two building companies, for instance, have to be sanctioned by the courts, and if so, what criteria are applied?  The whole thing boils down here and perhaps it is an argument that could be debated with more light and less heat if one could look not at the arguments which have been made <Col N="1250" /> about the PMPS and the PMPA, a subject we all admit is charged with a lot of legal, emotional and personal anxiety, but to look at it more in terms of the abstract criteria that ought to be taken into account.  I am not sure that a solution can be found to the problem which Deputy Keating is worried about in this context because there are so many other events that have intervened.  That is another day's work.  It is important to get this section right.</P>

If we are taking amendment No. 35, may I ask the Minister if he would indicate how his amendment differs in substance from the amendment in the names of Deputies Keating and Cullen and in what respects, if any, he has problems with the wording used in the amendment?

That is no reflection on the drafters of the amendment.

Is the Minister saying that we should abdicate responsibility in the matter, leave it to the courts and set no criteria for them?  Surely it is the function of this House to give some guidelines to the court.  What is the Minister's main objection to the difference between our two amendments?

We are not, in principle, opposed to it.

It is not specific.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are approving is what we have in front of us not the discussion that is taking place here.  That is why, with respect, the Minister's assurance that it is not the intention to do certain things is worthless also unless it is provided for here.  I am trying to ensure that the Bill reflects the general concensus that I assumed would be in the House in relation to this issue.  The Bill is very detailed and technical and unfortunately it will not be hued or coloured by the asides or by this discussion.  One of the two reasons the Minister of State gave for not accepting our amendment was that it was specifically targeted.  It is not.  The amendment is general.  In that context it is important to remember that the Minister of State has now corrected himself in relation to Deputy Bruton's earlier query to indicate that there are amalgamations of insurance companies that do not go before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am getting to <Col N="1254" /> is that the courts do not have a function in the case of some amalgamations and as there are no guidelines in the section, it is quite certain that there will be asset stripping in a number of amalgamations. In the cases of the PMPA, the court may intervene, but the court has no function in ensuring that what you and I might deem to be just, proper or appropriate will echo through the decision to dispose of the assets.  The Minister's only argument is that the amendment is specifically targeted, which it is not &mdash; and I challenge the Minister to show me where there is any specific targeting in the amendment we have proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the amendment, not the remarks we are making here.  It is the amendment that will be included in law.  I know that Ministers and Ministers of State like to rely on the parliamentary draftsman and they are quite right to do that most of the time, but there are many of the Minister's colleagues, and indeed the Minister himself, who have been gracious enough on previous occasions to accept amendments, particularly amendments that reflect a view he appears to hold.  The Minister has just said it would be the intention not to asset strip in this case and that he would implicitly expect the court to bear that in mind.  If that is the case, all I am asking is that the Minister simply put it into law so that the court does not have to make up its own mind and berate the Oireachtas for a lack of guidance on the issue.  At the very least, maybe the Minister of State will reflect on the amendment before Report Stage when he will be given another opportunity to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister says this we might make some progress.  The Minister is either sincere in what he says and he believes truthfully that there will not be an attempt to asset strip or else he is saying something he does not believe in.  I do not accept the latter; I think the Minister is genuine about this.  I am asking the Minister to <Col N="1255" /> accept that he may be wrong and that he may be opening the door to a situation down the line when he might say he did not intend this to happen, and he did not think would happen, but in retrospect the section as proposed by the draftsman allowed it to happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen was right when he said the Bill has been around for some time. I think it is one of the most incredible coincidences of all time that while the discussions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the sale of PMPA are proceeding, this amendment is also floated.  I will leave that point aside.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention that there be no asset stripping and if the Minister's only objections are that there might be specific targeting, which there is not &mdash; and I assure the Minister there is not, and I am quite prepared to accept a form of words from the Minister to do the same task I am talking about &mdash; then I suggest there is no reason for not accepting our amendment.  It is far more accurate in terms of what we all want to achieve and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, let us refine to these few words rather than the two acres of text we have to look at.  Would the Minister be prepared to accept the idea that the court should satisfy itself that provision would be made for outstanding liabilities?  Let me make the point quite clearly that this would have to follow upon a determination that there were actual liabilities.  If there were no liabilities, then this section would be of no benefit to people who felt they had a liability but in respect of whom the court had decided that they had not.  This is only to ensure that the transfer taking place at a particular time does not deprive people of rights, they had at that time being enforced subsequently.  It does not increase their rights in any way; it simply says their existing rights should not be taken away by this section.  I think that is the key issue in the Minister's amendment. If the Minister is not happy with the wording of Deputy Keating's amendment, he should find a way of ensuring and assuring that no rights that exist today are being taken away by this section.  That is all we want to know.  We are not asking the Minister to create any new rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in my amendment as drafted that interferes with anybody's rights and I must make this point clearly.  I appreciate that Deputy Bruton is trying to be helpful but in effect he is suggesting that we add the phrase &ldquo;the court has satisfied itself&rdquo;, which effectively is Deputy Keating's proposal.  There is a suggestion in that that the court would make some decision that it had not satisfied itself about but as I have put on the record already, these words are unnecessary because I could not see any court in the land contemplating dissolving a company unless liabilities are provided for.  I am sure any <Col N="1257" /> court would fully take into account the liabilities of any company.  It is unnecessary to add these words and without the benefit of very detailed legal consultations, I am not in a position to move from my text on this amendment because of its very careful drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State believes that what we are asking him to do will happen anyway, why does he not add some words to ensure &mdash; I see the Minister shaking his head, but I ask him to hear me out &mdash; the court will at least have the mandate from the Oireachtas for so doing.  The court has not been charged with this up to now, and they do not have to do anything of the nature we are talking about.  The Minister of State might believe the courts will &mdash; and I am not going to comment on court decisions down the years &mdash; but if the Minister believes that it is the intention to do as we are asking, why will he not add some words to ensure that it will happen?  What is to be lost in doing that?  I am quite happy to let the matter sit until Report Stage and give the Minister of State an opportunity to discuss the matter with his advisers and perhaps come up with a further form of words.  We do not pretend to have the last word of wisdom on this, although we believe our drafting is good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, the Minister's assurance is not as valid as it seems because the court could agree to transfer all the assets, but only half of the liabilities.  It could also decide under the Minister's amendment to transfer all the assets but none of the liabilities.  To <Col N="1258" /> my mind, the assurance that the Minister is giving therefore as to the protection of existing rights does not exist because if the court can transfer all the assets but none of the liabilities, then those who have a property right in the liabilities at present could, by virtue of this section, have those property rights taken away. Just as my previous amendment &mdash; where I said the Minister could be sued if he acted maliciously &mdash; was ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle as creating a potential charge on the Exchequer, there is a potential loss to those who are owed money by an insurance company here because in theory at least the court could decide not to transfer their liabilities to the same company to which they were transferring the assets against which those liabilities existed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase used here is &ldquo;provided for&rdquo;.  As I said in my assurance, I cannot see any court dissolving a company unless the liabilities are provided for.  There is more than one way to provide for liabilities.  The court may transfer certain portions of them.  There are obviously other ways of providing for liabilities and I am quite happy that this amendment includes the court being satisfied that liabilities in the case of dissolution are provided for.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister, and having spent 26 years of my working life in the insurance industry, this Part of the Bill makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Despite numerous attempts outside the House to get across a point of view what happens in the business, as distinct from what the Minister is trying to do here, it is the greatest retrograde step to professionalism I have ever come across.  I understood this country was preparing itself for 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this country was preparing itself for 1992 and an open market where we would have an opportunity of competing abroad on a professional basis for business and bringing it into this country.  What the Minister is attempting to do is to bring us back 30 years to when people operated from a boot of a car selling insurance.  Everything in this Part of the Bill will discourage people from advancing in a professional manner and will encourage organisations and companies to compete in the future.  I want to give some examples.</P>
      <P>Section 43 refers to brokers' qualifications. I have no objection to setting down rules and regulations in relation to brokers' qualifications but I want to give an example of why this provision is so farcical.  In many large towns and cities the insurance brokers who have qualified professionally to deal with what one would call general insurance contracts, that is, fire, property and liability insurance, have an ACII or an FCII operating in that field.  They are well organised and well respected firms who have been operting for many years in that field and from time to time they may get involved in non-general insurance, in other words, life assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation says that you are an insurance broker if you have more than five agencies or companies in that field. I could illustrate numerous examples of companies that have 20 agencies, with every company operating in this country in the field of general insurance but because they are non-specialist in the life and pensions areas they may have one or two life agencies purely as a convenience for individual clients who may be on their books.  Under this section that broker would be both an insurance broker and an insurance agent.  I do not know how you can police a situation like that.  With <Col N="1262" /> the greatest respect to the Minister, this shows complete ignorance as to what is actually happening in the field.  I am saying this, hopefully not from the point of view of one with a vested interest.  I do not particularly care whether all these regulations are imposed on the particular business in which I am involved because we are big enough to be able to handle them.</P>
    <P>Legislation that says that if you have four agencies you are an insurance agent and if you have five agencies you have suddenly become an insurance broker is rather strange.  It has nothing to do with professionalism evidently, with what is best for the consumer.  If I approached any Deputy as a possible client and told him or her that I was an insurance broker having agencies with every company operating in this country, is he or she, as a possible consumer, in a better position to do business with somebody like that as against somebody who has the opportunity only of placing his or her business with four companies?  What is in it for the consumer?  Surely what we should be doing here is ensuring that the consumer will get the best of professional advice, that this business will be placed in the cheapest market with the widest possible cover.  We are legislating, effectively, to change people from being insurance brokers into being insurance agents.  This is because if you are a broker you must have professional indemnity insurance and, in addition, a bond.  What advantage is it to the consumer that I could place his business with one of four companies when, if I go down the road, I can place that particular risk with one of 20 companies that will perhaps offer wider cover at a cheaper premium?</P>
    <P>I do not understand what we are trying to do here.  I can understand that people will act as agents for a particular company, that a company rather than employing people directly will appoint an agent to represent them.  That person as an agent sells that company's products and tries to get business on their behalf. There is no mention of qualification or professionalism.  No account is taken of the fact that an insurance broker will have <Col N="1263" /> an office which is staffed, which will have all the facilities that will benefit the consumer, whose staff will give professional advice and will employ people to help the consumer.  If you close down your office and cancel one of your agencies you can operate from the boot of a car and do not have to comply with any of the requirements mentioned in this Part of the Bill. It just does not make sense, from the consumer's point of view and that of the development of the industry. Insurance brokers should be encouraged to go abroad, compete for business and bring that business back to Irish insurance companies.  That is what we should be doing.  We should be competing and creating employment here.  Under this legislation we are encouraging people to drop the name of broker and become agents.</P>
    <P>It all boils down to section 43.  What is an insurance broker?  I do not see how the consumer will benefit from what is attempted to be done here.  I have declared my interest.  I am an insurance broker and have been in the business for 26 years.  I am a director of a company and a shareholder.  I am putting that on the record in case anybody should think I was pushing my own interests.  I am not; I am presenting the case on the basis of developing an industry that can compete in the future and give the consumer the best advice and best value.  I do not want to delay because I appreciate that there is a shortage of time, but I should like an opportunity to speak on later sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance broker is defined in the legislation in the definition section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; means a person who, acting with the freedom of choice described in section 43 (1) (b), brings together, with a view to the insurance of risks, persons seeking insurance and insurance undertakings, and carries out work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance, but does not include an insurance agent or an employee of an insurer when the employee is acting for that insurer; </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> That is what an insurance broker is under the Bill as adopted here today.</P>
    <P>I have not received any amendments to section 43 from anybody in the House. That is a point worth making.  Secondly, the bodies that represent insurance brokers &mdash; there are two in this country representing virtually all insurance brokers, although some obviously are not members of either &mdash; are NIBA and CIBA.  There has been no objection from either of those bodies to the number of five.  Section 43 deals with brokers.  We shall come to the agents later on because that is a separate question.  They have no objection to the provision that a person having fewer than five agencies could not legitimately call himself a broker.  If you had five agencies or companies on the life side and five on the non-life side you would probably have something like 65 per cent or 70 per cent of the market. That would entitle you to call yourself a broker because you could offer a range of services.</P>
    <P>I totally reject and refute the suggestion that we are not trying to build a brokerage profession here.  We have gone to great lengths and have had much consultation over very many months to establish and give a form of recognition to brokers.  I should remind Deputy Barrett that in the Bill published by the last Government no attempt at all was made to limit the number of agencies or reduce the number of people operating out of the boots of cars.  There was no attempt to deal with the question of setting up professional people as brokers who would offer a wide range of insurance cover.  We have made a significant advance on the Bill published by the Deputy's Government.  For the first time there is a formal recognition of brokers. It is important that I emphasise that fact.</P>
    <P>The Bill says that the Minister, instead of recognising each of the thousands of brokers &mdash; which I simply do not have the staff to do and nobody suggested I should attempt to do &mdash; recognises the recognisers. That is the sensible way.  In other words CIBA and NIBA, the people representing the brokers, are being given a form of recognition.  If they certify that <Col N="1265" /> people are complying with their rules they will get formal recognition under this legislation as being independent, professional brokers.  This is a major attempt to build a professional body of brokers. Let me not put a tooth in it.  Many of the brokers would prefer if we wiped the agents off the map altogether.  This Bill will provide that agents will have only four companies although many at present have ten, 12 or more.  That will reduce the role of agents in the insurance industry. The last Bill made no attempt to do that.  It was quite prepared to leave the agents with all the agencies.  I strongly refute the suggestion that we are not trying to build a professional body of independent insurance intermediaries and I have resisted the temptation to totally obliterate independent agents because they are necessary in small towns.  Indeed, I am sure that many brokers were angry with me for not wiping agents off the map.</P>
    <P>For the first time, legislation gives a form of recognition to the insurance broker and insists that he has at least five companies on either side which means he has to give a full share of the market.  It is important that those points are considered by the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>Brokerage is not a problem, as the Minister said.  The trouble arises in section 48 where agents are raised almost to the status of brokers without having any of the qualifications or restrictions which are put on brokers. Is there a time limit on this part of the Bill?</P>

      <P>In that case we will have time to debate section 48 because I am particularly interested in it.  However, it does impinge on this section in relation to the number of companies.  A person is a broker if he has five companies under his belt and an agent can have up to four companies.  As I understand it, in the small Irish insurance market up to four companies can give an agent up to 60 per cent or 65 per cent of the market.  You might have smaller companies which would yield only 10 per cent of the market but if you have the four right companies you could have 60 per cent of the market. An agent does not have any qualifications and does not have restrictions placed on him and if he gets one more small insurance undertaking he will become a broker.  That is where the difficulty lies. Deputy Bruton has an amendment down to reduce the agents to three companies but I would suggest two.  If the amendment is accepted, the brokers would have to be brought down to four companies. What happens if an agent may have three companies and a broker must have five?</P>

My understanding is that the problem is in the area of the agent <Col N="1267" /> which will come up in a later section. Deputy Barrett seems to be dissatisfied with section 43 and, if that is the case, I have not followed the tenor of his reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to me.  Deputy Mac Giolla is quite right when he says it is not that important but it highlights the lack of understanding of the problems in the industry.  An insurance broker can be professionally qualified in general insurance to deal solely in fire, property and liability.  He may have a huge office with a staff of 100 and may not deal with life and pension business except for having perhaps ten policies on his books, which may be with a particular company.  If he has 20 or 100 agencies with different companies but only one agency with a life and pensions company he is both an insurance broker and an insurance agent.  How will the Minister deal with that?  If he is an insurance agent for life and pensions he is an insurance broker for fire liability and property.  That is where the misunderstanding arises.  A proper insurance broker has companies lining up to give him agencies.  The number does not make any difference; if you are a professional insurance broker giving professional advice you must have a premises, a proper staff and so on.  At the end of the day an insurance agent will get the same level of commission from the company as an insurance broker, yet a broker will have costs relating to an office, professional indemnity and a bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is discouraging people from becoming brokers and encouraging them to become agents.  From the consumers' point of view that is a bad thing because the consumer should be dealing with people who have access to every part of the market.  We all know about the scandal in certain building societies who forced individuals to place their business with one insurance company because they were getting a loan from the building society in question.  The insurance company were paying 35 per cent commission in one case, more than three times what <Col N="1268" /> an insurance broker was getting.  The client was not getting the widest cover and the cheapest premium.  Is that in the consumer's interest?  That will happen here.  The small broker the Minister of State speaks about, who may at present have five or six agencies on the general side and five or six agencies on the life side, instead of advancing forward and developing would go backwards as he would not need to have professional indemnity and a bond.  I do not see how the consumer would benefit as a result of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, it is very difficult to take section 43 in isolation.  We also need to refer to section 48.  In his opening remarks the Minister of State said that he had received great support from CIBA and NIBA on this matter. The understanding was that agents would have a total of four agencies.  The shock came when the Bill was published and it became clear that agents would be allowed four agencies on the life side and four agencies on the non-life side.  The problem is that the Minister of State has removed any difference there may have been between what an insurance broker does and what an insurance agent does. He is encouraging a lack of professionalism in the marketplace by removing the incentive for people to be insurance brokers and have professional staff in the services area, and to take the one slight step downwards, which would not hurt them very much, and become insurance agents instead because four agencies would give them 65 per cent of the market, which is sufficient to survive <Col N="1269" /> on.  This is the argument put forward to me to day by CIBA.  The Minister of State has said that he has their support, but he has not because as of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that we cannot take section 43 in isolation from section 48.  That is where the problem lies.  If we do not raise this point on section 43 we will miss the boat.  The Minister of State understands the points being made but he has not given a full answer to the House.  I would like him to do so now, and to tell us why he wants to blur the difference between an agent and a broker.  He is not putting enough distance between the two categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next question is, how do we do this?  We must decide on a figure and say that above this figure a person is a broker and below it he is an agent.  If we are talking about figures, we also have to look at the percentage of the market.  The figure five is generally accepted by companies and brokers as being a reasonable figure, below which one could not sensibly be described as a broker because five agencies on the life side would give a person 71 per cent of the marketplace and five agencies on the <Col N="1270" /> non-life side would give a person 47 per cent of the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the non-life side, the figure would be 40 per cent and on the life side, the figure would be 66 per cent, still substantial figures.  I do not think Deputy Barrett is arguing that brokers should have less than five agencies. If we accept that, we should then debate the provision in section 48.  If we say an agent can have one agency only &mdash; which would get them out of the hair of the brokers, which is what the brokers ultimately want &mdash; the question I pose for Deputy Barrett and any interested Deputy, is, what do I call the people with two, three or four agencies?  I put this question to the industry.  The figures have to be consecutive.  If we go for a figure of five for brokers then we must have a figure of four for agents.  There cannot be a lacuna in this structure.</P>

It is for the people listening to this debate to decide whether I understand the industry.  It is the Deputy's understanding of the industry that is evident, and I respect that, but that does not mean nobody else in this House has any understanding of a particular industry when one studies the figures and looks at the industry carefully.  I asked Deputies a question and I will pose it again when we are dealing with Deputy Bruton's amendment which proposes a figure of three, what do we call the people in between?  They are neither brokers nor agents.</P>

I have been living <Col N="1271" /> with this problem for six months on a daily basis and I can assure the Deputy that one learns something about the industry in this way.  I put this question to all of the interested professional bodies.  If we do not have consecutive figures, it would be meaningless.  We need to decide on a figure below which a person would be an agent and above which one would be a broker.  There cannot be two jumps and a gap in between.  We will debate that matter when we get to it.  Let me make one other point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I answer that point?  With respect, the Minister of State is arguing this from the point of view of a vested interest, be it a broker or an agent.  Forget about that for a moment and think instead about the consumer.  I accept that I am obliged to give proper advice to the public as long as I am a Member of this House.  I am not entitled to come into this House and pursue my own personal interest.

      <P>Let me finish.  The Minister of State asked for an answer and I will tell him.  A consumer should know that if he goes to an intermediary who is acting impartially on his behalf, the intermediary will sit him down, ask details and advise him on the cover he needs, the cheapest premium and the best company to get cover.  That person can either accept that advice or not.  He may walk out of that office and go directly to an insurance company, and not go through any intermediary.  I am arguing that one either deals with an insurance company or with an intermediary.</P>

This is what Deputy Bruton's amendment aims to achieve.  I could argue from the consumer's point of view that that is reducing competition and removing agents from the system.  If we reduce competition and have a nice cosy club of, perhaps, professional brokers, this would militate against the consumer interest.  What we are doing is leaving an additional number of agents which the broking bodies would prefer I would take out, because these will provide additional competition and there will be more companies covering more of the market.  This would mean that the consumer would have a greater choice in who they want to deal with.  This will protect the consumer to a greater extent than reducing the number of agents which is being suggested by the other side of the House. One of the things I would like to nail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the first point I made.  Deputy Barrett suggested there were differences between brokers and agents in regard to costs.  That is not accurate.  Read the Bill carefully.  An agent has to have a bond.  A broker has to have a bond.  Both of them have to have bonds under the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is one end of the profession thinking the other end do not have professional standards.  That goes on in every profession.  I cannot eliminate that by legislation.  I cannot legislate for professional standards and rivalry in an industry and the Bill published a couple of years ago did not attempt to do that either.  The point is the same costs are laid on brokers and agents, so the suggestion that we are trying to force people to become agents to get some cheap way out of being professional is just not accurate under this Bill.  They have got to get a bond and the insurance company are responsible for the agents' professional indemnity ultimately.  That argument just is not accurate.</P>

      <P>I cannot tell the companies who they can do business with, but in an attempt to police that line in section 43 &ldquo;and he otherwise complies with the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; I had to find some mechanism.  The best I could come up with was that the company in question would ascertain whether a person proposed to be appointed as an insurance intermediary complies with the provisions of the Bill.

      <P>There is a possibility that there would be people who would fall out with one or both of these organisations representing brokers.  They could fall out for personality reasons or whatever and could say, &ldquo;I am not going to be a member of this body&rdquo; just as people might say, &ldquo;I am not going to be a member of a trade union in a business&rdquo;, and they want to ply their trade without being a member of the body.  If you leave it to the companies, who after all are private institutions and are not accountable in any way for this power the Minister appears prepared to give to them, to determine this, the insurance companies are going to be in &mdash; to use the &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrase &mdash; a conflict of interest.  They are not going to want to fall out with all the brokers who are promoting their business by recognising as a broker some individual whom perhaps one of the broking bodies has expelled, even though in practice the expellee may otherwise comply fully with the provisions of the Bill.  I do not think it appropriate to delegate to a private body &mdash; the insurance companies are private bodies &mdash; the powers of interpreting this legislation as it affects an individual.  It would appear that the Minister should be the one who should decide. At least he should be the one to whom there should be the right of appeal in a situation like this.  He should be the one to say if the insurance companies have rejected a person and he feels they have done it wrongly, &ldquo;This man is a broker and you are not entitled to refuse to deal <Col N="1276" /> with him on the basis that he does not fulfil the terms of the legislation.  He does.  If you do not want to deal with him after that, that is OK, but you cannot use that ground as a basis for not dealing with him.&rdquo;  The idea that insurance companies could become in some senses courts of law in a matter of this kind is not right.</P>

      <P>By the way, most brokers are not members of representative bodies.  I would say a slight majority of brokers are not members. <Col N="1277" /> Therefore, we have a huge body of brokers who are not members.  In order to give the representative bodies increased stature, help them and encourage people to join the bodies because by joining the bodies they build professional standards among themselves, we give a form of recognition to these two bodies by saying effectively, &ldquo;If you tell us the people who are your members are keeping your rules and complying with the legislation we accept that from you.&rdquo;  That leaves a great number of brokers who are not members. Deputy Bruton has suggested the duty is on Government to police that.  He is probably right in a sense but the practicalities are otherwise.  We are dealing with a veritable army of brokers who are not members of these organisations and it just would not be possible for any Department of State to check that every one of those brokers individually compiled with the legislation.</P>

They do that all the time.  If they are now going to police this part of the Bill and suddenly decide they want to use this as an excuse &mdash; which is what the Deputy fears &mdash; for saying: we do not like the look of that agent, so we will say he is not adhering to the provisions of the Act and, therefore, we will not deal with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last evening I had dealt with the role played by the vocational education sector in bringing education within that sphere to its present level of expertise and standing within the educational scene.  I had made the point that there were now top quality students attending these colleges.  Tribute must be paid to the VECs on this development and, more particularly, to the calibre, excellence and commitment of the teachers appointed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said also that the provisions of Deputy Birmingham's Bill meant that the appointment of teachers would be transferred from the VECs to the Local Appointments Commission.  I had made the point also that the Local Appointments Commission was established by Arthur Griffith to ensure that the filling <Col N="1279" /> of executive posts would be devoid of any political influence.  Obviously that was something all of us welcomed.  However, a number of difficulties arose <i>vis-à-vis</i> appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission, not least the fact that their operations or interviews were centralised.  Seeing Deputy John Bruton across the floor of the House reminds me that he is committed to devolution, whereas Deputy Birmingham, at his side, is committed to centralisation by way of the provisions of this Bill.  I had thought that rather strange coming from two brethren of the same fold.</P>

      <P>One of the blemishes on that Local Appointments Commission was their centralised interviews which meant people from all parts of the country could attend for interview.  I gave instances, such as town commissions or urban councils where there could be centralised interviews with people being appointed from different parts of the country to a place like, say, Kinsale.  It has been my experience that in the town of Kinsale over a 15 month period three town clerks had been appointed, thereby eroding the type of continuity needed by such a local council.  I would have certain misgivings in that respect <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of this Bill.  I had also mentioned that a period of 15 months had elapsed before a city manager was appointed in Cork.  I note that the phrase &ldquo;due process&rdquo; was used by the Minister. It has to be said that the &ldquo;due process&rdquo; involved in appointments by the Local Appointments Commission signifies delays.  We must ask ourselves whether <Col N="1280" /> we can, by way of the provisions of this Bill, eliminate delay in the appointment of teachers, which is much to be desired.</P>
      <P>I might move on and deal with the type of continuity about which we are concerned.  More than any other institution continuity of teachers in a school is vital.  We have seen how the concept of continuity has been frustrated on the local government side.  We must ensure that such continuity is maintained in the schools-college sector.</P>
      <P>I should like to pose a number of questions relating to appointments to regional technical colleges and the appropriateness of introducing the Local Appointments Commission into that framework.  In general regional technical colleges seek particular expertise when making appointments.  For example, it is quite easy for the Local Appointments Commission to appoint a teacher of mathematics in an ordinary vocational school but I foresee a difficulty in appointing a mathematics lecturer or teacher in the college sector because in that case one will be seeking expertise in given specific subjects.  Within the college area, taking mathematics as an example, one could be seeking the appointment of somebody with ability in statistics, mathematics itself and other allied competencies. Take electronics, which involves disciplines as diverse as communications, computers and electronics itself which can present a problem.  We must remember that the school authorities, as at present constituted, are well aware of the expertise needed and the gap they want plugged in their system.  In turn that begs the question: if people are appointed from outside by way of centralised interviewing, will such applicants be aware of those specific requirements? It would also be extremely difficult for the regional technical colleges to outline job specifications.  It is easy to produce a broad job specification but it is a different matter when preparing a job specification for a specific post.  The proposer of the Bill should take cognisance of that and I appeal to the Minister to bear it in mind when preparing legislation to cover the colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> Local VECs have recognised their limitations and have handed over the specialised function of managing the regional colleges to boards of management, albeit sub-committees of the VECs.  Such boards include the principal, the CEO, representatives of the Department of Education and public representatives with a special emphasis on cross-party interaction.  The latter is important and I am pleased to report that such cross-party interaction takes place at VEC meetings and among members of the interview boards.</P>
    <P>We must accept the integrity of CEOs and principals of the college when interviewing teachers for posts because their sole concern is to appoint the right person for the job.  Such boards also include representatives of local chambers of commerce and trade unions, people who have expertise in their own fields.  One can justly claim that the boards of management of regional colleges have a discipline expertise rather than a political imbalance.  Their recommendations go to the VEC for ratification.</P>
    <P>Colleges specialise in different disciplines and because of that I wonder if an outside local appointments body would have the experts available to make valid judgments on all applicants.  People sitting on the interview board may have good technical knowledge but I wonder if they would be in a position to make a good judgment on an applicant for a post in a different discipline.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill made an important point when she stated that we must always think of the ethos of the school and the requirements of local areas.  Any changes in the selection system should take account of local conditions.  I should like to refer to the position in the regional college in Cork and show how that college has progressed from not having any external contracts some years ago to generating a big income this year.  It is expected that the college will generate an income of £500,000 by organising short courses to meet the needs of the people in the area, being involved in an EOLAS project, participation in the European <Col N="1282" /> star programme and setting up local consultancies.</P>
    <P>It would be extraordinary if the chief executive of a company was not involved in making appointments to his or her company.  Is it not fair to suggest that any company making an appointment must be meticulous in trying to match the applicant to the job and in trying to ensure that the job suits the applicant?  Is it not true to say that a school principal and the CEO of a VEC, in the interest of their own school or college, would be anxious to appoint the best qualified person to a post?  It is incumbent on me to draw attention to the fact that under the NCEA scheme courses and course emphasis change rapidly with the result that subject requirements change from year to year.</P>
    <P>It is because of that that it is necessary that local expertise be involved in the selection of teachers.  Those involved in running our colleges are aware of the gaps that need to be filled on the teaching staff.  They have the competence to make appointments expertly and expeditiously. In the past Local Appointments Commissions have been accused of not making appointments expeditiously. Time is of the essence in the appointment of teachers so that they can be available when students are selected for college enrolment in September.</P>
    <P>A key member of the staff of a college may depart during the summer vacation and for that reason it is essential that the college authorities have the flexibility to take urgent steps to appoint a suitable replacement.  The Minister should keep that in mind when reviewing the provisions in Deputy Birmingham's Bill.  The compatibility of the lecturer to the college and the college to the lecturer is important.  I do not think Deputy Birmingham's proposal would prove to be a better selection procedure and I wonder if he is serious when he suggests that appointments be made by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech with great care and noted her comments that the whole impression of the interviewing system was that it works satisfactorily. <Col N="1283" /> All Members recognise the interviewing system as being satisfactory.  If we involve the Local Appointments Commission there will be a delay in the making of appointments and the Minister is aware of that.  A comparison the Minister made between the appointment of people to administrative posts in contrast to teaching appointments suggests that the filling of administrative posts can await due process but the appointment of teachers cannot.  The Minister also adverted to the prospect of increased administrative costs if the system is changed.  I am glad the Minister intends keeping that in mind.</P>

      <P>Let me begin by saying I listened with great interest to what the previous speakers have said.  I note Deputy O'Keeffe's congratulations to his Minister and his probable preparation of the elaborate congratulatory obeisance that will be necessary at the Ard Fheis.  I wish him success in that regard.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bill itself I should explain at the outset that my reason for questioning the form of its introduction in a technical sense was in no way a reflection of the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education but rather stemmed from my anxiety to ensure that when legislation on education is being proceeded with, we should have prior consideration of it so that we might be able to develop as adequate a response as education deserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  On the Bill, I am interested in two issues that I can state positively.  Deputy Birmingham in moving the Bill stated &ldquo;I am <Col N="1285" /> simply asking the House tonight that they establish the principle of impartial objective selection in relation to teaching posts&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty with this ambition of the Bill.  I also received today a statement from the Teachers Union of Ireland expressing their support for the movement of the appointment from vocational education committees to the Local Appointments Commission, and I am certainly sensitive to the points made by the Teachers Union of Ireland which is a reflection of an opinion they have expressed at many different conferences.</P>
      <P>The view of my party, therefore, is to be sympathetic to this intention of the Minister and also very particularly to the opinion expressed by the Teachers Union of Ireland, and I am not at this stage inclined to do anything other than perhaps assist the Bill past the Second Stage; but I believe it needs very drastic amendment on Committee Stage. Indeed I have to consider the situation in relation to what some of the implications of it are.</P>
      <P>I might say at the beginning that there were some points in the speech of the mover of the Bill last evening with which I profoundly disagreed.  On one occasion last night he said that in relation to the teaching positions themselves this is the only area in which the independent criteria of appointment are not now applied. I disagree with that profoundly because I might ask him, when he comes to reply, if he would explain to me what independent criteria there are for the appointment of secondary teachers in secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>They are not appointed by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that in his interruption Deputy Birmingham gives the game away.  It is of course the nub of the matter that the highest and most impeccable standards must apply to the State.  In that the Deputy would have my support &mdash; I have already spoken about this &mdash; but it is always in what is not included that one finds the mind of the person revealed.  So far as I am concerned <Col N="1286" /> the brave spokesperson on Education would begin by addressing the issue of control in education generally and then move through the different sectors of education with courage and come to address the question of the appointment of teachers in all sectors.  It may be acceptable to Deputy Birmingham, but it is not to me, that we subject vocational educational appointments to intense scrutiny but that there we limit our concern. I was horrified at what discussion took place on the famous Eileen Flynn episode in its day and I am only too well aware of the lack of accountability and transparency in many appointments in the secondary sector.  That is not to say that all such appointments are not impeccable, but it is to say that I could find examples where it was at least unclear as to how a particular person came to be appointed.  If we are to have transparency and accountability let it be for all teaching posts.  I might move back to that other neglected issue which people approach with about as much enthusiasm as they approach the fires of hell, the question of the control of management in the primary sector.  Who there will touch or question the appointment of a teacher?  In the two sectors I have alluded to a name comes up to the Department for the payment of salary.  The person is of course suitably qualified and a cheque goes down; but how many suitable applicants were there, and did it influence things at all that it was a past pupil or that the mother or father was a former pupil, or that so and so knew somebody else who was in charge of the particular institution?  These are all issues of importance to those of us interested in a general sense in the issue of control in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important, in this debate which is explicitly about vocational education that we have a sense of accuracy. I noticed last evening that there was a flair for history developing in the House. People were going back to Arthur Griffith, encountering John Marcus O'Sullivan on the way.  I am interested in the history of vocational education as much as I am in the provision or inadequate provision for the same sector but it is <Col N="1287" /> important to bear in mind that vocational education was not established in this country without a great deal of difficulty and without a considerable amount of assurances having to be given to those who were concerned about it.  The Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, took up the historiography somewhere in the thirties and I may be able to be of some assistance to her in that regard.</P>
    <P>John Marcus O'Sullivan established vocational education through the Vocational Education Act in the thirties, after very considerable guarantees had been given.  It is important to bear in mind the kind of attitude that prevailed at the time.  In his letter of November 1930 which he wrote to the Most Rev. Dr. Keane, the Bishop of Limerick, and addressed to the Palace in Corbally, Limerick, he mentioned all the things that vocational education would not possibly touch.  He also gave other guarantees. People were worried, let us be very clear about that.  The basic encyclical of Pope Pious XI, &ldquo;The Christian Education of Youth&rdquo; stated that &ldquo;there was a difference of physical organism in inclination and disposition&rdquo; existing between women and men and that this had to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate Minister for Education had to suggest that VECs would regard co-education with some circumspection, that hours of attendance would be fixed so that young men and young women would not attend the same classes, and even that there would possibly be no night classes at all, in case they met on the way home.  Considerable concern was expressed as to whether what was being proposed was Godless and maybe there would not be adequate arrangements for religious instruction and so on.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since then and we should be very grateful for that. If the Minister is thinking of bringing in a general education Act she should go back to the issue of control and ask what is the most appropriate way now to have democratic procedures in place so that we can say that education is controlled to <Col N="1288" /> some degree by those who pay for it &mdash; the taxpayers, parents and those involved in it, teachers and others.  It is not by putting the cart very firmly before the horse that one will do that &mdash; by beginning with the question of the VEC teachers and moving back to the question of control.  Who will address the people who wrote the letters to John Marcus O'Sullivan in his day?</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to Eoin MacNeill, our first distinguished Minister for Education.  He was the first in a line that continued through John Marcus O'Sullivan's time.  Eoin MacNeill had interesting things to say on education in his time.  He said that nobody would do anything other than establish denominational education in Ireland.  There was nothing particularly brave about that.  He was not a great Republican or Nationalist in his statement.  I do not want to get too involved in this, but the mentality at that time was very interesting.  Eoin MacNeill gave a guarantee that there would be no disturbance of the donominational control of education.  I failed in the Seanad and here on many occasions to establish on what basis was the control system of education established.</P>
    <P>Before people start saying that everyone in the country was in favour of vocational education from the start, I want to tell the House that in a debate on the 1922 Constitution the one-time Leader of the Labour Party, T.J. O'Connell, sought to amend Article 10 of the Constitution.  That was a minimalist article and he sought to add to it &ldquo;All children of the Irish Free State Saorstát Éireann have the right to free elementary education&rdquo;.  That is what it was.  He was defeated and among the people who spoke against him were MacNeill and others.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the 1937 Constitution, there was very little contribution on Committee Stage, one Deputy spoke about the importance of free footwear and basic conditions to enable people to come to school.  This was defeated when it got less than ten votes.  I give this as a <Col N="1289" /> corrective to the kind of glowing historiography we got last night, that everyone has been in favour of vocational education.  The issue of control raised hackles, and what was achieved was achieved by giving guarantees.  On the issue of disadvantage, any specific measures for the disadvantaged were opposed.  The Act that was passed in the thirties was very good in many respects and the reaction to it was very interesting.  There is no point in attacking politicians because they were reflective of a very interesting attitude that prevailed in the country.</P>
    <P>The principal spokesman on education at the time in the pages of &ldquo;studies&rdquo; was the Rev. Professor Timothy Corcoran. Between 1912 and 1941, the year of his death, he wrote 37 articles on education in the journal studies.  He was among those who referred to the materialism and rationalism of Froebel, Pestalozzi and Maria Montessori that had to be resisted.  He referred to Maria Montessori's suggestions that her principles could be reconciled with Christian and Greek philosophy as &ldquo;an astonishing specimen of braggart blasphemy&rdquo;.  In one of his later articles published in 1940 he referred to co-education as &ldquo;the promiscuous herding of the sexes together&rdquo;. Those are the attitudes that prevailed.</P>
    <P>If you want to reform education you should go back and do all that.  You should address yourself to the people who are claiming a control in education at primary level from a 19th century base on ideas such as that.  You should look at the secondary level and ask about control, transparency and accountability there.  Of course, one of the reasons vocational education is addressed is that, with all its faults, it is the only kind of State education we have.  It is also a form of education that is uniquely addressed to the disadvantaged.  It is very important to bear in mind that that is its history.  Of course it has quite transcended that in recent times, particularly in the extention of its courses at second and third level and the number of courses it is offering of a novel kind, ones that are on the interface of technology and society, but it is State education.  When everyone's <Col N="1290" /> heart is bleeding for vocational education, I claim I have a very interesting right to speak on that matter because I moved a motion on 8 March last drawing attention to the specific needs of vocational education and the consequences there would be for cuts in that sector.</P>
    <P>I make these points in response to the tenor of the debate so far.  I am a realist in many ways.  My reservations, as I have said, is that I would prefer to move from the general to the specific rather than from the specific to the general.  I am willing to go along with what the teachers' union feel they need for their members as professionals and I am willing to listen to Deputy George Birmingham when he says he wants to establish a principle of accountability.  But I want him to note the consequences of what is happening here this evening, what happened last evening and what will happen next week.</P>
    <P>There is an admission that local democracy is defective.  I say that not only local democracy is defective if all the cases I heard of last night are true &mdash; and I know there are some cases of abuse.  Why have such a cowed and cowardly population who, if they know there is corruption, will not speak about it?  If they suspect corruption but do not want to prove it, why are they willing to speak so widely about it?  Is it not one of those luxuries of a despicable population that they are able to say something without having to go to the trouble of proving it?</P>
    <P>I am equally worried about the local authorities who elect members onto vocational education committees but yet never question them.  Is it not open to a local authority who put members on a vocational education committee, against which an allegation has been made, to ask questions about the operations of the VEC?  Again, one wonders.  I do not disagree with any speaker last night who said that there have been abuses.  I know of abuses in some areas, abuses which seem to be particularly bad.  I want to express my sadness about it all.  Why is it that we have to do this?  Ideally, I would have liked to have heard the Minister for <Col N="1291" /> Education's proposals for the reorganisation of education, in terms of regional and local structures, and to fit the question of an independent body that would be separate from any taint or hint of corruption in appointment into that context rather than to have to address it in isolation.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for the approach being taken by Deputy Birmingham in relation to the VECs themselves.  I was not impressed by many of the VECs when the cuts took place.  The cuts began in 1983 in the vocational sector, and people must be honest about that, but they were particularly savage in the period of office of the present Minister because there were cuts upon cuts.  The Minister will excuse me not joining in in the general required congratulations.</P>
    <P>The main question I want to ask is why were the VECs silent.  The reason is that the political composition of the committees is very useful.  They can keep their heads down while the Minister is under attack for under-provision in relation to the vocational sector but this is not an argument against committees as much as it is an argument against the members of committees.  Questions should be asked by the public, by all those parents who were agitating and all the people who were expressing interest. They should ask: &ldquo;why have you been rattling on in Dáil Éireann, talking about the problem?&rdquo;.  Why have the unions been demonstrating and what is the attitude of the public to the cuts which have taken place?  The public should ask themselves questions about that.  They are the people who are being represented by local representatives on vocational education committees who have all suddenly lost their tongues, effected by a dose of silence.  These would make me sympathetic to the idea that if that is their attitude in relation to the welfare of education, maybe in relation to appointments you would not be too confident about them either.  I am an idealist in that regard and I still have some faith in local democracy.  Therefore, at this point in my remarks, I should like to say that it is <Col N="1292" /> important to keep a balance in what we are proposing between local democracy, which is under threat, as local authorities are losing more and more of their powers and, equally, at the other end of the scale, where we are trying to achieve something which is the right of a professional &mdash; and I agree very much with Deputy Birmingham and others on this point not to have to do the rounds at the end of the 20th century canvassing county councillors for a position.</P>
    <P>Last night nobody mentioned poor old George Russell, &mdash;AE&mdash; who wrote in 1913 about the gombeenism of the new State.  He said all the appointments are in their gift and around this drunken gombeen system reels the whole new State and so on.  He was particularly bitter about it.  Think of what happened.  The principal result of corruption in local government was the City and County management Act, 1940, amended in 1955.  In between there was a great deal of discussion about the division of functions into reserve and executive functions.  Can anybody tell me that they are entirely happy with the way the management system has worked out through the powers conferred by the 1940 Act?  How accountable, for example, is the Association of County Managers in terms of their attitude towards proposals and so forth.  As anyone who is an elected representative at present knows this is a profoundly alienating period.  You are on a very low revenue base, you take no really effective decisions and as one of our representatives put it to one of our members not so long ago: &ldquo;We are here to do our little jobs and the manager will handle the multi-million pound decisions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1940 Act was a drastic addressing of corruption that was widespread in the new State in the twenties, through the thirties and up to the forties.  We would want to be very careful about how we deal with the question of changing methods of appointment.</P>
    <P>I want to see the vocational sector thrive and prosper.  If those within it feel that they want even the suspicion or a hint of any interference in appointment removed from them, so that they can be <Col N="1293" /> integrated in another way and have a new relationship in such new structures as will come into being, I will accept that but I do so with a certain amount of sadness about what some of the implications are. I notice that the Minister's response to this Bill has been that she is preparing major legislation which will deal with all of these issues.  While she is thinking of that legislation perhaps she would take into account the general issues I mentioned. The question of access is one for which we need money, obviously we are precluded from that discussion this evening. The question of curriculum is one from which I am blue in the face speaking to the Minister.  The curriculum needs reform and it needs it urgently.  I repeat my statement to her that she will be remembered as a Minister in the following terms: as to whether she allowed people to know the maps of their own society &mdash; how power is exercised in their lives, how other societies have come together to answer questions on the organisation of society, social literacy, political literacy and economic literacy. Third world countries, within five years of their revolution, establish these basic principles; they should be on the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The issue we are addressing this evening is one of control.  That is the general area within which this specific proposal fits in relation to appointments.  In relation to control it is important that nettles be grasped.  There are the many people that this Bill ignores.  We must ask why people who speak on education do not want to address the question of how the management structure of denominational education in this country was established, from what legislative base or from what consensus?  Articles are written tracing it back to the 19th century. Let us address them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second level system, when social history is written &mdash; now that history has broken out as a little orientation in this House &mdash; my advice is to remember the Eileen Flynn case but more than that, the networks that are important in Ireland and elsewhere.  I disagree with Deputy Birmingham's <Col N="1294" /> suggestion that vocational teachers are the last area from which there is a whiff of politicisation coming from their appointments.  That is a very depressed statement but there are many others. None of us is happy with many of the appointments emanating from the legal profession.  In the medical profession there is a fair amount of networking going on.  If you were a junior houseman to a consultant who decided he did not like you, and did not give you a good reference, tell me how you would go flying through the Local Appointments Commission in years to come and what kind of a job you would get.  These are all realities.</P>
    <P>I want to end by saying that vocational education is perhaps one of the most exciting areas of education.  It is also one against which there has been a deep class prejudice in Ireland, a class prejudice that reveals many things, a conservative society, not very courageous about checking anything, fatalistic in much of its orientation, dependent and so forth. Everyone was quoting the 1930 Act last night as a kind of continuation education or vocational education.  It is now much bigger.  It is now one of the most progressive areas of education, or it can be, but it is also one of the most underfunded. For example, the Minister has yet to say in this House that she takes into account the extra cost borne by vocational education in terms of the materials and equipment for metalwork, woodwork, the necessity for having a high teacher-pupil ratio, the extra remedial work that has to be done, and the interface between the world of work and the world of school.  These are all cases for extra provision. They are not cases for the levelling down from vocational education to some secondary level.</P>

      <P>I hope that when the Minister comes to review, as she will, the issues raised by the Bill and the general issues in education, she will tell the officials in her Department it is time they prepared true costings of how pounds <Col N="1295" /> are spent in the vocational sector.  Many pounds are not spent in the same way as in the traditional secondary sector.  I look forward equally to a very good relationship between the vocational and the comprehensive and community sectors, and the Minister would have my assistance in that regard.</P>
      <P>This is the first time we have discussed vocational education without discussing the implication of cuts.  This does not mean that they have disappeared from our minds.  The teachers have left, the classes have got bigger and the materials are in short supply.  I say it here again tonight: let us make a commitment to the sector and let it develop.  If it is required that the appointment system needs this absolutely guaranteed system of appointment, I can go along with that, but I will go along with it after amending this Bill &mdash; and I have five of six amendments that I intend to put down and I will broaden the scope of accountability in appointments into the general second level and also into the primary level, and I will require that education spokespersons tell me what courage they have in addressing the general issue of control in Irish education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The most significant aspect of this Bill is its brevity.  While Shakespeare assures us that &ldquo;brevity is the soul of wit&rdquo;, I am greatly afraid that as an elected member of a local authority, I find it more invidious than witty, as its enactment would be a further erosion of the powers of local statutory bodies. The vocational education sector of our education system had made a massive contribution to the commercial, industrial and cultural development of this nation.  If the Bill is intended as a vote of no confidence in vocational education committees, it is to be regretted.  The persons appointed down through the years to posts as teachers, or education administrators by vocational education committees, have well and truly vindicated their selection by the manner in which they have carried out the duties assigned to them in their respective <Col N="1296" /> schools.  It tends to be forgotten than the role of the vocational education committees in the development of industrial skills predates AnCO, FÁS and any other agency you might care to mention.  The responsibility for technical education was passed to the Department of Education in 1924 and since that time, but more especially since the Vocational Education Act, 1930, this system of education has been one of the cornerstones of economic development.  It is timely to recall that in 1947 the day group certificate came into being and it is only now in 1989, in September of this year, that this vocational education certificate examination is being subsumed into the new junior certificate examination.</P>
      <P>The junior certificate will incorporate in one set of papers the two former examinations from the vocational and traditional secondary school systems.  In passing, one must congratulate the Minister for Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for steering this new system into place and bringing curricular unity into post-primary education.  Change is in the air for education and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and her Department are steadily, through a process of analysis and consultation, bringing together what I understand will be exciting new legislation.</P>
      <P>In view of all this change I would envisage that the matter of teacher appointments will inevitably come up for examination and appraisal.  This is all the more pertinent since the advent of the regional technical colleges to the vocational education field.  I can readily understand that the appointment of principals and lecturers to this grade of college has certain dimensions which are specific to the qualifications and job specifications of highly specialist teaching posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this time these appointments have been made by subcommittees on the model of the late Donogh O'Malley. The efficiency of these boards of subcommittees has been enhanced by the board's vocationally representative base which has been in place since 1979.  There <Col N="1297" /> are few, if any, who would argue that the calibre of the persons appointed to posts in the regional colleges has been of the highest quality.  The manner in which the colleges are administered by their principals and section heads has clearly vindicated the various appointments.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of these appointments, however, which calls for comment. It would be totally remiss of me not to raise the issue.  I am sure that the Minister in whatever legislation she may choose to bring forward, will also address this issue.  The matter I have in mind is the apparent imbalances that exist between men and women academics in third level education posts.  In the foreward to the Higher Education Authority Report of the Committee on the Position of Women Academics in Third Level Education in Ireland, Professor Máire Mulcahy, chairperson of the committee, puts it succinctly when she says; &ldquo;It appears that a programme of positive action in the institutions is required to expedite the matter&rdquo;.  While there is legislative support and indeed a national policy for equality of opportunity, there is need for mechanisms to enable it.  Should the Minister choose to make changes in the appointment of teachers at any or all levels I hope she will be mindful of the opportunity it would present for the correction of the imbalance that exists generally &mdash; one only has to look at the main findings of this committee which showed that only 5 per cent of women academics are to be found on the senior staff of the designated colleges.</P>
    <P>At the outset I expressed my disappointment of the latent potential this Bill has for the further erosion of the powers of local authorities, or in this case the vocational education committees.  If the powers of appointment are solely vested in the Local Appointment Commissioners this could be said of the Bill. If, on the other hand, the Minister were to exercise here undoubted ingenuity she might devise a scheme which would not totally erode the local authority influence. I would welcome this.</P>
    <P>The Bill, of course, has serious limitations. It only refers to a committee <Col N="1298" /> established under the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The boards of management of community and comprehensive schools were not so set up.  The VEC's are represented on those boards and under existing practice are partners to the selection process.  The teachers, however, would perhaps have some difficulty with the notion that they as staff of the community and comprehensive system were being appointed to some degree by members of an authority who had been denied the power to appoint teachers of equal status to their own schools.  Similarly, teachers in secondary schools might argue that their preference might well be for a system of appointment by a body external to their school and independent of it.  This anomoly exists at the moment by virtue of the manner in which teachers are appointed, but it would be accentuated if appointments were made by the Local Appointments Commission for one school and not in another.</P>
    <P>This leads me on to the conclusion that there is a different requirement for third level appointments.  It also leads me to the conclusion that there is a different requirement for third level appointments as opposed to second level appointments. It also leads me to the conclusion that the authors of the Bill did not do their homework thoroughly, for teachers are affected by the provisions of the Bill. That, of course, takes us to a view that I hold strongly, and that is, that instead of this being a single isolated measure it would be better accommodated in a broader framework, some form of legislation that encompassed all the issues, especially the matter of education levels and their respective demands and requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her speech to the House on 21 February 1989 referred to the number of appointments being made annually. In the RTC's and VEC colleges only 30 to 40 appointments per annum are being made at present due to the financial constraints necessary to achieve the national economic objective. Appoinments at this low annual rate do <Col N="1299" /> not merit a fire brigade reaction at this time.  The falling population and other demographic influences have had and will continue to have a serious impact on the post-primary school population.  This is reflected in low staff recruitment and a parallel low staff turnover.  Normal wastage due to death or retirement are the most likely and commonly occurring reasons for staff change in the post-primary sector.  All in all one does not have to be a mathematician or a statistician to appreciate that machinery for teacher appointments at any level is not a numerically pressing issue at this time.  Even if one concedes the desirability in the principle of revised and updated recruitment practices, one can still see merit in agreeing to change but not treating it as a panic measure that has suddenly become imperative.  The Latin proverb <i>&ldquo;Festina Lente&rdquo;</i>, make haste slowly, would seem to be the appropriate wisdom in this case and accordingly I would urge that the authors of the Bill should wait until it would become part of a wider series of measures to rationalise education. Since the Bill impacts on both second and third level education systems it has difficult overtones that an amendment of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, will not adequately solve.</P>
    <P>There is one area of teaching appointments that has always made me stop and think, that is, in the nature and variety and indeed repetition of advertisements for teaching posts.  The rationalisation of advertising practices for teaching posts could be a cost saving measure.  At a time when teacher employment is scarce it should not be necessary to mount expensive advertising.  It might also be better to publish teacher vacancies on a set day each week in a uniform and cost-effective format.  The private secondary schools have always managed well in the prepaid columns.  As the Minister outlined in her speech to the House on Tuesday, the practice in the case of appointments to regional colleges has been to have selection boards subject to a maximum of 12 members widely representative of the <Col N="1300" /> wider community.  The inclusion of nominees of neighbouring vocational education committees is an important factor here.  The regional character of the colleges is emphasised by this inclusion. There are not too many overt acknowledgements of regionality and should a new system of appointments diminish this one, it would be a pity.  Any appointments system should keep it in mind.</P>
    <P>I have followed with much interest the debate on this proposal to amend the Local Authorities (Officers and Employers) Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>The posts in question are of crucial importance for the educational careers of our young people.  It is, therefore, appropriate that the Dáil should examine existing procedures for making appointments to these posts and introduce changes if there are substantial grounds for the misgivings expressed by the proposers of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal to give responsibility for making appointments to the Commissioners of Local Appointments is one which will arouse little opposition from any side of this House or, indeed, in the community as a whole.  The Local Appointments Commission has carried out its tasks over the years with efficiency and impartiality.  Not only has it functioned well but it has been seen to function well and offhand it is difficult to think of any public institution which enjoys more popular confidence.  In principle therefore it would be hard to argue against the proposal.</P>
    <P>Of course it is not sufficient that a proposal should have a sound theoretical base: it is of equal, or maybe even of greater, importance that it should be workable in practice and that the proposed procedures represent a substantial improvement on the procedures they replace.  The application of these two tests to the making of appointments in the third level VEC colleges suggest some questions which should be raised in the course of our examination of this draft legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be readily conceded that time is of the essence in filling vacant posts in any educational establishment.  As far as <Col N="1301" /> the third level area is concerned, appointment procedures must operate in such a way as to ensure that the college authorities know well in advance of the commencement of the academic year the teaching staff who will be responsible for the courses which have been offered.  It can happen, for example, that a key member of staff may depart during the summer vacation.  It is essential that the college should have the flexibility to take such urgent steps as are necessary to find a suitable replacement.  What I have heard so far from the proposers of this Bill does not reassure me that they have taken this possibility sufficiently into account.  A possible way forward might be to reserve permanent, wholetime appointments to the Commissioners of Local Appointments and to retain existing procedures for part-time and temporary appointments.</P>
    <P>There is one other point arising from the arguments that have been put forward in favour of this Bill.  It has been suggested that in present circumstances appointments can be influenced by considerations unrelated to the qualifications and experience of the candidates.  That is undoubtedly a theoretical possibility and the adoption of the proposed alternative would certainly eliminate it.  But I have not heard a clear indication of the extent to which the present system is subverted in practice. Are we talking about something which could happen in theory but hardly ever happens in practice?  If the present system works well in practice, as I believe it does, the question must arise as to whether we should not leave well enough alone.</P>
    <P>It is important to raise these two questions which I am sure deserve further consideration before we proceed to a vote on this measure.</P>
    <P>We are now at a very important juncture in Irish education.  We recently had the decision to confer university status on the National Institutes for Higher Education at Limerick and Dublin.  We have the coming into being of the new junior certificate which, as I have already said, marks the welding together of the junior <Col N="1302" /> examination certificates of both the traditional secondary and vocational systems. We have the satisfaction of seeking a worldwide demand for the graduates of our colleges, though we would encourage their going on other than a short-term experimental basis.  In short, we are seeing the fruits of all the efforts of successive Governments and their respective Ministers for Education, not least the present incumbent of that office Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  We are seeing the fruits of the efforts of public servants who serve the education sector.  We are seeing the fruits of the unselfish dedication of teachers over all the years since national Independence. All these teachers, all these administrators, were appointed to their jobs by people who wondered at the time had they made the right choice.  The passage of time and the fruits of their labours in terms of fine citizens, first class craftsmen, academics, technicians, workers at every level, is proof positive that their selection systems worked not well but very well indeed.  We must act in a considered and deliberate way.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the authors of the Bill to concede that its objectives will best be met by its being left to be part of a wider process of change by way of new legislation which would incorporate all the measures needed to equalise and maximise the whole education system and process which has been offered in the Minister's contribution last night.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wright implied that there was an attack on the vocational education system, but that is not the case. We, on this side of the House, appreciate the contribution that vocational education has made to this country and we regret that resources are not being made available for the further development of vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not making a further effort to take powers from the local authorities. Indeed, it could be said that 1977 sounded the death knell for local authorities in relation to funding.  This Bill is not an attempt to take more powers from local authorities.  The Bill's purpose is to <Col N="1303" /> remove the appointment of vocational teachers from the political arena.</P>
    <P>If this Bill was not acceptable to the Teacher's Union of Ireland, they would not have issued a statement today welcoming the introduction of the Bill.  Their press release says that the Bill seeks to have the appointment of vocational teachers taken out of the political arena and have future appointments made by the Commissioners of Local Appointments, that for too long the appointment of vocatinal teachers had been tainted by allegations of political jobbery and that even where these allegations were totally unfounded they were given credence because of the fact that the appointments were made by political representatives. The press release goes on to say that the appointment of vocational teachers is the last area in which elected representatives make such appointments and that all other comparable appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commission. It says also that it is now high time teacher's appointments were made by a system which is seen to be fair and impartial and that the present Bill, if passed, will achieve this objective.  If the teachers, the people affected most, disagreed with this view they would have come out with a contrary statement to the one they issued.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at statements made by both Deputies O'Keeffe and Wright opposing this Bill.  If the teachers agree with the Bill I do not understand why the Deputies should disagree with it.  I wish to speak in favour of the measure and to compliment my colleague, Deputy George Birmingham, for dealing with it so ably here last night.  I support the Bill because it proposes to introduce a fair and impartial procedure for the appointment of teachers employed by vocational education committees.  It is of the utmost importance that teachers as professional people and, more importantly, as the guardians of our youth should not be appointed by procedures which are open to question.  I regret to have to say that the present procedures have been questioned on a widespread scale.  Even where <Col N="1304" /> appointments were carried out properly and well they have been the subject of suspicion because of the structure of the selection procedure.  At present the appointment of vocational teachers is carried out by a selection committee who consist of five persons &mdash; four named members of the VEC and an officer of the Department of Education.  This suspicion arises because the majority of the selection board are either local councillors or nominees of political parties.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is inappropriate that political representatives should be entrusted to make such appointments.  It is unfair to the political representatives in that it exposes them to the possibility of being canvassed either directly or indirectly to vote for one candidate as opposed to another, not on the basis of a candidate's ability but on a party political basis.  It is unfair to applicants in that they may feel they must make representations in order to have a chance of being appointed.  It is also unfair to a successful candidate in that even if he or she is appointed on merit suspicion can still exist that political influence was brought to bear.  Such a system undermines confidence not only in the appointment procedures but in the whole system of vocational education, This is tragic and should be put right by the removal of appointments from the political arena into the ambit of a recognised professional body such as the Commissioners for Local Appointments.</P>
    <P>There is another reason I favour the Local Appointments Commission having responsibility for the appointment of vocational teachers.  The members of vocational education committees are appointed to these bodies to formulate policy on behalf of the people of the area and to oversee the implementation of that policy in the school and colleges under their control.  That system was introduced in 1930 by the then Cumann na nGaedheal Minister, John Marcus O'Sullivan, to serve this country well. The point I am making in relation to the Bill under discussion is that members of vocational education committees do not <Col N="1305" /> have the training or the expertise to interview teachers, school principals, lecturers in regional colleges and adult education officers nor indeed could they be expected to have.  Interviewing and appointing teachers of a variety of subject disciplines is a skilled and specialised business and it needs to be handled by experts trained in the skill of interviewing and with sufficient specialised knowledge to ensure that the best candidate is appointed.  Some of the appointments covered by this Bill would carry salaries of up to £25,000 and these are significant appointments by any criteria.  The persons appointed will remain in the service for a considerable period of time and most important of all they are entrusted with the vitally important task of educating our young people.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Keeffe said that these people need local knowledge and knowledge of the ethos of the school. Does that mean that even though a teacher may be well qualified, because they would not fit into the ethos of a school they should not be appointed?  I do not know what local knowledge of a school means because I am sure the same teaching is carried on in all schools.  It is a very lame argument to say that the appointments committee should have local knowledge in order to appoint a teacher.  I taught in a comprehensive school in Tarbet and there were teachers from all over Ireland in that school. Those teachers were appointed by an appointments committee who were based locally and I am sure they had no local knowledge when they appointed those teachers.  We owe it to our young people, our teachers and ourselves as public representatives to ensure that appointment to these positions are above any shred of suspicion and are so designed as to ensure that the most able candidates get the job. By adopting this Bill we will meet those objectives.</P>
    <P>There have been widespread demands for reform of the appointments system in the vocational sector, no least from the teachers themselves.  Year after year at the Annual Congress of the Teachers' Union of Ireland motions are passed for <Col N="1306" /> reform of appointments in vocational schools and colleges.  It is time to take cognisance of these representations and take a step which will be of great benefit to all concerned in vocational education. I know for a fact that representations have repeatedly been made by the teachers both to the Irish Vocational Education Association, the IVEA and to the Department of Education seeking a notice to the effect that &ldquo;Canvassing will disqualify&rdquo; to be inserted in all public advertisements for teaching posts.  I regret that this provision, which is widespread throughout State and semi-State employment, did not find favour with the majority of vocational education committees. I wonder why.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of this Bill, I urge the Minister, in conjunction with the Irish Vocational Education Association, who are effectively controlled by her party at the moment, to have this provision implemented forthwith.  In all advertisements for jobs within the vocational education system there should, like all other advertisements, be a sentence at the bottom of the advertisement stating that canvassing will disqualify. I cannot understand why that sentence cannot be inserted in advertisements for teachers in the vocational sector.  As I have said, repeated representations have been made to the IVEA to have this provision inserted and I am boggled as to why it is not done.  I call on the Minister to examine this matter.  She may not be aware of the reasons it is not done at present but it deserves to be questioned and examined.</P>
    <P>In the event of this Bill being passed by this House, and I confidently expect that it will be, all we will be doing is bringing the appointment of vocational education teachers into line with other professional appointments in the local authority services.  If engineers, draftsmen, administrators, doctors and social welfare workers are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission, then why not teachers?  This Bill does not seek any special consideration for teachers; rather it seeks to have them treated in the same manner as other comparable <Col N="1307" /> local government officers.  Was it not for this very purpose that the Local Appointments Commission were set up in the first place and to ensure that our local authorities appointed staff in a fair way and were seen to do so, a way which would command the respect of all and which would not be tarred with allegations of political interference?  If this is so, then we should use the commissioners for the purpose for which they were established.  I was glad that Deputy Quill referred in particular to rate collectors who as recently as ten years ago were appointed by local authorities.  Last night Deputy Molloy claimed credit for removing that responsibility from local authorities and giving it to the Local Appointments Commission.  I understand that the appointment of rate collectors was one of the most politicised appointments by local authorities.</P>
    <P>No matter what the politics of a teacher or rate collector, he or she should not get a job because of political affiliation.  The best person should get the job.  There should be no suspicion surrounding the appointments.  At different times, different parties control vocational education committees.  This Bill is aimed at taking that pressure from public representatives, which is very reasonable.  I could not see why the Bill should not be accepted.  I was somewhat amused to hear the Minister say:</P>
    <P>The centralisation of selection procedures for VEC teachers under the Commissioners for Local Appointments would be contrary to the devolution of authority to the appropriate operational level. </P>
    <P>This view was also expressed by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who expanded on it this evening.  If this is so in the case of teachers, is it not also the case for the multiplicity of other professional grades in the local authority services that are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission?</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument is without foundation as, indeed, is Deputy <Col N="1308" /> O'Keeffe's.  The real block to decentralisation lies not in the area to which the Minister referred but to the stranglehold that she and her Department keep over the funding of the VECs.  With the abolition of rates, to which I have already referred, the funding for VECs, as in other areas of the local authority service, became centralised.  It was centralisation of funding which inhibited the local initiative of not only the VECs but every county council throughout the country.  I am sure that Deputy O'Donoghue would agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are ineffective now because they do not have the necessary funding, or else they cannot decide on how to spend the funding.  Deputy Higgins mentioned that even when money becomes available from the EC, again the members of the local authorities will have no say in how it will be spent.  It will be some official from the Department of Finance or the county manager who will have that say.  The local representatives will have no say in the formulation of plans or in making decisions.  The point has been made by Deputy O'Keeffe forcibly and by Deputy Wright that what we are trying to do here is take away power from local authorities, from local VECs. This is a small power and will not damage the local authorities substantially, or in any way, compared with the damage that has already been caused to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the number and variety of appointments would lead to delay if centralised.  She suggests that 350 appointments are made annually by the VECs.  I have been a member of a VEC for a few years and have seen very few appointments made.</P>

I would point out with regard to the education cuts which the Minister introduced that, as Deputy Higgins said, it did not start with the present Minister; it started, I think, in 1983, but the more severe cuts have occurred in the last few <Col N="1309" /> years.

With the projected decrease in school population, the number of appointments will decrease rather than increase.  Why was Deputy O'Keeffe making such a fuss about the delay?  If you do not have any teachers to appoint, where will the delay come in? That argument does not stand up.</P>

      <P>The talk about the delay in getting the appointments commission to come together does not hold. It is very easy to appoint the number of teachers who would be appointed anyway.  This is an unfounded argument. The Minister, but even moreso the Deputies on her side, are trying to cloud the issue that is involved here.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred at some length to the regional technical colleges and her intention to give them more authority within the VEC system.  This is a sentiment with which I would agree totally. She suggests that appointments to the colleges will be revised in the light of the proposed legislation.  If she brings forward this legislation as soon as possible she will have the total support of this side of the House, from all parties.  It is very important that we now upgrade the role of regional colleges, especially considering their great potential with regard to the new structural funding and their role in the various regions.  The sooner the legislation making their role more clear-cut and giving it more purpose is enacted, the better for the future standing of our regional colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, according to the Minister, <Col N="1310" /> the appointment of staff to the RTCs is governed by a letter to the president of the IVEA dated October 1979.  It is a pity that the provisions of the letter to which the Minister refers are not more widely circulated.  To my knowledge there is confusion in the colleges concerning the appointment procedures.  A matter of the importance of the appointment of staff in an RTC should, in any event, be the subject of a circular letter from the Department of Education to all the interested parties and not contained in a letter to any specific individual, irrespective of who he or she may be.</P>
    <P>I certainly support vocational education. Being a former teacher in a comprehensive school, I am a vocational teacher.  I believe that on the passing of this Bill vocational education will be strengthened.  I know that where vocational education committees seek to assimilate staff from secondary schools into their system where schools amalgamate, one of the greatest problems experienced is the fear of those teachers that their promotion prospects will be affected by political considerations.  That is an argument that I hear used all the time when vocational education committees or other groups are trying to introduce amalgamation around the country.  The argument is given by teachers in the secondary sector that they would be afraid to enter into a system where promotion and the granting of posts would be in the hands of politicians.</P>
    <P>There is a perception out there that it is not a fair system.  I am not making any accusations against anybody, but that perception is there.  This Bill is designed to remove that suspicion.  It must be welcomed for that.  Let us remove the appointment of vocational teachers from that area of suspicion.  The objective will be achieved by the passing of this Bill.  I compliment our spokesperson on Education, Deputy Birmingham, for bringing forward this proposal.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the appointments made both in the primary sector and the private secondary sector are also questionable.</P>

      <P>In page 24, in line 28, after &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or insurance agent&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is to give power to the Minister to require bonds of agencies as well as of brokers.  The arguments made earlier in relation to this part of the Bill dealt with potentially unfair competition between brokers and agents, in that agents do not have the same heavy responsibility in relation to indemnities, maintaining office standards, etc., as brokers have.  One of the problems relates to indemnity insurance and that is why I suggest that both might have to have indemnity insurance.  The arguments have been made already and I do not want to go any further into them.</P>

      <P>I take it we are talking about adding &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; after &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; in this section.  It is not proposed that agents would require professional indemnity.  It is proposed that brokers will have professional indemnity and the reason is that under section 50 of the Bill insurance agents are already provided with partial professional indemnity. Indeed, under that section, insurance companies are fully responsible for tied agents and under section 51 the insurance <Col N="1312" /> company will be responsible for premiums paid to intermediaries for renewal and accepted proposals.  Because of the responsibility of the insurance company for the agents, as it were, it is not necessary to lay the professional indemnity requirement on the agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, does the Minister not accept that an agent could give advice to a member of the public and is, therefore, acting as an agent?  Surely the whole idea of professional indemnity insurance is that, in the event of a claim for negligence being brought against a person, there are means to meet a particular claim.  There is a very big difference between a tied agent and an agent.  A tied agent is tied solely to a particular insurance company whereas apparently this Bill is endeavouring to provide for brokers, semi-brokers and tied agents.  The whole concept of professional indemnity insurance is to have cover in the event of a claim for negligence being brought against you as a result of improper practice or advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point that there is a difference between agents and tied agents. However, because of sections 50 and 51, it is not necessary to lay down professional indemnity insurance as a requirement for agents because of the large responsibility which the company have for the agents, tied or otherwise.  It is clear from section 51 which company the agent was acting for and, in those circumstances, the person who might feel that his or her agent has been negligent would almost certainly have a case against the company via the agent for professional negligence.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear why brokers should have professional indemnity but there does not seem to be any requirement or need for it in relation to agencies because of the fact that we are now effectively making companies responsible for agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 50 defines a tied agent and, by its very nature, it <Col N="1313" /> means a person who is tied to a particular company and who clearly acts on behalf of that company.  However, we are talking about a sort of semi-broker who acts for eight particular companies and I do not think one could argue in law that a person is tied to eight companies.  A tied agent means that if I am selling insurance I am acting on behalf of a company to which I am tied, whereas an agent with four companies on the general side and four on life has discretion as to where he or she will place the business.  They are not tied to a company and, therefore, they play the role of broker and decide to which company they will give the business. Surely claims for professional negligence can arise in those instances?  It is different when you talk about the treatment of premiums paid to intermediaries, that is where somebody is acting as an agent on behalf of an insurance company and the company accept liability for the premium collected on their behalf. However, we are talking about professional negligence and there is a very big difference between that and collecting premiums for somebody else.  I think Deputy Bruton is right.</P>

      <P>Let me point out that when I refer to section 51 I am referring to the new section 51 which I propose to insert in the Bill and not the section currently marked as section 51.  Under the new section it would be clear which company the agent is acting for.  If we take the case of an agent acting for a maximum of four it would be clear under the new section 51 which of the companies the agent is acting for in each case. Therefore an aggrieved person who feels that an agent has acted in an negligent manner could take a professional negligence action against that company.  It would be possible to identify the company in question.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is missing the point.  We have a solicitor present among us whom, I am sure, has professional negligence insurance.  A professional negligence claim can arise from the giving of improper advice to a person <Col N="1314" /> who suffers as a result.  If I were to give advice to individuals and then decide where I am going to place that business I would be acting as an independent agent up to the point where I decide that I will give the business to a certain company.

If I were to go out to meet Deputy Brennan, who places a problem in front of me, and asks would he be covered if such a thing happened and I, as an agent acting on behalf of four agencies, advise him that he would, with the result that he goes ahead and takes out a particular policy and I decide to give the business to one of the four companies I act as agent for, fill up the proposal form and give it to one of the companies who accept the proposal form and underwrite the risk, this would not take away from the fact that prior to any proposal form being <Col N="1315" /> completed that I gave advice which turned out to be incorrect.  Therefore, I would need to cover myself against the possibility of a professional negligence claim being made.  How could the company be held responsible in respect of any advice I may have given prior to the filling in of a proposal form?  This is the point that is being missed.</P>

      <P>I can see that the Deputy is concerned but I am convinced that the provisions of the new section 51 which I propose to insert in the Bill would meet his concern.  As it would be possible to identify the company it would be possible to sue the company.  The Deputy is saying that an independent agent may give general advice on insurance which may turn out to be inaccurate but that is a difficult matter to pin down.  What we are talking about is the giving of advice pertaining to a particular proposal form. I would not envisage the agency getting involved to any major extent as they would not have an enormous proportion of the market.  By definition they would not maintain the overview maintained by brokers.  Therefore, I would not envisage them being involved to a major extent in the giving of specific advice.  Where specific advice is given the company may be sued in respect of negligence on the part of the agent.  Only a very small area may be left uncovered but I am convinced it is reasonably small and of no great significance.</P>

In the example the Deputy has given where he advises a particular customer, fills up a proposal form and sends it off to the insurance company, he would then be dealing with a specific insurance company. If it turns out to be the case that the advice given is very bad the company could be held responsible.  We cannot do any more than that.</P>

This is despite the fact that I could have given it to any one of the four companies.  That is what professional indemnity insurance is all about.

If that person asks me if he be covered under his existing policy if such a thing were to happen and I reply that he would, and complete a proposal form in respect of some other class of insurance and it subsequently turns out that the event the person referred to actually happens and goes along to the company only to find out that the advice I gave was wrong, even though I was not involved in that case, surely as a professional insurance agent I would have some liability in law for negligence.

It goes on to say: &ldquo;In such circumstances only, the insurer shall be responsible for any errors or omissions in the completed proposal form&rdquo;.  In those circumstances alone where he fills the form out in his own hand under section 50, is he deemed to be the agent of the insurance company, thereby proving my point that in every other single case he is the agent of a customer, not of the undertaking?

      <P>I want to take this instance as an example.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to allow the Minister to require professional indemnity insurance of agents if he decides to do it.  It is simply to give him the power to do it.  It is not requiring him to do it. If there is a doubt, as there may be, in the Minister's mind &mdash; we are not in the time available to us here this evening going to be able to come to a conclusion as to whether the Minister is right, whether Deputy Barrett is right or whether the truth is somewhere halfway between the two &mdash; surely the sensible thing to do is take the power to impose professional indemnity as the amendment propose.  If on reflection the Minister discovers it is not necessary to use it, then he does not use it.  Surely he should not reject an amendment which simply gives him a facility to take certain protective measures merely on the basis of a difference about facts between himself and Deputy Barrett.  If there is such an argument, let him take the facility, use it if he needs it and not use it if he does not need it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy feels very strongly about adding &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; I am happy to accept that, but I want to put on record that the intention will be not to use it in these circumstances for the foreseeable future.  If it is important to the Deputy we will be happy to take it.  A person dealing with an agent will be informed under the provisions of the Bill that the agent can only offer a policy with four companies and that limits the quality of advice that can be given. The only area that is out of this professional indemnity provision is the advice area.  Most of that advice will come from brokers.  Companies with a small number of agencies are being told in this legislation to stand over the errors and omissions of the agent.  I think the Deputies are overstating the case.  A company who stands behind the errors and omissions of the agents are a fair solace for the public.  It is fair cover for the public to know that the insurance company stand over the errors and omissions of an agent. Really I do not see what the fuss is about.</P>

      <P>This is concerned with a provision here whereby the Minister may increase the amount of the bond required of an insurance intermediary.  The Minister has power under this Bill to prescribe different amounts for the bond and to increase them as he wishes by order.

      <P>We had something similar earlier in the day where this idea of a positive affirmation of an order was suggested as a better approach than giving the House power to annul an order or regulation that was laid before the House for a 21 day sitting period.  It was explained at that time that in this industry it is important to be flexible, to be able to act swiftly and to be able to make <Col N="1322" /> orders and regulations.  As it is the Minister will have to wait for 21 days to see if the House will annul the order, it might unnecessarily slow down the procedure if the Minister of the day had to seek an order to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, because there may be a degree of urgency about it.

Subsection (3) reads &ldquo;...holds a bond to the value of £25,000 or 25 per cent of life assurance turnover, whichever is the greater,&rdquo;. What is meant by &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;?  Is the Minister talking about claims going through an intermediary's account?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect I fail to see what is the purpose of this provision in relation to life assurance.  To my knowledge there are no insurance brokers in the country who would be holding life assurance premiums in bank accounts on behalf of insurance companies.  The business does not work that way; moneys are paid directly into insurance companies. Is the purpose of a bond to deal mainly with general insurance brokers or life assurance brokers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a consumer protection measure and applies to both.  It does not apply to turnover of less than £25,000.  In regard to the example the Deputy gave, explaining how the system works &mdash; that sometimes it is paid directly to the insurance company &mdash; I should tell him that, in that case, a bond is not required.  Under the provisions of the Bill, if the money is not paid into the <Col N="1323" /> account then it is not deemed to be &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; for the purposes of the section. Where it is paid directly to the insurance company obviously one does not have to get a bond.  That should alleviate the Deputy's concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To ensure that when people pay over funds to insurance intermediaries they are protected.  Incidentally the Deputy might recall the travel agents' bonding system introduced some years ago on which this provision has been modelled to a large extent.  The Deputy will recall travel agents running into difficulties when people were left without funds.  In a similar fashion this provision is to ensure that, if a broker has funds in the account and the company gets into financial difficulties, there is at least some cover there for people who have paid over their money.  It is a consumer protection provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that moneys held by an insurance broker on behalf of an insurance company are deemed to have been paid to an insurance company if the broker subsequently goes into liquidation?  The same does not apply in the case of the travel agency business.  In the non-life area no consumer has ever suffered as a result of an insurance broker going into liquidation.  In all cases the company will be deemed to have received the money even though the money might not actually have been received by them but had been collected on their behalf.  I fail to understand how the insertion of a sum of <Col N="1324" /> £25,000 will solve the problem because, by and large, the amounts of money that would be involved would be greatly in excess of that amount.  The point I am making is that, in the life area, it will not apply to any broker because at no time would any broker have in excess of £25,000 in a bank account on behalf of a life assurance company.  In the area of general insurance it has always been the practice that moneys paid to an insurance broker on behalf of a company are held by the broker on behalf of the company and a client has never suffered.  Therefore, I fail to see the need for the provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may well be right, that this consumer protection measure may not be necessary.  I accept that the Deputy's knowledge of the business is considerably better than mine on a day-to-day basis.  If the money is paid directly, if it does not reach the limit or whatever, that is fine, that protects the consumer.  In cases where the client account receives premiums, on either side &mdash; and I accept that it is not as serious on one side as the other &mdash; we are endeavouring to ensure a measure of protection for those funds while in the hands of the intermediary.  It may never be needed but it is important that it be included in the legislative provisions just as it was in relation to the travel agency business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we will enact the provisions of the section to ensure that those bonds are taken out where the money is in the account.  If the amount does not reach £25,000, then the bond is not needed.  Whether the provision applies is not up to me or the Government.  That will depend on the level of the account, when it is triggered in itself.  I do not trigger it; what triggers it is the level of the account.</P>

      <P>With regard to subsection <Col N="1325" /> (2) (b) may I ask the Minister two questions. How was the figure of £25,000 arrived at.  Obviously the provisions of this section deal with the incidence of fraud.  The reality is that most people will adhere to the business regulations laid down.  How will the Minister administer this provision if it is to be by reference to the preceding accounting year? Is it not the case the damage will have been done and the horse will have bolted if there has been a case of fraud?  If the person is of a fraudulent disposition he will have committed the crime.  Of what benefit will the provisions be in that sense?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one is setting limits one must make a stab at them; there is no real scientific basis for that figure.  It is an estimate of what might be outstanding for a month or two in the case of a smallish broker.  It is purely an estimate and is as good as anybody else's. If there is a better figure around, let us hear it, but it seems to us to be a sensible kind of figure given the type of turnover of many smaller brokerages.  We can base it only on the preceding accounting year; it is firm, audited, is there and is definite. I cannot think on what else it could be based.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern.  The bond will be there: once the client account hits the £25,000 level there is a requirement to get a bond for the remainder of the year to cover turnover to the extent of £25,000.  Once that bond is in place, if the company is wound up, that bond will be available to meet aggrieved persons' claims.</P>

    <P>Does not the same argument apply here? If somebody is intent on defrauding the system he will do so in a year in which he has no indemnity, bond or anything else. Why was this subsection included in the first place?</P>

That view is commonsensical and omits a whole range of smaller brokers, constituting a vast improvement on the circumstances obtaining.  The position obtaining is that there are no bonding arrangements.  An insurance intermediary can go down the tubes leaving people high and dry, and it happens.</P>

An insurance broker is issued with a renewal form, in the case of motor insurance, by an insurance company, he sends it to the client, collects the money and is deemed to have done so on behalf of the insurance company once the money is remitted to him.  If, subsequently, the insurance broker goes &ldquo;bust&rdquo; the insurance company are at the loss and not the client.  The client's cover is in force because the insurance broker has binding authority to put him on cover once he receives the premium.  Again, the provision shows a lack of understanding of the industry.  The Minister is asking brokers like Coyle, Hamilton and Hamilton, for argument sake, the largest brokers in the country on the general side &mdash; God knows how many hundreds of millions of pounds of a turnover they have &mdash; to take out a bond for £25,000 although they do not need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 27, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(d) he displays prominently, in such form as may be specified by the Minister, at the entrance to any premises in which he is conducting his business as insurance agent, a notice drawing attention to the fact that he is an insurance agent and not an insurance broker and indicating the distinction between the role and competence of an insurance agent and that of an insurance broker.  </P>
      <P>There has been a lot of argument about the difference between brokers and agents and the difficulty brokers have because of the more onerous requirements imposed on them.  On the other hand, people may not realise the benefit of dealing with a broker in that a broker has a much wider choice and a better freedom in the giving of advice than has an agent.  People may not realise that and my amendment is designed to require a person who is dealing as an agent to make it clear that he is an agent and not a broker and to indicate the difference between what is the competence of a broker and the competence of an agent.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has said that he was anxious that there should be such a distinction and my amendment would assist him further in that direction by requiring a public display of such a notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) (b) states that an insurance agent must state on his letter headings and business forms that he is an insurance agent and that he must name the companies.  A person corresponding with the agent will be well aware of the companies involved.  I do not know of any legislation that lays down for an industry or a profession a requirement that there should be a display in a hall or at an entrance to a building indicating the difference between it and <Col N="1332" /> the other end of the profession.  I could not imagine a solicitor's office having a notice to the effect that they were solicitors and would do the following work, and barristers having a board indicating the type of work they are involved in. The amendment is unnecessary and excessive.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy is just trying to make sure people understand.  I do not think it is necessary to lay on particular enterprises the obligation to display prominently at the entrance to their premises information as to the distinction between themselves and their competitors.</P>

Section 48 (c) provides that the agent has to inform any proposer of an insurance contract that he is an insurance agent and of the names of the undertakings for which he is an agent.  I take the Deputy's point that it does not go on to explain the law on the matter or what the differences between one and the other area, but I do not think we should deal with that by way of publicly displaying a notice.</P>

Is the person behind the counter obliged to explain that he is an insurance agent and not an insurance broker and that under the 1989 Insurance Act, he is an insurance agent because he holds eight agencies with insurance companies and is not an insurance broker because he does not hold ten agencies? That would be ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Anybody could call himself an insurance broker.  Are people allowed to put up plates and call themselves solicitors or accountants or whatever? Surely they must produce a piece of paper to show that they have qualifications.  Is the Minister going to send inspectors from his Department to every town and village to check on pieces of letter headed paper, telling people to take down signs because they do not qualify under the 1989 Act?  Who is going to stop me from calling myself an insurance broker when I am an insurance agent?  A person looking for advice might not even see letter headed paper at that stage.  Does the insurance agent have to explain to the customer that he is an agent and has four agencies with four companies?  Are we really serious?  How is that going to benefit the consumer?</P>

      <P>That is not what the Bill sets out to do, and neither did the 1986 legislation.  What we have done is to make a considerable distinction between brokers and agents.  Under this legislation it will be up to the companies who are signing the cheques, the people with the clout in this industry, to establish whether they are dealing with agents or brokers. If they are dealing with agents, the agent puts the four names on his letterhead. All we are talking about here is the misleading sign on the door.  At the moment there is nothing about that in the legislation; there is nothing about five or six <Col N="1334" /> agencies; there is nothing about professional indemnity or about bonding.</P>

We have put in bonding; we have put in indemnity; we have made the insurance companies responsible; we have made it possible for the public to know by looking at the letterhead whether they are dealing with agents or brokers, and that is a 100 per cent advance on the current situation where there is very little control and the public have no way of knowing with whom they are dealing.</P>
      <P>There are other areas where people call themselves things and it is a continuing problem because one could not possibly police it on a town by town basis. A broker is defined in this Bill, an agent is defined in this Bill, and therefore one is not entitled to call oneself a broker unless one complies with the Bill.  It is as simple as that.  The Deputy is not being fair in saying there is no way of knowing the difference between brokers and agents.  We are making a substantial difference here and it is as far as we can possibly go.</P>

It is absolutely outrageous.  It is no wonder that sometimes some of the legislation we pass turns out to be a laughing matter, and it is very discouraging to Deputies who try to make a contribution on non-political matters when they find their efforts totally frustrated in this way.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. la comes first.  I will indicate the amendment to the House.  In the third line of the new section 7 inserted in Committee after &ldquo;authorisations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in settling the level of such fees the Minister shall follow as closely as possible the movements of the consumer price index since the last previous occasion on which the level of such fees had been set&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In the third line of the new section 7 inserted in committee after &ldquo;authorisations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in settling the level of such fees the Minister shall follow as closely as possible the movements of the consumer price index since the last previous occasion on which the level of such fees had been set&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to get away from the situation where the Minister has complete discretion to increase fees under this Act without reference to movements in consumer prices, as a revenue raising measure.  We are asking that such fees be related to movements in the consumer price index.  This, I submit to the House, is a reasonable amendment and one which I hope the Minister will accept.  It does not constrain him not to increase fees but merely requires that he should do so in line with the CPI.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, the intention here is to relate these fees to the costs of supervision.  The level of fees payable by any particular company should, therefore, relate to the costs of supervision and the number of <Col N="1339" /> companies paying fees in accordance with whatever fee structure is finally set.  Any review of the fee structure and levels should take account of these factors and could result in either increases or decreases in particular rates of fees.  In these circumstances it might not be appropriate to relate the review of fee structure to movements in the consumer price index, although obviously that could well be taken into account.  It is more important that we relate it to the costs of supervision rather than to the consumer price index because the idea behind it is to cover the costs of supervision. That is a more practical way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>I will now ask how the amendment stands.  I must advise the House &mdash; it is hardly necessary for me to do so &mdash; that as we are now on Report Stage Members may speak once only, except the mover of an amendment who has the right to reply.  How does the amendment stand in the name of Deputy Bruton?</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Burton Mr. J. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1b:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister may, by regulation from time to time, increase or <Col N="1340" /> reduce the figure of £500,000 referred to in subsection (1) of this section, in line with movements in the consumer price index over the period since the figure was first set.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Under this section the Minister may set a minimum share capital requirement for companies.  This amendment proposes to allow the Minister to increase the minimum share capital requirement in line with the consumer price index by means of an order.  At present, as I understand the meaning of section 23, the Minister cannot increase the minimum share capital requirement other than by new legislation. That is unduly rigid and therefore I propose that the Minister should at least be able, by order, to keep the figure in line with inflation.  If he wants to increase it more than the rate of inflation, in other words to make a real change in the level of the minimum capital requirement, obviously legislation would be required. He should be capable, by order, of keeping the figure in touch with reality in relation to inflation because it is in line with the original intentions of the House as of this time.  Therefore, I propose this amendment as one that facilitates the Minister and I hope he can accept it on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are in the EC regulations.  Were the EC regulations to be altered we could alter these figures on foot of those regulations.  That might be a better approach than pinning it to the consumer price index.  The Deputy will appreciate that the consumer price index is not really the issue when talking about share capital of a company like this.  The main reason one would want to increase these fees almost certainly would have nothing to do with inflation or price increases, but with the supervisory powers and the capital structure of insurance companies.  To limit ourselves to altering them in line with the consumer price index would be restrictive.  Given the EC situation, I am satisfied that this provision is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we are <Col N="1341" /> passing Irish legislation here and we should take powers to amend Irish legislation as appropriate in light of Irish circumstances. If we could rely entirely on the EC to do this work for us we would not be passing this section at all and therefore I do not accept that argument.  In any event, a change in the EC regulation is something that may be decided in the light of conditions in the market as a whole in Europe.  It may be that we in Ireland would wish to make a change in the light of circumstances obtaining here and in that event it is appropriate that we should enable ourselves to keep this figure of £500,000 up to date in line with inflation.  That is all this amendment proposes. It does not require the Minister to keep it up to date and in line with inflation, it merely enables him to do it. In any event, I cannot see how a figure of IR £500,000 could be required in an EC rule in the sense that &mdash; I may be wrong here &mdash; EC rules would be expressed in European units of account.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate of the Irish pound to European units of account varies from time to time so a facility to the Minister which enables him to keep the figure in Irish pounds up to date, relative to inflation, might also enable him by regulation to keep it more closely in line with movements in the true value of the figure specified in the European regulations.</P>

      <P>... may by order amend the requirements as to their required value of paid up share value referred to in that subsection. </P>
      <P>Lest I gave the wrong impression the Minister can, by regulation, vary the amount.  I take the Deputy's point.  It is not related to the consumer price index. That is a different item.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete the new section 33 inserted in Committee and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 33.&mdash;(1)  It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that an administrator appointed under section 2 of the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, power to dispose of all or any part of the business, undertaking or assets of the insurer and to carry on any remaining business including the <Col N="1343" /> settlement of liabilities for the purposes specified in subsection (3) of section 2 of the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where an administrator shall have disposed of all or any part of the business, undertaking or assets of an insurer, there may, with the approval of the High Court, be paid out of the Fund to the administrator such amounts as are, in the opinion of the High Court, required to enable the administrator to settle the liabilities of the insurer in an orderly manner.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>I do not want to re-hash all the same arguments.  I want to deal particularly with amendment No. 2.  The same question arises as to why this section is being inserted in that particular form.  I hope that the Minister on reflection of the earlier discussion we had this evening may have come around to the view we were trying to put across.  The difference between his amendment which was passed this afternoon and our proposed amendment is that I am trying to ensure that the liabilities of the company are settled and that the matter is not left up in the air.  The Minister proposed the words &ldquo;with a view to the orderly completion of the administration&rdquo;.  I do not know what the words &ldquo;orderly completion of the administration&rdquo; are supposed to mean.  I do not know what standing that wording has in law.  I do not know what the Minister can enforce with that wording.  That wording says nothing and leaves the whole matter hanging in the air.  As we said earlier it allows the assets of the PMPA to be sold off and a shell left with no regard to the depositors and those whose liabilities are left with the PMPS.  I hope the Minister has had time for reflection and that he will accept what I believe is a very reasonable amendment setting down guidelines, which is what this House should be about, to add the words &ldquo;to settle the liabilities of the insurer in an orderly manner.&rdquo;. Surely it is desirable that the wording be used as opposed to &ldquo;the orderly completion of the administration&rdquo; which <Col N="1344" /> means absolutely nothing.  I would like to get the Minister's views on that and whether he will accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier we passed a Government amendment which I understood took account of the situation about which the Deputy is concerned, but he may not think so.  This amendment appears to restrict an administrator to the settlement of liabilities for the purposes set out in section 2 of the 1983 Insurance Act.  As already stated, the intention of the section is to make explicit the administrator's powers to sell the business of the company and to run off any remaining business, including all liabilities, with a view to the orderly completion of the administration.  I am quite satisfied that amendment No. 30 which has amended section 33 provides for this orderly completion of any administration to take place.  Therefore, I do not think this amendment is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into the detail of the discussion we had this afternoon and this morning I would like, nevertheless, to make an appeal to the Minister to consider the amendments before him in my name and in the name of Deputy Cullen.  The principle concern here is to facilitate the Government to an extent in having this Bill put into law because there are many things in it of a positive nature.  There still remains with us the lingering concern about certain aspects of the manner in which disposals, winding-ups and amalgamations of companies can take place unless there is some explicit safeguard built in.  That is what these amendments are designed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have thought about what the Minister said to us this evening in relation to the concerns which Deputy Cullen and I and, indeed, Deputy Bruton had earlier.  I am interpreting the general consolation he offered us in the most comprehensive way possible.  He said he did not envisage that there would be any circumstances where a court would dispose of assets.  It was never the intention or would not be the intention so to do.  He thought it would be right and proper that liabilities <Col N="1345" /> would be taken care of.  In other words, it seems to me that his policy and, therefore, the thinking of the Government, is that the worst possible interpretation, somebody purchasing, for example, the PMPA will not be drawn.  I still believe the Bill would be strengthened and some measure of comfort would be offered to the people who would be hit by this if what I and Deputy Cullen fear occurs if the Bill was amended along the lines suggested.  I appeal to the Minister to consider accepting these amendments. Essentially they seek to give reasonable guarantees in the event that a case is proven, guarantees sufficient only to write into law that which the Minister appears to believe will be inevitable, that which he clearly implies is his policy and that of his colleagues, and is the clear underlying concern of other Members in this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that he and many of us are passing through this House and he has an opportunity, as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce to put his mark on this Bill in a personal way and to rise above &mdash; I say this with respect &mdash; the conservative advice he would be given by people who are reluctant ever to suggest that an Opposition amendment would be accepted because they have had a chance to reflect carefully on their own drafting. There are Ministers in Government who have had the capacity and the courage to believe that now and again the odd reasonably good idea does emanate from the Opposition benches.  The difference between our amendments and what the Minister believes should happen is so slight in terms of the technical change to the actual Bill but so significant in terms of writing into law that which we all want to see achieved, that I suggest he take the responsibility, which is his in law, and exercise the authority which he has vested in him by virtue of his appointment as Minister of State and accept the amendment.  He would be doing a good day's work both in establishing his own authority &mdash; if I may be so bold as to say so &mdash; in the context of this Bill and in <Col N="1346" /> ensuring that the people we are concerned about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be expedient. The Minister has that authority, that flexibility and that power if he so wishes to use it.  It is his decision and I do not think it is reasonable for a Minister consistently to advert to the fact that he is advised this and he is advised that.  He should stand on his own two feet.  It is his job to say yes or no.  He should certainly take advice on board but he has to make the decision.  Having given this matter some thought since we last spoke about it, I cannot for the life of me see a difference between the terms of the amendment he suggested earlier and what we are now trying to achieve which would do any kind of injury to what the Minister says is policy and practice.  We must bear in mind that there are some 6,000 people who decided to put sums ranging on average from £1,500 to £2,000 into what they thought was the PMPA and are presently left high and dry.  They can continue to be left high and dry if this amendment is not accepted.  I am certain that is not what the Minister wants and certainly it is not what most Members in the House want.  I do not believe, therefore, that the Minister should take refuge &mdash; and I say this in the nicest possible fashion &mdash; in reference to advice he receives or to devices for evading his centrality of decision-making. It is his decision.  Up to now I think the Minister has been unduly inhibited or timorous about what he could and should do.  I would ask him in the light of events to consider the matter again and consider accepting this amendment, which would do what we all want to see achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> This amendment requires that a court in respect of the new section 36, which deals with the amalgamation of insurance companies, to take due account of the liabilities of any company that is being amalgamated or is agreeing to an amalgamation. It is a different way of saying the same thing that Deputies Cullen and Keating are saying in their amendment. It is absolutely important for the avoidance of doubt to give assurance to everybody that their existing legal rights are not going to be jeopardised in any way in the Bill to make it clear that the court in agreeing to an amalgamation &mdash; and in this case we are talking about the possible sale of the PMPA, but we could be talking about any number of other possible scenarios in the future &mdash; must take account of any liabilities of the company being amalgamated.  That does not create any new rights for any existing depositors in the PMPS, but simply says that any existing rights prior to the amalgamation must be taken into account by the court agreeing to the amalgamation.  To my mind that is eminently reasonable.  I do not mind which amendment we vote on but the House must decide on this important issue of principle and the sooner we decide on it the better.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 50, after &ldquo;believe&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at or before the time he is conducting the audit&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Certain accountants have expressed a problem about the provisions of the section.  This section requires auditors, if they have reason to believe that circumstances exist which could affect the insurers ability to fulfil their obligations to policyholders that they disclose this information to the Minister.  The amendment proposes that this would only apply at or before the time of conducting the audit.  If an audit had been completed and subsequently an auditor heard something, for instance on foot of a newspaper article, the auditors are concerned that they should not be required to report on that because they fear they would be required to report on a matter that had not come to their notice in the course of conducting the audit but something that came to their notice after the audit had been completed.  They are concerned about the wording in the sense that it throws them open to an undue degree of liability and that their auditing fees would have to be appropriately increased because of what they regard as an undue degree of liability for the giving of information to the Minister under section 35. The duty remains but it is only in respect of information they had at the time of the audit or prior to it, but not to information that comes to their attention subsequent to the completion of the audit.  I do not want to take a lot of time on this issue.  I have explained why I think it is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is between us <Col N="1350" /> on this is that we have taken the view that whenever an auditor is doing work for a client &mdash; thus it may be outside the audit time, when preparing taxation proposals, doing management consultancy work or engaged on specific financial assignments &mdash; and comes across such information, he should report it.  The Deputy's amendment would have the effect of limiting the reporting of it to whenever the auditor comes across it at the time of audit.  Perhaps the Deputy would reflect on this because an auditor might, while doing other accountancy work for an insurer, come across some of the information and it would be a pity if he was not able to report it at that time. I do not think there is anything sacrosanct about coming across information at the time of an audit as opposed to coming across it during a management consultancy assignment.</P>

      <P>This is another matter that is of concern to the auditing profession who are worried that they are now required to report directly to the Minister with regard to certain matters rather than to their client.  Simply for the sake of form, they want the report to be one that they must furnish to the insurer and that the requirement be placed on the insurer to furnish this to the Minister within two <Col N="1351" /> days.  It is academic, because it has to go to the Minister anyway.

This keeps the insurance company from the temptation to talk the auditor out of expeditiously reporting such matters.  In practice, the Minister would be informed almost at the same time.  Given the seriousness of the matters we are asking them to report &mdash; I appreciate the auditors' concern about this matter &mdash; we should make the reporting system direct. It would almost be at the same time in any case.</P>

      <P>In page 32, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;.&mdash;(1)  The duty of disclosure <Col N="1352" /> imposed by law on a person (in this section referred to as `the proposer') proposing to enter into a contract of insurance (whether initially or by way of renewal of an earlier contract) shall be limited to those material facts&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  which are actually known to the proposer or which, by virtue of subsection (3) below, he is assumed to know; and</P>
    <P>(b) which a reasonable man in the position of the proposer would disclose to the insurer, having regard to the nature and extent of the insurance cover which is sought and the circumstances in which it is sought.  </P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Act any fact or other matter is material, in relation to a contract of insurance, if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) in deciding whether to offer insurance against the risks covered by the contract; or</P>
    <P>(b) in deciding the premium or other terms on which he would be prepared to offer that insurance.  </P>
    <P>(3)  For all the purposes of sub-section (1) above, the proposer shall be assumed to know of any fact which could have been ascertained by reasonable inquiry and would have been so ascertained by a reasonable man proposing to enter into the contract of insurance in question.</P>
    <P>(4)  Notwithstanding the duty of disclosure referred to in subsection (1) above, the liability of an insurer under a relevant contract of insurance shall not be affected by the non-disclosure of any material fact if the circumstances in which the contract came into being (or, as the case may be, was renewed) were such that the proposer might reasonably conclude that the insurer was not concerned about the disclosure of that fact.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any provision of a contract (whether a contract of insurance or not) which purports, directly or <Col N="1353" /> indirectly, to enable the insurer under a contract of insurance to avoid the contract on account of, or to rely for any other purpose on, a failure by the insured to disclose any fact which, having regard to the provisions of this section he is under no duty to disclose shall be void.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This, fortunately, is just a shadow of a series of amendments which I had tabled on Committee Stage &mdash; 15 in all.  I realised that there would not be time to deal with them all at any length on Report Stage and I reduced the matter as the Minister suggested, to its very basis and I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>The issue involved here is essentially a very simple one.  It might seem complex from the 15 amendments I had down on Committee Stage but the net point is essentially simple.  We have reached a stage in our legal development that the duty of disclosure that the man in the street has to insurance companies on filling in proposal forms has gone to ridiculous proportions.  The courts themselves recognise that.  Something has to be done about it.  If a man in the street applies for a fire insurance policy on his home, he is presented with his proposal form which he fills in.  He is obliged in that form to warrant that those facts are correct and that every single remote item, no matter how trivial, has been disclosed, and if he slips up on even a trivial matter, he is out.  This is not some notional thing.  It was highlighted in a case to which Deputy Bruton referred earlier in the day which is reported in the Annual Review of Irish Law 1987 by Byrne and Binchy.  It says on page 38 of that report:</P>
    <P>In Keenan <i>v</i> Shield Insurance Co Ltd, High Court, 13 February 1987, the plaintiff took out a policy of insurance on his house with the defendant company.  The proposal form asked the plaintiff, inter alia, whether he had ever sustained loss or damage by any of the risks or liabilities he wished to insure against.  The plaintiff answered no.  The plaintiff was also required to <Col N="1354" /> sign a declaration at the end of the proposal form by which he warranted that the contents of the proposal were true and complete in every respect, and that no material fact had been suppressed or withheld.  In fact, one year previously, there had been fire damage to a pump for which the plaintiff had been paid a sum of money.  A fire took place in the house and the plaintiff claimed indemnity under the policy.  The company refused to indemnify on the basis that the plaintiff's declaration on signing the proposal amounted to a condition precedent of the insurance contract, and that he was in breach of warranty in failing to disclose the information regarding the payment arising from the pump fire...</P>
    <P>What emerges from the judgment is that although the non-disclosure could be described as trivial, as Blayney J held, it was the warranty which proved crucial to the outcome of the case, making the triviality irrelevant...</P>
    <P>In the context of a lay person being asked questions when applying for insurance, however, the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the sentence comprising the warranty is important....</P>
    <P>Certainly, the lay person would have no knowledge of the common law obligation arising from the contract of insurance, and while Blayney J stated the the warranty &ldquo;related to&rdquo; the common law obligation... </P>
    <P>All I am asking in this amendment is to provide what is, a very substantial safeguard for the insurance company.  I recognise that there must be an obligation on a person proposing insurance to give the fullest possible information.  All I am trying to safeguard is that where the matter is so trivial as to be almost irrelevant, the insurance company should not thereby be entitled to use trivia as an excuse for avoiding the entirety of the policy.</P>

      <P>That matter was examined <Col N="1355" /> in some detail by the English Law Commission in 1980.  Their summing up on page 52 of their report can be equally related to the situation here.  They said on page 52 of the English Law Commission's report on insurance law:</P>
      <P>4.56 A major criticism of the present law, as we have already noted in paragraph 3.20, above, is that an insured may well be unaware that he is under a residual duty to disclose material facts to the insurer when he has answered a series of specific questions in a proposal form, because these could naturally lead him to believe that the questions cover all matters about which the insurer is concerned to be informed.  Indeed, the very fact that specific questions are invariably asked in proposal forms, which is their essential purpose, may have the effect of creating a trap for the insured under the present law.  We have no doubt that this is a mischief which requires reform for the protection of the insured. </P>
      <P>What I am asking for is relatively minor. My amendment contains more than ample safeguards for the insurance company, specifying quite substantial obligations and responsibility for a proposer, but limiting what the insurance company may rely on, to material facts, and disallowing the insurance company from being enabled, as they are now, to rely on trivia and matters of little or no consequence to avoid paying substantial sums of money which in all morality they ought to be obliged to pay.  I am beseeching the Minister to favourably consider the urgent need for this amendment.  Byrne and Binchy went on to sum up the situation on page 40 of their book where they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Keenan and Curran cases illustrate the quicksand nature of the disclosure requirement in insurance contracts, and point to the extent of the information which must be provided by the insured person.  There is good reason for some requirement of disclosure bearing in mind the special <Col N="1356" /> risks attached to the insurance contract&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have provided for those in my amendment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and the fact that the insured may have peculiar knowledge of the relevant basis on which the insurance company makes its decision whether to insure. </P>
    <P>That is also covered in my amendment. They continue:</P>
    <P>But there has been increasing concern expressed that there is too heavy a burden on the insured to disclose information.  That would appear to be supported by the outcome of the High Court decision in the Keenan case above.  But as yet there does not appear to be any legislative move in this direction. </P>
    <P>The House now has a small but tentative legislative move in this direction and I hope the Minister will be able to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I want to very strongly support the case which has just been made by Deputy Taylor.  In view of the time I am not going to repeat the arguments he has made.  I had intended to put forward an amendment of this kind but Deputy Taylor has done the job in an exemplary fashion in a most comprehensive amendment. I strongly support him and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It is entirely wrong that insurance companies should be using small print and excessively using the <i>uberrimafides</i> rule to prevent the clear intention of the contract into which they entered from taking effect, and therefore I support Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of Deputy Taylor's deep interest in this matter and I have given the amendment as much time and thought as I possibly can but I still have some difficulty with it in a number of areas.  I have no problem with <Col N="1357" /> the objective the Deputy is trying to achieve but some parts of the draft would concern me.  By way of background I want to say that this matter originally came to light as a result of a commission report undertaken in the UK some seven or eight years ago.  The UK authorities have had seven or eight years to examine this matter and have backed off enacting a comprehensive provision such as the Deputy suggests.  We have had only a short few days to consider the implications of this amendment, which is lengthy and complex, even though the net point is a simple one.  I am not concerned about the net point but I am concerned at the length of time we have had to consider all the implications of a lengthy amendment to a Bill which we are about to pass, assuming the House agrees to it.</P>
      <P>The part of the amendment I have considerable concern about is subsection (4).  The last line of that subsection states &ldquo;...were such that the proposer might reasonably conclude that the insurer was not concerned about the disclosure of that fact&rdquo;.  That more or less says that if the person with the policy reasonably concludes that the insured would not be concerned about a fact being disclosed then that fact in itself would not affect him.  From my initial examination of the amendment I am concerned that the authority, onus and judgment is left with the proposer to decide whether or not the insured would wish to have known about a fact.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Deputy that I have drafted a short amendment which probably does not meet all his points but it is as far as I can go this evening considering the length of the Deputy's amendment and the proposal in sub-section (4), about which I have genuine concerns, to leave it with the proposer to reasonably conclude that the insured would not be concerned about the disclosure. That is too wide and leaves too much to the individual.  My amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister considers it necessary in the public interest, and following consultation with the <Col N="1358" /> Insurance industry and consumer representatives, he may by Order prescribe Codes of Conduct to be observed by undertakings in their dealings with proposers of policies of insurance and policyholders renewing policies of insurance in respect of duty of disclosure and warranties&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The reason I drafted this amendment is that the UK authority &mdash; and I do not make any apology for looking closely at what is done there; they have one of the most sophisticated and developed insurance industries in the western world and they have considerably more resources in their insurance area than we have &mdash; did not enact this provision but after discussions with the industry brought in codes of conduct and I am informed that those codes of conduct appear to be working satisfactorily in the UK jurisdiction.  Those codes of conduct deal with the extent to which nonmaterial disclosures can be used against a person who had a claim at some other time.</P>
    <P>This may not be the perfect solution to what Deputy Taylor wanted to achieve but it goes a considerable distance.  His amendment is lengthy, detailed, came extremely late and the new draft &mdash; this is not the fault of the Deputy &mdash; is literally hours old.  I am not concerned about the objective of the amendment but I am concerned about the wording of sub-section (4) which might pose difficulties for us.  I would be worried about putting that amendment into our legislation tonight and if the House agrees I am prepared to formally undertake to have discussions with the industry and take power to introduce codes of conduct.  I have drafted suggested wording for a new section which I am prepared to put forward now.  It might not pin down all corners but it will go a long way and I will give a specific undertaking here this evening to introduce codes of conduct to deal with the specific problem and ensure that something which is not material or frivolous does not subsequently trip up a person who overlooked it and did not think it was necessary at the time.  I know <Col N="1359" /> what the Deputy wants to achieve and I propose to achieve a similar thing by way of a codes of conduct system.  I will not only give that guarantee but I will write my amendment into the Bill this evening. The new section would read: &ldquo;Where the Minister considers it necessary in the public interest, and following consultation with the insurance industry and consumer representatives, he may, by order, prescribe codes of conduct to be observed by undertakings in their dealings with proposers of policies of insurance and policyholders renewing policies of insurance in respect of duty of disclosure and warranties&rdquo;.  I am prepared to put that amendment to the House for its approval and to move on it as quickly as possible.  We have some difficulty with the wording in the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot supprt the amendment because it is important that the numbers be sequential.  If it takes five agencies to be a broker, anything below that is an agent.  That makes commonsense to me.  I am not disposed to opening up a gap like that.  I am trying to have a neat line.  I do not want to introduce a third area.  The matter is complicated enough.  I know that Deputies have scoffed at this, but my second point is important and I mention it again.  The Attorney General has constitutional worries about removing peoples livelihoods perhaps even further than we are already doing in this Bill.  In this Bill we have, perhaps, already considerably reduced the earning power of many agents throughout the country.  We should think twice before we go further.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of deaths in Irish prisons.  Shall we say that the Deputy has 13 minutes in which to make his case with the Minister having seven minutes in which to reply? Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise what I believe is a very urgent and pressing issue in the proper administration of our prison service. The year 1988 must be regarded as the black year in the history of our prisons. While I am open to correction by the Minister, I believe there were more deaths in our prisons in 1988 as a result of suicide or otherwise than in any other year in the recent history of our prisons. The unfortunate message of the last year is that for some reason or another life in prison is cheap and people seem to hold the feeling that those who died were only prisoners.  This is an issue all of us must address and we have to try to dispel that feeling.  I would argue that we should be more concerned about the death of a person in the care and custody of the State than about the death of a person who dies at liberty in the community. There is an onus on us and for this reason it is important that this House takes a little time to debate and discuss what happened during the appalling year of 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only proper that I put on the record the names and dates of death of the six people who passed away while serving sentences in our prisons during the past year.  On 12 February 1988, Philip <Col N="1366" /> McGrath committed suicide in Mountjoy Prison.  The coronor's report recorded the death as being caused by cardiac and respiratory failure due to hanging.  On 16 April 1988, again in Mountjoy Prison, Michael McGowan died and it was subsequently established that he died by his own hand.  On 18 April 1988, Kevin McDonagh died in Mountjoy Prison, the verdict being death at his own hand.  On 30 June 1988, John Ryan died in Mountjoy Prison.  The inquest into his death decided on the reasons and cause of death.  On 3 July 1988, Edward Carey died of a drug overdose and, finally, on 30 September 1988, Francis McDonagh died at Arbour Hill Prison, the verdict being death at his own hand.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to accord my sympathy to the families and relatives of those six men and to say that each and every one of those deaths was a tragedy. We should try to learn lessons and make every effort to ensure that no further deaths occur.  I attended four of the inquests, two on 16 September 1988 into the deaths of John Ryan and Kevin McDonagh and two on 15 December 1988 at the Coroner's Court in Dublin into the deaths of Francis McDonagh and Edward Carey.  The remarkable feature of the inquests held on 16 September 1988 is that the jury, who were very interested in what happened, attached very constructive riders to their findings on the cause of death.  The point which needs to be made, and which I have made time and again, is that coroners' inquests are not adequate forms of inquiry into the cause of death or proper forms of inquiry to find out what happened in order that steps may be taken to prevent further deaths occurring.</P>
    <P>Juries are assembled under section 43 of the Coroners Act, on a simple request by the coroner to a member of the Garda Síochána who then has the duty to assemble between six and 12 members. At the inquest many years ago into the death of a young man who died while in custody in Rathfarnham Garda station, it was established that the manager of a local shoe shop was asked to attend as a juror but because the shop was busy that <Col N="1367" /> afternoon he sent the porter at the shop to sit in his place.  I have established that at the inquests held on 16 September 1988 all the jurors were from one particular section of a Department of Government. They were young and interested and attached riders to their findings in both cases.  However, the jury at the inquests held on 15 December 1988 were very silent and returned verdicts with no riders attached.  This makes one wonder about the method of selection, about how people are called and if advice or directives are given in advance of people being called.</P>
    <P>I say this because I am not at all happy. The lawyers who attend at these inquests attempt to establish, on what is for the most part a fishing expedition, some degree of negligence so that there might be ongoing litigation.  The terms of reference of any inquest are to establish how, where and when and no other questions or issues may be pursued.  Given the record number of deaths in 1988 would the Minister not consider at this stage that it is time we introduced a broader inquiry involving some form of independent agency to establish the causes of deaths and any patterns which might exist with a view to making firm recommendations on what actions may be necessary?  However, I do not have as much time available to me as I anticipated and I do not want to dwell for too long on those matters.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the jury at the inquests held in September 1988 attached very firm riders to their findings.  At the inquest of John Ryan it was established that the prison officer on duty had responsibility at the start of his duty for 80 cells on two landings of Mountjoy Prison.  By the time John Ryan was found hanging in his cell at 1.15 a.m. the prison officer had responsibility for 120 cells. This is an old prison constructed in the Victorian era.  It was established that the only means of communication was banging. Because of the nature of the construction only an echo sound would be heard throughout the landing with the result that a prison officer would not be <Col N="1368" /> able to pinpoint where noise is coming from.  That night John Ryan was banging on his cell.  His arm was in plaster, he was in pain and complained of this earlier in the night.  He needed attention but when found he was dead.  The jury said that a proper communications system should be introduced, one similar to that which exists at Arbour Hill Prison, a bell in every cell and a light outside every door in order to ensure that a prison officer would be able to pinpoint immediately the person seeking assistance and needing attention.</P>
    <P>The jury also commented on the ease with which people can hang themselves in cells and drew attention to the bars on windows which could be used to hang a sheet or shirt from.  They recommended that unbreakable glass be installed in prisons. It was established in virtually all the cases involving hanging that the glass in the windows had been removed to get at the bars on the outside in order to be able to hang a sheet from them.  They made that recommendation but I understand no action has been taken.</P>
    <P>At the inquest into the death of Francis McDonagh it was established that in Arbour Hill Prison because of the length of prison sentences served, and other related problems, a special observation list system was in operation.  Of the 140 prisoners in Arbour Hill, 130 of them in the main block, 100 were on this special observation list.  For whatever reason, security, medical or otherwise, the majority if not all of the prisoners in Arbour Hill Prison require special attention. On the night this prisoner died it was established that a prison officer had responsibility for upwards of 100 prisoners on his tour of duty.  Even though there is a very good communications system the point was established that if a prisoner takes it into his mind to do himself in, unless there is a mechanism whereby prison officers can observe more readily and frequently, it can happen, as happened unfortunately to this young man.</P>
    <P>Both McDonagh and the other prisoner who died in Mountjoy Prison, Mr. Kevin McDonagh; had been clearly <Col N="1369" /> established as potential suicide risks but that information had not been passed down to the prison officers.  At the inquest into McDonagh's death in Arbour Hill the lawyer representing the Prison Officer's Association pleaded with the jury to bring in a rider that manning levels be improved in prisons so that prison officers would have the opportunity more readily to keep an eye on what was going on.  He also made the case that prison officers be advised more readily and frequently and be kept up to date on problems affecting prisoners that may require particular attention.  There was a breakdown of communications. While the jury in the other case did not bring in a rider, the Minister should look at these clearly established facts.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the following proposals: that there be a proper communications system in all prisons and proper manning levels or, if necessary, a reduction in prison numbers particularly in Mountjoy Prison where there are so many short timers who should not be in prison at all; that there be a review of medical care for prisoners, the introduction and appointment of a medical director as recommended in the Whitaker report in 1985, that windows be repaired and some measure taken to ensure that people cannot hang themselves so easily.  For example, one has to consider a restriction on sheets.  Perhaps the use of medical paper sheets should be considered.  There is a question of whether drug addicts as John Ryan was or AIDS victims should ever be in prison. In the case in question a prison strike was in progress.  Proper training and advice should be provided for gardaí going in.</P>
    <P>In a number of these cases there have been applications for <i>ex gratia</i> payments to cover the funeral expenses.  I hope the Minister can respond early and favourably to those representations.  I know he has shown concern for these matters.</P>

      <P>Regrettably, deaths in prisons are not a recent phenomenon, they are a feature with which prisons administrations internationally have to contend.  Since 1 January 1988 a total of six persons have died in prison custody in this jurisdiction. Obviously, all of these deaths are a matter of the deepest concern and regret. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the number of deaths which occur in our prisons is out of line with the number of such deaths which occur in other countries.</P>
      <P>Here let me refer to a remark made by Deputy McCartan at the outset.  He said: &ldquo;It is coming out that life in prison is cheap.&rdquo;  This implies there is a lack of care on the part of the authorities for those in prison.  Great care is taken in regard to those whose lives may be in danger either at their own hands or at the hands of others.  Prisoners whose lives may be in danger from others are carefully segregated.  Those who may be in danger of death by their own hand are carefully assessed and attended to by prison staff, by the welfare service, by psychologists and doctors, by way of probation and so on as the need arises.  I want to make that clear because the implication of Deputy McCartan's comments must be looked at as I look at it. It must be dealt with here and now and not allowed go unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on previous occasions to this House in reply to a number of questions which raised similar issues to those raised here this evening, very strenuous efforts are made by the prison authorities to identify offenders who may be at risk and, where such offenders are identified they are given special attention by prison staff with the specific objective of minimising the risk of self injury. Offenders whose behaviour suggests they have psychiatric problems or that they might make an attempt at committing suicide are referred to consultant psychiatrists who visit the prisons regularly and, if the psychiatrist considers it necessary, they are transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for the necessary treatment.  While I am satisfied <Col N="1371" /> that all concerned are fully aware of the need to be vigilant in this area, it has to be accepted that it will never be possible to identify every possible potential suicide victim or to eliminate every possible avenue of self injury.</P>
    <P>Reports on all deaths in prison are carefully examined by the Prison governors and within my Department to see whether there is any action that might have been taken that might have helped to bring a potential risk to notice or that might have lessened any risk that was known to exist in a particular case or which might usefully be introduced in an effort to forestall similar tragedies.  The procedures for identifying and providing for offenders at risk are kept under continuous review and where measures suggest themselves which can reasonably be taken, these are taken immediately.</P>
    <P>It has to be accepted, however, that where an offender is determined to take his or her life, and not infrequently there is no prior warning of any such intent, there are limits to what the prison authorities can reasonably do.</P>
    <P>All deaths which take place in custody are the subject of a public inquiry in the form of an inquest.  In the case of two of the most recent inquests into the deaths of persons in custody, the jury added riders to their verdicts.  In one case, the jury recommended that improved methods of communication be established for use by prisoners while confined to their cells in Mountjoy Prison.  In fact, despite pressure on resources, money had already been provided for the installation this year of a new cell-call system in the context of a total re-wiring of the custodial wings in Mountjoy Prison.  Work has commenced on the renewal of the electrical system in the past few days and the provision of the cell-call system will be included as part of this project at the appropriate stage.  The existing cell-call system which was installed in the early 1900s had been dysfunctional for some time due to its age and the fact that it had been vandalised on a regular basis.  The jury also recommended that the staffing levels in Mountjoy Prison be increased. <Col N="1372" /> The question of staffing levels in each institution is kept under review in consultation with the various governors and is the subject of regular discussion with staff association representatives.</P>
    <P>In the interests of keeping the record straight, let me say in regard to one of the cases mentioned by Deputy McCartan, that the prisoner McDonagh at Arbour Hill hanged himself at 9.10 a.m.  He had his breakfast, went back to his cell and hanged himself.  A special list is kept of people who may be at risk.  The main purpose of this list is that they be kept under observation at night.  The event we are talking about happened after breakfast in the morning.  At the time Mr. McDonagh, regrettably, committed suicide about 30 staff were on duty.  The fact that one or more officers may have had people on the special list under observation at night was irrelevant in this instance.</P>
    <P>In another case the jury recommended that the windows of Mountjoy Jail be inspected with a view to rendering them less easy for a prisoner to hang himself from.  The question of the type of bars in prison windows is kept under regular review.  However, the reality remains that the requirements of security are such that it has not proved possible to devise an arrangement of bars which would be proof against use for hanging and which at the same time would meet security needs.  This is a matter which will continue to be looked at but &mdash; leaving aside the question of the cost of replacing existing bars &mdash; there are no grounds for optimism that replacement will prove feasible.</P>

      <P>The changes referred to by the Deputy would require legislation.  As has been indicated to the House on a number of occasions in the past I could not, in the context of <Col N="1167" /> parliamentary questions, say whether or not I have proposals for legislative changes in particular areas.  Such proposals are announced, in the ordinary way, only after Government approval.</P>
      <P>I would, however, refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 10 November 1987 in which I indicated that I did not see any need, from a practical point of view, to exclude by legislation the possibility that persons other than serving judges might serve on the Special Criminal Court since only serving judges sit on the court at present and there is no question, so far as I am aware, of any proposal to change that arrangement.</P>
      <P>As far as security of tenure is concerned the members of the court have the same security of tenure enjoyed by all judges.  As far as the third part of the question is concerned, the power of the DPP to direct that a person charged with an offence which is not a scheduled offence under the Offences Against the State Act can hardly be described as unfettered.  That power is subject to the requirement that the DPP must certify that the ordinary courts are in his opinion inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to the trial of the particular accused on the charge in question.  The DPP is by law independent in the exercise of his powers and there is no reason to suppose that he takes his decisions otherwise than with absolute impartiality and scrupulous regard for the law.  I am not at all convinced that it would be desirable to subject his power to refer cases to the Special Criminal Court to judicial review.</P>

      <P>I accept that the incidence of crime in a particular area is a factor which has to be considered in the allocation of Garda manpower and the Deputy may be assured that due weight is in fact given to it.  I would not, however, accept the suggestion which appears to be inherent in the Question, that the level of Garda manpower to be assigned to an area should be directly proportional to the level of recorded crime in that area.  Such a suggestion takes no account of other important factors which are relevant to Garda personnel deployment policies. These include the extent of rural areas that must be policed, the economies of scale that can be achieved in policing large urban areas, the security requirements of particular locations and the extent to which support staff may be available in certain areas to supplement the services of operational gardaí.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána must be deployed throughout the State in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that all areas are provided with a Garda service commensurate with their needs, taking into account that there is a limit to the total Garda resources that can be made available. Decisions in regard to the number of gardaí to be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area are, as in the case of any other area, based upon a professional assessment by the Garda authorities of the relative policing needs of all areas throughout the whole country.  Garda personnel deployment strategies are constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are assigned to where they are most needed at any given time.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the particular crime problems that are associated with the DMA and I fully appreciate the need to keep Garda strength there at a level where it can effectively cope with these problems.  I have regular consultations with the Garda Commissioner about my concern in this regard and I am satisfied that full consideration will continue to be given to the particular policing needs of the DMA.</P>

      <P>Since July 1987 vaccine against hepatitis B has been available at State expense to members of the Garda Síochána who have a genuine case for receiving it, based on the nature of the duties they discharge. It is a matter for individual decision by each member concerned whether to avail of the vaccine.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities naturally regard attacks of this nature with the utmost seriousness and have put into operation a number of measures specifically designed to tackle the problem.  These include mobile patrolling of areas deemed to be of special risk, and the manning of checkpoints to carry out spot checks on suspect cars.  Also members of the Force visit elderly people who might be at risk to advise them of ways of improving their own personal safety and the security of their houses.  In addition, the Garda work closely with voluntary agencies that are involved with the elderly, such as Muintir na Tíre which organises the very successful community alert projects.  This involves members of the community in maintaining contact with elderly people and in bringing any suspicious circumstances to the notice of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures are proving to be effective. The 1988 level of recorded attacks on elderly people in rural areas was just over one-quarter of the level recorded in 1984 when the problem was at its peak.

      <P>In accordance with a decision by the Government some years ago, certain cash movements are escorted by the Garda and the Defence Forces to ensure that the cash does not fall into the wrong hands.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost of providing escorts in 1988 has not been separately compiled and that it would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and effort to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The escorts are necessary in the public interest and have not been requested by the security companies or the financial institutions.  In addition, substantial amounts of the cash escorted are for distribution as social welfare payments.  In <Col N="1178" /> these circumstances, recoupment of the cost of the escorts is not sought.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not accurate to say that the Investigation Unit (popularly known as the &ldquo;Murder Squad&rdquo;) attached to the Technical Support Services Section in Garda headquarters was disbanded at any time. A corps of highly experienced major crime investigators has always been retained in this unit but, as part of an internal re-organisation which took place in April 1988, a number of detective gardaí were transferred from the unit to stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The Garda <Col N="1179" /> authorities considered that their services could be used more effectively in this way, when they were not required for major crime investigations.  The services of these members can still be made available on request when needed for any special investigation.</P>

      <P>The late husband of the person concerned was last insurably employed in the United Kingdom.  She applied for a death grant on 2 February 1989.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a death grant certain insurance contribution conditions need to be satisfied on the insurance record of the deceased person.  As the late husband of the person concerned did not have an Irish insurance record, details of his United Kingdom contributions have been requested to ascertain if a death grant may be paid on the basis of such contributions.</P>
      <P>A funeral grant is only payable where the insured person dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease.  The Department has no trace of a claim to a funeral grant from the person concerned. There is no trace either of a claim from the person concerned for a contributory widow's pension.  A claim form has been issued to her.  When this form is completed and returned her claim will be considered and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>
      <P>Under EC regulations, the disability benefit claim is the responsibility of the UK authorities.  The claim was forwarded to the Department of Health and Social Security early last month for their consideration together with the medical evidence in connection with the claim.</P>

      <P>Applications for work permits were received on 25 March and 27 October 1988 respectively, from the prospective employer of the persons to whom the question relates.</P>
      <P>The position is that immigration regulations have not, as yet, been fully complied with by one of the persons concerned, and the employer has failed to furnish certain information requested from him in connection with the applications. In the circumstances, it has not been possible to complete the processing of the applications.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware my policy in regard to the granting or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that, as far as possible, employment opportunities arising here are reserved for Irish or European Community (EC) nationals.  The issue of a work permit is, therefore, not considered unless the employer can show that there are no suitably qualified Irish or EC nationals available for the position in question.  This policy applies to the granting of permits for ethnic restaurants as for other sectors of the economy.  Up to now the expansion of this sector of the catering industry has not led to any significant employment opportunities for Irish or EC nationals.</P>
      <P>This situation is not acceptable, particularly as my Department understand from the relevant professional bodies that in many cases there are no special skills involved that an Irish apprentice chef could not readily pick up after a period of on-the-job training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to improve the situation I have <Col N="1200" /> insisted that, as a condition for the granting of work permits for ethnic restaurants, they must employ trainee staff from the local workforce.  In this respect in accordance with the policy guidelines outlined above, I arranged for officers of my Department to contact the employer and request that information be provided which will support his statement regarding the number of Irish/EC employees on his staff.  No response to this request has, as yet, been received.</P>
