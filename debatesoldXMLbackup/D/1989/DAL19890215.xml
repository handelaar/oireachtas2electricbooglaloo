    <Title>Garda Síochána Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="250" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, and the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 to enable members of the Garda Síochána to serve outside the State with peace-keeping forces of the United Nations. There is a particular reason for this Bill being introduced now and for its passage through the House being a matter of some urgency.  Following the successful conclusion of negotiations between all the parties concerned in the dispute over Namibia, South West Africa, Ireland has been called on to supply in the next few weeks a national contingent of members of the Garda to serve there with the United Nations forces.  The UN force in Namibia will be known as the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and it will assist in the peaceful transfer of power in that country to its own population.  The Garda Síochána Acts preclude members of the Garda from serving outside the State and the Government are advised that it is necessary to enact amending legislation now to enable them to respond urgently to this request from the United Nations and, indeed, to be enabled to meet any future such request.</P>
      <P>As the House will know, Ireland has taken a keen, and sometimes prominent, interest in Namibian independence. Since we joined the United Nations in 1955, successive Irish Governments have spoken out against South Africa's occupation of the territory and have urged the international community to bring pressure to bear on South Africa to withdraw from the territory so that its people could exercise their right to self-determination.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me here to rehearse the entire history of United Nations involvement in the Namibia issue, a history that is long and complex &mdash; politically, diplomatically and legally.  It is, nevertheless, worth while to recall its main outlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> In 1920, South Africa was entrusted by the League of Nations with a mandate over the territory of South West Africa, now called Namibia.  After the demise of the League, South Africa, unlike other mandatory powers, declined in 1946 to place the territory under UN trusteeship. It declined also in 1949 to continue submitting reports to the UN on the territory as it was obliged to do under the UN Charter.  Moreover, in 1950 it refused to accept the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which held that the functions of supervision under the mandate should be exercised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Throughout the fifties and sixties, while South Africa consolidated its position in Namibia and applied to the territory many of its apartheid policies, the UN continued with its efforts.  In 1966 the General Assembly declared South West Africa to be henceforth a direct responsibility of the United Nations and the following year called on the Security Council to take effective measures to ensure the removal of the illegal presence of South Africa from the territory.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the Security Council reaffirmed the termination of South Africa's mandate by the Assembly, called upon South Africa to withdraw its illegal presence and stated that if South Africa failed to do so the Council would decide on necessary measures in accordance with the Charter. Ireland fully supported the decision of the General Assembly to terminate the mandate and welcomed the Security Council's decision to assume its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The legal position was clarified beyond any doubt in an advisory ruling of the International Court in 1971 which held that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately and that the member states of the United Nations were under an obligation to recognise the illegality of South African presence there.  This opinion was accepted by the Security Council and its efforts since then have been directed towards giving effect to these decisions.</P>
    <P>These efforts have crystallised around <Col N="252" /> two important Security Council Resolutions which provide the basis for the present settlement of the long running dispute over Namibia.  Resolution 385 in 1976 declared it imperative that free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations be held for the whole of Namibia.  Resolution 435 in 1978 endorsed an independence plan for Namibia based on settlement proposals drawn up the previous year by five members of the Security Council, viz., the USA, Britain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Canada.</P>
    <P>Following several abortive attempts by the UN to persuade South Africa to accept the UN settlement plan, the US in May 1988 initiated a series of talks with Angola, Cuba and South Africa to consider possibilities for a settlement to the conflicts in both Namibia and Angola. These negotiations finally reached a successful conclusion in December 1988 with the formal signing in New York of a series of agreements which paved the way with respect to Namibia for the official establishment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).  The role of the group set out in the UN Plan of 1978 is to oversee the transition of Namibia to independence.</P>
    <P>This plan which is currently under review by the UN envisages the establishment of a group comprising a military component of seven battalions of which four will be held in reserve, a police component of 500 and a civilian staff the number of which has not been determined. The functions of the police component, which will be required for a period of up to one year, will be essentially to prevent any intimidation or interference in the electoral process and to oversee the conduct of the existing police force in Namibia during the transition period.  The police will be organised in units drawn from the various national contingents.  The Government have already agreed to a UN request to provide 20 military observers for Namibia and these will be drawn from the ranks of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In 1978 when the plan on which the present negotiations are based was first <Col N="253" /> developed, Ireland was asked by the UN, and agreed in principle subject to the necessary legislative and administrative arrangements, to provide a national contingent of gardaí.</P>
    <P>The UN has now renewed that request for gardaí to serve with UNTAG and a contribution of up to 35 members of the force to the total police component of 500 has been sought.  A breakdown of the ranks of those it is proposed to send is as follows: one chief superintendent, two superintendents, two inspectors, seven sergeants and 23 gardaí.  The financial arrangements are likely to be similar to those for UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Namibia is the last major colonial issue before the United Nations and the Government are in no doubt that a successful outcome to a peaceful transition to independence there will represent a major success for the United Nations Organisation and, indeed, for the rule of law and for the principle of settling international disputes by negotiation. Our commitment to Namibian independence and our peacekeeping record with the UN in many parts of the world suggest that we should agree to help the United Nations in resolving one of its longest outstanding issues and one of its largest ever undertakings.  I am confident that our gardaí can, if called upon to do so, enhance the already outstanding peacekeeping record of our Defence Forces, and play a distinguished and honourable role in the historic task of helping to bring independence and self-determination to Namibia and peace and security to a troubled region.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the contents of this short Bill.  Section 2, subsection (1) empowers the Government to send a contingent of the Garda Síochána for service outside the State with an international United Nations Force and subsection (2) of section 2 enables the Government to determine the number and ranks of the members of the Garda Síochána who would be included in such a contingent.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill ensures that all the members of such a Garda contingent <Col N="254" /> would be volunteers and that, ultimately, the decision about whose offers to serve would be accepted would rest with the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I propose to move an amendment which will provide for the registration here of certain births and deaths occurring overseas during the service of contingents of the Garda Síochána with the UN.  This is intended particularly to deal with the situation in places where the civil authorities are not in a position to provide such certification, or to do so sufficiently quickly, because of disorder in the country in question or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>The death of gardaí on overseas service may not be a particularly likely eventuality and it is one that we would all earnestly wish would not occur.  However, I am sure Members will agree with me that it is far better to make provision now for such an eventuality in case it does arise rather than be left in the position of having to attempt to do so after that event.  The amendment which I am proposing should shortly be in circulation to Members who may be interested to note that it follows very closely section 6 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>In 1960, the then Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass, moved the Second Stage of the Defence Bill enabling Army contingents to be sent on UN missions abroad.  In his speech on that occasion, he acknowledged that our adherence to the UN Charter imposed substantial obligations on this country.  He also referred to Article 29 of our Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, which solemnly affirms Ireland's &ldquo;devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations, founded on international justice and morality&rdquo;.  As Seán Lemass saw it, it was not only our moral duty but also in our national interest to support the United Nations to act in any situation in any part of the world that might endanger peace and to be prepared, where necessary, to contribute from our resources to the fulfilment of the UN's responsibilities in such event.</P>
    <P>I would submit that the three decades <Col N="255" /> which have elapsed since the Dáil first agreed to national participation in UN peacekeeping missions have not changed the validity of our commitment to such activity.  They have, if anything, endorsed it.  It is for this reason that I have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has every reason to be extremely proud of the role we have played in the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.  We have been doing so for many years and we can be proud of the members of the Defence Forces who have served abroad on UN duty.  Unfortunately some of them have made the ultimate sacrifice through the loss of their lives.  We hope sincerely that this will not happen to any members of the Defence Forces in the future or to any members of the Garda Síochána who will take up this peacekeeping role.  Fine Gael have always supported our involvement in the peacekeeping role of the United Nations and will continue to do so.  I am quite certain that the Garda Síochána when they take up duty will not only make us proud of their efforts but will do much good for the Garda Force. I am confident of their ability to do their duty.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in that the numbers of gardaí have dramatically reduced during the past two years.  We now have a police force of about 10,600, compared to about 11,400 two years ago.  That represents a drop of about 800 in membership of the Garda Síochána.  Nobody in his right mind would suggest that this reduction has been justified by a reduction in the level of crime.  The contrary is the case.  The level of crime has increased dramatically during the past 12 months and the type of crime we are dealing with makes our situation very serious.  Border security problems must be faced on a daily basis and we must also deal with arms shipments for use by the IRA.  All these things have placed a tremendous burden on the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I and my party would certainly <Col N="256" /> support any effort to secure a peaceful transition to independence in Namibia, we must be conscious of our responsibilities at home.  We can do both, if the will is there.  This Bill deals not solely with Namibia but empowers the Government to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána to any part of the world on UN duty in the future.  It is wise to give the Government this general power.  We are talking about a specific instance here but the Government will be empowered by this Bill to meet future requests by the UN.</P>
    <P>In this instance 35 personnel are to be sent abroad.  I want an assurance from the Minister that if members of the Garda Síochána are asked to serve abroad the already depleted numbers of gardaí will not be further depleted.  There is no reason not to give such an assurance because the UN will pay for the cost of the gardaí serving abroad.  Therefore, there will be no additional cost to the Exchequer in increasing strength here to compensate.  Perhaps the Minister will give that assurance when replying.  If not, I have an amendment prepared which will be calculated on Committee Stage and I will seek the support of other parties.</P>
    <P>None of us is satisfied that the strength of the Garda Síochána is sufficient to meet the problems they are facing on a daily basis.  In England and Wales the strength of the police force has increased since 1979 by over 13,000 and now stands at 124,737, divided among 36 forces. They have recognised the need for sufficient numbers of police to safeguard democracy and the ordinary individual. We have the growing problem of drugs and unemployment.  These things have led to an increase in the level of crime and violence and there is no sign that it will decrease in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>On 31 December 1987 the strength of our police force was 11,109, while on the same date in 1988 the figure was 10,748 and I am told that the number has been further reduced since then.  In 1986 there were approximately 11,500 members of the Garda Síochána.  As I have said, there has been a reduction of approximately <Col N="257" /> 800 at a time when crime is on the increase.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the Minister for Justice conducted a marvellous PR exercise when he announced his intention to recruit an extra 1,000 members of the Garda Síochána.  This was designed to show Fianna Fáil's great concern for law and order.  Good PR work was done by P.J. Mara, but we discovered that it was all a con job.  A thousand new recruits were to be taken on, but over a three-year period.  Letters were sent out to the thousands of applicants who sought to join the Garda Síochána telling them that they had to sit an examination.  I am sure every Member of this House has met individuals who have since got letters telling them they were successful in the examination and that they would be called for an interview in 1991.  One of the conditions is that an applicant must be under 26 years of age.  What happens to those who are over the age limit in two years?  They will be disqualified even from an interview.  At a time when the numbers in the Garda Síochána have reduced dramatically, this is nothing short of a scandal.  We should have been honest and said that we could only afford to take on 300 recruits this year and that we would call a certain number for interview. People should not be left wondering what they should do before they are called for interview in 1991.</P>
    <P>Only 300 recruits are being taken on in 1989 and the natural wastage will far exceed that.  The numbers are going down and we are now being asked to give the Government approval to despatch members of the Garda Síochána on UN duty.  As I said, I have no objections to that as we have a moral obligation to play our part in any peacekeeping role in which the UN are involved.  As a country that suffered for a long time prior to our Independence we know its value.  We should be very proud of the fact that Ireland has been asked to play a part which is as a result of the record of those who served in the past.  I am quite certain <Col N="258" /> that the chief superintendents, inspectors, sergeants and the ordinary members will do us proud in Namibia.</P>
    <P>However, in addition to playing a peacekeeping role, we also have a responsibility to see that the people in this country retain their freedom.  The Government must face up to their responsibility in terms of dealing with the IRA who are not the slightest bit interested in Ireland retaining its democratic freedom.  These gentlemen want to destroy everything for which we fought and we cannot control them without having adequate, trained members of the Garda Síochána seeking these people and the arms which they import to destroy democracy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps social conditions have contributed to crime but we cannot expect the Garda Síochána to deal with it and to overcome the difficulties when every year their strength is reduced on a daily basis. At the same time the Government have not brought forward any new ideas in relation to restructuring or reforming the courts where gardaí are tied up daily waiting for a road traffic offence to be heard, which may be adjourned, with the result that the gardaí in question may have to come back many times.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are doing clerical work that could be done by civilians.  I know members of the Garda Síochána are needed for certain types of clerical work for security reasons, that is understandable but, by and large, there has been no reform in that area.  There has also been no reform in the area of road traffic offences.  There should be on the spot fines instead of involving gardaí in District Courts waiting for traffic offences to be heard.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but he and the House will agree that I have given a lot of latitude in dealing with this confined and limited Bill.  I am concerned that the debate may become too wide ranging. Detail should be dealt with on Committee Stage and wide ranging references should be left to the debate on the Estimate for the Minister's Department or <Col N="259" /> some other appropriate occasion.  Will the Deputy please confine his remarks to this Bill?  To go beyond the latitude the Chair has given would make a mockery of the debate on this measure.</P>

      <P>I respect your ruling of course but you will appreciate that the Dáil is being asked to give power to the Government to despatch members of the Garda Síochána to serve on UN duties whenever they are called on.  This Bill does not just deal with Namibia.  This could involve the Garda Síochána in all kinds of work abroad in future.  The Dáil, before it makes such a decision, is entitled to get an assurance from the Minister in relation to ways and means of reducing crime and supporting the Garda Síochána in their efforts to overcome those difficulties. If we are to make the decision which the Bill is asking us to do, we must be satisfied that other things are in place so that the loss of these men will not further impose strain on an already stretched police force and ultimately cause problems at home.  I strayed a little from the Bill but I hope you appreciate there was a purpose behind my argument.</P>
      <P>There should be reorganisation of our courts, laws and management structures in the Garda Síochána.  We should promote the juvenile liaison scheme to prevent crime in the future.  If we did that perhaps the Minister could then justify reducing the strength of the Garda Síochána by 800 in a period of two years. He cannot justify that because there have been cuts in the juvenile liaison scheme, there is a lack of support for the neighbourhood watch scheme and there has been no massive expansion in the concept of community policing, which I totally support, the old style community policeman working daily in settled or developing communities.  I want an assurance that these things will happen before agreeing to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party and I want to support this Bill and we have a moral obligation to play our part in peacekeeping with the United Nations, but the Minister must give us an assurance that we will not <Col N="260" /> suffer the consequences at home, particularly as the United Nations will pick up the tab for the cost of sending men abroad.  There will be no net cost to the Exchequer if the Minister agrees to what I am asking.  It is important, therefore, to get these assurances from the Minister to counteract the fears among the community in regard to the level of crime at present.</P>
    <P>I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, throughout your life as a respected public representative, and other Members of the House, particularly those who act as spokespersons for their party, will confirm that we get letters and telephone calls daily from communities expressing fear about what is happening on our streets.  A man telephoned my office the other day and I have a full report of the conversation he had with my secretary. He said that people cannot walk down Westmoreland Street without being challenged for money.  If they refuse to give it they are assaulted and this on the main street of our capital city.  That is only one of the many phone calls I get.  Others get on to me to complain that their wives, aunts, sisters or cousins cannot go out without being mugged, attacked or having their handbags snatched.  In my own constituency recently two people going home after a disco were stabbed, one of whom died as a result.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the fact that my colleagues also wish to speak.  Anything else I have to say will <Col N="261" /> have to wait for another day but we will keep on about this matter at Question Time, during debates on the Estimates and on any other occasion we have the opportunity until we get an assurance from the Government that it will be dealt with.  When in opposition Fianna Fáil told us continually of what they would do in Government.  They insisted on the setting up of a special committee of this House, the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and delayed the setting up of other committees unless such a committee was established. However, when they got into Government they refused point blank to reestablish the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism because they knew that that committee would expose the sort of things that they said they would do when in opposition but which they will not now do when in Government. We in the Opposition have every right to criticise those who make commitments and promises when in Opposition but who do not fulfil those promises when in Government.</P>
      <P>It is simply not acceptable that we be asked to pass legislation involving 35 members of the Garda Síochána &mdash; the issue, as I said, is much broader in that in the future the Government would have the power to dispatch personnel to take up UN duty &mdash; without getting an assurance from the Minister that there will be no further reductions in the strength of the Garda Síochána.  The force is already undermanned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which should be supported in principle.  Our history in terms of UN peacekeeping duties is extremely honourable.  As the Minister pointed out, Seán Lemass in introducing the first Bill to allow members of the Defence Forces to take up UN peace-keeping duties some 25 to 30 years ago set a precedent which has been followed through throughout the years.  Many members of our Defence Forces have served with great honour with a number of peace-keeping forces around the world under the banner of the UN.  In fact some members of the Defence Forces have lost <Col N="262" /> their lives which is a source of great sadness for us.  We are also resigned to the fact that some sacrifices are necessary and we appreciate the enormous sacrifice that has been made by those personnel and their families on our behalf and in the name of peace and the defence of freedom.  Our own history makes us aware that an impartial police force is something to be valued.  Over the years our own police force, the Garda Síochána, have displayed remarkable impartiality despite the great difficulties they have encountered.  Therefore, we are very well placed to provide the kind of personnel the United Nations need and who will represent this country in a fine manner in Namibia and other areas in the future, presumably.</P>
      <P>The history of Namibia is a very difficult one but I am happy to see that an end may be in sight to their difficulties. If Ireland can help in that process we should do all in our power to make it possible.  As I said, the Garda Síochána have over the years worked in support of the civil power and have worked with every Government who have come into power.  Given the number of countries that have faced difficulties with their defence forces and police forces we can look upon ourselves as being unusual in that we have not experienced any such problems despite the violent beginning of this State.  It is therefore unfair that the Garda Síochána to date have been shackled by the heavy hand of the Department of Justice, that no move has been made in recent years to remove this shackle and to allow them to grow into a modern police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time we are being asked to approve the sending of 35 members of the Garda Síochána of various rank to Namibia to take up duty with the United Nations force.  As I said, in general I believe that that is a good thing, not just because it will give members of the Garda Síochána an opportunity to participate in such a force but also because it will help to expose members of the Garda Síochána to other policing methods and approaches.  This is something that should take place constantly.  A feature <Col N="263" /> of modern police forces is that personnel are exchanged on a very regular basis in a planned way so as to expose them to new methods of policing.  That would be an added advantage of taking part in this police force.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about reducing the numbers currently serving in the Garda Síochána.  I would re-echo what Deputy Barrett has said and raise a number of queries.  We have a much depleted force and there is no evidence to suggest that the Government have any intention of increasing the numbers or restructuring the force so that those currently serving in the force would be able to provide the kind of service that this country so badly needs.  During the past nine to ten years there has been an enormous upsurge in crime, the number of robberies has doubled and there has been an alarming increase in the number of crimes with violence.  The reduction in the rate of detection is quite startling as is the reduction in the rate of recovery of stolen property.  All of this points directly to an inability on the part of the Garda Síochána to cope with modern criminals. When will the Government &mdash; previous Governments also failed in this area &mdash; face up to the fact that the major problem facing the Garda Síochána, apart from dealing with the criminal on the street, is the structure under which they must operate?  When are the Government going to mature politically and realise that the Garda Síochána are a loyal police force and can be entrusted with their own management and structure?  I appeal to the Minister to have immediate regard to this fact.</P>
    <P>Even though the 35 members of the Garda Síochána whom we will send to Namibia to take up duty with the United Nations peacekeeping force will be as well equipped as possible and as well trained as possible this training will not be to the standard that other modern democracies can provide.  I believe we would be letting ourselves down if we were to allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>It is now ten years, according to this <Col N="264" /> Bill, which cites the various Garda Síochána Acts, since we had any legislation on the Garda Síochána; I am discounting the Garda Síochána Complaints Board because that is somewhat extraneous. There has been no legislation of note. That is not to say there has been a feeling of satisfaction among the gardaí about their structures and the management of that force.  We have a militaristic style of police force which is an anachronism in modern days.  We have trained members of the Garda Síochána to use their discretion; therefore, we must allow them to use it and stop throwing the rule book at them when they do so.  To do that we must change the structures.  We must regionalise the Garda Síochána and allow the kind of policing to take effect on the ground that is necessary, rather than trying to impose the kind of policing necessary in the inner city of Dublin on the south-west coast of Kerry.  It simply is not effective.  It stunts the development of proper policing.  We are doing ourselves a disservice by not allowing the many thousands of willing and able gardaí to develop in that force when they have asked for it, they want it.  The Progressive Democrats are on record as spelling out a plan by which it could be done, but there is absolutely no evidence that this Government or this Minister are even remotely interested in bringing our police force up to a required modern standard.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the deployment of the 35 gardaí, or more in future, on UN duties is the fact that we have an imbalance as between garda deployment and crime rates.  I have said in this House, and I think it is worth saying again because it demonstrates this imbalance, that approximately 57 per cent of crime occurs in the greater Dublin area and a far lesser number of gardaí, some 35 per cent, are deployed in Dublin.  I would be worried that there would be an increase of this imbalance if, for instance, we send the kind of key personnel we need in Dublin to Namibia or some other far-off place if they offer to go and that offer is accepted by the Garda Commissioner.  In my constituency in Rathfarnham the station has lost five personnel in the past year and <Col N="265" /> has had one further transfer recently and none of those has been replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, not as law-abiding as one would wish.  The imbalance in Dublin is very marked and it would be unfortunate if this Bill added to that imbalance.  I am looking at the personnel involved: one chief superintendent, two superintendents, two inspectors, seven sergeants and 23 gardaí.  Already we know there are a number of vacancies in the superintendent, inspector and sergeant ranks. What is the Minister proposing to do when he sends further personnel of those ranks away?  Is he proposing to make promotions within the Garda so that the effects of this depletion are not felt?  If he is he should have said so in his opening speech.  I do not understand why he did not address himself to the consequences within the Garda Síochána of these changes and, as Deputy Barrett said, the possibility of further changes in the future.  I am extremely supportive of our taking part in United Nations peace-keeping forces, but I want to know the consequences at home on the ground.  It is the Minister's responsibility to tell us and it is my responsibility as spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats to point it out if he does not tell us.  If we have a number of these people of the various ranks I have mentioned offering to go and if they are accepted, what is the Minister going to do in turn for the stations that are going to find they are without those personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not addressed himself to the type of personnel who are going to be sent away.  I imagine there is a possibility that specialised personnel will be required for such a peacekeeping <Col N="266" /> force.  Is that the case?  If so, can we afford to lose particularly highly trained, specialised gardaí for a given period?  If we can, does it mean the Minister intends to train other personnel to take their place?  We have had in Dublin in the past year the disbandment of a number of task forces and the murder squad and there is now almost no legal section within the Garda.  We should be very vigilant about not losing out on the really important and essential personnel in our Garda who are not easily replaced.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the morale in the Garda force at the moment.</P>

Indeed, in that regard I have given the Deputy a great deal of latitude, as I think she will realise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring particularly to the Bill in my contribution.  I do not intend to be that much longer, but I feel I should make certain points I wish the Minister to reply to.  I think it is necessary to point to the low morale within the Garda force at the moment.  We have over a number of years had difficulties in promotions, recruitment, a lack of numbers and huge pressures on members of the Garda Síochána.  I fear that when the Commissioner asks for volunteers for this UN force we are going to be embarrassed at the rush to join and the reason will be that the morale of gardaí on the beat or in their stations is so low that they will say, &ldquo;Here is a chance to do something where I will get job satisfaction.  It will be interesting and I will be regarded as being important and essential which is certainly not the case at present in <Col N="267" /> Ireland.&rdquo;  The Minister has only himself to blame because he has continued over the past two years to run down the Garda Síochána with no idea of where he is going on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I warn the Minister he should be aware that there is already great interest in this matter within the Garda Síochána and I believe there will be a great rush to take part in this.  He should be aware of the reasons behind it. I am in favour of the Bill but I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House, and the public, from what stations the personnel will be drawn.  He should tell us if specialised personnel will be involved and if it is proposed to replace them.  I do not think we should tolerate crucial ranks in the Garda being further depleted by our participation in this force thereby putting law abiding citizens more at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are supporting this measure in recognition of the contribution that Ireland has made, and must continue to make, on the international peacekeeping scene.  Our Defence Forces have a proud record serving with United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon and other countries and I have no doubt that that tradition will be continued by our gardaí who will be serving abroad after the Bill has been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a small and neutral country but we have an important role to play on the international scene.  We do not have any tie with any of the major political blocs and our neutrality is important to us.  It is important that we should take great care in exercising that neutrality particularly when our soldiers and gardaí are involved with international peacekeeping forces.  I am referring to the gardaí who will be going to Namibia and to the soldiers serving in Lebanon.  It is true to <Col N="268" /> say that most of the time our Ministers observe our sense of neutrality to protect Irish people who serve abroad but, occassionally, there are lapses and one-sided statements are made by them.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Colley asked the effect the creation of this peacekeeping force will have on Garda numbers and what will be done to replace the experienced members.  I agree with them that Garda numbers are too low but I do not intend to go into that topic in detail. However, it is no harm to point out that the Garda superintendent in my constituency, which covers Tallaght, informed me that the number under his control is well below what he reasonably requires to police the area.  He told me that he had sent a request to the Garda Commissioner for 20 additional gardaí for the Tallaght station but this was not acceded to.  In fact, the number of personnel had dropped.  It is important that we should send members of the force abroad on peacekeeping duties but it is equally important that we make resources available to maintain staffing levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made the point that this peacekeeping force would not cost us anything, that the expenses and salaries involved in sending gardaí to Namibia would be met by the UN.  He said that the UN will pay, that they will pick up the tab.  However, the Minister, in the course of his speech, said that the financial arrangements are likely to be similar to those for UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon.  That is exactly what I am afraid of because our experience of the financial arrangements for UNIFIL was not a happy one.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the Minister for Defence some months ago, in response to a parliamentary question, that approximately £15 million was owed to us by the UN for arrears of payments to our soldiers serving with UNIFIL over many years.  The Minister told me that the figure owed to us by the UN increases year on year.  The primary reason for that is that many of the countries who are ardent and vociferous participants in UN debates unfortunately fail to meet their <Col N="269" /> responsibility of paying their contributions to the UN.  The result is that Ireland, and other contributors to the peacekeeping force, find that the financial arrangements are not met.  Substantial sums of money are owed to those countries.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the financial arrangements are likely to be similar to those for UNIFIL.  I had hoped that they would be different and that the expenses and salaries paid to those involved in this operation will be paid promptly to the State so that the Minister, and the Government, can ensure that replacements will be found for those serving with the force.  I hope the Garda strength is not depleted further as a result of our generous contribution to the force in Namibia.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the fact that our Garda volunteers, like our soldiers serving with the UN, will be exposed to danger.  The political climate in Namibia has improved and we are all pleased about that.  To what extent that may have been due to the negotiations carried out by the UN or the participation by Cuba is another matter but progress has been made and we can look forward with confidence to the independence of that country.  However, the political climate will continue to be unsettled for some time and our gardaí will be put at risk.  They deserve our full support and we must ensure that they are given all the technical back up and equipment they need.  Notwithstanding Deputy Barrett's comments, Namibia will prove to be a more dangerous place to work than patrolling Westmoreland Street.</P>
    <P>We should express our appreciation to the gardaí who have volunteered.  I should like to know if it is the intention to include banghardaí in the force.  That should be given favourable consideration because banghardaí have a valuable role to play in such groups.  They should be included in the contingent.  A breakdown of the ranks of those it is proposed to send is as follows: one chief superintendent, two superintendents, two inspectors, seven sergeants and 23 gardaí.  I am no expert on proportionality <Col N="270" /> but it occurred to me that if there is an error it is slightly on the side of over-emphasis on Chiefs rather than on Indians.  According to my calculations there will be 12 Chiefs and 23 Indians&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am indeed pleased that this Bill is before the House.  It is good to see that we will be continuing the very fine traditions we have built up over the years in international participation, co-operation and peacekeeping where needed.  I do hope that the Minister will ensure that we are promptly recompensed by the United Nations so that such funds can be used for no other purpose than the maintenance of our Garda Force in those areas in need of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to indicate my party's support of and welcome for this Bill, particularly the honour reflected on this country and the Garda Síochána on being invited to Namibia.  It is a particularly pleasing feature that while 35 members of the Garda Force will be sent to Namibia initially, over 400 others indicated a willingness to participate. That is an incredible credit to the force as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister's remarks rang a slightly sombre note when referring to the fact that there would be an amendment tabled later, in that the task will be a dangerous, onerous one.  There is the wrongly held belief that our Defence Forces when going on duty to, say, the Lebanon are going on holiday in the sun.  That is not the case.  It is a difficult, onerous task, undertaken after long consideration only by those who volunteer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going to Namibia, it must be acknowledged, will be going into a situation of intense political and military turmoil.  For many years past, in collaboration with South Africa, the Americans have been <Col N="271" /> funding the South African equivalent of the Contras in Namibia in an attempt to do down the popular movement of the South West African People's Organisation, the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people.  They will still be there when the members of the Garda arrive, South African mercenaries and troops, working in disguise, intent in continuing some control and interest in Namibia and, more particularly, directing their attentions &mdash; as they have done over the past decade &mdash; on Angola in support of UNITA there.  They will continue to be opeating there, ruthless trained killers backed by the South African and American Governments.  It must be remembered that there were until very recently over 100,000 South African troops in Namibia using it as a launching pad into Southern Angola.</P>
    <P>It will be clearly seen that the task of the members of the Garda Síochána will not be a straightforward one.  The members who have indicated in such great numbers their interest in and commitment to peacekeeping in Namibia, in a process leading to democracy there, must be congratulated.  In those circumstances it constitutes a small gesture for us to release 35 members to go there. It does not do this House any credit to introduce reservations or to trade counters to that commitment.  It is my belief that the remaining members of the force here, out of the almost 11,000 in total, will easily recoup the loss of the 35 who will depart.</P>
    <P>Neither do I think their departure will have any great impact on the capacity of the Garda to continue to effectively combat crime here.  In this respect I might make two small points as a Deputy representing the north side of this city.  I represent a constituency in which late night bus services have had to be curtailed because of lawlessness, vandalism and attacks on drivers.  My constituents, perhaps more than others in this city, could well do with more Garda attention.  In combating crime, increasing the numbers of Garda on the ground is not sufficient in <Col N="272" /> itself; that will not eliminate the problem altogether.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion that must be refuted is the one that there has been some enormous rise in crime in recent times.  That is not the case.  In fact it is remarkable the extent to which crime has been contained in this State given the extent of unemployment and poverty that obtains.  Given those circumstances the Garda are doing a remarkable job. Neither do I accept the suggestion that morale is low within the force, as has been contended.  Certainly conditions have not been as good recently because of the curtailment on overtime and the like.  My experience from contacts I have had with Garda on the ground in my area &mdash; where there are some fine community/Garda projects in train &mdash; has been one of members who are doing the task allotted to them with the commitment expected of them.  Of course there is room for improvement but this is not the time to introduce such bargaining counters.</P>
    <P>This House should be united in recognising the honour bestowed on the country and the Garda Síochána, in particular, in having been invited into Namibia.  We should feel honoured that we, as a country because of our neutrality and peace-keeping traditions, continue to be relied on, by international peacekeeping forces abroad in the maintenance of peace and the protection of democracy.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister went into the history behind the current initiatives and what has emanated therefrom.  Unfortunately in this respect there were a few omissions which I should like to rectify.  It would be wrong of this House, in the course of any debate, particularly one that included a reference to the history of Namibia, not to mention the late Seán MacBride, the first Commissioner appointed by the United Nations in 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;through whose <Col N="273" /> involvement we, as an international community, made huge progress in the international demand for democracy and the recognition of SWAPO in Namibia.  We should recall that it was during that period he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work and efforts.</P>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that the current accord achieved in respect of Namibia, based on talks held in Geneva, followed an American initiative.  I want to make it quite clear that the role of America in regard to Namibia has been one of imperial disgrace.  In collusion with South Africa America has poured millions of dollars into supporting the Contras of Namibia, into the war effort there, maintaining an offensive against SWAPO in Namibia and the democratically elected Government of Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might well pose the question: what happened recently to bring about this historic peace settlement?  We must remember that the United Nations have attempted &mdash; through every means available to them over the last three decades &mdash; to achieve what has now been wraught there.  The small nation responsible for what has now happened in Namibia is Cuba.  I will explain briefly why that has been the case.  In or about June-July last South Africa launched a major offensive from Namibia into Angola.  They massed troops of 15,000 near the town of Cuito Cuanavale where they were confronted by 30,000 Cuban troops in Angola.  At the same time Cuba sent over another 20,000 troops who progressed in a calculated movement behind the South African troops, surrounding them completely, forcing them to total surrender. There was very little heard of the event and very little bloodshed.  What happened then was that the South African Government immediately sought to negotiate a surrender and peaceful retreat from Cuito Cuanavale.  One of the conditions imposed by the Angolan and Cuban negotiators was that Namibia be given independence and left in peace. This constituted one of the first major defeats, with hardly any bloodshed, imposed on South African troops in <Col N="274" /> Namibia and, illegally, in Angola.  It was one of the conditions of the accord that there would be no major international debate or trumpet blowing about it.  The Cubans and the Angolans respected that, and for that reason we have heard very little of that major event.  It was directly as a condition of surrender on that occasion that the South Africans, for the first time in recent times, agreed to sit down and conclude an accord.  In the time they have been in Angola, the Cubans have contributed significantly to achieving democracy or at least a solution that will lead to democracy in Namibia.  It is in that context that our Garda are asked to contribute.</P>
    <P>We have to be completely supportive of this initiative.  I would reiterate some of the points Deputy Taylor has made in regard to financial arrangements.  We have to recognise that when the UN pay for our troops and gardaí in Namibia there will then be the resource available for further recruitment.  That is something I would ask the Minister to consider. If this commitment must continue over a lengthy period and involve more members going abroad, the Minister should consider increasing recruitment and training of new members to replace those who go away.</P>
    <P>It is a great moment in the history of Namibia that we have come to the stage where the international community is mustering what will be the largest ever peacekeeping force of troops and policemen under the flag of the UN.  The decades of economic exploitation, the disregard for and abuse of human rights in Namibia, forced upon them by the South Africans, will come to an end. As was mentioned by the Minister, once resolved it will represent one of the last major colonial problems on the table of affairs at the United Nations.  What South Africa has done in Namibia since they took on the so-called protectorate on behalf of Great Britain is condemnable and outrageous.  If our Garda can in any way contribute to a quick solution of the problems of transition to democracy in South Africa and in Namibia we should <Col N="275" /> welcome that contribution wholeheartedly and give it every support.  I have no doubt that our members going there will do us proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not keep the Minister long.  I am anxious to speak on this matter in the context of my own responsibility for development co-operation.  I share the reservations expressed by our spokesperson in relation to the inadequate resourcing of the Garda Síochána and its importance in the communities we all represent.</P>
      <P>Here today it is important to welcome the principle of this Bill.  It marks a new departure in international co-operation. We are long familiar with the picture of our soldiers going out to the UN.  It is a great new departure to have our police force going to perform a peacetime role in the nursing of an emergent, democratic, independent State.  It is a great new departure and I hope it is police forces that will be required in many of the trouble spots of the world in the coming decades.</P>
      <P>In relation to local resources I share the view that the Garda Síochána numbers are inadequate.  Anybody who represents large urban constituencies with a lot of social problems knows how great the need is for more community policing and that should be provided within the context of management of our own resources.  The Irish people have overwhelmingly shown their willingness, even where our own resources are short to share with others.  They have proved this by putting their hands in their pockets and indicating in opinion poll after opinion poll that we should share our limited State resources in generous fashion with the needy of the world, with the poorest of the poor.  The continent of Africa is one of the areas of greatest need.  I welcome and support this initiative to commit resources there.</P>

      <P>I also very much welcome the generous tributes paid to the Garda Síochána in the difficult work they carry out in the Ireland of today.  However, it would be wrong of me to let references to low Garda morale go unrefuted.  I have had contact with the management and members of the Force over a longer period than have most Members of the House, and I am absolutely satisfied that Garda morale is more than good.  The Garda Síochána enjoy the support of the community and deserve all the support the Government can give them.  Of course, the individual garda may have a personal crib, like any other citizen, but the allegation of overall poor morale made by Deputy Colley is totally untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been at Garda conferences in the recent past I am satisfied from what I have heard and witnessed that what I say truly reflects the situation as it is.  There is no foundation whatsoever for what Deputy Colley is suggesting.  I reckon she is totally out of touch with what is going on.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan correctly reminded us of the great role played in Namibia by the late Seán MacBride.  There has been worldwide recognition of his efforts in the interests of peace both nationally and internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor was very generous in his support of what we are trying to do. He had a number of questions which I will try to deal with.  First, he adverted to the question of the likely make up of the Garda contingent and suggested a possible imbalance between gardaí and more senior ranks.  The constitution of the Garda contingent takes account of the duties to which the members of the contingent will be assigned, and it is in line with the strength requested by the United Nations from this country.  A number of the members of the more senior Garda ranks will be assigned to <Col N="277" /> duties at the United Nations headquarters in Namibia and I am sure Deputy Colley would agree that this experience can only be of benefit to these members in their future assignments in the Garda Síochána and that the more gardaí in the senior ranks who receive such experience the greater will be the gains to the Garda Síochána in the long term.  During the course of the debate mention was made of this fact and the importance of it but Deputy Colley, judging from what I heard her say, is probably not aware that there are a lot of connections between our Garda Force and other police forces and that there is a lot of interchange of personnel at all levels. It is not something new.  It is an experience that we all learn from and something that we encourage on every possible occasion.  The Deputy should remember that only last year four senior chief superintendents did a long session with the Canadian Royal Mounted Police.</P>

      <P>Please, let me continue. It is done in a planned way.  It is not something new and it is not something that has been ignored in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí who are going to Namibia will be very thoroughly briefed beforehand. I understand that a course is ready for them to take part in before they go. On arrival in Namibia individual briefings will be given by the United Nations about the districts to which members will be assigned.  The briefing in this country before they go will cover medical aspects, political and historical factors and the cultural characteristics of the people of <Col N="278" /> Namibia.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will give every help and assistance to the Garda Commissioner in ensuring that, from their point of view, our people going out there will be very well briefed.</P>
    <P>The total force working for the United Nations will be in the region of 500.  For the information of the House, I understand as of today, that Holland will have 30 members of their police force working there, Jamaica, 30; Ghana, 100; Barbados, 30; Sweden, 50; Fiji, 100; Ireland, 35 and Austria, 50 &mdash; a total of 425.  I understand the remaining 75 will be drawn from countries such as New Zealand, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt and Senegal.  That is as much information as I have on that issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan was correct when he said that a good number of gardaí are applying for work in Namibia.  They are applying for good and proper reasons, as he strongly stressed, and not for the reasons suggested by Deputy Colley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The Deputy is very far off the mark.  There were a little over 500 gardaí volunteers; there were 25 banghardaí volunteers, about 52 sergeants, two inspectors, two superintendents and one chief superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by Deputy Taylor and I understand the Commissioner is giving it consideration. It is entirely his decision bearing in mind the role which they have to play in that country.  As of now I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some role for the banghardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="279" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that.  A number of Deputies asked whether or not the gardaí being sent overseas will be replaced.  In discussing this aspect it should first be acknowledged that it is an honour to the Garda Síochána and to the country as a whole that we have been asked to contribute to the international police contingent who will be involved in the transition of Namibia to an independent state.  As I have said, our 35 member contribution to this force will amount to only about one-third of 1 per cent of the total strength of the Garda Síochána.  I am satisfied that the advantages to be gained from participation in this historic mission outweigh the loss to this country of the services of these members during their absence in Namibia.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of replacements <i>per se</i>, I can inform the House that the Government have decided that vacancies in the promotional ranks involved in the Namibia contingent &mdash; 12 posts &mdash; will be filled here straight away.  The vacant posts at garda rank, which is the basic recruitment rank in the force, will be filled by gardaí returning from career breaks.  Redeployment is also necessary within the Force.  As a result of the dispatch of a Garda contingent to Namibia overall numbers in the force available for duty at home will decline even though there will be a special round of promotions in the ranks of sergeant and chief superintendent to which I have just referred.  However, having consulted the Garda Commissioner I have today arranged for an increase in Garda recruitment this year from a planned figure of 300 to 335.  The first batch of these trainees &mdash; 85 young men and women &mdash; will start their training in Templemore in a little over six weeks time, on 1 April, when their colleagues should be taking up their posts in Namibia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. It was worth while introducing that little element into the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A further 700 trainees approximately will be taken into the <Col N="280" /> training centre during 1990 and 1991.  I might add for the information of Members who are concerned about balance or imbalance, as Deputy Colley was, that the selection of members of the Namibia contingent is at an advanced stage and the commissioner has indicated that the members likely to be chosen will be drawn from the geographical spread of Garda divisions throughout the State. Members can be assured that the dispatch of this Garda contingent will not result in any substantial reduction in Garda services in any particular area of the State.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the kind of allowances that will be paid in respect of the United Nations service by the Garda. One of the reasons for this Bill is to ensure that in future gardaí who volunteer for UN service do not have to break their service with the force in order to do so.  The members of the Garda contingent going to Namibia will have a continuing entitlement to their basic pay, rent allowance and other allowances.  In addition, there will be a special daily allowance payable to each member of the force at a rate to be determined by the Department of Finance.  This allowance will be on the same general lines as the allowance paid to soldiers serving with the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to say what is the nature of the role of the police contingent in Namibia.  The present police force in Namibia, the South West African Police Force Service, is salaried effectively by South Africa.  In the period coming up to the Namibian elections many people who have been actively involved in the longrunning conflict in that country will be returning to their homes and villages. Some of these people will have been, as it were, on the run from the security forces in Namibia in the past.  In what must be a time of some tension in Namibia, the United Nations' police force will be deployed in the police stations around the country to monitor the law enforcement work of the local police.  If breaches of police discipline of a serious nature occur these will be reported immediately to the United Nations commanders who will intervene at a senior level with the <Col N="281" /> South West African Police Service to bring the abuse or abuses in question to an end.  It is felt that an active United Nations police presence in the local stations will be an inhibiting factor in relation to any such problem.  It is also anticipated that the police contingent will have a role in relation to ensuring that the election process is not interfered with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of reimbursement costs by the United Nations.  While the precise reimbursement terms have yet to be notified to us, it is likely that payments will be made by the UN at a similar rate and on the same basis as applies in the case of the Irish Army personnel in Lebanon. This would involve reimbursement of some US $1,020 per member per month for extra and extraordinary expenses, full reimbursement of travel costs and provision of free accommodation, meals and medical care for members of the contingent. I understand that for the present United Nations reimbursements at a rate of 60 per cent of amounts due are made monthly in arrears.  The balance of 40 per cent is not being paid at present because of financial difficulties in the United Nations caused by arrears of contributions of certain member states.  I am not in a position at present to estimate the cost of uniforms and items of equipment which will need to be supplied to the members serving in Namibia.  Arrangements for the equipping of the Garda contingent are being made by Garda Headquarters with the co-operation of the Army Quartermasters-General's Branch.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the conditions in Namibia and the deployment of the Garda contingent.  I understand that a small number of the Garda contingent will be based at the headquarters in the capital, Windhoek, and that other individual gardaí will be attached to police stations throughout Namibia but mostly in the more populous northern tip of that country.  The gardaí are likely to be in the company of other United Nations police force members at most times and a significant number of these are likely to be English speakers or at least have <Col N="282" /> English as a second language.  I understand it is anticipated that Fijian, Swedish and Dutch police contingents will be serving there.  Parts of Namibia are desert country but the inhabited areas are more temperate in climate, though generally a good deal warmer than Ireland.  Namibia is approximately ten times as big as Ireland or somewhat bigger than Germany and France combined.  Distances between the UN posts will be considerable and the use of the country's network of airfields will at times be necessary as the UN headquarters in Windhoek keeps in touch with its contingents in the countryside.  All parties to the dispute over Namibia have officially welcomed the presence of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and have undertaken to co-operate with it and its work.</P>
    <P>One other matter of interest which I feel I should mention for the information of the House is that the United Nations will look after the medical requirements of members of the UNTAG while in Namibia and in cases of serious illnesses members will be transferred to hospital or will be brought home to Ireland by the United Nations.  As part of the selection process, volunteers who are otherwise suitable for Namibian duty will undergo a rigorous medical examination by the Garda Surgeon.  The members selected will undergo a course of inoculations to protect them against a number of diseases they could possibly encounter in Namibia, including typhoid, cholera, polio, malaria and yellow fever.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters were raised that have no relevance to the Bill and I do not propose to chase down the different cul-de-sacs in any shape or form. There were a number of misrepresentations made by my good friend Deputy Barrett.  He totally misrepresented the position on recruitment. Recruitment is taking place.  I told him that in about six weeks time we will have the first contingent moving into Templemore. There were two main problems as to why we were delayed until 1 April to get the recruitment up and running. One reason was that the state of the building in Templemore, which is to <Col N="283" /> accommodate the recruits, was in a shocking condition.  This is known to every Member of the House and many Members here would be familiar with the condition of the building there.  It was necessary for the Government to provide many millions to do something about improving the conditions.  The conditions experienced there were out of the last century or perhaps the century before.  It is a reflection on all of us that it has taken up now to do something about it but at least something has been done.  The bulldozers are working there for the past nine to 12 months and are tearing the place asunder.  Work has started there on a major programme to give us a first-class Garda training college which the police force, the community and the country deserves.</P>

      <P>Another area where there has been a misrepresentation of the facts is in relation to crime in general.  There is a general recognition and acceptance by the community at large that never has there been such a successful onslaught on organised crime as there has been in the past 12 or 18 months and we are thankful to the Garda for that.  These are the things that help Garda morale at all times and which give gardaí the motivation that is essential if they are to be successful in what they are doing.  If there are those with complaints who come to people, I think Deputy McCartan put his finger on it when he said Garda morale should not be measured with overtime.</P>

      <P>There is always a danger that emotion will rule the head. This Bill does not deal solely with Namibia, but empowers the Government without coming back to the House to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána on UN duty at a future date.  Of course, we all support the need for Ireland to play its part in seeing there is a peaceful transition to independence in Namibia but the legislation does not just deal with Namibia but gives the Government general powers to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána anywhere on UN duty. It is important that we put this point on the record.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 2 (1) will the Government have any power to determine the requirements we may wish to see as to the manner members of the Garda Síochána will be treated when they go abroad?  For argument's sake, do we have any say in determining where our members work, that they have a certain number of hours duty, rest days, overtime? Will such arrangements be part and parcel of the negotiations built into our requirements for the Garda Síochána who go abroad?  What arrangements are being made for annual leave or for return visits during their tour of duty?  What type of accommodation will be afforded to members of the Garda Síochána serving on duty abroad?  What ratio of male to female staff will be dispatched?  Will we always insist that a certain number who hold offices of rank in the Garda Síochána be part of a contingent?  Let us not, to use the Minister's phrase, be taken down a cul-de-sac on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the legislation as if it only applied to Namibia. However, section 2 (1) makes it quite clear that the legislation empowers the Government without ever having to come back to the Dáil again to dispatch members to serve on UN duty abroad.  It <Col N="288" /> happens to be in Namibia in this instance but it could be some other place next year and we will never again get an opportunity of debating the issue.  The Minister has told us that 35 members have been requested in this particular instance but there is nothing to stop the Government in six months time agreeing to the dispatch of 125 or indeed 200 gardaí because there is no such restriction in the Bill. This is no restriction also on the conditions under which the members will be working.</P>
    <P>I am not going to allow this opportunity to pass &mdash; regardless of Deputy McCartan's comments which I know were not meant to be unfriendly &mdash; without introducing bargaining counters, because that is what we are elected for.  The legislation empowers the Government to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána abroad and for that reason we should be certain we know what we are doing and that we can answer the Irish people who will say to us that it is grand we are sending 500 people abroad to serve in a peacekeeping capacity &mdash; and Deputy Flaherty has said that Irish people have always been very generous when it comes to supporting Third World countries and those who are seeking independence &mdash; but what about the situation at home?  If the Minister wants to fool himself that there is no real problem in the fight against crime he must be living on a different island than I am because every day you will read about people being mugged, raped, murdered or of houses being broken into.</P>
    <P>I remember ten to 15 years ago, when these gentlemen up in the Press Gallery were doing their job, if there was a murder it would be a headline in the newspapers for two or three weeks. Everybody would be talking about it. People are murdered today and if lucky it merits two lines in the fourth or fifth page.  The Minister is trying to convince us that there is no problem with regard to crime and that the Garda Síochána are going around saying this is a great place to work and that there are no morale problems in the force.  What nonsense. Does the Minister ever talk to the ordinary rank and file garda who is frustrated <Col N="289" /> by the fact that when people come in to lodge a complaint at the Garda station, the only thing he can do is to take details knowing full well that the Garda have not got the resources to find those who committed the crime and prevent it from happening again.</P>
    <P>I do not know about other Members of the House, but I live in the Republic of Ireland.  I read the newspapers, talk to people and listen to community organisations. I have received a letter from a neighbourhood watch group outlining their concern about the fact that we can dispatch members of the Garda Síochána abroad without regard to the home problem. I want to put it clearly on the record that we in the Fine Gael Party support the UN in their peacekeeping role and that we feel morally bound to play our part by offering to UNIFIL members of both the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  We are quite prepared to do that.  I tabled an amendment to section 2 which is in the possession of Members that:</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a contingent of the Garda Síochána is despatched outside the State with an International United Nations Force, provision shall be made to add an equal number of gardaí to the numbers available for service in the State.</P>
    <P>That does not apply just to Namibia or to the 35 members who are now being dispatched.  I am very pleased that as a result of Fine Gael saying publicly last week that we would vote against this Bill unless we got an assurance from the Minister that he would replace the Garda Síochána members being sent abroad with new members in this country, the Minister in his Second Stage reply has given us that commitment.  It is our job in opposition to point out these things and I thank the Minister for adhering to our demands and giving us an assurance that in this instance he will do what we have asked.  That is an achievement on our part and I hope those who argue against us or who say we are doing nothing in opposition will take note of the fact that we do seek certain things <Col N="290" /> and at times are very successful.  The Minister has told us that he will take on 35 new members to replace those who are going away.  I have respect for the Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, who has done a reasonable job during both his terms in office but he will not always be Minister and I want to be assured that whenever a Minister for Justice decides to give a commitment to send X number of gardaí abroad we will not have to start issuing threats every day of the week and that a provision will be built into our legislation so that the gardaí who are sent abroad will be automatically replaced here.</P>
    <P>As I said in my Second Stage contribution the Garda Síochána have lost 800 members in two years.  Despite that, the Minister is trying to cover up that is the reality.  If the Minister wishes I will table a written question tomorrow to get information to back up what I am saying. I will stand over what I am saying.  The reality is that the Force has been reduced by approximately 800 during the past two years and that crime has not reduced in this country to justify that reduction.  As Deputy Taylor said, I accept that adding more members to the Garda Síochána does not necessarily mean there will be less crime but it helps a lot if they are there and even if no imagination is being applied by this Government in terms of restructuring the Garda Síochána.  As I said in my Second Stage contribution we should be supporting the juvenile liaison scheme and the neighbourhood watch scheme to try to prevent crime in the first place.  There are cuts in those areas and if anybody has any doubts about that they should check the subhead in the Estimates.  There is no reform, there are fewer gardaí, and I will stand over this, there is an increase in crime, most important of all, in serious crime.  I had to face two parents whose son was stabbed to death by a crowd of thugs on his way home from a disco.  The person who was with him was also stabbed and he has just been released from hospital.  I had to face the parents of that 21 or 22 year old boy. Parents are extremely perturbed that their children cannot walk home from <Col N="291" /> discos without a crowd of thugs jumping on them and in the case I am mentioning, stabbing one of them to death.  That unfortunate incident was mentioned in a few news bulletins and we have not heard of it since but those two parents are at home minus a son.  We should not fool ourselves that we do not have a problem. We have a problem and I believe that together we can do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am trying to present a case for the Minister for Justice so that he can go back to the Cabinet table, bang the table and say: &ldquo;I need more resources and I should not be expected to deal with a problem in this country, whether it is the IRA or crime, without the necessary resources, and if there is a cake to divide we should get our priorities right.&rdquo;  I accept that there is only a certain size cake to be divided but what is important is how it is divided and where our priorities lie.  I want sufficient support for the Minister for Justice so that he can get a bigger slice of whatever cake is available and ensure that people can walk in safety around our streets and that instead of the United Nations seeking our support to deal with problems abroad, we will not be looking for their support to deal with problems here at home, a prospect which may not be too farfetched, having regard to what is happening in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister may have misunderstood what I said but I want to put on the record that what I said was that it is foolish and unwise not to give the Garda Síochána the necessary backup and support to root out the arms and ammunition in the possession of the IRA. I do not want, nor ever intended, it to be implied that I ignored the success of the Garda Síochána.  I will fully support them again if they endeavour to get into their control all of the arms and ammunition that are in the hands of these thugs. However, one needs resources for that.</P>
    <P>Before this debate started I got a letter from the Ceann Comhairle telling me that unfortunately my amendment had been adjudged out of order as it involved a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I ask you, Sir, to change your mind because <Col N="292" /> that is not factual.  The Minister has just told us that the UN are paying for the services of the Garda Síochána who are going to Namibia so how can my proposal involve a potential charge on the Exchequer?  It is not.  Deputy Taylor said that I am fooling myself that the UN owe us £15 million.  That may be so but we are owed that amount and it is up to the Government to collect it.  We are entitled to this money.  I argue that my amendment is in order because it does not involve a charge on the Exchequer and that it is wise to build into our legislation a provision which ensures that members of the Garda Síochána who are sent abroad, are replaced here as long as the situation in this country continues.  We should use the money we get from the UN to pay for the salaries of those who are taken on to replace those who go abroad.  If we have to enter into an agreement with the UN that they refund all of the costs so be it but now is the time to debate and decide this issue.  The Government should negotiate to make certain that if we provide these people the UN will pick up the tab.  There are far richer nations in the United Nations than poor old mother Ireland, nations that can well afford to make a contribution. We are supplying the best quality one could find in terms of members of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána. There is no better quality in any police force in any part of the world and we should be proud to say that.  However, one can only squeeze so much from an orange and one cannot expect a reduced Force to do the job expected of them. People can only be worked so hard and they cannot be expected to perform miracles.</P>
    <P>I want the Ceann Comhairle to reconsider his decision in relation to my amendment in the light of what the Minister has told us.  I maintain that the subsection in my amendment is in order and that it would be wise for this House to include it in the Bill bearing in mind that we will never get a chance again to debate this issue.</P>
    <P>We should not be side tracked by Namibia, which happens to be the place <Col N="293" /> at this time, because this Bill enables future Governments to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána on UN service to Namibia or elsewhere.  I want protection to be built into the Bill both for the members of the Garda Síochána who will serve there with regard to the conditions they will serve under and the facilities available to them and also for those who are left behind here.  Thirty-five members are going abroad and the remainder are to be asked to perform the duties of those who are going.  There will be well over 10,000 members left behind who will be asked to perform the duties of those who have gone away.  The Minister in this instance has given a guarantee, for which I thank him, that the 35 men going away immediately will be replaced, but I am thinking about the future.</P>
    <P>Would the Chair reconsider my amendment in the light of what the Minister has told us?  I would argue that it is in order.  If so, I am asking the Members of this House to support me in having it incorporated into the legislation.  It will not in any way take away from our commitment to support the United Nations or, in this instance, to support the people of Namibia.  It will give us a guarantee for the future that as well as helping other people we will also help ourselves.  Our duty as legislators is to see to it that those who elected us can walk the streets in peace and comfort without fear of being mugged, raped, or otherwise attacked. That is our duty, in addition to supporting the less well off people in other countries and accepting our responsibility in that area.  My amendment will not interfere with either of those commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief comment on what Deputy Barrett has said.  The principle contained in section 2 is an important one &mdash; that the Government be allowed to dispatch abroad members of the Garda Síochána to participate in the work of the United Nations peacekeeping initiatives.  The section allows the Government to determine the numbers involved, which is correct, in consultation, no doubt, with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I do not believe that at any stage the Commissioner would advise the Government to dispatch such numbers as would seriously deplete the Garda Síochána to such an extent that they would be unable to carry out their duties.  It has been pointed out that the number we are talking about is one third of 1 per cent of the numbers available.  We must keep this matter in perspective.  When one looks at the contribution of other smaller nations to the current force, Ireland is making what could be described as a rather modest contribution but, nonetheless, it is significant.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the complete support of this House for our commitment to these peacekeeping initiatives.  If we are concerned about the availability of gardaí to do their job correctly, the Minister might advise the House how many members of the Garda Síochána are at the moment employed in driving Government Ministers to various functions, how many are currently employed in protection duties with regard to former Taoisigh or on protection work in regard to members of the Fine Gael Party, colleagues of Deputy Barrett.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On manning levels, I have indicated that my area is one that would be well served by a new Garda station in the Donaghmede area.  This is essential.  The Minister can provide only an office there and part-time staff.  I have indicated major problems with regard to public transport that need policing attention and the Garda Síochána have, in consultation with authorities in Dublin Bus and Rail, provided a special force to deal with trouble on the DART line.  There are always needs, particular and general.  If there is disquiet, I would invite Deputy Barrett and his party to consider putting down a motion on Private Members' <Col N="295" /> Business so that it could be debated at length and in detail in the proper context.</P>

The principle contained in section 2 is a good one which, in the context of the immediate objective of securing the peaceful transition to democracy in Namibia, is one that we should all support unequivocally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Barrett, has stated, there is a need to tighten up section 2 to ensure adequate compensation in Garda staffing levels here to make up for the numbers that would travel overseas on UN duty. I do not wish at this stage to speak on the overall Namibian situation, but would accept what the Minister has stated, that we should not be found wanting in our aid to developing States and our country has been internationally recognised for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 as at present drafted is a little open-ended.  While the Minister has given an assurance that the 35 persons whom he has in mind sending immediately will be replaced, nobody has any idea what the future might hold.  Deputy McCartan, speaking of one-third of 1 per cent of the Garda force being involved, considered that to be a very small number.  With the exception of the Minister, I am the first rural Deputy, or non-Dublin based Deputy, to address this Bill this morning.  I can tell Deputy McCartan, and all other Deputies who may be concerned, that one-third of 1 per cent, or even one garda, is a vital resource <Col N="296" /> in many areas.  The demise of the rural Garda station must be addressed at the earliest opportunity.  There we are talking about far fewer in number than one-third of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Were we arbitrarily to empower Ministers for Justice to rubber-stamp numbers of gardaí for overseas duties, I fear that we would run the risk of depleting our already hard pressed force at home.  That may not seem likely at present but there is always that possibility unless we tighten up the legislation somewhat.  The Minister stated that the United Nations will be prepared to compensate in terms of remuneration for these services abroad, so Deputy Barrett's amendment does not involve a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The problem of crime in rural areas, in particular, must be addressed at the earliest opportunity.  In many Garda stations there is a massive backlog of filing and there is very little being done in terms of crime detection by virtue of the one sergeant and two gardaí regime.  This necessitates a constant foot patrol which does not allow for the administrative tasks that gardaí in rural areas must now undertake.  This matter must be looked into, so that this legislation will not hit even harder our depleted Garda numbers. The Minister now has an opportunity to state specifically his intentions with regard to Garda recruitment.</P>
    <P>Statistics appear to show that something like 400 gardaí resign, retire or die each year, yet it is being said that by recruiting 300 we are advancing in the area of Garda numbers and crime detection. In fact, this is only a holding operation. There was a great deal of talk about the 1,000 recruits but they are to be taken into the force over a three-year period.  Almost 2,000 people applied and some have been notified that if they wait until 1991 they might be considered.  That is particularly sad and we should have a sense of shame about being in any way responsible for it.</P>
    <P>We must receive an assurance from the UN that they will be prepared to pay compensation.  Deputy Taylor again stated that the rather large sum of £15 million is outstanding.  We should not <Col N="297" /> allow a further bill to be run up and we must ensure that the proper arrangements for compensation and funding are in place before any of these 35 gardaí enter an aircraft.  I hope the Minister when replying will give an indication as to long-term projections.  The number involved now is only 35, but it could easily rise to 350 or 1,000.  If that happens there will be great difficulties in the domestic service unless there is adequate recruiting.</P>
    <P>The public will not thank us for allowing Garda numbers to be depleted.  I recognise that we should make a contribution towards the United Nations and a developing State, but if we allow our force to run down there will be serious difficulties, particularly in rural areas.  I would ask the Minister to investigate certain blackspots such as the constituency of Laois-Offaly where there is a drain on Garda resources because of the high security prison at Portlaoise.  That should not be used as an excuse to cut Garda hours and allow stations in outlying areas to open for only three or four hours at a time, while other stations are completely closed.  If we send gardaí overseas to work in other States we run the risk of fostering discontent at home in areas where there are blackspots.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises the tremendous contribution of the gardaí in making arms finds, particularly this year.  I agree that they are to be highly commended. They have done a tremendous job, especially in view of their lack of resources.  However, one Garda car roving through the Slieve Bloom Mountains on a 24-hour basis will not add to the crime detection statistics.  They are working under very difficult circumstances and performing brilliantly.  I hope the Minister will examine the problem of blackspots to which I have referred and not allow manpower resources to run down.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on Deputy McCartan's statement concerning members of the Garda Síochána engaged in security tasks of a non-crime detection kind, but the Minister might consider the number of gardaí who are engaged in menial tasks <Col N="298" /> such as typing and locking documents in filing cabinets.  These and other tasks have little to do with the proper function of the Garda Síochána.  If recruits cannot be brought in immediately on a large scale, secretaries or administrative staff should be employed, at least on a part-time basis.  There is not much point in hoping that a garda in a rural town can do his job adequately if he has to type memos and statements.  Many members of the force are seriously hampered by the necessity to do these jobs.  They feel that their position in the community is under threat because they cannot produce results due to being hampered by administrative duties.  I hope the Minister will reconsider Deputy Barrett's amendment and that it will receive the universal acclaim of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to recruit 300 people to the Garda Síochána this year.  It is a move in the right direction but they will not come on stream for two years following their induction to the training scheme.  It is the best offer available.  Deputy Barrett's amendment is out of order.  Perhaps it might be better to provide that the Minister could by regulation allow a contingent to take part in a UN force.  Those regulations should also deal with the personnel available at home.  If a contingent is going for eight months or a year, by the time any extra recruits come on stream that contingent will be a memory. Once we enter into a peacekeeping force, further opportunities will constantly arise and this might become an ongoing exercise. The Minister might indicate that he will continue the kind of commitment he has given today and ensure that numbers will be made up by ongoing recruitment. While it would not take effect immediately, at least it would mean the force would not be further depleted.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that there are a lot of personnel difficulties in the Garda.  This change will probably give rise to lengthy negotiations with the various associations.  When Deputy Barrett put down his amendment <Col N="299" /> the Ceann Comhairle examined it and rejected it because it would involve additional costs.</P>
      <P>I contend that the Minister has ample opportunity to increase the numbers by recalling the many gardaí on career breaks or leave of absence.  I recall making representations about a number of gardaí on career breaks who have not been taken back.  I do not know the current position but about 12 months ago there were about 40 or 50 gardaí on career breaks who had expected to get back almost immediately when the break was over, but the Department of Justice refused to take them back.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on the up to date position.  Perhaps the schedule in relation to career breaks and leave of absence has changed but there was an opportunity in the Bill to expand the position in relation to recruitment, transfers, leave of absence and so on.  Deputy Colley referred to regulations and maybe that is the way to do it.  It would have been very satisfactory if the Minister had indicated he was bringing about reform in this area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the recruitment of 1,000 new gardaí and there has been a call for many years about better training.  If the Minister intends to tackle this in a realistic way he is to be commended.  The 300 new gardaí will certainly bring up the numbers and counter natural wastage.  However, as other speakers on this side of the House said, a real opportunity has been lost.  I know this is a short Bill, brought through the House with commendable speed, but it would have been an opportunity to give the Minister and the Department scope to change the antiquated systems in the personnel section of the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  It is a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the allegation by Deputy McCartan about the security personnel guarding members of the Fine Gael Party.  He has a niggardly approach to security.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his reply <Col N="300" /> to Second Stage, indicated he would not go down cul-de-sacs and that everything in the garden was rosy.  He said that crime was under control and that there were adequate gardaí.  If he goes down that road he will come up against difficulties at the end of it because that is far from the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is what the Minister was leading up to.  The truth is that when the Minister and his party were in opposition they levelled plenty of criticism at the state of manning levels in the Garda Síochána.  The position is considerably worse since his party took over and the cutbacks have hit the Department of Justice as viciously as every other Department.  The position in relation to crime is very serious and old people and those living alone are frightened.  Never mind crime detection, there is also the question of protection of the elderly and women living on their own who very often are surrounded by gangs of thugs at night. They are scared out of their wits; they send for the Garda who cannot supply someone to protect them.  That is the case in my constituency and I am sure it applies in many others.</P>
      <P>We all know the situation is extremely serious and that those cutbacks have an effect.  They may not affect some upper class regions which may not need Garda protection, but that is not the case in other areas which have been badly hit. The superintendent in my constituency told me he applied for an additional 20 gardaí but was given the cold shoulder. That is just in one station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are sending 35 gardaí to Namibia. That is fine and I support it 100 per cent, but they should not be sent from an already depleted Garda force.  That is not acceptable because we are looking for an increase in the number of gardaí and for their presence on the beat so that people and their goods are protected.  Large areas of densely populated urban areas never see a Garda presence.  The Minister seems to have abandoned the neighbourhood watch scheme because they <Col N="301" /> have not got the resources and support they need.  The theft of cars and drunken driving takes place every day.</P>
    <P>While we are pleased to fulfil our international obligations by sending a national contingency to Namibia, the Minister should also ensure that our needs are met.  I could take the Minister to people in Tallaght who would be outraged that gardaí were being sent to Namibia when their needs have not been met.  They would have some pretty sharp comments to make on that score.  We must emphasise that our needs at home come first and if we have gardaí to spare we can send them abroad if the United Nations pay for it.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlines the situation in Namibia and I did not like the sound of it.  It did not sound a healthy place but of course we must not shirk our duty.  The training and resources should be given but I should like to know if a senior Garda officer has gone to Namibia to see what is going on and what our men and women will be facing.  Are we relying on reports from Fiji or somewhere else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people in that country in various militaristic groupings of one hue or another and the very least we can do to protect our gardaí is to send out a senior group of suitably qualified people to see what is happening.  They should assess the situation to ensure that the people we send out will not be at a greater risk than necessary.  Obviously there will be some risk, there is no doubt about that.  If there was no risk, the need to send them would not have arisen. However, the risk must be kept to a minimum and that requires on the ground inspections and assessments.  Has the inspection been carried out?  Has the assessment been made as to what is required and the risks involved?  The House is entitled to know.  What specific measures will be taken to ensure that the maximum possible resources and protection will be given to those men and women who have so bravely volunteered to leave the relative safety of Ireland and <Col N="302" /> go to foreign fields where the political situation is in a state of flux and where risks will have to be met by them?  Therefore, the House is entitled to receive some further information on that issue before it decides to pass this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to reply because we have had a very wideranging Second Stage type debate on an amendment which was ruled out of order but I will reply in the best way I can in a spirit of co-operation to the points that were made.  I appreciate that much of what was said was said out of genuine concern.</P>
      <P>I also understand why practically everything else was said, perhaps it had more to do with political reasons rather than for the reasons I would have wished but be that as it may concern has been expressed that if we were to send members of the Garda Síochána to Namibia that the Garda force in certain areas would be depleted.  I have already dealt with this issue.  The Garda Commissioner has advised me that he would spread the draw geographically so as to ensure that no great inconvenience would be caused. I also said, and it is important that I repeat it now, that 20 gardai who took career breaks are on the way back, as against the 23 to go out.  This would be of some help to us.  In reply to the point raised by Deputy Carey, and I hope that his colleagues will relay this to him &mdash; I can readily accept his absence &mdash; there is no prohibition on members of the force at present on career breaks coming back. They would be most welcome as we have work for them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is totally out of order but for the information of Deputy Taylor, and it relates to a point raised, I am glad to say that within the past month a community police scheme has come into operation in the area of Tallaght he mentioned. Two sergeants and 15 gardaí are involved in this scheme.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the scheme is working exceptionally well and has been greatly welcomed by the community. Without this co-operation the scheme would not be workable.  Let me say also, <Col N="303" /> and I mean this sincerely, that an indication of the height of morale in the force can be gauged from the fact that each one of the gardaí who has gone to Tallaght has gone there voluntarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies should make their own speeches.  I do not interrupt Deputies when they speak, quibble with them or divert them down culs-desac similar to the one Deputy Taylor brought me down a few minutes or so ago and which I did my best to avoid.</P>
      <P>I will now deal very briefly with a number of points made by Deputy Barrett. The question of overtime would not arise.  The allowances would reflect the number of hours worked.  There would be an effort to deal with it on the basis of hours on, hours off.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also rightly referred to the type of accommodation to be used.  I have been advised by the commissioner that although this accommodation would be basic he is satisfied that it would be adequate.  It would be of the bunk house type.  As I said earlier on, they would all be volunteers and the commissioner would make it clear to each of them that it would not be a picnic they would be going on.  They would be fully briefed on the present position in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a point made by Deputy Taylor, members of the force have visited the country and reported back to the Commissioner.  They are satisfied that they would be capable of dealing with the <Col N="304" /> problems they would face there.  Former assistant commissioner Fanning who led the Garda effort in this area visited the country on a number of occasions.  It has been said, but I cannot comment on this officially, that he may be the UN person involved out there.  This is not a matter for us but rather for the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked if they would be able to get special leave to come home. I am sure that no special leave would be given before the elections are held.  If an emergency was to arise, that would be a separate matter and would be dealt with separately.  Deputy Barrett also asked as to what the balance would be as between males and females.  I cannot give him an answer to this as that would be a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am sure no one would suggest that either I or the Government should say to the commissioner that females and males should be chosen.  It would be a matter for his professional judgement bearing in mind the tasks they would have to undertake. That is all I have to say at this stage.  I am leaving all the red herrings by the wayside on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the information given by the Minister, I suggest that the Chair now agree that the amendment I tabled is in order as no additional charge would be imposed on the Exchequer and there is no reason any additional charge should be imposed on the Exchequer in the future.  It is within the powers of the Government to negotiate with the United Nations on suitable arrangements.  I do not wish to show any great disrespect for the Minister but all of the time he seems to concentrate, when replying to points made, on one particular country, that is, Namibia.  What I am at pains to point out is that this legislation would enable the Government in the future to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána to take up UN peace-keeping duties all over the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government to ensure that in future negotiations with the United Nations, not alone in respect of Namibia but in respect of any other country where members may be asked to take up duty, <Col N="305" /> they seek guarantees that we would be able to recoup our costs in sending our top personnel abroad.  After all, it is the talent and skills of the members of the Garda Síochána that are being sought after.  We recognise that we do have our financial difficulties and that there are other richer nations who can well afford to pay up so that the money owed to us at present can be paid.  We would be showing no lack of commitment in respect of our resolve to have members of the Garda Síochána participate in such a peacekeeping force if we were to ask for what we are duly entitled to.  At the end of the day, the qualities of the people we have to offer are what has attracted the attention of the United Nations and we should not be afraid to say so.  It is an established fact that the talents of our Defence Force personnel were extremely attractive to UNIFIL.  They are good at the job of peacekeeping and I am quite confident that the members of the Garda Síochána would be equally as good.</P>
    <P>We are faced with our own problems and it would be foolish for anyone to say otherwise.  All I am asking is that we insert a subsection into the Bill, the provisions of which would oblige future Governments in deciding to send 50 or 100 members of the Garda Síochána to a particular country to seek guarantees that we would be paid by the United Nations, that they keep the strength of the Garda Síochána at its existing level and not reduce it by way of the number of personnel to be sent abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make a political point on this issue as this is serious legislation. The Bill may be short but it is not the length of a Bill that is important, rather it is the powers that would be made available. It is our duty to point out to the Government that there is concern on this side of the House, I can only speak for ourselves, and above all else that there is concern among the people.  The points we make here reflect the views made known to us by people in our clinics and by various deputations.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to highlight those issues when we get the opportunity.  The Minister may feel he is being taken down a <Col N="306" /> cul-de-sac, but I do not hold the same view.  These are important issues.  We are being asked to give the Government power to dispatch members of the Garda Síochána.  Before they can make that decision we need answers as to whether the home front will be looked after when these people go abroad.  There may be only 35 today but it could be 300 in three or four years' time, and they will be out there under this legislation.  Therefore, it is important to establish the facts and not to regard it as being taken down a cul-de-sac.</P>
    <P>We have to make our case and point out why we have these concerns.  It would be different if we had no crime and there were 12,000 members of the Garda Síochána floating around as happy as Larry scratching their heads and wondering what they are going to do the next day.  That is not the case and we would be foolish to think it is.  To make a case as to why a subsection like this is necessary in legislation it is important to point out these things.  If anybody else has a more brilliant idea or a better suggestion than I have proposed here, I would be glad to hear it and debate it and I would be delighted to accept it once it is within the general spirit of what I am trying to achieve.  The immediate problem we have is to ask, in the light of the information now supplied to the Dáil by the Minister, is if my amendment is out of order.  I claim it is no longer out of order because it is clearly not a charge on the Exchequer.</P>

How is this period calculated?  Is that a finality?  I thought the Minister told us the initial tour was a fluid one, that it could be for a minimum of eight months, or it could be for a year.  How could anything as fluid as that be a specified period?  I would like to know for the clarification of the House, how exactly that is to operate.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may by regulations, made with the consent of the Minister for Health, provide for the keeping of a record of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the death of a member of the Garda Síochána,</P>
      <P>(b)  the death of the spouse or any of such other members of the family of a member of the Garda Síochána as may be specified in the regulations, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the birth of a child of a member of the Garda Síochána,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>occurring outside the State while the member of the Garda Síochána is serving outside the State with an International United Nations Force and, as <Col N="309" /> respects a death referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection or a birth, in such circumstances as may be specified in the regulations.</P>
    <P>(2)  Records kept pursuant to regulations made under this section shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  authenticated in such manner as may be specified in the regulations by such person as may be specified for that purpose in the regulations, and</P>
    <P>(b)  transmitted to an tArd-Chláraitheoir in such manner as may be specified in the regulations.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a)  An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall maintain a register to be known as the Garda Síochána Deaths Register Book (in this section referred to as the Deaths Book) and shall cause an entry to be made in the Deaths Book of each record of a death transmitted to him under this section.</P>
    <P>(b)  An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall maintain a register to be known as the Garda Síochána Births Register Book (in this section referred to as the Births Book) and shall cause an entry to be made in the Births Book of each record of a birth transmitted to him under this section.</P>
    <P>(c)  An entry made under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection shall be in such form as may be specified in the regulations under this section and shall contain such particulars as may be specified in those regulations.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Deaths Book and the Births Book shall, for the purposes of the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987, be deemed to be register books within the meaning of those Acts, but paragraph (3) of section 27 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880, shall, in its application to the Deaths Book and the Births Book have effect as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  &lsquo;upon payment of the <Col N="310" /> appointed fee, and&rsquo; were deleted, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the reference therein to a statutory declaration made by one or more persons required by that Act to give information concerning the birth or death referred to in that paragraph were a reference to a statement in writing made by a person specified under paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall keep at his office an index to the Deaths Book and an index to the Births Book; and persons shall be entitled to search the indices and to have a certified copy of an entry in the Deaths Book or the Births Book or of items contained in the entry on the same terms and conditions in all respects as to fees and otherwise as are applicable under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987, or any other enactment in respect of the registers of births and deaths; and such fees shall be collected and disposed of in the same manner as fees payable under the said recited Acts.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment, which is modelled on section 6 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960 is to provide for registration, in this State, of the death outside the State, of a member of the Garda Síochána, his spouse or other relative while such a member is on service overseas with the United Nations.  The amendment also provides for the registration of the birth outside the State of a child of such a member.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> I am sure that I speak for all of us here when I say that it is our most sincere wish that all members of the Garda Síochána would return safe and well to this country on the conclusion of their overseas service. At the same time, however, it is important that, in the event of a fatality among a Garda contingent serving outside the State, there is a clear, straightforward procedure which ensures a minimum of delay in the settlement of the deceased member's estate.</P>
    <P>The amendment removes any question of reliance on the civil authorities of the country where a member's death occurs to expedite arrangements for registration of death and ensures that relatives do not have to encounter problems posed by civil unrest, language barriers, etc. which could conceivably arise in communications with such authorities.</P>
    <P>The net effect of invoking the provisions of the amendment would be to speed up the payment of pension, insurance and other moneys due to the spouse of a member of the Garda Síochána who dies on service with the United Nations.  I have no doubt that Deputies will agree that we could not tolerate a situation where there was a delay in payment of such moneys to a member's dependants in the time of their bereavement. The amendment which I am now moving will guard against such a situation arising.</P>
    <P>I now want to outline the contents of the amendment.  Subsection (1) enables the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Health, to make regulations to provide for the registration of certain births and deaths occurring outside the State while a member of the Garda Síochána is on external service with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides for the authentication and transmission to an tArd-Chláraitheóir of records kept pursuant to regulations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that An tArd-Chláraitheóir shall maintain a deaths register and births register and shall enter particulars of each record of a birth or death transmitted to him in such form <Col N="312" /> as may be specified in regulations.  This subsection also provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the deaths register and births register are deemed register books for the purposes of the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for the keeping of indices to the birth and death books and empowers persons to search the indices and obtain a copy of an entry on payment of the appropriate fee.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the manner in which regulations are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to express the hope that it will never be necessary to put the provision in the amendment for registration of death into effect but, as I have already said, it is most important to ensure that this safeguard is in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of library assistants with special responsibilities, among other duties, for security and prevention of theft, vandalism and damage to property in the National Library, Dublin 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All staff of the National Library are considered to have responsibility for security and prevention of theft, vandalism and damage to property. When the library is open to the public, there are at least nine staff on public duty of which two are library assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that my question arises out of the theft of one of the most valuable properties in the possession of the library, a 16th century manuscript map of Munster. Is the Taoiseach aware that library assistants are mainly responsible for the on-the-floor security in the public area, that traditionally there were ten such assistants in that area, that up to September last there were five and that there are now three unless one has been appointed since last week?  Thankfully, the valuable map is back but I should like to know if the Taoiseach considers the number of staff adequate bearing in mind that they are the people who are primarily responsible for the security of those works?  Can we all feel confident that there will not be a repetition of such a theft?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that this is a problem which besets libraries all over the world.  In fact, I was in a university library not so long ago in the United <Col N="314" /> States where the devices to which they are compelled to resort are quite horrendous to try to protect their valuable books and manuscripts.  Unfortunately, it is a feature of our modern world.  I am assured that in this case it was not shortage of staff that was responsible but rather inadequate security procedures. There has been an investigation into that aspect and it is hoped that the situation will greatly improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it has been said that slipshod methods were responsible for the theft.  However, although nobody would condone slipshod methods in the protection of such valuable items the fact that there are only three library assistants must place a big burden on them.  Will the Taoiseach give us an assurance that he will consider the provision of all modern electronic aids, video cameras and so on, together with adequate staff to ensure that there is no danger of a theft of such items?  The Taoiseach will be aware that such items are irreplaceable, that future generations will not be able to buy them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of staff allocated to the National Library, Dublin 2; the division of this staff between the genealogical office and the library section; and the numbers in each grade in (a) the library section and (b) the genealogical section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of staff allocated to the National Library is 44 in the library section and eight in the genealogical office.</P>

      <P>With regard to Priority Questions, the Chair's office communicated with me that my question as to whether the Minister had satisfied herself on the constitutionality of requiring a contribution for the provision of schools was not in order because it was a matter for the courts.  I seek the advice of the Chair in regard to that ruling in so far as my question dealt with the attitude of the Minister rather than of citizens and of courts.</P>

      <P>On a point of order in relation to Priority Questions, I tabled a question relating to the provision of school transport during this year and I specifically related that question to statements made from within CIE since Christmas.  It was ruled out of order by you on the basis that it was a repeat.  I have to say that I do not understand that, given that it specifically related to those statements but what concerns me is that I was not formally made aware of the fact that it was being ruled out of order until this morning.  In fact, due to the good offices of another Member of the House, I was aware of it in advance of that and, being so aware, I attempted to take some steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am considering proposals relating to the general question of entry to third level.  This will of course involve discussion with third level institutions among others.  I hope that such discussions can be got under way shortly.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to anxieties expressed within the educational world about circumstances in which the leaving certificate, which is for all students, should have this structured role in the interests of the minority of students who aspire to attend the national University of Ireland?  Even if the Minister is satisfied that it is proper that there should be a role for third level in relation to the leaving certificate why is there a distinction to be drawn between the National University of Ireland and, for example, the non-HEA sector?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the VECs and other parties concerned with the provision of adult education, will <Col N="320" /> continue to ensure that adult education is as effective and accessible as possible within available resources.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that it has been possible to increase the moneys available for adult education over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>A wide range of relevant courses is available to people throughout the country. In the case of the disadvantaged second chance education is available at much reduced fees and literacy and community education is provided free or at nominal cost.</P>
    <P>My Department's approach is to work towards making the best use of resources available.  In that regard I might refer to the two bodies established to deal with adult education in an umbrella fashion, that is AONTAS and NALA and say that, for example, NALA received £28,000 in 1988 and in 1989 £42,000. There has also been an increased allocation to AONTAS, from £77,000 in 1988 to £85,000 in 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, that as a first step, she should restore the original cadre of adult education organisers appointed around the country?  In that context will she confirm that, of the original 50 posts approved, something of the order of 40 or 42 only have been filled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year in respect of the adult literacy and community education scheme the amount sanctioned for the VECs was £400,000.  That has been increased to £500,000 this year, representing an increase of 25 per cent which is commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the area of adult education literacy appears to have been excluded from consideration for EC Structural <Col N="321" /> Funds?  Is she aware that those involved in the adult education area say that they made submissions with a view to benefiting from EC Structural Funds and that, while those submissions were received, they were then told that they were being excluded?  Does the Minister regard that as a satisfactory state of affairs?  If she does not, will she take up the matter with her colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, who has such responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is one on which there are ongoing discussions in Government in regard to the seven regional plans around the country being codified <i>vis-à-vis</i> the various proposals to be incorporated in the overall national plan.  I am reasonably satisfied that, in the economic circumstances prevailing, to have been able to grant an increase to NALA, AONTAS and the VECs of 25 per cent is good. Naturally one would wish one had unlimited funds to allocate to what is a very good cause.  But, bearing in mind the conflicting demands within the education budget, what we have been able to do for this most necessitous area has been relatively good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Minister has said in that regard.  Indeed I would be much happier if she simply fulfilled the funding commitments of the previous Government in this area.  My question related specifically to the possibility of securing moneys from the EC Structural Funds for adult education and specifically for literacy.  Would the Minister accept that, for those who are unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, the possibility of second chance education and the possibility of addressing literacy and numeracy problems constitutes a very important and practical way of helping them into the labour market?  If the Minister does accept that contention would she not then accept that there is a role in this for moneys from the EC Structural Funds? If that is so, will she please take up with <Col N="322" /> her colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, why she has disappointed the providers of adult education?</P>

      <P>Since 1985, £1.8 million have been provided as against the £1 million originally targeted by the Coalition. I make that point for the record.  I have no objection at all to talking to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, about matters such as these.  In the meantime I do not intend to sit back on that aspect.

I was at pains each year, in my circular accompanying the VECs allocations, to emphasise the importance I attach to community and literacy education.  I should say that the schemes to which the Deputy referred, the day time adult schemes, particularly for women in various areas would come within the overall umbrella of community education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the grant for necessitous pupils in the primary sector is this, that each child who is deemed to be necessitous is given an annual grant of £6, that is the amount the State provides towards the provision of school books.  In view of the fact that that grant has remained static since 1985, since then the cost of school books has increased considerably, just as the economic difficulties encountered by families whose school-going children could now be deemed to be necessitous have increased enormously due to the rise in <Col N="324" /> the level of unemployment, does the Minister consider that satisfactory in the face of those variables?  What plans, if any, has she to raise the amount of that grant, bringing it into line with the cost of books and the ever growing need of parents to provide books for their school-going children, especially those parents experiencing great economic hardship? That is my first question.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked a question about aid for books for necessitous pupils in primary schools.  Again, for the record &mdash; because I like to be fair to all sides &mdash; Deputy Quill did say the grant had remained static since 1985.  That is not quite accurate.  Perhaps I might be permitted to give the relevant figures.  In 1985 the provision of aid to necessitous pupils for books in the primary schools sector amounted to £783,000</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the grant per pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to give the global figure because it is money about which we are talking.  I might repeat that in 1985 the figure was £783,000; in 1986, £826,000 and in 1987, £846,000.  The <Col N="325" /> figure remained static between the years 1987 and 1988 when it stood at £846,000. The figure for 1989 is £982,000 which, in a period in which there has been the lowest inflation rate in 20 years, represents the highest percentage increase ever granted.  Of course the Deputy will contend that it is not sufficient and it is not.  As I have said repeatedly, we would all wish that there were always endless funds for allocation in the education sector.  However, I must point out that this is a priority of mine, as is the increase in the literacy allocation to VECs which constitutes an increase of 16.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the grant per pupil.  It is up to the principal of each school to decide how she or he will allocate the moneys available for this purpose which is normally allocated per child but it is up to the principal to give an extra grant if the degree of necessity is very high or by way of the loan of books or a combination of grant and loan.  It is left to the boards of management and principals of schools who I might add carry out their duties very effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the precise grant per pupil this year?  Second, is the Minister satisfied that a flat grant to all necessitous pupils in primary schools is the best way to approach the problem, bearing in mind that a six year old would have an annual outlay on books of approximately £8 to £10 whereas an 11 year old, at the tail end of the primary school system would require £35 to £40 in September for books?  Does the Minister think a flat across the board grant to every school pupil, irrespective of age or the outlay on books is the best way to meet the needs of necessitous pupils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that could be a matter for ongoing debate.  The Deputy's question was about the flat rate, and I told her it was £6 and it is now £7. This gives rise to the percentage increase that I have referred to.  The Department do not, as a rule, interfere in individual cases, or question a principal's decision. This has kept the scheme above criticism, because we could be accused of undue <Col N="326" /> interference if we were to dictate to a principal, or in a general way to a board of management, how the grants were to be allocated.  Principals run their schools and they know the pupils who are really in need as distinct from those covered by a departmental diktat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the special circumstances that have arisen as a result of changes in the curriculum which necessitate new books? On a previous occasion when we were discussing a question like this, the Minister undertook to have some feasibility studies carried out on the provision of books that might be rotated, like a library system.  Finally, is it not a fact that a number of school principals have contacted her Department saying they find the business of allocating an inadequate amount among the poor in their area to be an invidious task, which many of them find they are unable to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will answer the Deputy's final question.  No individual principal has contacted me directly, however they may have contacted the Department &mdash; I make that distinction. However, if they were to contact me I would be willing to listen to them.  The Deputy raised the major issue of post-primary books.  It would be more invidious for me to interfere with the principal of each school and to tell her or him their business in that respect.</P>
      <P>For the first time in a long number of years, we have given a substantial increase in the book grant scheme for necessitous pupils.  This arises directly from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which asked that the needs of the disadvantaged be kept always under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has asked about the post-primary scheme which is included in Deputy Wyse's question.  I will give the precise figures, the total grant for primary <Col N="327" /> school books for necessitous pupils this year is just short of £1 million, and for the post-primary sector it is a little under £2 million.  In 1985 the grant for post-primary pupils stood at £1,485,000 increasing to £1,570,000 in 1986, to £1,589,000 in 1987, remaining at £1,589,000 in 1988 and increasing to £1,912,000 in 1989, an increase of 20.3 per cent.  This increase is quite deliberate in view of the upcoming changes in the post-primary syllabi and curriculum and in the light of changes in the junior certificate examination embracing the intermediate certificate and the group certificate.</P>
    <P>Since I last spoke to Deputy Higgins on this matter, I had a meeting with the booksellers association coming up to Christmas last and expressed my very strong viewpoint, that while we are living in a free, competitive market and their job is to sell books, I said I did not approve of wholesale changes across the full spectrum of subjects.  I am keeping this under review.  I have met with the parent bodies, the managerial bodies and the unions on the same issue.  I feel very strongly about this issue because I was always assertive about the need for more and more books, but a 20 per cent increase in 1989 for the post-primary free school book scheme brings it to a little short of £2 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to post-primary books in post-primary schools, would the Minister's Department take action to ensure that as far as possible schools in the same catchment area which are likely to have pupils of the same family would opt for the same texts? Would she accept that that is particularly important given the greater discretion that would be available because of the <Col N="328" /> new junior syllabus?  Could her Department do something in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point.  I would not be able to say to school book sellers that they have got to do this but I could suggest it at a meeting with the joint managerial body and with the IVEA of the two sectors at post-primary level and also with the parents and they, through their own agencies, could suggest it.  It is a fair point and one worth looking at.</P>

      <P>It should definitely be encouraged.  The fact that books could be lent sounds perfectly reasonable.  Perhaps in my discussions and at teachers unions conferences things like that can be aired. Regarding the matter of the seven new syllabi which would require a consequent range of books I would not accept that every new syllabus will require a complete change.  Many can be done from the existing range.  Many of them give a welcome freedom to the teacher and to the pupil to choose from an already existing anthology or an existing book.  In the light of the fact that there will be changes and a need for books in September I was motivated to press for the handsome increase of 23.4 per cent bringing the amount to £2 million.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that particularly in the Dublin area the scheme can and does produce many anomalies and ridiculous arrangements that should be looked at closely.  As far <Col N="331" /> back as July 1988 in a meeting with the Minister for Education a number of these instances were drawn to her attention. As I understand the regulations transport is provided to the school within the shortest walking distance.  Public transport in Dublin on the radial basis can involve two or three journeys to a school and considerable greater distances and time. Has the Minister given any attention to these anomalies or is there any intention to amend the regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who deals with school transport will accept that there were anomalies right from the beginning of this scheme.  While I would not disagree with what the Deputy has said, any new scheme would bring about its own anomalies.  If the Deputy is suggesting that we do a complete change of the system that operates I suggest that he provide us with an alternative which will not have anomalies and certainly he will be doing something that was never done before.</P>

For example in my constituency the DART line is a very convenient mode of transport.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to people in that area who would like to attend the all Irish schools in Booterstown but the regulations require that those pupils go to Glasnevin.  The journey on the DART line is one single run across town and there is no change in terms of having to walk to a different route or bus, but to go to Glasnevin involves two different routes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and myself would agree with the Deputy that the specific arrangement in any particular case may not be the most suitable but the difficulty that exists, and which has always existed, is that if you divert from the objectives of the scheme and allow people to come and go as it suits them very soon people throughout will decide that it is more suitable to go here, there or elsewhere.  The Minister, the departmental officials and I have looked very carefully at this problem and no matter what you do with the scheme to try to accommodate the anomalies which we all accept you will create further anomalies. Obviously such changes would have major implications for teaching posts in schools where there may be a serious reduction in numbers in one area and an increase in numbers in other areas. Generally it is not possible to come up with an ideal scheme which is to everybody's satisfaction.  In relation to Irish schools and the question of convenience this is something that has been uppermost in the mind of the Minister because of her support for the Irish schools.  Certainly we will look at that particular aspect.</P>

      <P>While the Minister of State is having a look at the Irish schools would he have a look at the situation of the multidenominational schools.  Is he aware that some very curious features seem to have arisen in relation to what is regarded as a suitable school?  In some parts of the country it appears that the providers of transport have taken the view that a multidenominational school is suitable for the Protestant children of the area but not suitable for the Catholic children of the area which is a very odd arrangement.</P>

      <P>We will have a look at it.  There are certain exceptions to the scheme and one such exception is the provision for the conveyance of Protestant children to national schools under Protestant management and consequently they have always been given the necessary advantage in terms of the provision of school transport.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that there are many anomalies.  Would he accept that in many cases the school transport system is designed to facilitate transport operators rather than children? If he is looking for a criteria against which to eliminate a number of the anomalies, he might start with the children.  In my constituency children who want to get to a certain school are brought by public transport to the city of Cork and must <Col N="334" /> make their way to the school by another means of transport.  If children could be taken from their homes to the school I would suggest that that might be a very good way to begin unravelling the anomalies to which the Minister has referred and which he has honestly acknowledged are there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of teaching posts which will become available in national schools in 1989-90 will be determined by reference to the schedule governing the appointment and retention of staff, the school enrolment on 30 September 1988 and the numbers who leave the teaching service during the summer of 1989 by virtue of retirement, career breaks and other reasons.  A portion of the posts which become available will be filled through the redeployment of teachers whose posts are discontinued because of the expected fall in enrolment, and the remainder will be fillable by recruitment.  It would not be possible at this stage to accurately predict the number of jobs which would become available to new graduates.</P>
      <P>The present schedule governing the appointment and retention of staff in national schools will remain in force in the 1989-90 school year but will be improved by one unit cumulatively with effect from September 1990.

      <P>Obviously no one could expect the Minister to be accurate at this stage of the year.  Nonetheless, I would suggest that in the Department of Education everything is decided by numbers.  Can the Minister give any general indications at this stage as to the number of teaching posts that will be available, given the present resources, and compare that with the number of trainee teachers who will be coming out of the training colleges?  Would she agree that there is a vast number of young people coming out of our training colleges who have no prospects whatsoever of securing teaching jobs in this country <Col N="336" /> because of the current state of education here?</P>

      <P>To answer the first part of the question, I wish I could be accurate but at present it is all a matter of gathering and compiling the returns of 30 September.  One imponderable is the number who voluntarily retire for various reasons or who retire on grounds of disability. That is a number we can never put a figure on.  Another imponderable is the number who seek career breaks.  One never knows from year to year what that number will be.  I would be very glad to answer this question later when the figures are more readily identifiable.  I would like to be more precise about it if I could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement from the Royal Irish Academy which the Deputy refers to, expresses in the main, concern about the methods of funding research in Ireland.  The interdepartmental committee on third-level education which was set up by the Government was asked, as part of its terms of reference, to make recommendations about how third-level education and research should be funded. The Deputy may be assured that the academy's comments will be fully considered by the committee.  In that regard the Royal Irish Academy have sent a copy of their book, <i>Research in Ireland,</i> to the Assistant Secretary in the Department who is the chairman of the interdepartmental committee on third level education and therefore it is being taken into account in their deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the document to which the question refers the statement is contained that a number of recent measures of an economic kind are such as to endanger basic research in Ireland?  Is she not worried about the fact that Ireland is at the bottom of the international tables in regard to basic research by comparison with countries like Belgium and Denmark? I want to hear her attitude to the positive proposals put forward by the academy.  Is she considering, for example, the expansion of the Eolas postgraduate support scheme to cover the <Col N="338" /> humanities and is she considering the restoration of post-doctorate fellowships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals which the Royal Irish Academy have put forward in their very well researched document called <i>Research in Ireland</i> have cost implications.  I had thought about the point raised by the Deputy in regard to the extension of the Eolas scheme to include the humanities but the very title of Eolas precludes such an extension. As the Deputy knows that sector has received considerable funding for research.  I would certainly undertake to speak to the Minister, Deputy Seán McCarthy, with whom I have already had extensive discussions with regard to research in technology, about the possible extension of that scheme to involve the humanities.  In the overall situation the interdepartmental committee, as part of their brief, have to consider that matter in particular and I look forward to hearing what they have to say about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the basic argument in the document, that the technologies on which her college, to whom she has referred, places so much emphasis depend, in the end on basic research?  Is she not concerned that, irrespective of what the committee come up with, the institutes involved have now stated that the cuts in funding for basic research are such as to imperil the later development of technologies and that it is a matter of great urgency and concern?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the report published by the Higher Education Authority in December 1988 (details supplied) which showed that only 25 per cent of school leavers from Dublin went to college, compared to 35 per cent in some western counties; and that school leavers from working class areas of Dublin were particularly disadvantaged; if she has any plans to bring about a more equitable distribution of third level places; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the findings in the recent Clancy report that admission rates in third level education vary by county in the range 19 per cent to 35 per cent and that the rate for Dublin is at the lower level.  While some variation is inevitable I am concerned at the degree of variation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the interdepartmental committee on third level education to give special attention to this issue and I will be considering what action should be taken after I have received the committee's report which I expect to receive in the next few months.  It would be as well to point out that Patrick Clancy issued his first report which related to 1980 in 1983 and this one in 1986.  The level of participation of the relevant age group in third level education increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent between <Col N="340" /> 1980 and 1986.  This included very dramatic increases for some counties plus the stubborn persistence of Dublin not to increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Clancy report also indicated that where third level colleges exist, more pupils from that area attend third level colleges.  Would the Minister agree that in view of the high number of third level colleges in Dublin, there should be a higher proportion of pupils from Dublin?  Having had the report for at least two months now, has the Minister analysed the cause of this and would she consider that the allocation of grants is one of the major causes of this imbalance?  It is much more difficult for children of a PAYE worker to get a grant than it is for the children of self-employed people and farmers.  Has the Minister any ideas for changing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no ready explanations for the level of variation shown &mdash; 20 per cent for Offaly, 23 per cent for Laois, but 30 per cent for Longford and 34 per cent for Leitrim.  These figures are not easy to reconcile, and distance from and nearness to a third level institution do not appear to be major factors.  One of the major factors in third level participation rates is that the participation rates to the end of second level education have dramatically increased as well, as the Conference for Major Religious Superiors acknowledged in their major report last autumn.  A low participation level is probably linked to poor motivation and income levels in families in large population areas.  The level of grant applicable is another factor and there has been growing concern at the preponderence of children of self-employed people receiving third level grants to the alleged detriment of PAYE workers' children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that she is not accepting the logic of low motivation as a factor in participation?  As referred to in the Dr. Clancy report, if we exclude people from the lower socio-economic groups in one generation we cannot then be surprised that their children are excluded because of the lack of adequate provision for their right to get into third level education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of any member of Government or Opposition must be to increase participation levels in general but in particular to address the position whereby lower socio-economic groupings' participation is so low that that imbalance must be addressed.  Many factors come into play &mdash; increased participation at second level to the Leaving Certificate stage, the background of young people and even making the system of entry to third level education more understandable in a general way.  I am very busy with all that work now and I hope to have some proposals in place quite shortly.</P>

      <P>To what does the Minister attribute the very wide variation of which she has just spoken, and would she accept that in the case of Dublin there are whole belts of the city with very low participation rates?  Would the Minister agree that it is possible to address that problem by the provision of the RTC in Tallaght which has been long promised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also agree that a possible explanation for the variation is a very much lower opportunity to avail of Social Fund supporting <Col N="342" /> courses in the Dublin area than elsewhere? Will the Minister look at that element?  Is it not the case that the percentage of courses available in Dublin that would enjoy Social Fund support is much lower than elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of certificate courses which are nearly all funded partly by Europe and by the Department is certainly lower in the VEC colleges in the Dublin area than in any of the nine RTCs around the country, which appear to run courses suitable for the allocations of the money.  I have not a ready explanation. There are a variety of causes.  I agree that the provision of a technical college in Tallaght would certainly help to redress some of the imbalances that have arisen.  For that reason I put it forward for inclusion in the Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are regulations in place but is the Minister satisfied that some of our school buildings are not fire hazards?  Even though these regulations are in place, if a fire occurred drills would be useless because it is not possible to evacuate the buildings quickly.  I can instance certain cases where the authorities involved have pointed out that if there was a fire in their schools they could not evacuate the buildings in time and people would be injured.  I believe the Minister should review the state of the school buildings rather than review the regulations.  The regulations are fine so long as the buildings are right but the problem relates to buildings where the regulations cannot be enforced.</P>

      <P>The question I was asked related to the fire regulations laid down by my Department for primary and secondary schools.  That is the question I answered but I have no objection to answering what the Deputy has put to me.  If the Deputy has a particular case <Col N="344" /> in mind and does not want to mention it publicly, if he gives me the details privately I will have the matter addresssed. I have to say that any time a report from a fire officer is received in the Department we attend to it as quickly as possible and naturally the prime reason the Department respond quickly is to ensure the safety of the children.  I know what Deputy Deenihan said was said in good faith and because of his sense of commitment but I caution him to be wary about creating wholesale scares about schools.  The Deputy asked me about the fire regulations and I replied to that question but if he has a particular case in mind he should give me the details.  In any instance where fire officers reports are submitted we will certainly attend to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause 7 of the higher education grants scheme provides that grants payable by local authorities shall be issued to students as early as possible <Col N="346" /> in each term of the academic year. Prompt payment of higher education grants to eligible students is, therefore, a matter for local authorities who are statutorily entrusted with administration of the scheme.  If a delay such as referred to by the Deputy occurs in particular cases, it is almost invariably due to a delay in establishing reckonable income for purposes of the means test in cases where audited accounts, etc., have to be produced.  In general, however, I am not aware of any undue delay in payment of grants where eligibility of the applicants has been established.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the local authority are under an obligation to pay out the grants as expeditiously as possible once they get their allocation from the Department of Education?  Is it not true that for the past five years, for example, third level grant holders in the Galway area have drawn attention to the fact that the county council have claimed they have not got their money from the Department and, therefore, cannot pay the students on time?</P>

With regard to the recoupment by Louth County Council of their expenditure on higher education grants &mdash; and I have no reason to believe that Louth should have been more favourably treated than any other county &mdash; it is interesting to note, that the county councils application for recoupment was received in the Department on 23 January 1989 and payment was made on 31 January, exactly eight days.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the steps she intends to take to implement the terms of the motion passed by Dáil Éireann on 7 <Col N="349" /> December 1988, which called for the building of a third level college in Tallaght, Dublin 24 as well as second level schools in Kingswood/Kilnamanagh and Jobstown; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present considering the future of Jobstown community college.</P>
      <P>The present position regarding the proposed post-primary school for the Kingswood Heights/Kilnamanagh areas of Tallaght is that in view of the considerable amount of capital expenditure required to provide the school, the strict limitation of funding available to my Department and the large number of cases requiring urgent attention, all aspects of the project are the subject of a detailed investigation before commitments can be entered into.  Consequently, I am not in a position to say when work will commence on the school.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to the debate on the motion in question that I had instructed my Department to include the Tallaght regional technical college in the submission they have made for support from the European Structural Funds. That has been done.  I am keeping in touch personally with developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a most disappointing answer from the Minister. I am sure she is aware that this is the only area in the country in which there will be an increasing population of young people, both for second level and third level education, for at least the next decade and probably into the next millennium. Is the Minister aware that the Brookfield school which the 250 Jobstown pupils are allowed to use at the moment because they have no school of their own, has asked that those pupils be out by next September?  There will be then 250 pupils with no school to go to.  Is the Minister further aware that £120,000 has already been spent on professional fees with not a stone put upon a stone? The Minister's reply was that she is considering the future of Jobstown.  Does <Col N="350" /> that mean that she is considering not having any school there?</P>

I have also met with the board of management of Brookfield.  I am aware of the position with regard to next September.  I have practically assembled all the facts I need.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the action taken by her in respect of second chance education in <Col N="352" /> accordance with the Government decision announced in paragraph 4.29 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The White Paper referred to by the Deputy is that of a previous Government, published in 1984, and it would not, I believe, be appropriate for me to comment on the action or inaction of that Government in respect of their policies.</P>
      <P>However, as an independent initiative, my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and myself established an interdepartmental committee to report to us on the problem and on foot of their recommendations we launched a special joint programme to cater for the special needs of unqualified early school leavers.</P>
      <P>This programme, called Youthreach, could be seen as fulfilling the need outlined in the White Paper to which the Deputy refers.  The new programme, to be operated by the vocational education committees and Fás, and, indeed, already set up in two centres will provide education and training for 3,000 early school leavers.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to paragraph 4.29 of the 1984 proposal to which the Deputy refers in his question.  An approach different from that of AnCO in general training is required for people leaving school with no formal educational qualifications or who are lacking in literacy and oral skills. It must be recognised that the prospects for employment in modern industry of people deficient in those skills are severely restricted.  Therefore the Departments of Education and of Labour have been asked to draw up an employment oriented system of second chance education for those who, having left school early, are deficient in these respects.  That was in 1984 and the previous Government left office in 1987 without having done anything about it. Bertie Ahern and I have done it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to a decision of the board of management of the Regional College, Letterkenny, County Donegal not to allow 35 language students to go on an eight day educational trip to the European Parliament in Strasbourg; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Letterkenny Regional Technical College is administered under the aegis of County Donegal Vocational Education Committee with responsibility for the day to day management of the college resting with a board of management. I am aware of the board's decision not to permit the students to travel during term time.  I am given to understand that the decision was based on educational considerations and that the board would have no objections to such a visit outside term time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously covering up for somebody.  She will appreciate that this was purely a political decision because my esteemed colleague and member of the European Parliament, Joseph McCartin, organised this <Col N="354" /> trip and got the European grant for it for the students concerned.  There is grave alarm in County Donegal that politics should be brought to such a low level that a school management, led by a Member of the House, Deputy Blayney and who are either entirely Fianna Fáil or Independent Fianna Fáil, should discriminate against 15 students going to Strasbourg. Because of the political bias of the school management board former Deputy McCartin in the last minute had to switch the money to Sligo.  Sligo Regional College had no difficulty whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would have to establish that the running of such day to day functions of a regional college rests with the board of management who, in turn, report to the relevant vocational education committee.  It quite amazes me that the trend of questions has been that I must continuously intervene on everything from the smallest item to the most major.  When one does this, one is accused of being interventionist and of taking sides.</P>
      <P>This proposal arose, I understand, following inquiries which had been made by an esteemed lecturer in the RTC, the Deputy's own son, Patrick Harte, to the EC officials in Dublin and to Mr. McCartin, MEP.  I should like to rectify a misrepresentation which appears to have occurred.  Yesterday the board of management of the Donogh O'Malley Regional Technical College in Letterkenny issued a press statement to the effect that they turned down the trip because it was to happen during term time.  They were concerned about the loss of time to the students going to Europe and also the loss to the students at home caused by the absence of some of the lecturers and tutors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister to intervene but to concern herself with the political bias of the school management who took this decision.  The Minister has mentioned my son, who was in the background organising the trip. The bias was against the former Deputy, Joe McCartin.  Is the Minister aware that the student member of the board of management who protested at the decision received an anonymous telephone call the following morning telling her that if she pressed the matter she would be removed from the board?  The Minister should be concerned about the use of such tactics.  I am not asking the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte is concerned about the alleged political bias, as he sees it.  We live in a democratic system. Vocational education committees are sub-committees of county councils.  It is the people going to the polls who elect people to the relevant vocational education committees.

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Harte should get accurate information.  Inaccurate information is the hallmark of the blackguarding in Letterkenny as to the decision of the management board.  Are the Deputy and the Minister aware that <Col N="356" /> the board were not told that those going on the trip would be language students? There were to be 15 from business studies, unspecified and yet to be selected; ten from engineering and five from art, yet to be selected; two from the students' union, yet to be selected, and three lecturers, yet to be selected.  There was no suggestion that this trip had anything to do with the curriculum of any of the faculties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett made the point when speaking here on 15 December that the question of the criteria for giving a supply certificate should be looked at in conjunction with classification.  This is a valid point and, accordingly, I propose to give some details now.  I also told Deputy De Rossa, when he raised the matter, that I would give details of amendments I have in mind for a classification system and which I will introduce on Report Stage. It is reasonable to give those details now as Deputies may be of the view that they are relevant to the debate on the criteria in section 3.  Deputies will remember that I promised to have another look at the classification question in the context of giving information about the contents of the video work in a recording.  I felt there was a lot to be said for having classification for information purposes.  Having considered the matter thoroughly, I am satisfied that such classification would be a useful addition to the Bill.  Accordingly, I will move a series of amendments to that effect on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments will provide for four classifications in all.  The first and highest classification will be that the work is fit for viewing by persons generally; the second classification will be that the work is fit for viewing by persons generally but, in the case of a child under 12 years, only in the company of a responsible adult; the third category will be for works considered to be fit for viewing by persons aged 15 years or more; and the final category will relate to those works which the <Col N="400" /> censor considers are fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more.  I want to make it quite clear that the classification I will be proposing is intended for information purposes only.  The amendments will provide for any offence in respect of the supply of a recording of a video work to a person outside the age group for whom the work is classified.</P>
    <P>As I have said on a number of occasions already, I am very anxious that we should reach consensus on the provisions of this Bill.  What we are trying to do here is to arrive at the best possible Bill having regard to the controls that we wish to bring in for video recordings and having regard also to the practicalities of the situation.  All of us have ideas as to how the Bill should be framed.  We must examine all these ideas, pick out the best of them and force them into an effective Bill.</P>
    <P>The classification system I have in mind will give information to parents as to the suitability of video recordings of particular works for their children.  It is no harm to stress once again the responsibility of parents in this area.  The State can do a certain amount in bringing in controls.  However, it remains for parents to play their part and when we are talking about video films the part that can be played by parents is as important, if not more important, than the part played by the State.  The purpose of my outlining the classification system is to enable Deputies to relate them to the debate we are having at present concerning the criteria in section 3 of the Bill.  I hope the information will be useful in that context.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult areas of this Bill in so far as drafting is concerned was the drafting of the criteria for refusing a supply certificate set out in section 3, and for making a prohibition order set out in section 6.</P>
    <P>As I said already, there is the desire in drafting criteria such as this to give the person who has to make a decision as much guidance as possible.  At the same time there is the realisation that it is not possible to pin things down exactly and, in fact, in trying to come up with precise criteria one may tie the hands of the <Col N="401" /> censor in a totally unrealistic fashion.  The criteria in the two sections should be looked at with this in mind.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important point in relation to the criteria is that the censor has to decide that the video work is unfit for viewing because he is of the opinion that the viewing of it would, for instance, tend to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it because of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter.  It is not sufficient that the film should contain obscene or indecent matter.  The censor has to be of the opinion that it is unfit for viewing because the viewing of it would tend to deprave, etc.  The censor has a discretion in the matter.  At very best it would be unrealistic to attempt to deprive him of that discretion and perhaps also it would be impossible to do so and at the same time have meaningful legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies again to the individual criteria in (a) and (b) of subsection 1.  The first category of criteria in (a) of the subsection refers to material that would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection. Again it must be remembered that the film censor must form the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because of this ground.  The ground is intended to deal with situations such as those where detailed information is given in relation to how to commit a crime and the depiction of it would be such as to cause the viewer to commit the crime whether by inciting or encouraging him to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection.  Again one must remember that the film censor has a discretion here.  Obviously he will not ban films such as &ldquo;How To Steal A Million&rdquo;. In fact it is likely that there will be a very small number of video works that will be refused a supply certificate on this ground.  However, it is necessary to provide for this category as it would not be caught by the traditional criteria for banning films which generally relate to material that is obscene or indecent or <Col N="402" /> material that would tend to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it.</P>
    <P>The second category of criteria in (a) of the subsection refers to material that would tend, by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it.  As I have said already, this is a type of criteria that is mentioned in earlier legislation in relation to cinema films and publications.  I would expect that it will be the most relevant ground as regards refusing supply certificates or making prohibition orders as most works which would fail to get a supply certificate would fail because of the inclusion of material of this nature.  Again I must stress that the film censor has discretion in relation to this type of material.  It is not sufficient that there is obscene or indecent matter in the video work &mdash; it must be of such a nature that the censor will form the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because the viewing of it would tend to deprave, etc.</P>
    <P>The last category of video work which would fail to get a supply certificate is that where there is a depiction of acts of gross violence or cruelty towards humans or animals.  The ground is not included in earlier legislation and the reason for its inclusion now is that such material is known to have been included in video works.  For that reason it was decided that it was necessary to provide for it specifically.  Again the censor must be able to form the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because of the inclusion of this material.  In other words he has a discretion in the matter.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt individually with the amendments put down by Deputies. I appreciate that all Deputies who have spoken on this matter are attempting to improve on the wording in the Bill.  I am at one with them in that objective but frankly I am not convinced that the alternative wordings proposed are an improvement on the wording in the Bill at present with one possible exception that I will deal with in a minute or two.</P>
    <P>First, let me say a few more words about the amendment put down by Deputy Taylor, amendment No. 7a.  As I <Col N="403" /> have already said, the wording of this amendment is fairly close to what is included in subsection (2) of section 2 of the British Video Recordings Act, 1984. However the purpose of the criteria in subsection (2) of section 2 of that Act is different from the purpose of the criteria in sections 3 and 6 of this Bill.  The 1984 British Act does not contain criteria for the refusal of classification certificates. Those criteria are included in the Censorship of Publications Act, 1959.  The purpose of the criteria in the 1984 Act is to remove an exemption from works which otherwise would have an exemption, works in the educational, sport or religious areas or works which are video games.  The purpose of subsection (2) of section 2 of that Act is to provide that if any works of that nature contain material such as is described in subsection (2) the work would have to be examined in the light of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act.  The criteria mentioned in that Act relate to a matter which is obscene or indecent and which would tend to deprave or corrupt people.</P>
    <P>I am willing to consider one small amendment to the criteria and this is the removal of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; at the end of line 8 on page 6 and at the end of line 1 on page 8.  The effect of this would be to refer to &ldquo;obsecene or indecent matter&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;any obscene or indecent matter&rdquo;.  This amendment would not affect the purpose and intent of the criteria set out in the two sections. However, it might help to dispel some of the reservations Deputies have about the criteria as presently set out and I am suggesting it for that reason.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I will provide on Report Stage for the removal of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;, and I am keeping to a promise, as I said I would the last day in reply to Deputy Barrett and Deputy De Rossa and possibly others &mdash; there seemed to be general agreement with Deputy Colley holding a similar viewpoint to that of Deputy De Rossa &mdash; that I would let Members know as to how I would proceed on Report Stage in an effort to meet concerns genuinely held.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to say that I appreciate the open way in which the Minister is approaching this debate and the way in which he is attempting to meet the concerns expressed by Deputies on this side of the House in regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's offer of a compromise in respect of providing classification for information purposes. Obviously it does not go the full distance in meeting my concern, but it does satisfy one of those, that is, that without some form of classification, even for information purposes, the censor might feel constrained not to allow certain videos through as the chances were that it would get into the hands of very young children. What is being proposed by the Minister would remove that constraint from the censor.  He would now be free to look at a video in the knowledge that he has received some guidance on what classification he should apply to the video.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposal to delete the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; in paragraph (a), again this is an indication of the Minister's willingness to travel some of the road with us.  I sought to have the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; replaced by the word &ldquo;grossly&rdquo; so that the subsection would read &ldquo;would tend, by reason of the inclusion in it of grossly obscene or indecent matter&rdquo;.  The removal of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; would satisfy to a large degree my concern.  The point I tried to make was that it was not good enough to insert a word in a section which could be interpreted in a very narrow or very broad way depending on who the occupant of the position of censor was. Obviously, the wording of the section could be interpreted by the censor in an objective way but nevertheless the proposed deletion of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; corresponds with the view of the House that the section should not be interpreted in too narrow a sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points I would like to make in respect of this section which we have been dealing with for a long time &mdash; for that reason I do not propose to go on at length &mdash; is that we should include a reference to the stirring up of hatred on the basis of religious beliefs, nationality, <Col N="405" /> race, gender or sexual orientation which is what I sought to do in the amendment I tabled.  A section of the Bill which referred to the stirring up of hatred on the basis of race, nationality and religious beliefs was taken out during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad.  The Minister argued that it was not necessary to include such a section because a similar section is included in the Racial Hatred Bill which at present is going through the Seanad.  However, I strongly believe that a specific reference to it should be contained in the Video Recordings Bill and that the censor should be obliged to consider the question of whether a video is aimed at promoting hatred on racial or religious grounds or indeed on the grounds of the gender or sexual orientation of a person.  The Racial Hatred Bill at present going through the Seanad contains no reference to gender or sexual orientation.  When that Bill comes before this House the Minister may argue that that section need not be included in that Bill either as there is no such reference in the United Nations Convention.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether he would be willing to include a section containing a reference to the promotion of racial hatred or hatred on the grounds of nationality, gender or sexual orientation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, appreciate the indication the Minister has given of what we can expect to see on Report Stage in respect of the amendments relating to classification.  As the Minister has indicated, if the amendments were to have such an effect I would be happy but I would prefer to await the full wording before deciding on my position. However, the approach the Minister has adopted is constructive.  I would have no problem with the removal of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;, as this would enable the censor to take the meaning that we would wish to have taken out of the wording of section 3 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I still have a difficulty with the wording of section 3 (1) (a) (i) which reads &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so&rdquo;.  The phrase <Col N="406" />&ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo; is very subjective and would present the film censor with a very difficult task.  He would be able to decide from what is depicted in the video whether it would incite somebody to commit an act of violence or a crime.  He would also be able to decide after looking at it whether it would encourage a person to do so but he would not be able to decide after looking at it whether it was likely a person would commit a crime.  It is beyond the capabilities of the film censor looking at a certain video, which undoubtedly is encouraging somebody to go out and do something unlawful, to say that it will have that effect.  All viewers who are going to see this video will react in different ways.  It is unnecessary to include the words &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo;.  It is misleading as to the effect of this section and it is asking of the censor something he is incapable of doing while he is carrying out his duty &mdash; viewing the video. Having regard to what is required in this Bill, he must decide whether the video is inciting or encouraging somebody to commit a crime.  That is why I feel my amendment No. 9 is tighter and more direct and asks of the censor exactly what this House wants him to do, that is, to see if a video incites or encourages a person to commit a crime.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider accepting my amendment because it has the very same objective in mind as the Bill, but it is more in keeping with what we can expect the censor to do.  We are putting him in a very difficult situation, when we ask him whether a video is likely to cause somebody to go out and commit a crime, given the different reactions people have. The only thing he can judge is what he sees, but he cannot say if it is inciting or encouraging somebody to commit a crime because he cannot know what effect it will have on an individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe Members will agree with Deputy Colley's point of view, but I have had the case made by Deputy Colley on amendment No. 9 looked at in great detail since we discussed the matter <Col N="407" /> on 15 December, and I am advised that under the section as drafted the official censor has to consider whether the viewing would be likely to cause persons to commit crime whether by inciting or encouraging them, etc.  Deputy Colley's amendment would require the censor to consider whether the viewing would incite or encourage etc.  With all due respect to the film censor, for whom we have great regard, he is no clairvoyant and the natural question for him to ask himself would be whether this work would be likely to incite viewers to commit crime; not &ldquo;would it incite?&rdquo; but &ldquo;would it be likely to do so?&rdquo; I think Members will agree with me that the section as drafted gives the right idea.  It gives him that extra bit of discretion, that little more room to manoeuvre: would it be likely to cause people to commit crime or, as Deputy Colley would strengthen it, would it incite etc.?  The House can see what I am trying to get at.  There is no hang-up between us; it is a matter of what is most practical and effective.  I believe &ldquo;likely&rdquo; is better here than &ldquo;would&rdquo;.  I would like to hear the views of other Members on it.  We are not going to disagree on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister when he indicated that this section, which is the bones of the Bill, gave rise to very considerable difficulties at the drafting stage.  One can understand very well how that was, but I feel he has not come up with the best solution as the Bill now stands.  The mere fact that the Minister has to get down to such a fine point as &ldquo;likely to incite&rdquo;, &ldquo;would incite&rdquo; highlights the points I am trying to make. The difficulty with those interpretations is that the unfortunate censor is doing his best, of course, but he is trying to put himself into the minds of other people. We all know from legal practice that you cannot do that.  Judges refuse to do it.  It is impossible to put yourself into the minds of other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach taken of dealing with what would be likely to happen, or would tend to happen, is not a good one.  Having <Col N="408" /> thought about it carefully, I came to the conclusion that the only way to tackle this realistically was not to try to decide what effect a video would be likely to have on persons in general, or would tend to have on persons in general, but to look at it and ask what it does, what it shows, and if it shows certain things it should be censored but if it does not, it is all right.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, correctly, the censor is just one person.  That is not a good idea, it would be better if there had been a group, but, as we all know, opinions and views can vary from censor to censor.  It has been said that there is a safeguard here because if a film has been on general release in the cinemas it will be all right to release it as a video.  That is true as far as it goes, but many videos will not be released in film form, and will have to be considered on their own merits or demerits as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (b) gets away from the &ldquo;would be likely to&rdquo; or &ldquo;would tend to&rdquo; idea and says &ldquo;depicts&rdquo; acts of gross violence. Leaving aside descriptions, that approach is correct where the section is dealing with what is in the video and takes that as the appropriate criterion rather than the vagary of trying to decide whether it would tend to do something or would not.  When the section says, for example, &ldquo;would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo;, what person does that mean?  What is the unfortunate censor supposed to take from that?  Put yourself in his position.  Some persons, one person, any person, persons in general &mdash; it would have a different effect on different people.  The most outlandish of these video nasties seen by the Minister or by me is not going to deprave us, but it might deprave some people.  An unacceptable difficulty will be put on the censor if we deal with the matter in that way.</P>
    <P>For those reasons my amendment No. 7a got away from that kind of approach and simply delineated the substance of what would be in the video.  The censor looks at that; does it depict the things I have specified?  If so then it is out; if it does not, it is all right.  In all <Col N="409" /> cases, I have used the words &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo;, and that is an important safeguard because many videos will show violent scenes and the question then will be whether the extent of that violence is significant.  I am unhappy about this issue of &ldquo;likely to commit crimes&rdquo; and suggesting ways of doing it and ways of avoiding detection.  We are going too far in taking that as a subject for video nasties. I do not think that category was in the minds of Members originally and it appears to have been introduced as a separate one.  In my view it is in a different category to films that portray violence and sex.  I do not think it should have been introduced and it will present problems.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is possible to obtain a video that gives instructions in crime or one that outlines ways of avoiding detection but I accept that such information can be obtained from most crime films which are a major part of the video industry.  Most videos on crime suggest possible ways of committing crimes or avoiding detection but we are going too far if we include that classification.  The Minister should give serious consideration to dropping it.</P>
    <P>I do not think the dropping of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; in section 3 (3) (a) will make a great deal of difference to the interpretation, if one looks at this objectively.  It would have been better if Deputy De Rossa's suggestion in regard to the word &ldquo;grossly&rdquo; had been adopted.  It would have been a substantial improvement on the subsection. I do not think the deletion of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; will add a great deal to the section.</P>
    <P>It is not ideal to have one person acting as censor.  The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism considered the question of censorship and recommended that there should be a video censorship authority but I do not think they amplified on that recommendation. Certainly, they envisaged more than one person being involved.  It would have been better if the Minister had decided on a group of people, even two or three people, to give a balanced viewpoint on videos.  It would also give an element of continuity to the authority <Col N="410" /> because if one member died the standards set by the group could be continued by the remaining members.  If the task is left to one person a new appointee might have a different outlook on the censorship of videos.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it is right to proceed with the section as it stands.  It is too vague and leaves too much to the unfortunate censor by asking that person to form an opinion on whether a video would be likely to encourage people to commit crimes or would tend to mislead depraved people.  The provision in regard to the depicting of acts of gross violence is a good one but my amendment would have improved the measure.  I do not mind if the Minister considers it necessary to extend it but it would be a mistake to leave the section in its present form by reason of its vagueness and the uncertainty that will be left with the censor and the appeals board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his decision in regard to classification.  On Report Stage we will have an opportunity to debate the text of the Minister's amendment.  However, I do not understand why the Minister had to go into so much detail in regard to this. It is obvious that his amendment is along the lines of a provision in the Film Act, 1923 but I wonder if it was necessary to go into such detail.  In our amendment we suggest that the censor should be given power to either issue a supply certificate or a limited supply certificate.  It is important that the censor should have flexibility in deciding what age group should view a video but I do not think it is necessary to enshrine that power in the Bill.  We have had sufficient experience in regard to film censorship to be able to make up our minds in regard to videos.  For example, the Film Censor demonstrated his good sense of judgment by imposing restrictions in regard to the showing of the film, &ldquo;The Last Temptation of Christ&rdquo;.  I do not think we could include in a Bill the conditions he imposed in regard to the showing of that film.  I do not think it is necessary for us to specify the age groups.  We should give the censor <Col N="411" /> discretion to issue a supply certificate or a limited supply certificate.  It should be left to the censor to decide on the age limits.</P>
      <P>There was a fear in the Department of Justice that if that suggestion was adopted all videos would have to be viewed by the censor but I do not see how that could arise.  I may be missing the point but I do not know how the censor would be obliged to view all videos if we give that official discretion to issue a limited supply certificate.  How does that automatically assume that we are forcing the censor to view all videos?  A censor will be aware of the type of videos that will cause offence.  Surely we are not going to expect a censor to watch a Donald Duck video simply because he may be obliged by law to view every video?  If the censor is aware that the video is about Donald Duck she should not have to view it before issuing a supply certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but I am sure the Deputy understands what I mean.  We should leave this provision as loose as possible so that the censor will have maximum discretion.  The Minister should bear my comments in mind when considering the provision between now and Report Stage.  I wonder how adding a provision that a censor should have power to issue a limited supply certificate in any way implies that the censor will have to watch every video but I may be missing the point.  I think I know the reason the Minister says his proposal will be for guidance purposes which will not impose an onus on those supplying videos to adhere to any strict rules stipulated by the Official Censor.  If one were a retailer in this business and the censor decided on some restriction, then one would have a responsibility just as has a cinema owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage members of the Garda going into every retail video shop searching through the shelves in order <Col N="412" /> to ascertain whether everything is being done in accordance with the law.  It is my opinion that the trade itself will sort this out.  Those who are in the trade in a professional, businesslike fashion are responsible people who are being frustrated daily by the pirates.  Legitimate traders are endeavouring to legitamise the business, as it were, and remove the people who have no regard to any law and who have no intention of paying anything to the State.  If, through the provisions of this Bill we render it more difficult for people to become involved in piracy I believe the trade will respond.  If the Minister wants to give himself power under these provisions to introduce regulations &mdash; if what I am saying does not happen &mdash; he should take that power which will allow him take certain action. If people do not respond in a responsible fashion, unfortunately, the Minister of the day will have to take action.  That is the way to go about it.  The same principle should apply to the issue of licences. Once the Minister has the power he can use it when he sees fit in the future if people are not behaving in a responsible fashion.</P>
    <P>There has been much about section 3 (1) (a) (i), (ii) and (b).  We could debate <i>ad nauseam</i> how this wording will be interpreted.  Deputy Taylor made a point earlier which led me to thinking somewhat more about it, when he said that in a court of law judges do not like having to interpret what the law was intended to mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  So far as I can ascertain, this provision will not be dealt with in a court of law.  It will be the Official Censor who will decide whether to issue a licence.  An applicant who may be refused a certificate will have a right to appeal not to a court but to an appeals board.  So, no matter how one views the matter, it is a question of people using common sense.  I cannot foresee circumstances arising in which this wording would be tested in court.  The provisions of the Bill specify how any certificate is <Col N="413" /> to be issued, that is either by the Official Censor or on appeal to an appeals board. Therefore, I do not think we have to worry about how a court would interpret this wording on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>My concern would be more with the provisions of section 3 (1) (a) (i) which constitute a more factual consideration. The Minister did not answer the question I posed on Second Stage.  Perhaps I am misreading the provision.  Let us suppose one viewed a video of the great train robbery which might indicate or suggest ways of engaging in robbery and &mdash; or of avoiding detection.  I do not think it is the Minister's or anybody else's intention to introduce a provision which would force the Official Censor to refuse a supply certificate.  The provision is much too tight and narrow.  As legislators we should be endeavouring to indicate the will of this House in attempting to deal with what we regard as a serious position in some respects but without tying ourselves up in knots.  We should remember that we are passing a Bill whose provisions will have to be interpreted by the Official Censor or by an appeals board. The Bill will not be taken into the courts unless somebody challenges it which is unlikely.  This provision has to do with retailers or wholesalers seeking a certificate and the mechanism to be used in the supply of that certificate.  Therefore I do not think we have to be as precise since this is not a Bill whose provisions will be interpreted daily in the courts. That is the difference between this Bill and others with which we have dealt in the past or are likely to deal with in the future.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for moving at least in the direction of classification.  I would ask him to bear my comments in mind.  I am not pretending to advance all the answers.  The Minister should allow the Official Censor as much discretion or flexibility as possible.  That was why I suggested providing a limited supply certificate so that he could decide what restrictions he should impose without specifying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's amendment was similar to mine.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="414" /> to accept Deputy De Rossa's amendment which talks about supply because, at the end of the day, that is all we can do. When that video is taken home we cannot control who will see it there.  That is the responsibility of the parents or guardians of the children involved.  We cannot do anything about that but we can tell people in the business that they have a responsibility not to supply that video to somebody under 18 years, or whatever age the censor decides because they have a moral responsibility in society, like everybody else.  Some people will act in good faith and will not allow under-age children to see these films.  As I have said, the trade will sort out this problem, but if the Minister is not satisfied that he can depend on the trade, he should introduce a provision whereby, under regulation, he can impose other restrictions.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's reply earlier, I wish to say a couple of words because there may have been a misunderstanding about what I intended. In regard to my amendment to section 3 (1) (a) (i) the Minister indicated that the intention in the Bill is to allow the censor as much discretion as possible, and I certainly go along with that.  He said that the phrase &ldquo;would be likely to&rdquo; is one that he would like to retain, because it allows the censor some discretion in deciding whether a video work incites or encourages people to commit crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to leaving the words &ldquo;would be likely to&rdquo; within the subsection; the difficulty I see is in the phrase that follows that, which is &ldquo;to cause persons to commit crimes&rdquo;. Deputy Taylor echoed my sentiments when he said the censor can only judge on what is in front of him, that is the video work.  He cannot judge what is in the mind of the viewer.  He cannot judge whether that person will react by committing a crime, or would be likely to do that.  What he can do is to say that a certain video incites or encourages people to commit a crime.  I would have no objection to having inserted &ldquo;would be likely to incite or encourage a person to commit crimes&rdquo; if that would give <Col N="415" /> more discretion to the censor.  The difficulty I see is that the censor is required to exercise some all-seeing powers, some type of crystal ball, that allows him to know what the viewer is thinking.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Colley's intervention.  There appears to be something in the point she is making and we might be able to reach a consensus on it.  I will consider it before Report Stage. I want to say to Deputies Barrett, Taylor and De Rossa that I fully appreciate that in this legislation, which has been before us for a considerable period of time, there is an obvious wish among all of us to try to reach a consensus.  There are not many differences in our views on this matter. These are not matters of priniciple at issue between us.  I would be more than glad to try to meet everybody's wishes if that is possible.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Barrett in particular, with regard to his comments about matters coming up on Report Stage, I very much welcome that contribution. I will certainly give a lot of thought to what he said to see if we can reach consensus on that issue.  The same applies to other Members.  We have spent a lot of time on this matter and we will spend a lot more time to get it right.  If we make mistakes now it could take a long time to put them right.  If particular points of view are put forward in an effort to improve the drafting of the Bill, and if for some reason I cannot take them on board, I will very gladly give my reasons. I am open to be convinced that I should take them on board, and that is as it should be.  I think we will have an interesting discussion on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the point in regard to racial hatred.  The Deputy knows that a Bill to prohibit incitement to hatred on grounds of race, religion or nationality has been completed in the Seanad and is on the Order Paper of the Dáil.  Yesterday I asked the Whip if it could be brought before the House because it is important that we get to grips with it.  There is a genuine wish among all Members of this House to <Col N="416" /> come to grips with this matter that has been on the sidelines for a considerable period of time.  We had a good debate on it in the Seanad &mdash; amendments were put down which were not accepted &mdash; and we can have a debate on it in this House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of that Bill is to put on the Statute Book one of the measures necessary to enable this country to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Under the Bill it will be an offence to distribute, show or play a recording of visual images or sounds that are threatening, abusive, insulting or are intended or are likely to stir up hatred on the grounds specified.  Thus the stirring up of racial, religious or national hatred by means of distribution, showing or playing of videos will be covered by the incitement legislation.  An incitement to hatred on any other ground or against any particular group would be outside the scope of what I am trying to achieve in the incitement Bill.</P>
    <P>I would regard a provision on incitement to hatred on any ground as being unnecessary in the context of this Bill, as well as being outside the scope of the Bill.  As I have said, that legislation will be before the House very soon.  It is for the Whips to reach agreement on it.  The Bill was completed in the Seanad two or three months ago, well before Christmas, and I would welcome an opportunity of bringing it in here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor is not in favour of section 3 (1) (a) (i).  The reality is that when this section was being researched it came to notice that a small number of video films of this nature existed.  They would not have been &ldquo;banable&rdquo;, if I might use such a word, under the traditional criteria and therefore it was necessary to provide for them specifically.</P>

A number of matters have been raised and I will certainly have them fully and properly considered.  Before Report Stage if <Col N="417" /> Members want to talk to me to see if I can accommodate the points of view they have specifc interest in, if I can, I will gladly show them what I propose to bring into the House but if I cannot, they will have the opportunity of putting down amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Again, the Minister has demonstrated his willingness to take on board the case being made in relation to this section.  With regard to section 3 (1) (a) (i), the Minister has said a number of times that films such as &ldquo;How to Steal a Million&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; will not be covered by this section.  Could he indicate what kind of film or video would be covered?  In terms of &ldquo;encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggeting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection&rdquo;, could the Minister give an indication what would be covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo;, it is a long time since I saw that film but I do not think the punchline would encourage anyone to commit crime.  I think everyone got punished, up-ended, somewhere along the line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps before the Deputy reads subsection (1) (a) of that section he would read the first part, subsection (1).  The last two lines of the subsection states that the censor &ldquo;declaring the work to be fit for viewing unless he is <Col N="418" /> of opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because...&rdquo; We are giving the censor discretion, that flexibility we all wish him to have.  If he is not given this flexibility, he will not be able to do his job properly, and that would not meet the views expressed by Members here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to provide him with greater freedom to make that judgment and to come to a decision.  By including the statement in the section that the censor must take into account the question of whether the film suggests ways of committing crime or of avoiding detection having committed a crime, we are putting that as an obligation on the censor to consider when he is making up his mind as to whether a video is suitable for viewing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to be helpful to Deputy De Rossa the censor is aware of the particular wording and is satisfied that it is a system that can operate successfully. He knows he has that room to manoeuvre and he has flexibility to move. I take on board what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking on board the Minister's commitment to review the wording of this section perhaps he would take into account the concerns I have expressed regarding the last two lines which to my mind would unnecessarily restrict the censor in deciding what he should do in relation to a video.  While I accept the bona fides of what the Minister says and what he has been told by the current censor it is a question of us providing a framework for any censor and not just the person who happens to occupy the position at present.  We must ensure that the framework we provide will be interpreted reasonably consistently by whoever may occupy that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the incitement to hatred section I have not been following the debate in the Seanad on the incitement to hatred Bill but I <Col N="419" /> know it does not include reference to the question of incitement to hatred based on a person's gender or sexual orientation.  I have made the point here before that in this day and age we are all conscious of the need to ensure that every citizen is treated equally and that their sexual orientation or their gender is not used against them and that material is not produced which would incite hatred against them.  We are all aware that situations can be created where hatred can be aroused. We had an unfortunate murder in a park in Dublin some years ago, the blame for which can be reasonably laid at the door of the hatred of a young man because of his sexual orientation.  It is important that we try to cover this aspect of ruling out that kind of incitement or the possibility of incitement on those grounds.</P>
      <P>The incitement to hatred Bill does not cover that area and this Bill initially intended to cover the question of race, nationality and religion but that has been deleted.  It must be covered at some point.  If the Minister can give me an undertaking that he will consider including what I am talking about in the incitement to hatred Bill, that would satisfy me for the moment.  I do not know what position the Minister took on it in the Seanad but I would certainly be keen to have some commitment on the matter.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not making the point clearly.  There is a need to cover the question of incitement to hatred in our legal code.  This Bill is before us in relation to the restriction on video recordings which would incite to crime of various kinds.  I am proposing that included in this Bill there be a section which would enable the censor to refuse a certificate for videos which incited to hatred on the basis of race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation or gender. The Minister had responded by saying that this is covered in the incitement to hatred Bill which has yet to come before the House.  Part of what I am proposing is not included in the incitement to hatred Bill.  If the Minister could indicate that he is prepared to take on board my concerns about extending the incitement to hatred Bill to cover the areas mentioned here, I would be favourably disposed to letting the matter go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was about to proceed on another point in relation to amendment No. 8. There are two distinctions to be made. The Bill before us deals with the question of providing certificates for the distribution of videos.  The incitement to hatred Bill, as I understand it, deals with the question of a person inciting to hatred in a public place or knowingly having recordings or documents which might incite to hatred.  While obviously we would expect the censor would have the good sense not to allow videos which would be overtly providing incitement to hatred there may be a grey area regarding this matter and he may feel that a video should go through on the basis that the other Bill &mdash; the incitement to hatred Bill &mdash; would catch whatever might get through his screening process.  While the Minister says he does not see a need for it here I wonder whether that is so.  It may be that we could have a situation <Col N="421" /> where, in order to stop videos being provided for distribution which encourage incitement to hatred on various grounds, private citizens would have to take prosecutions on individual videos.  I do not think that would necessarily be the way to go when we are trying to deal with video nasties in a general way in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a fair amount of comment about the question of the censor and the extent of his discretion. Many of the Deputies who contributed have put it on the basis that we ought to allow the censor as much discretion as possible, that his authority should be flexible and that he should have a wide range of discretion in examining these videos.  It is very easy to get carried away with that.  It is a nice sounding expression that the censor should have the maximum possible discretion.  If you want him to have the maximum possible discretion one could leave it in his hands completely and let him ban what he wants.  We should be careful about this.  Quite frankly my own view would be the reverse, he should have the minimum discretion necessary and not the maximum.  The decision on what videos are allowed and what are not allowed essentially is one for us here in this House to decide and not for the censor to decide.  We have to set down the guidelines on what we want him to do.  Obviously he will be left with a certain measure of discretion but it should be the minimum necessary, not the maximum. We ought, so far as possible, to devise the criteria he is bound by.  When he looks at the video and the guidelines we have given him the extent of his discretion is to see whether that video comes within those guidelines.  One should be careful then, about throwing out phrases such as &ldquo;He should have the maximum possible discretion&rdquo;.  The decision on the matter should be made by us, not by the censor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to the point made by Deputy Barrett.  We are not talking about decisions on these videos being made in a court.  That is true but there are many important decisions made that are not made in courts but which nonetheless are judicial decisions.  That is to say they are <Col N="422" /> decisions that have to be made in accordance with the laws we lay down.  The decisions that would be made by the censor come within that category.  They would be judicial decisions because the censor is obliged to look at the law that we will have laid down for him and the various categories under which he will be authorised to ban or not to ban.  He will have to base his decision on that and not on a biased point of view or on account of any personal whim that he might have in one direction or another.  His will be a judicial decision as though he was a judge, just as so many other decisions that are made by people who are not judges are.  That is what I meant when I said in my previous contribution that we ought not leave the censor in the position of having to try to interpret what is in the minds of other people or how other people would tend to react to a video that they would see.</P>
    <P>I know that we are talking about consensus and consensus is always desirable. However, there is a basic distinction in the approach and that is whether one should, as my colleague Deputy Higgins outlined on the last day when I could not be here, take a minimalist approach or not.  In other words when one goes to ban the items should one cast the net widely or narrowly?  I took the view and so did he that the net should be cast as narrowly as necessary.  The net should be cast as narrowly as possible and we should not catch a wide range of things which on careful examination we might not want at all.  We have taken a first tentative step in that direction and I am not happy about the way we are handling the crime aspect which has entered the debate for the first time when it appeared in the Bill. It was never there before at all and I do not know why or from what source it emanated.  Deputy De Rossa raised a number of tentative questions on this issue and got very tentative replies which did not satisfy me and I doubt that they satisfied him.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which dealt with the issue of video nasties <Col N="423" /> during the last Dáil.  A great deal of evidence was taken, the matter was gone into in great details and representatives of all interested parties were heard at great length but the crime category of video was not considered at all.  However they dealt with the other two categories and I quote from section 8.8 headed &ldquo;Video Nasties&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Videos which display unrestrained violence and/or sexual abuse must be banned.  Most of these videos are not classified on the international coding system.</P>
    <P>There is not a word in the report about the crime category, perhaps there is something that we do not know anything about or that has come up since the committee issued their report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is it.  There is some vagary there and it seems very difficult to get anything specific on it.  In the absence of anything more specific, I will not agree to the crime category being allowed to creep into the Bill.  Unless the Minister can tell us that he is going to look at the possible exclusion of that classification, I think the sooner we have a decision here on Committee Stage the better.  I am not satisfied either from what I have heard as a member of that committee or since that this category should be included at all.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, I am also unhappy about the way in which the draftsman decided to come down on this category in this particular subsection. While I sympathise with his difficulties, and I cannot say that I regard my alternative as perfect, I would have to say that my own amendment is certainly marginally better in giving a more balanced approach to what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had meant to say something in my first contribution about the Minister's classification arrangement and in so far as it goes, it is to be welcomed.  I had hoped that we would have gone further because we are left with a somewhat <Col N="424" /> anomalous situation so far as limited viewing is concerned.  As we discussed on a previous section I do not intend to go into it again.  However the anomaly still remains notwithstanding the Minister's concession on classification, helpful though it is.  It will be some help on an unofficial basis but I would have preferred, and I think Deputy Barrett would also, that it would have been more formalised and that the categories should be brought forward into the video section as it is in the cinema section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to Deputy Taylor's last point.  During the course of our research work in the preparation of the Bill we came across videos which were being made to show people how to commit crime, for example, how to steal cars without the keys, how to inject oneself with drugs, and under the legislation as it stands we were not in a position to deal with these video films.  Most people would be of the view that this type of video should not be allowed and we are trying to deal with videos that would be educating people to commit crime.  God knows we have enough trouble as it is.</P>

There is something in all of our natures that automatically brings a natural resentment when told you are not to do this or that.  I react in the same way as anybody else but we are trying to deal with the situation as I have described it. I will mention a point raised by Deputy De Rossa.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred <Col N="425" /> Bill is before the House at present and I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill more than cover what the Deputy has suggested.  I will doubly ensure that I am perfectly right on that before we talk about it again on Report Stage.  I am very conscious of the debate on this Bill, and as the Deputy may know I was involved with it in Seanad Éireann.  I think it is quite a good Bill but we will have to wait until we get a discussion on it here.  I am satisfied that the matters the Deputy referred to are covered in the Bill as it stands.  That concludes my remarks.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 3 (2), why is the censor obliged to automatically grant a supply certificate if a certificate has been granted under the Censorship of Films Acts?  If there is a limited supply certificate for a film, why is he obliged to issue a supply certificate for the video?  I know we will overcome that difficulty to some extent if we get around to classification, but that will not altogether solve the problem because the Minister's present proposals are purely for guidance purposes.  Surely the censor should not be obliged but should have a discretion as to whether to grant a certificate.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that he must automatically grant a certificate, in other words, give a supply certificate with no restrictions to a video when he has already given a certificate with restrictions to the film.  The censor can order that nobody under the age of 18 is entitled to see a certain film yet he has to automatically give a certificate with no restrictions to the video of the same film, so that, for instance, a 12 year old can go out and buy it.  It is a bit ridiculous and it does not make sense.  Why has the Minister decided to include that provision?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A supply certificate shall be deemed to have been granted to the person making the application 90 days after making the application, unless a prohibition order has been made by the Film Censor in respect of the video work which is the subject of the application.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that there will not be a hold up by the film censor in the granting of certificates. It simply puts into the Bill some time limit by which the film censor should have made a decision, and if he has not made a decision, then one can assume that the video was not one that demanded his priority attention and therefore is deemed to have been granted a supply certificate.  I admit that I have more or less taken 90 days out of the air.  I am not involved in the business of film censorship and I do not know what length of time would be the norm.  I am open to correction on that.</P>
      <P>However, if I am a supplier of videos or a wholesaler of videos and I have certain contractual obligations to supply other people, it is reasonable that some sort of time limit should apply to the granting of a supply certificate and if that time limit is not met, the supply certificate should be deemed to have been granted and I may then apply for a label.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment I suggest that this new subsection (3) should go between lines 17 and 18 but in fact it would be better placed between lines 25 and 26 <Col N="428" /> because at that stage a prohibition order has been mentioned in the Bill.  A supply certificate should be deemed to have been granted if after 90 days no actual certificate has emerged from the film censor's office, unless a prohibition order has been granted.  It is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising that point.  The amendment relates to practical arrangements that have to be made between the film censor and those who will be submitting video work to him for a supply certificate.  The point dealt with in this amendment was discussed by representatives of the Irish Videogram Association, the film censor and officers in the Department of Justice. There was agreement on all sides that the system would have to be such as to allow for decisions in relation to supply certificates being made in advance of the dates on which any particular work was to be in place in shops for sale or rent to the public.</P>
      <P>There will be an onus on the trade and on the censor.  The trade will have to supply a copy of the work to the censor in reasonable time in advance of the projected date for the sale of the film, and the film censor will have to deal with the work within a reasonable period and he will have to have sufficient staff and equipment to do so.  There was general agreement on this point and no difficulty was foreseen.  I am satisfied that is the type of detail that should be left for discussion and agreement between the trade and the censor and that it is not necessary to put it into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Colley's amendment.  It is a perfectly reasonable amendment and is particularly appropriate. The amendment is to meet the case where some videos might be submitted and left sitting there without a decision being given.  It is the sort of thing that happens.  Under planning law when a planning application is made the planning permission has to be either granted or refused within two months, which is only 60 days, or else it is deemed to have been <Col N="429" /> granted.  The reason for that was because there used to be long delays.</P>
      <P>Let there be discussions between the trade and the censor, by all means, but it is still reasonable to say here that at a certain point a decision has to be given and if a decision has not been given a supply certificate is deemed to have been granted, just as it would in planning law. If it is appropriate to provide that kind of resolution of delays in the planning code, it is certainly appropriate to deal with this here.  Indeed, if I had any fault with Deputy Colley's amendment it would be that the period of 90 days is altogether too long.</P>

      <P>I am not too happy about the way the amendment is framed because it provides that a certificate shall be deemed to have been granted to the person making the application if there is an undue delay.  I would much rather if the censor was obliged to give a certificate after a fixed period of time rather than give a distributor an automatic right to distribute a video even if he does not have a certificate which says &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo;. It would make a nonsense of the Bill and the debate on it over a number of weeks if, because of a bureaucratic tangle, any video could be distributed simply because there was a backlog of work in the office of the censor.  There should be some way of ensuring that a certificate has to be given which says either &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo;.  One should not automatically get a certificate to distribute and a decision should be given within a certain period so that the Bill will apply to the video and will not be swept aside because of a bureaucratic tangle.</P>

      <P>I want to reply to a point raised by Deputy De Rossa.  My intention was that if the given period had elapsed and no decision had been made by the film censor, at that stage effectively a certificate would be given because it would be deemed to have been given. That would enable the applicant to obtain a label, in other words, this would bypass the physical certifying of a video by the censor.  I envisage that this would happen <Col N="430" /> only in cases where the censor would not be required to actually view a video.  A number of queries have been raised both on Second Stage and Committee Stage about whether the film censor will have to view every single video which is presented to him.  The Minister stated on a couple of occasions that it will not be necessary for the censor to look at every video: he will be able to judge from the descriptions of some of them and his own knowledge of some of them that it is not necessary to look at a film.  It could be that a bureaucratic logjam could build up because of that and distributors would not receive certificates within the right amount of time.  Given the 90 days I am suggesting, I think it is reasonable to put in a safeguard, in other words a safety net, so that people are not left, because of a bureaucratic hiccup, without a method of obtaining labels and distributing videos.</P>

      <P>I understand the logic of the case put forward by Deputy Colley and I could see some way of being more favourably disposed to the amendment if it were not for what we propose to do on the question of clarification on Report Stage.  There is a general understanding that if a classification system is in operation it will be a slower system to operate. On the other hand, we had discussions, even before classification became a real live runner, with the censor and the Videogram Association and there was no worry in anybody's mind about any delays that might take place.  I should like an opportunity of looking at this question and to consult with the censor, bearing in mind what we are going to do about classification.  I share the view expressed by Deputy De Rossa that there could, for some reason or other, be a delay perhaps in relation to titles submitted for classification because inquiries might have to be conducted or responses made to inquiries might might slow things up.  I am thinking of what happens in regard to applications for planning permission to local authorities.  The statutory period within which the local authority must make a decision only commences when <Col N="431" /> all the documentation required to back up the application is with the local authority. I would hate to think that for some reason or other which we may not identify this afternoon we would put a difficulty in the way of the censor and prevent him from doing what we want him to do.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Colley agrees, I would like to consult with the censor, bearing in mind the fact that on Report Stage we will introduce a classification system, to see what problems might emerge with which he will want some freedom.  I understand and share the Deputy's view that at all times bureaucracy can be very difficult to understand when there are long delays.  I get upset, as anybody would, if things, even in my own Department, are not moving as fast as I want them to move.  It is hard to understand why things are not moving but, of course, this is not the case with regard to this section, although we are not going very fast right now.</P>

      <P>There is no clause in the Bill which says that if there is a breach of copyright this entitles the censor to refuse a supply certificate.  He does not pronounce any comment on the copyright issue.  A point was made about whether it would be necessary for the censor to view every video in respect of which he will grant or refuse a supply certificate. The suggestion was made that perhaps it was not necessary.  I think this point is very important and should be clarified. From my reading of the Bill, it seems to be quite clear that the censor will be obligated to see every video on which he has to make a decision.  Otherwise how can he form an opinion on the work and decide whether it comes within the various categories?  How can he form an opinion if he does not see the work? Therefore, I believe he must see the work.  If the censor gave a decision on <Col N="433" /> any video and said he had formed an opinion on it without having seen it I think such a decision would be reviewable by the courts and his decision would be quashed.  Otherwise, he would have to rely on hearsay, what somebody told him, the title or some written blurb about it.  I do not think he could properly form an opinion and, therefore, the question is referable to Deputy Colley's amendment. It would mean that a large supply of these videos could build up and the censor might need some assistance or a colleague might have to be given authority to deal with them as well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be an offence for a person to apply for a supply certificate or a limited supply certificate unless such person has been authorised to apply by the owner of the copyright in the said video work.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Here we are dealing with the manner in which a manufacturer of video material might present his case or his video to the Official Censor.  The Bill as envisaged by the Minister needs a little tightening up in this regard.  Who has title to that material?  As Deputy Taylor stated earlier, we may be infringing copyright legislation, which is perhaps another day's work.  By inserting amendment No. 20, an onus is put on the censor to see that the applicant has title to the video material, rather like a driving licence tester under the Department of the Environment regulations checking whether an applicant for the test has motor insurance and road tax for the vehicle.  If the censor satisfies himself that the video material has not been pirated or published contrary to statute, contrary to copyright legislation, we could go somewhat down the road of outlawing the video piracy which is widespread at the moment.  On Second Stage the Minister stated that he had taken up this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I hope some progress has been made in this regard.  The legislation before us will be seriously flawed unless the necessary copyright legislation is enacted without delay.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the question of who can apply.  Under the present section anybody, provided he has been supplied with video material, can now apply to the censor for a supply certificate. Amendment No. 20 tightens that up somewhat in so far as it requires the person making the application to show that he is not in breach of copyright and that he has authority to submit his application. We are not going outside the realm of the censor's duties.  In many ways we could counteract much of the present piracy by the applicant showing that he has title, is not in breach of copyright and has authority to apply.  If passed unamended, the section could mean that anybody, however unqualified, could apply to the censor for a certificate and the censor under the present legislation could not refuse to grant a certificate for any copyright reasons.  The amendment has some merit in that regard alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the case he has made for the amendment. I can understand what he is trying to achieve.  However, what the Deputy is concerned about is already provided for. It is unnecessary to create an offence of applying for a supply certificate for a video work of which somebody else owns the copyright.  If the Official Censor learned that the applicant was acting in breach of somebody else's copyright, he could simply refuse to consider the application, just as if he learned that the applicant was acting otherwise without authority or that the video recording contained in the work had been stolen.  This is on the general principle that a statute must not be made the instrument of fraud.</P>
      <P>A similar situation might arise over a cinema film.  In either case the applicant would scarcely venture to challenge the censor's refusal by proceeding to the High Court unless there was a genuine issue over the ownership of the copyright. The owner of the copyright might seek an injunction to prevent the censor from considering the application.  I know that the trade are very watchful in this area. Members of the House will recall that only recently there was very large advertisements inserted in the newspapers by the trade, advising that a particular video available in Australia labelled &ldquo;Frantic&rdquo; had been hijacked.  The trade was alerting all of us to the fact that this was so.  I have no doubt that the censor, if he was involved in the matter, would immediately be contacted by the trade and made aware of the facts.  He would therefore be entitled to deal with it as I have already described.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with everything the Deputy has said, but we have adequate cover to deal with the situation he mentions. What is in the amendment is provided for.</P>

      <P>The trade are already extremely watchful in these matters. They would advise the censor that there was piracy or hijacking involved with regard to the particular film.  The censor could deal with the matter accordingly.  I have impressed on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the need to expedite the copyright legislation.  Members will know from the last occasion that Minister Brennan, who has responsibility here, is well aware of the views of the House and he is being constantly reminded by me that there is a great demand for this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be adequate. but people do get injunctions.  There have been reports about it in the newspapers. The breach of copyright is going on on a large scale, for obvious reasons.  The position, as I understand it, is that an unauthorised copy of the average video costs about £80.  The owner of a small video shop told me that every week a van <Col N="437" /> comes down from the North of Ireland with the identical videos which cost about £20.  Consequently the pressure is on owners of small video shops as opposed to multiples and it is very great.  Many say that they would go out of business if they had to pay the £80 but that is another day's work.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's response to amendment No. 20, although for different reasons.  The Minister makes the point that if the censor knew there was a breach of copyright he would not deal with the application because to do so would mean that this Act would be used as an instrument of fraud.  I do not think that is quite right.  Breach of copyright is not fraud.  It is quite different.  If this Bill is passed in its present form the censor will be bound by what it contains and he will not be entitled to go into the question of copyright.  It is not a relevant factor. He is given his instructions in section 3. He is to see the video and decide whether it would cause a person to commit crime and so on.  He makes his decision on that basis.  It is appropriate to deal with copyright in separate legislation, not in this Bill.  I support the Minister in his response, for that different reason.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 requires that video recordings containing certificated video works should have affixed to them a label in the prescribed form to be obtained from the Official Censor.  The amendment provides that labels should be obtainable only by holders of wholesale or retail licences under the Bill.  Under the existing wording of subsection (1) (a) anybody would be entitled to get labels from the Official Censor and this would leave scope for people who are not licensed to sell video recordings or let them on hire to get labels and put them on pirate copies or on recordings of video works for which certificates have not been obtained.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to the amendment in that it tightens up on piracy.  Labelling is one of the areas where we can do something without actually affecting those legitimately trading in the video business.  It will, however, affect those who are pirating.  The provision in relation to a licence is not very restrictive.  It is wrong to allow the official stamp of approval to be used willy nilly. There should be tight control of these labels.  If a person purchases labels it does not necessarily follow that those labels will be affixed to the videos for which they are intended.  There should be strict control on those who are entitled to purchase these labels.  It is the responsibility of the distributor or his agent to affix the labels required in this legislation.  It would be wrong to allow a situation where all a person had to do was to pay the fee, get a bundle of labels, take them away and affix them to the videos.  Presumably if a distributor &mdash; or the manufacturer, as he is called &mdash; makes a video he will have to submit it to the censor in accordance with the Bill for a supply certificate to be issued.  That manufacturer or distributor will go through the process of getting approval from the censor by way of a supply certificate or a limited supply certificate, depending on how we thrash out Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the approval of the censor is gained the distributor should affix the label to the video approved.  The distributor, having got the supply certificate, should not be able to send out the videos to the various agents around the country who will purchase a bundle of labels and affix them to the videos in their own premises.  Strict control will have to be exercised or there will be chaos.  I could go in and say I wanted a certain number of labels, pay my fee, walk out of the premises and affix them to a different video which could have been pirated. Legislation which permits that practice should not be passed.  The distributor submits the video to the censor, he will get the supply certificate if the video is <Col N="441" /> approved and at that point he should affix the label required under this section.  He will then distribute them to the wholesalers and retailers who will hire and sell them to individuals.</P>
    <P>I am aware &mdash; and I am sure the Minister's officials are aware &mdash; that the Irish Videogram Association have been in consultation with the Department of Justice in relation to this matter.  My understanding is that the fear is there could be a monopoly, although I do not see that. It could be argued that it will deprive somebody from going to Britain and purchasing a number of videos at a lesser cost and bringing them back here.  However, they would not be able to get the labels if my amendment was accepted.  However, there is a way around that.</P>
    <P>If I go to Britain or Northern Ireland and purchase a number of videos that have been approved by the censor here I can then go to the approved agent who will be obliged to sell me the labels that have already been supplied to the company in question.  For argument's sake say that company X manufacturers a video and submits it to the censor who gives him a certificate.  They must then purchase the labels and affix them to the videos to be distributed.  Company X will presumably also be selling that video in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The argument is that I as a retailer could go to Northern Ireland and purchase the same video, perhaps at 10 per cent less than I could buy it from the representative of company X.  The argument is that I would be deprived of purchasing them in Northern Ireland at 10 per cent less if I cannot get the labels.  The way around that is that the representative of company X here would be obliged to supply me with the labels even if I purchased the videos outside the country.  It is a little bit complicated but I hope I am getting my message across.  The basic point is that there must be strict control over labels.</P>
    <P>I understrand that the pirate trade in videos is somewhere in the region of £15 million per annum and the Exchequer is losing £3 million or £4 million in VAT and PRSI.  We should use every possible means and legislation to force those <Col N="442" /> people out of business.  We cannot allow them to get away with this and at the same time put ordinary, legitimate people out of business because they are selling videos.  The pirates are selling videos at a much lower cost and are not subject to the strict control which applies to legitimate traders.  I appreciate that my ramblings may not have been clear but I am asking the Minister, between now and Report Stage, to consider this point.  If necessary I would table an amendment but I would prefer to get together to put a stop to this.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 46 in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 48, 49, 50 and 51 are <Col N="443" /> consequential and it is proposed, therefore, to discuss them together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), line 40, after &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to let them on hire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 17 provides for a grant of licences by the official censor.  Under the section in its present form a wholesale licence would authorise the holder to sell video recordings by wholesale.  A retail licence would authorise him to sell the recordings by retail or to let them on hire.  Amendment No. 46 provides that a wholesale licence will authorise the holder to sell video recordings by wholesale or, like a retail licence, to let them on hire. Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 are consequential.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 50 is also consequential on the amendment to section 17 (1).  Under the Bill at present section 18 (1) (2) provides separately for prohibiting sales, etc. otherwise than in accordance with wholesale licences and sales otherwise than in accordance with retail licences.  Now, as a result of amendment No. 46 to section 17 (1), a wholesale licence will authorise letting or hiring. There is no need for separate prohibitions in subsections (1) and (2) of section 18; amendment No. 50 makes the necessary provision in one subsection covering both kinds of licence.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendments is that wholesalers do let video recordings on hire.  Accordingly, the existing wording of the section is too restrictive as under it the holder of a wholesale licence is confined to selling video recordings.  The amendment would enable them to let recordings on hire and is in keeping with existing trading practices in the video business.  Amendment No. 51 is consequential.</P>

      <P>I mentioned earlier that the Minister should include provisions in the Bill which would enable <Col N="444" /> him to make various changes by way of regulation if it became necessary to do so.  This is one area where it would be advisable for the Minister to include such a provision.  Subsection 6 states:</P>
      <P>a person who applies to the Official Censor for a licence shall furnish to the Official Censor such information as he may reasonably require for the purpose of the performance of his functions.....</P>
      <P>What I am afraid of is that a person would be able to walk in and obtain a licence, which amounts to an official Government stamp, to commence trading in this business, yet this person could be up to his tonsils in piracy.  This section does not lay down any standards.  A person would have to get a licence for all intents and purposes but if we find that this legislation is not working effectively it would be a good idea if the Minister had the power to amend the conditions under which a person may obtain a licence, be it a wholesale or retail licence, by way of regulation.  That is all I am asking the Minister to do.  This would be a safeguard. I know the Minister does not want to get involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 19, lines 15 to 23, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  If&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person is convicted of an offence under section 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19 or 20 of this Act, an offence referred to in section 15 (2) of this Act committed after the commencement of this section or an offence under the laws relating to copyright committed in relation to a video recording after such commencement,</P>
      <P>(b)  he has previously been convicted of any of those offences, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the offence or offences referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection of which he has previously been convicted was or were committed at any time not earlier than 5 years before the commission of the offence referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection,</P>
      <P>the court shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the person is the holder of a licence for the time being in force in relation to premises where any of the offences aforesaid was committed, order that the licence or licences be forfeited, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  order that the person be disqualified for a period of 5 years from the date on which the order takes effect for holding a licence in relation to any premises where any of the offences referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection was committed or any premises in relation to which he is not the holder of a licence on that date.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the new subsection (1) of section 23 which this amendment proposes is to relax the strictness of the subsection in its present form as regards disqualification from holding a licence to sell or let video recordings.  The present <Col N="448" /> subsection provides that if the holder of a wholesale or retail licence is convicted of any of a number of offences, such as selling a video recording containing an uncertified video work, and has previously been convicted of any other such offence, committed not earlier than five years before the commission of the first mentioned offence, the court shall order that his licence be forfeited and he be disqualified for five years from holding a licence.</P>
    <P>One effect of this would be that if the owner of several shops was convicted of selling a recording of an uncertified video work in one of his shops and had a relevant previous conviction he would be disqualified for five years from holding a licence to sell at any of his shops.  I think this would be too severe and the amendment proposes therefore that the offender should be disqualified from holding a licence only in relation to the premises where the offences were committed or in any other premises for which he had no licence at the time the order of disqualification took effect.  Therefore, he would still keep his licence in respect of the shops other than those where any of the relevant offences were committed within the five years but he would not be able to get a new licence for any other shop until five years from the date the disqualification order takes effect.</P>
    <P>The amendment also makes two smaller changes as compared with the section in its present form.  First, it adds to the offences giving rise to disqualification. The offence referred to in section 15 (2) is importing a video recording of a prohibited video work.  This is also an offence which can give rise under section 27 to forfeiture of an illegal imported video recording.  Secondly, the amendment provides that offences, such as illegal importation of breach of copyright, which could give rise to disqualification from holding a licence, would be limited to offences committed under section 23.</P>

      <P>Apart from a small verbal change at the beginning of the subsection the only change is to remove the requirement in the subsection in its present form that before the court may order the forfeiture of a video recording the recording must be produced before the court.  The reason for the amendment is that there may be a large stock of video recordings involved in the offence and it would be an unnecessary inconvenience to require their production in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would still be necessary for the court to be satisfied that the video recordings are the ones to which the offence relates and if the court is in any doubt on the matter it could still require the recordings to be produced.

      <P>Section 30 commences by stating a strange thing.  It states that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of enabling this Act to have full effect.  I do not know what is envisaged by this.  Whatever is envisaged it should not be there.  It is altogether too wide, though I have not the slightest objection to the following part remaining which provides the Minister may make regulations dealing with the categories mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and so on.  That is perfectly in order, but a wide ranging, sweeping statement that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of enabling this Act to have full effect, is an easy way out for the draftsman. If they want to give the Minister power to make regulations they will have to specify exactly what he is supposed to be making regulations for.  It is a very dangerous precedent to give any Minister of whatever political party sweeping powers of that nature.  When the Minister is making regulations he is making law, and we in this House ought to be able to look at that and see what power we are delegating.  That is normal procedure. This is altogether too wide and it is very dangerous to give him a power of that nature.  I do not know whether he wants that kind of power but whether he does or not the House should not give it to him.  I am objecting to this section.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy De Rossa.  I reiterate what Deputy Taylor said.  In fact, I referred to this a couple of minutes ago.  The notion of giving any Minister the right to amend legislation effectively by regulation when it is not specified in the Bill is totally against the way we should be operating in this House, and I will not support it.  Subsection (2) continues this approach to the legislation when it provides: &ldquo;Regulations under this Act may make different provisions for different kinds of video works and licences&rdquo;&mdash; I agree with that <Col N="452" />&mdash;&ldquo;and for different circumstances&rdquo;.

      <P>This is a common formula in legislation.  Of course, any regulations made under it would be subject to a negative resolution of the House, if that was the decision of the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The main reason for this section is that the operations involved here will have to be phased in.  It will not come in altogether, and different dates will have to be made for the different phases.  Different sections will come in at different times.  For instance, the censor will have to look at video nasties already on the market, and they will have to be banned.  Then he will have to set a date for new films coming in from the UK or wherever, he will have to deal with a backlog and there will be a date for licences to trade.  That is all that is involved here.  I assure the House I want no statutory authority in any shape or form to do anything other than to ensure that the different sections of this Bill can be phased in when it is appropriate to do so and the film censor is ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured this is a common formula.  In other Acts where this formula is used, the House has the <Col N="453" /> ultimate way of dealing with it in that it can, if it so requires, negative any regulations made by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand what the Minister is saying.  He needs certain powers to introduce the Bill, or Act as it will then be, in different phases.  Deputy Taylor has a point when he said section 34 could enable the Minister to do that. Notwithstanding that, there are three separate areas which have been singled out for the making of regulations, and if we restrict the making of regulations to those areas, that will be perfectly acceptable.</P>
      <P>Regarding the last few words in subsection (2), &ldquo;and for different circumstances&rdquo;, the Minister has not addressed himself to that.  I assume what is meant there is that as the technology changes different types of video works are made available, and one would have to change the definitions constantly to allow for that if regulations could not do so.  I presume that is what is intended there.  If it is not, the Minister might address himself to that.  The phrase does not seem to have any meaning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly in order for any Minister to come into the House and say he seeks power to make laws by regulation to cover certain matters.  The House may look at them and consider it appropriate for that matter to be dealt with by ministerial regulation rather than by an amending Act, but at least the House must see what the Minister is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) set out categories of items.  That is fair enough, that is in order, that is acceptable.  The first part of subsection (2) &ldquo;Regulations under this Act may make different provisions for different kinds of video works and licences&rdquo; is also acceptable, but this is what I might call crude, attempted catch-all drafting just in case the Minister takes power to make regulations for the purpose of enabling this legislation to have full effect, might not even be constitutional. I have doubts whether that kind of wide ranging provision is constitutional. It is not acceptable.  It is too wide.  If the Minister wants to have power to make regulations on any aspect of this Bill, fair enough, spell them out, specify them category by category as he has done in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), but for goodness sake do not come in and attempt this catch-all lazy drafting which should not be acceptable to a democratic assembly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the next section so I will refer to it as the negative resolution procedure, for want of a better word.  Is the Minister suggesting to the House that it is effective or reasonable for an Opposition party to usefully avail of its powers?  I am sure he knows and has said &mdash; many of his colleagues did when they were in Opposition &mdash; it is absolutely useless and of no value to some Opposition parties.  It might be all right for Fine Gael who have plenty of Private Members' Time because a motion to annul can be taken only in Private Members' Time.  When do we have Private Members' Time?  How long do the Progressive Democrats or the Labour Party have to wait to get their share of Private Members' Time?  Considerably more than the 21 working days that are allowed in the negative resolution.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate Workers' Party are even worse off because they have no Private Members' Time at all.  So, if they were minded to move an annulling resolution they would be unable to do so. Therefore, if there is to be a provision dealing with the annulling of regulations it ought to be a positive resolution &mdash; to provide that the regulations do not come <Col N="455" /> into force unless the Dáil passes a resolution approving of them.  That would be a much better procedure.  It would be a better form of draft.  I intend raising this issue on every occasion a Bill contains this miserable negative resolution procedure. Unless the Minister tells the House that he will give serious consideration to deleting that objectionable aspect of that section I will have to call a vote on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with the points made by Deputy Taylor in regard to the negative motion procedure for the changing of regulations. I am on record as having raised this matter on almost every Bill that I dealt with in the House.  It is not that I believe that it should be necessary to have positive motions for all regulations that come before the House because clearly the House would not have time to deal with them in that way but serious consideration should be given to the way negative motions are dealt with.  I have checked the Dáil records to see when a motion implementing regulations was challenged and my understanding is that such a motion was challenged only once in the last 20 years.  That was because primarily a negative resolution can only be taken in Government time with the permission of the Government and Governments have consistently refused to do that except on the occasion I mentioned which was in the late sixties or early seventies.  Another way of taking <Col N="456" /> such motions is in Private Members' Time but even parties like Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, when in Opposition, who have a fair slice of Private Members' Time, are reluctant to forego that time to deal with regulations which I and other Opposition parties argue, should be dealt with in Government time.  This should be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is something the Minister cannot easily resolve.  I am not arguing for positive motions for regulations in every Bill because that would not be practical.  I am prepared to wait until Report Stage to see how the Minister proposes to deal with regulations under the Bill.  Something substantial has to be done with regard to the way regulations are dealt with.  I should like to give one example of what I am talking about.  The House has been agreeing regulations under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act since 1976 and not once since then has there been a debate on those regulations despite the fact that there is considerable concern outside the House as to how they operate.  Members will be aware of my views in relation to the people covered by those regulations but, at the same time, there is a civil rights argument to be considered in regard to them.  The regulations have not been debated in the House for more than 13 years.  There is an argument for looking at how the procedures of the House permit Members, whether they are Independents, Members of small parties or of large groups, to challenge regulations made by way of negative motions.  I should like to ask the Minister to make a mental note of that case.  We should not have to constantly plead for access to challenging regulations.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  &mdash;(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, a building control authority may, if it considers it reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, grant a dispensation from, or a relaxation of, any requirement of building regulations in respect of buildings or works which are situated within the functional area of the building control authority and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  which are designed, constructed or carried out by or on behalf of the building control authority, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful on this section if I made a brief comment on what we had discussed on the last occasion.  When the Bill was last considered in Committee Deputies Keating and Quinn expressed concern about the provisions of section 4 (4) to the effect that the Minister could, by regulation, prescribe the period of time within which building control authorities would be required to give a decision on applications for relaxation of and dispensations from building regulations. It was suggested that there should be a two months time limit, as there is in the case of decisions on applications for planning permission.</P>
      <P>I have considered the arguments advanced and I am disposed to concede the point.  I give notice that I intend to bring forward amendments on Report Stage to insert the necessary provision in this section and in section 6 where it arises also.  Therefore, wherever it arises, I will concede the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that I shall also bring forward amendments on Report Stage to provide for separate definitions of the terms &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; instead of the composite definition at present contained in section 1, which was also a matter of some concern to us on the last occasion. <Col N="461" /> The House will recall that Deputies Quinn and Keating both addressed that point as well.  I am pleased to say that I can propose a suitable amendment on that matter also on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's constructive response.  I seek clarification on points which will probably become clearer when we see the text prepared for Report Stage.  Do I take it that the procedure of permission by default, which prevails in respect of planning permissions, in principle will apply to applications under the building regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to seek clarification. I merely want to have this point noted so that we can revert to it on Report Stage. It appears to me from representations I have received from a number of people, that in areas of urban development there are old buildings in areas designated for conservation requiring modification, which modification, if effected strictly in accordance with building regulations, would destroy their inherent value.  In other words modern-day standards applied to old buildings to render them safe or to comply with certain construction standards &mdash; for example, the buildings across the road &mdash; might destroy the very quality that warranted their preservation in the first place.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Minister considers that compliance with any requirement of building regulations would be <Col N="462" /> unreasonable in relation to any specified class of building operation, works or material, the Minister may, as regards such compliance, by order dispense with or relax that requirement subject to such conditions as he sees fit and specifies in the order.</P>
    <P>Is that to be interpreted as a framework section that would accommodate derogations in respect of areas designated for conservation?  I want to establish that this is the section which provides the framework within which there can be derogations from building regulations &mdash; not the abandonment of standards but an alternative set of standards &mdash; in respect of old buildings warranting improvement but whose improvement under the ordinary building regulations would be counter-productive from a conservation point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is the appropriate section whose provisions would prevail in the type of circumstances the Deputy has outlined.  In regard to particular types of buildings where the ordinary building regulations might not be appropriate, then these would be the provisions to be used.  Perhaps the best I can do is to make that clear in issuing guidelines to local authorities.  That would be the way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, this section would provide the mechanism under which one could apply for, say, a waiver of the current by-laws.  Am I right in thinking that this would constitute the legal door through which one would proceed to effect an adjustment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <P>(6)  Where an application for a dispensation from or relaxation of any requirement of building regulations is made pursuant to section 4, or where an appeal under section 7 has been made against a decision on such application, the building control authority may defer the making of a decision in relation to the granting or, as the case may be, the refusal of a fire safety certificate or certificate of approval, in respect of the building concerned until the decision on the application or, as the case may be, the appeal, has been made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment involves the deletion of section 6.  In deciding not to put forward a large number of drafting amendments separately I am mindful of the need to avoid distracting the House from the central issues arising.  I shall be glad to deal with any queries Members may have on individual subsections as they arise.</P>
    <P>The principal substantive change involved is that provision for appeals is now contained in the new section 7, the insertion of which I will move when the House has finished its deliberations on this section.  Section 6 empowers the Minister to make building control regulations dealing with the procedural, administrative and control arrangements to be operated to secure compliance with the building regulations.  This section gives power to the Minister to apply different systems of control to different <Col N="468" /> kinds of buildings or to buildings in different areas if he so wishes.  That is the kernel of the section.  This power gives the Minister a flexibility to apply either an approval type system of control, involving the submission of plans to building control authorities for their approval, to the erection of individual buildings, a self certification system based upon certificates given by designated persons on their own responsibility or a combination of both systems.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the submission to a building control authority of an application for a fire safety certificate in respect of a building of a prescribed class such as a high risk premises and places of public resort.  This power is inserted in response to the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal report that it would be undesirable for the fire related parts of the building regulations to be subject to a self-certification system of control.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned this section is <Col N="469" /> the key to the whole Bill before us in that this is the section that proposes to introduce certification by bodies other than the existing building control authorities. While I would be the first to accept that outside of Dublin and Cork the building control authorities do not operate in any substantial way, nevertheless it has been found that the way the building controls have been operated by Dublin city and county and indeed by Cork has proved to be extremely satisfactory in terms of the standards of buildings and the standards of compliance where regulations are concerned.</P>
    <P>The proposal in amendment No. a1 is that paragraph (a) of the new section being proposed by the Minister be deleted.  I am proposing this because it is under this paragraph that the question of certificates of compliance are being introduced.  It is clear from the context of this Bill and indeed the debate surrounding it and the submissions which have been received from various interest groups that what is being proposed here is a procedure of self certification.  I do not accept that as an adequate way of dealing with the development of urban areas in particular.  It has not been found to be a satisfactory way of proceeding in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister has taken on board the recommendation of the Stardust Tribunal, that the fire regulations should not be subject to this form of certification.  I know there are concerns among the professional bodies as regards where the ultimate liability would stand, given the failure to comply with a certificate or indeed if faults were to be found subsequent to a building being erected and a certificate issued.  Who exactly would be responsible?  If, for instance, a certifier was to die, go out of business or whatever, in what way would the person whose building was certified have recourse to the law or who would be ultimately responsible?  It is for these reasons in general that I am proposing amendment No. a1 at this point.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that building control regulations can only provide for approval type control systems based around the submission <Col N="470" /> of plans and other documents to building control authorities who would have to issue an approval before work could commence. There is a number of serious drawbacks to the proposal.  First, such a system would create inhibitory and costly delays in getting construction projects under way and secondly, it has the potential to seriously affect efficiency in the construction industry if introduced throughout the country.  It would also involve the recruitment and training of a substantial number of staff in those local authorities not operating building by-laws. There are only seven local authorities operating these by-laws at present. Given the limitations on resources in local authorities, expenditure of the magnitude required would be quite unacceptable. The primary responsibility for the design and construction of buildings rests with the construction industry and the certification system envisaged in paragraph (a) recognises this.  To exclude the possibility of being able to introduce a certification system, which would be the result of agreeing to this amendment, is not acceptable to me.  For reasons involving practicality and principle I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>No.  There are different types of certification as the Deputy will know.  There is the approval system by local authorities, the self-certification system &mdash; a designer-builder operation &mdash; and there is the combination of both these systems.  Certain types of buildings should be certified by the fire authorities. I think I mentioned on the last occasion that it was my intention to set up a building regulation advisory body and that is possible under section 13.  I would expect that they would give advice on matters such as the types of certificates involved. That is the kind of advice I will be requesting them to provide to me.</P>

      <P>I commend the Department <Col N="471" /> for the clarity with which the amendment has been drafted relative to the original section 6.  It is much clearer in its lay-out and content and a lot of detailed comments could be made about it.  There is going to be a long debate on section 6 because the core of much of this legislation is embodied in that section. Subsection (2) (a) makes provision for self-certification; subsection (2) (b) refers to fire safety certificates; subsection (2) (c) refers to building certificates of approval coming from a building authority and subsection (2) (d) refers to the type of certificate.  In essence, if I understand what Deputy De Rossa is saying, if we accept The Workers' Party amendment we are proposing to eliminate the power for any form of self-certification.</P>

      <P>I was about to contribute to the debate last night when we had to adjourn.  The Bill, although raising fundamental issues of importance in relation to anti-competitive practices and restrictive practices in the Irish economy, is somewhat premature.  I suppose I could be criticised for making this statement if nothing was being done by this Government on matters referred to in the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, the record of this House shows that the Minister, during the debate in the Dáil on the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, gave a commitment to have the Fair Trade Commission carry out a full investigation on the merits or demerits of a system to regulate competition on a basis which was similar to that contained in the Treaty of Rome under Articles 85 and 86.  This system is generally taken as a prohibition system of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Bill would render useless, to some extent, the work already carried out by the Fair Trade Commission in the investigation to which I have referred.  In March 1988 the commission sought submissions from those interested in this subject.  I understand that the commission in their study must also have regard to the constitutional question which might arise in the matter of granting the Fair Trade Commission judicial powers similar to those already invested in the EC Commission.  The study also involves the consideration of many other questions.  The EC Commission approach is that this is a prohibition system as enshrined in Articles 85 and 86.  The current Irish approach to the problem, as enshrined in current legislation, covers competition control under <Col N="473" /> the control of abuses of the system. Articles 85 and 86 deal with competition between member states in their particular trading relationships.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the control of trade practices is governed essentially by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, as amended by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1987.  Mergers, takeovers and monopolies are also governed by the 1978 Act and are covered by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Over the years as well as the Acts I have referred to, in the Irish context, many ministerial orders have been made covering a whole range of areas such as groceries, carpets, motor spirits, jewellery, motor cars, radios, cookers, electrical equipment, building materials etc.  This is a fairly extensive volume of Irish competition law notwithstanding all this legislation which is very important and which has been widely used in the context of competition and fair trade control.</P>
    <P>While we are awaiting the results of the study by the Fair Trade Commission, the Government have been pushing ahead with their own legislative programme to ehance national competition legislation.  The Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, is an important example of this type of legislation.  What would concern me at this stage about the introduction of the prohibition system would be largely in the area of control and organisation.  I question whether the costs involved might not in themselves be prohibitive so far as any particular industry was concerned if one was passing on the cost of establishing a particular system directly to the customer.  If we were not passing on the cost the State would be expected to carry the cost of the organisation to control the anti-competitive practices and restrictive practices enshrined in a prohibition system.  I am not sure that that is a road we should go down.</P>
    <P>From what I can glean from my study of the EC experience in this regard, it has led to the establishment of fairly substantial organisations to try to patrol the system.  So far as the prohibition system is concerned, considerable delays have taken place in the system responding to contacts from industries throughout the <Col N="474" /> EC.  In some cases the system was unable to respond quickly enough to the demands from industry or from those seeking a response from the organisation handling a particular issue.  The organisations were compelled to try to catch up with the backlogs by extending block clearances, letters of comfort, etc.  This suggests that the prohibition system is not necessarily the best system, although I accept that the Minister in setting the Fair Trade Commission to investigate both types of systems will take on board the findings of the commission when they report on what is a fairly crucial issue at present.</P>
    <P>To proceed now with this Bill would be premature because the Fair Trade Commission are investigating a very important issue.  We all accept that competition is the lifeblood of an economy such as ours.  Ours is an open economy and in 1992 it will be subject to greater competition from outside and will have to be able to withstand the fierce onslaught that will undoubtedly come.  While open competition has beneficial effects, we should not get carried away and say the ideal situation is an absolutely open competition market without any controls or mechanisms to protect sometimes the consumer and sometimes the supplier of the goods or services involved.</P>
    <P>In setting guidelines for prices I am not sure it is always a good thing to say to part of the economy supplying particular goods or services that competition should determine precisely the price structure. Sometimes that is not necessarily in the best interests of the consumer.  I will try to explain the reasons.  If a service is being provided by a particular organisation, and because of the intensity of competition prices are lowered, sometimes the net effect of that competition is to cut corners.  Cutting corners to provide cheaper services such as cleaning or even the fire service &mdash; can very seriously affect the consumer.</P>
    <P>One can sometimes be so exposed to competition that in order to stay in business one has to lower prices consistently and one can only go down so far before something begins to give way either in terms of service or in terms of the job one was paid to do and in the end the <Col N="475" /> consumer can pay a heavy price for the continuous downgrading of the price structure.  Sometimes it is as well for the public to know that they can obtain a particular product or service at a specific price and below this price alarm bells should ring regarding the product or service they are getting.  In that regard it is sometimes better to have control mechanisms in position in order to ensure that the consumer does not completely lose out in the free economy we have in this country and which sometimes can be to the benefit of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Control of abuse in this area is very much strengthened by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  This allows the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to delve into some of the areas that have caused consumers concern over the years.  The 1987 Act strengthens the hand of the director and has put on notice in a substantial way the suppliers of goods and services who perhaps until recent times felt they had a free hand in so far as costs and prices were concerned.  There is sufficient legislation, but that is not to say that improvements are not continuously called for and that the strong hand of the Minister of the day is not sometimes required in matters of this kind, as we have seen fairly recently.  I would prefer to see the line being taken in the direction of strengthening the existing legislation in view of the work being carried out by the Fair Trade Commission.  I would prefer that we would await their report and then make our decision on whether we continue with the control of abuse or take on board the EC Commission's prohibition system.  There are merits and demerits on both sides.  The issue is important for the economy and will become increasingly so.  Although the Bill genuinely raises issues we must keep before our minds, it would be wiser to wait until we size up all areas that will impact on the economy in the years ahead.  Arising from reports from the Fair Trade Commission and debates such as this, the fundamental job ahead is to decide whether we choose the existing system or the one which presently pertains in the EC Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some brief remarks on this debate.  I deplore the attitude expressed by the Government in recent days with regard to the use of Private Members' Time and particularly the remarks made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  His suggestion that smaller parties in this House should not be allowed bring forward legislative proposals and his view that only the Government have the right to initiate legislation is in effect verging on Fascism and is a very dangerous trend.  I was glad to see other Government spokespersons rowing back from that position very quickly.</P>
      <P>To put it at its mildest, the Government would find no support in the Constitution of our country for that view.  In fact, Article 15.1º of the Constitution says very explicitly that &ldquo;The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State&rdquo;.  Article 284.1º says that &ldquo;The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  There is nothing in the Constitution providing that only the Government have the right to legislate and I am sure that the Fianna Fáil Party over the past number of years did not take that view when in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the logic of the Government's view expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was accepted, obviously it would only be a matter of time before the Government would be announcing that not only did the smaller parties in the House not have the right to initiate legislation but that we should perhaps also be excluded from introducing amendments to the proposed legislation brought forward by the Government. Within a short time the Government would set about precluding us from either asking questions or speaking on debates if that attitude were to prevail.  I can assure the Government that the Labour Party will continue to bring forward legislation in Private Members' Time and that we will be introducing a number of legislative measures in the course of the year. We intend to introduce measures dealing with the practice of companies who use huge voluntary redundancy packages to increase their profits.  These include the <Col N="477" /> introduction of a new code of practice for office holders in a position to receive valuable gifts, a system of disclosure of Member's financial interests, and other measures.  We will not be deflected in our intentions in this regard by the antidemocratic utterances of any Minister.</P>
    <P>Having said that, when we publish legislation, what we intend will be clear for all to see.  We will not be publishing Bills which say one thing on the surface and an entirely different thing when they are examined closely.  We will not be publishing dishonest legislation, of the kind we are discussing this evening.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was published, the Progressive Democrats held a press conference to launch it.  That was on 2 February.  At that conference, great play was made of the intention of the Progressive Democrats to take on the semi-State bodies and to curb their economic power.  Their press release referred to the &ldquo;protected position of the monopolistic semi-State companies&rdquo; and went on to say that the Bill &ldquo;would change all that.&rdquo; Other contributors to the press conference, including Deputy McDowell, even talked about how privatisation of semi-State companies would be facilitated rather than hindered by legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Bill attracted the usual few paragraphs in the papers, and was then forgotten about.  It was not until the debate started, and Members of the House began to study the legislation, that the real intentions of what looked like a very worthy measure began to sink in.  My own study of the Bill gave rise, I must say, to considerable feelings of unease.  I felt somewhat reassured by the commitment given to the House by the proposer of this Bill, Deputy Cullen, and by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, that they would be more than happy to meet the concerns of any other Deputy or party about the Bill, and that they would positively welcome amendments that Deputies felt would improve the Bill.  For that reason, rather than come to a hasty conclusion, I felt it would be worthwhile to test the commitments given by the Progressive Democrats.  I wrote to the proposer of the Bill in the following terms:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>I have been studying the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, as initiated by you, with a view to making a recommendation to my Parliamentary Party meeting on Wednesday next as to whether or not we should support the Bill at Second Stage.</P>
    <P>While I support the principle of competition, the Bill as initiated gives rise to a number of serious questions.  I would be grateful if you could give me your views on these issues prior to my discussing the matter with the Parliamentary Party.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the application of the Bill to semi-state industry.  It appears to me that the Bill as currently drafted can be used as a weapon in the hands of anyone wishing, on the one hand, to seek the privatisation of any aspect of the activities of semi-state industry, and on the other hand, by any individual seeking to prevent a semi-state company from expanding the products it manufactures or sells, the services it offers, or the market it supplies.</P>
    <P>This may be a question of drafting, or it may be an expression of the principles underlying the Bill.  The latter seems to me to be more likely, particularly in view of the last sentence of Paragraph 8 of the Explanatory Memorandum (although I notice from Deputy O'Malley's contribution to the debate that that sentence was inserted in error &mdash; a Freudian error?).</P>
    <P>In any event, it would not be acceptable to me that a Bill should pass into law which has the potential effect of weakening public enterprises.  For that reason, I would be glad to have your assurance that the Progressive Democrats would be prepared to support an amendment to the Bill exempting semi-State companies from the effects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second reservation I have about the Bill as drafted concerns the onus it places on the individual to seek redress in any situation where he believes himself to have been wronged by a breach of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Much of the &ldquo;price-fixing&rdquo; referred <Col N="479" /> to in the debate so far on the Bill could be more effectively dealt with by the restoration of consumer protection legislation, such as price control legislation; whereas the individual who seeks redress against professional malpractice will need a great deal more support than is proposed in your Bill.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I believe that (a)  the power of the Minister to fix prices by Order in any case where he deems it to be essential to the common good should be included; and (b) the right of the Director of Fair Trade to act on behalf of aggrieved persons must be spelled out in the Bill (similar to, for instance, the right of the Minister for Labour in certain equality cases), and I am seeking your assurance that appropriate measures on these lines will be included.</P>
    <P>Since my Parliamentary Party meets on Wednesday to discuss the matter, I would be grateful if you could give this letter your earliest attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In due course I received a long and clever reply to this letter indicating that of course the Progressive Democrats could not accept the major amendment I proposed because any such amendment would weaken the semi-State sector. Then to my amazement, while I was reading this letter Deputy MacDowell of the Progressive Democrats was busily distributing copies of it to the media and explaining to them that a reason the Progressive Democrats would not accept the amendment suggested was because it would weaken the Bill.  Apart from the fact that this is the first time I have ever been asked by the media to comment on a letter to me which they had read before I had even finished reading it, the two different versions put out by two different spokesmen reveals the duplicity involved in their approach to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The truth about this Bill is that it is an ideologically biased piece of free marketeering. The irony about the party that propose it is that they are perfectly capable of shouting slogans in support of a free market one minute and calling on whatever Minister will listen to them to fix the price of bread on the one hand or to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Our economy can only work effectively in the interests of all the people who depend on it if the State is given a strong role.  That role must include the capacity of the State to intervene to create jobs where that is possible and to protect jobs.  It must leave the State sector free to expand and develop according to commercial criteria, but the role we envisage for the State also includes the right to intervene to ensure that the interests of consumers, workers and business are reconciled to the maximum extent.  That is why we will not support any blanket approach to this question.  We intend to study the report of the Fair Trade Commission when published and if legislation is introduced as a result we will reserve the right to seek to amend it to ensure that the competition law we adopt is the one that suits the circumstances of this country.</P>

      <P>A prohibition system deliberately modelled on the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and on its implementing Regulation 17/1962 is, as has already been pointed out in earlier contributions, likely to be costly and bureaucratic if one takes into consideration the systems and procedures currently operated by the Commission of the European Communities in exercising its functions under these Articles.  This is a serious omission in the Bill and one which only helps to underline the need to consider all aspects and implications of any proposed prohibition system in a very careful manner if we are to avoid some obvious pitfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal later with the Commission's procedures for operating the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 which will help to highlight such potential difficulties.  Suffice it for me to say at this point that very considerable staff numbers are required in the EC Commission's Directorate General for Competition to enable it to carry out its role under these Articles.  It <Col N="481" /> makes abundant sense to await the Fair Trade Commission's Report before any accurate conclusions can be reached on the precise staffing and cost implications of a prohibition system.  If there is such a huge scale of anti-competitive practices in existence in this country as has been suggested by many Deputies, a situation which incidentally I would consider to be somewhat exaggerated, there are likely to be very considerable resources required in vetting and clearing notified agreements under a system along the lines of Articles 85 and 86.  At a time when there are many demands on scarce resources, the Government would have to consider very carefully whether such a proposal should be proceeded with at this time in the manner envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Much has been said by the Opposition in the debate about the negative, cautious and protectionist stance taken by the Government on this Bill in the light of 1992.  It has been suggested, for example, that with the partial exception of the UK, all other European Community countries have applied the principles of the competition Articles of the Treaty of Rome to their domestic law.  Let me put the record straight on this point.  We are by no means the &ldquo;odd ones out&rdquo; in this regard.  An excessively rosy picture of the situation in other member states has been painted.  The real extent and effectiveness of competition legislation and administrative arrangements is less than ideal.</P>
    <P>The extent to which other member states are reviewing and revising their legislation establishes the point.  Denmark operates a &ldquo;control of abuse&rdquo; system largely along the same lines as our own.  Spain has only recently introduced a system based on the principles of Articles 85 and 86 but may have to amend its legislation in the light of experience to correct a flaw which has been discovered in its system.</P>
    <P>We have a sophisticated merger, takeover and monopoly control system, as is contained in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, such as does not exist in all other member states of the Community.  Our Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, as amended by the 1987 Act, provides power to make orders <Col N="482" /> relating to restrictive practices which again are not generally available in other member states.  Furthermore, our restrictive practices legislation does not provide for any exemptions such as are included in the competition legislation of some other member states.  A considerable number of such exemptions, or block exemption regulations as they are commonly known, have become necessary, among other things, under the EC Commission's Articles 85 and 86 system in order to deal with the huge log-jam of notifications and delays which built up in the past to the detriment of legal certainty for business.  Going down the road of exemptions in order to make a prohibition system workable in practice, having regard to scarce resources is not necessarily satisfactory as it would seriously dilute the clarity at the outset for business of what is prohibited and what is not.  To suggest therefore that we are the &ldquo;odd ones out&rdquo; in this context is totally inaccurate.</P>
    <P>To suggest also that we are being cautious and negative in our approach to the proposed Bill, which is deliberately modelled on the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 which were, I would point out, first drawn up well over 30 years ago is also totally unacceptable.  Is it not only right and proper that we should proceed carefully and very deliberately in our consideration of any proposal of this type which is of fundamental importance in the context of encouraging and fostering economic growth in this country?  It is, therefore, important that we proceed on that basis.  I am not suggesting that the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty are deficient or inherently weak in any real respect.  I would simply like to emphasise the importance of a careful considered approach to this question, having regard to the length of time which has elapsed since the drafting of the Treaty and the changed business environment since then, aspects of which may need to be taken into account, and particularly the importance of getting things right in the run up to 1992.</P>
    <P>I would contrast this approach with those of the provisions of the Bill, which among other things, while addressing the future role of the Director of Consumer <Col N="483" /> Affairs and Fair Trade, gives no indication whatsoever of the future role it envisages for the Fair Trade Commission. The Fair Trade Commission, I need hardly point out, are one of the three authorities in which statutory control of restrictive practices legislation is vested by virtue of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, as amended by the 1987 Act.  Indeed, it is fair to say that the Bill gives no indication of how the proposed new legislation would fit into current restrictive practices legislation.  These are hardly examples of preparing our competition legislative system properly for 1992.</P>
    <P>One of the supposed strengths of this Bill is to enable any person, trade, association or company aggrieved to seek redress directly through the High Court. It is also envisaged that the High Court would have the power to award damages, together with, if necessary, the power to grant an injunction and declaration to a person aggrieved by the anti-competitive practices of another.  On the last point, I would point out that injunctive powers are already included in the existing provisions of the Restrictive Practices Act enabling a court of competent jurisdiction on the motion of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, or of the Minister, or of any person to enforce compliance with the terms of a Restrictive Practices Order.  Such a provision does not, therefore, necessarily represent an improvement.  Neither does direct access by an individual to the High Court to seek damages necessarily improve matters.  While in theory it might, the practical reality of such a provision is that the costs involved would be perhaps prohibitive to the vast majority of individuals and, therefore, direct access would not be likely to be exercised to any significant extent.</P>
    <P>Such considerations do not arise from an individual's point of view under current legislation.  Here it is open to any individual to request the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to investigate an alleged unfair or restrictive trading practice on his or her behalf under any existing Order which may be in force in the area concerned, and to <Col N="484" /> prosecute any breaches which may occur. Where there is no legislation in force, the Director may, if he considers the complaint to be justified, seek to resolve the matter on an informal basis.  If this does not prove possible, or if the problem is seen as a significant one for the sector concerned, the Director may then recommend that the matter be formally examined by the Fair Trade Commission.  Such an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission may result in a report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce containing whatever recommendations they consider necessary to deal with the problem concerned.  The Minister may then, if he accepts these recommendations, make an Order under section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act.  Such Orders could, for example, prohibit restrictive practices including arrangements, agreements or understandings which prevent or restrict competition or restrain trade, or the provision of any service or which involve resale price maintenance.</P>
    <P>Even for big businesses the undoubted costliness of seeking redress through the High Court and the possibility indeed of defences against mischievous claims by competitors, might also be an impediment to rather than a catalyst towards economic progress.  There is also the possibility that rather than bringing about a reduction in costs to industry and businesses at large the changes proposed here could have the opposite effect.  I am referring here to the possibility of the proposed prohibition system spawning a whole new service industry perhaps in the legal area where additional expertise, such as already exists in the Community, may be required to unravel the interpretation of Articles 85 and 86.</P>
    <P>An important consideration which arises in the Bill is its provision proposing to give certain judicial powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade relating to the proposed functions of that authority.  This raises a constitutional issue which is one of a number of issues being addressed in the current study being undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission.  It is indeed a matter which is currently the subject of legal advice from the Attorney General's Office.  It is possible, for example, that under the <Col N="485" /> Irish Constitution, it would not be possible for the Director of Consumer Affairs, or the Fair Trade Commission for that matter, to be granted powers similar to those of the EC Commission. Clearly this is a crucial issue which needs to be teased out very carefully before it could be said with any certainty that the House would be constitutionally entitled to grant judicial powers of the kind mentioned to any individual or body.  Perhaps Deputy Cullen has already investigated this question.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to present legislation as being cumbersome and offer Articles 85 and 86 as a panacea.  I thinks it is worthwhile to look at how Articles 85 and 86 work in practice. Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits agreements or other practices which distort competition and which are liable to affect trade between member states.  If an agreement is prohibited it is null and void and the Commission has the power to order parties to terminate the illegal conduct and it may impose fines.  However, the prohibition of Article 85 can be declared inapplicable by the Commission if the effects of a restrictive agreement or practice are sufficiently counterbalanced by a number of beneficial elements.  In these cases exemptions can be granted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Article 86 deals with the behaviour of undertakings which are in a dominant position.  Having a dominant position is not in itself prohibited, there must be an abuse of a dominant position.  The administrative practice of the Commission provides for a procedure enabling parties to an agreement to seek a declaration from the Commission that their activities do not come within the scope of the competition rules.  These declarations are called negative clearances and these can be given in individual cases provided the parties have notified the agreement to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Notification of agreements, decisions and concerted practices is made to the Commission for the purpose of seeking a decision either that the conduct is not caught by Article 85 (1) at all, that is the negative clearance procedure, or that while it is caught it may nevertheless <Col N="486" /> benefit from exemption under Article 85 (3).  No exemption or negative clearance may be granted unless an agreement has been notified to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Any interested party may, of course, complain about anti-competitive behaviour to the Commission.  If after examination of the complaint the Commission considered it to be well-founded it will proceed to ensure the termination of the infringement.  The three basic types of decisions which the Commission can take in the application of Articles 85 and 86 are: decisions granting negative clearance; exemption decisions pursuant to Article 85 (3) and decisions ordering the termination of an infringement.  When an undertaking has made an application seeking formal assurance from the Commission that their agreement or other commercial activities are not deemed to infringe the competition rules, that is the negative clearance procedure, the Commission must first give any other interested parties the chance to make their views on the matter known.  A second formality which must be observed before negative clearance can be given is consultation with member state authorities through the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions.  If after these steps have been taken the Commission maintains the view that negative clearance is justified, a formal decision is taken which states that on the basis of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds for the Commission to take any action under Article 85 (1) and/or Article 86 against the agreement or the commercial activity involved.  If new facts subsequently arise or if the circumstances involved change substantially the Commission retains the power to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>I would now like to look at the exemption procedure.  As in the case of negative clearances, a decision granting exemption must be preceded by publication of the main elements involved, giving interested parties the opportunity to submit any observations and by consultation of the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions. The Commission's decision indicates why the agreement or other activity in question is deemed to violate Article <Col N="487" /> 85 (1) and what elements have been found by the Commission which fulfil all the requirements for justifying an exemption under Article 85 (3).  Exemption is always granted for a fixed period of time, which can, of course, be extended.  The decision may impose certain obligations on the undertaking involved and in some cases, the parties may be requested to modify certain aspects of their agreements before exemption can be granted at all.</P>
    <P>If the Commission reach the preliminary conclusion that a violation of Article 85 (1) or Article 86 is taking place and in the case of notifications, that the conditions for granting an exemption under Article 85 (3) are not present it must give the parties notice of its objections in the form of a written communication. Parties are given a specific time limit to respond in writing to the Commission objections.  Parties can also request an opportunity to argue their case orally.  Following the oral hearing, the Commission must consult the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions.  Only after all these steps have taken place can the Commission come to a final decision.</P>
    <P>Where an infringement is found to exist the Commission will order the undertaking involved to put an end to it forthwith.  If appropriate, the Commission also has the power to order positive action by the undertakings involved, for example, where a dominant undertaking has been found to abuse its position by refusing, say, to supply a customer, the Commission may require it to resume supplies to such customer within a specified period and ensure appropriate supply arrangements for the future.  The Commission may also impose fines.</P>
    <P>Depending on the complexity of the complaints of any given case it may take the Commission one or two years or more to reach a final decision.</P>
    <P>For the sake of expediency, many cases before the Commission are concluded by way of informal settlement, notably where the undertakings involved voluntarily eliminate any objectionable practices.  In fact, the Commission normally <Col N="488" /> takes a dozen or so formal decisions each year, whereas the number of informal settlements is usually running into several hundred.</P>
    <P>In some cases the Commission may conclude an informal settlement with the parties by way of issue of an administrative letter known as a &ldquo;letter of comfort&rdquo;. This states that the Commission, on the basis of the information at its disposal, has decided to take no action and proposes to close the file.  These letters are of an administrative nature only, and are not legally binding in any way.</P>
    <P>If we are to adopt the Bill as proposed by Deputy Cullen, the above procedures, with the exception of consultations with the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions, would have to be carried out.  While, as I have previously indicated, I accept that our current competition legislation is not perfect, I feel that we cannot merely incorporate Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into domestic legislation as is suggested in sections 1 and 2 of the Bill. If new legislation is to be put in place we must try to learn from the problems encountered by the EC in implementing Articles 85 and 86 and there have been many.  As Deputies are probably aware, the UK authorities published a consultative document entitled &ldquo;A Review of Restrictive Trade Practices Policy&rdquo; in March, 1988.  I would now like to address very quickly some of the issues raised in this document.  Others have made reference to these points throughout the debate.</P>
    <P>The UK report found that although it is impossible to be certain that any particular class of agreement is always going to be significantly anti-competitive, nevertheless there are some which can be identified as hard core and which the Government in the UK are particularly keen to see eradicated.  These almost always have severe anti-competitive effects, and for the sake of clarity the UK Government believe that it is worthwhile to list them in new law to illuminate the general prohibition.  This would not mean that the generality of the provision would in any sense be diminished.  The purpose of the illustrative list is to ensure that businessmen are left in no doubt about <Col N="489" /> the central targets of the law.  The UK government propose that the law should state that, in particular, the prohibition applies to the following agreements and concerted practices:</P>
    <P>(1)  those fixing prices and charges, including any terms or conditions (for example, discounts, credit terms) which determine effective net prices (recommendations by trade, professional and other associations on prices or charges are also included if those recommendations have the effect of determining minimum or actual prices);</P>
    <P>(2)  collusive tendering;</P>
    <P>(3)  those sharing or allocating markets, customers, raw materials or other inputs, processing or capacity;</P>
    <P>(4)  those prohibiting or otherwise restricting advertising or the provision of other promotional information;</P>
    <P>(5)  collective refusals to supply or to deal with suppliers, collective discrimination in the terms on which different customers or classes of customer are supplied, and collective anti-competitive conditions of supply such as tie-ins, aggregated or loyalty rebates and &ldquo;no competition&rdquo; clauses.</P>
    <P>It is possible that practices along these lines would be more appropriate in the Irish context than those listed in Article 85 and as set out at section 1 (2) of Deputy Cullen's Bill, which tend to relate to inter-state trade.</P>
    <P>The practices listed in the Third Schedule to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 could also be used as a basis for drawing up a list of specific prohibitions.  This would cover any measures, rules, agreements or acts, whether put into effect by a person alone, in combination or agreement with others, or through a merger, trust, cartel, monopoly or other means or device whatsoever, which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  have or are likely to have the effect of unreasonably limiting or restraining free and fair competition,</P>
    <P>(b)  are in unreasonable restraint of trade,</P>
    <P>(c)  have or are likely to have the <Col N="490" /> effect of unjustly eliminating a competitor,</P>
    <P>(d)  unjustly enhance prices of goods or charges for services, or promote unfairly at the expense of the public the advantage of suppliers or distributors of goods or of persons providing services,</P>
    <P>(e)  secure or are likely to secure, unfairly or contrary to the common good, a substantial or complete control of the supply or distribution of goods or any class of goods, or the provision of services or any class of services,</P>
    <P>(f)  without just cause prohibit or restrict the supply of goods or the provision of services to any person or class of persons, or give preference in regard to the supply of goods or the provision of services,</P>
    <P>(g)  restrict or are likely to restrict unjustly the exercise by any person of his freedom of choice as to what goods or services he will supply or provide, or as to the area in which he may supply or provide goods or services,</P>
    <P>(h)  impose unjust or unreasonable conditions in regard to the supply or distribution of goods or the provision of services,</P>
    <P>(i)  without good reason exclude or are likely to exclude new entrants to any trade, industry or business,</P>
    <P>(j)  secure or are likely to secure unjustly the territorial division of markets between particular persons or classes of persons to the exclusion of others, or</P>
    <P>(k)  in any other respect operate against the common good or are not in accordance with the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>The above list of practices which might be outlawed under a prohibition system could also be considered for inclusion in any amending legislation.  The Fair Trade Commission will be examining all these issues as part of their present study of the respective merits of the control of abuse and prohibition systems.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that even if the basic Article 85 and 86 route is chosen <Col N="491" /> there are a number of possible ways of implementing it.  It would be extremely unwise to pick the particular way at this stage.  The Fair Trade Commission have not given their report on the basic question, much less suggested any particular way or ways of approaching it.  Why rush ahead at this stage?  Let us see what that report contains.</P>
    <P>It may not be of any great concern to some Deputies that a Bill be properly drafted.  I suggest that, on reflection, it should be essentially important to every Deputy to ensure that Bills are completely and properly drafted.  It has been argued that we should allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage, &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo; in Deputy Bruton's words.  This is not a proper approach to legislation.  Let us await the Fair Trade Commission report, debate it, decide on the appropriate course of action for this country in the context in which we now find ourselves and then and only then, if necessary, we can properly prepare any legislation that might be required.  That is the fairest way to prepare any legislation for 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989 before the House this evening.  This is the fourth Bill brought forward by the Progressive Democrats in their Private Members' Time over the last two years.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the Bill is to deal with one of the major structural problems in our economy, that is, the prevalence of restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and professional services.  The Bill is designed to introduce for the first time in Irish law a general prohibition on anti-competitive practices in all sectors of the economy.  I want to deal this evening with the principles behind the Bill rather than go into specific detail on its drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the aim of an enterprise economy free from anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices is worthwhile in its own right in the year 1989.  Added to that, however, is the necessity to prepare the Irish economy for the rigorous competition which will be opened up in three years' time, with the advent of 1992.  The <Col N="492" /> real value of the Bill must be seen in this context.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that once again it has emerged that the Government are the only party in this House without a clear policy for 1992.  We saw this in the budget a few weeks ago when the Government failed abysmally to recognise that 1992, the single market and the harmonisation of taxes are a mere three budgets away.</P>
    <P>Now, contrary to the interests of the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the Government are stating in their reaction to this Bill that competitiveness and the consumer interest can be dealt with some other time in some other year.  Another holding operation has been put in place. We are to await the report of another committee, arising from the report by the Fair Trede Commission.  I want to refer to the politics behind this Bill as played out in this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, stated at the weekend that a Government defeat on the Second Stage of this Bill would be treated seriously and would be dealt with accordingly.  His imprudent and threatening remarks were followed up by the Government spokesperson who stated, quite outrageously, in Monday's newspapers that &ldquo;legislation is the responsibility of the Government and they are not prepared to have that responsibility usurped, particularly by smaller parties, by means of Private Members' Time being used for a purpose for which it was never intended&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that this arrogant attitude on the part of the Government has done more for the Progressive Democrats and this Bill than he could ever have imagined.  What the Minister succeeded in doing is what we had sought to do in introducing the Bill that is, to heighten public awareness of the need for greater competition and consumer protection in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remark was correctly interpreted by many, including the Consumers' Association of Ireland, as being an attempt on his part to deny to the Irish economy the benefits of fair trade.  He succeeded in confirming what most people suspect: that the existing situation with regard to fair trade enforcement procedures is unsatisfactory, cumbersome <Col N="493" /> and inapplicable to modern commercial practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's ill-advised reaction also demonstrates his hostility to new ideas and proposals, especially if they come from the Progressive Democrats.  That is no reason and should never be a reason for rejecting a Bill from any party.</P>
    <P>The Bill forms part of a policy programme that the Progressive Democrats have prepared to encourage an enterprise economy that will shift economic activity away from the over-burdening influence of the State to the private sector and, especially, to small enterprises which have the best record in regard to job creation in the past few years.  As part of this programme, it is our view that the best way to do this is to remove as many obstacles and impediments as possible.</P>
    <P>In the retail industry, for example, a representative of RGDATA, the small shop owners' federation, pointed out on radio that his members, in their efforts to make available non-prescription products, such as Junior Disprin, have found that their suppliers have been placed under unacceptable pressure by pharmacists seeking to retain the exclusive right to distribute these goods.  Under section 2 of the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, which seeks to bring into domestic law Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome, such an attempt would be unlawful and the members of RGDATA would have an immediate right of recourse to the High Court for, first, under section 3 (2) of this Bill, an injunction to restrain or prohibit such an attempt and secondly, under section 3 (3) for damages, including punitive damages, for any financial or commercial loss their members may have suffered as a result of such a concerted practice.</P>
    <P>More importantly, however, and in contrast to the present seven-stage procedure that Deputy Bruton referred to in detail last week, the victims of unfair trading practices would not have to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of unfair trade. Instead, the burden of proof and the onus would be on the pharmacists to show to the High Court's satisfaction that what they were doing was not unlawful.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the Minister's reaction <Col N="494" /> to this proposed procedure was to dismiss it at first hand but then this is not surprising when, in his own words, he gave this Bill only &ldquo;a rapid assessment of its contents&rdquo;.  Indeed, ostrich-like, he has his head firmly planted in the sand while all around him his European counterparts have been much more progressive in their attitude.  Their response has not been considered unusual or radical because such procedures are already a well-established part of the law that applies to Community trade.  I would caution the Minister, while he still has time, to reconsider his exclusive dependence on the anticipated report to be produced by the Fair Trade Commission since he may find that the court in Luxembourg will apply the benefit of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome directly to this country in any case.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to avoid future embarrassment in Europe, especially when he attends meetings of the Council of Ministers, he would do well to reconsider the contents of this Bill and to set out some positive programme to do away with anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>If that is not enough to encourage him to reconsider his earlier position, I can give him another example where the provisions of this Bill would be of considerable benefit both to businessmen and consumers.  I refer to the housing construction industry which is especially relevant in the context of the exorbitant rise in housing costs.  The sale and supply of building products throughout the country is a matter of grave concern, particularly in relation to one product extensively employed in the construction of new housing and the reconstruction of the existing housing stock.  This product is plaster and its derivative product, plasterboard. The Irish market for plaster products is dominated by a monopoly supplier, Gypsum Industries, which is a direct subsidiary of another substantial enterprise known as British Gypsum.</P>
    <P>Unlike its British parent, the Irish company has no competitors on the Irish market, not even from its British parent. It enjoys unique monopoly privileges to the detriment of the domestic building industry and householders.  Since this company enjoys a predominant position <Col N="495" /> in the building supplies trade, it has been able to see off a number of serious attempts to provide other sources of supply from France and, most recently, from Spain.  If these attempts had been successful, much cheaper plaster and plasterboard products would have been available to Irish builders, who would have been able to pass this benefit on to house purchasers in the form of lower costs.</P>
    <P>Each time, however, an attempt was made to provide alternative supplies, those supliers found that their customers did not repeat their orders because the customers were prohibited from obtaining supplies of raw plaster from the Irish producer.  What is most alarming is that a near monopoly producer is able to control the flow of its product to suppliers selectively and on the basis of whether they stock or refuse to stock competitors' plaster products.</P>
    <P>The alarming aspect of this situation is that, under the existing procedures, a substantial amount of time would elapse before any action might be taken and this would be too late to remedy any of the damage caused.  Alternatively, the Bill we have proposed would enable aggrieved parties to have immediate recourse in matters under dispute and have a prompt decision.  If the Minister can object to this only on the ground that business may have large legal costs to cope with, he is then ignoring the much larger costs that the consumer is expected to bear individually and in silence.  I would prefer to leave decisions on these matters to the good sense of consumers, as we propose in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the erroneous statement made by a Government spokesman earlier this week.  It was stated that legislation was the sole responsibility of Government and that smaller parties should not usurp these powers.  In the normal run of State matters it has generally been assumed, wrongly, that the primary responsibility for the nation's affairs has been, in practice, with the Government regardless of the onus set by the Constitution.  This view is totally wrong and contrasts greatly with most other advanced democratic countries. <Col N="496" /> Their parliamentarians are not only encouraged but expected to involve themselves in the legislative process.</P>
    <P>When the history of the 25th Dáil is written historians will notice three particular matters.  In the first place the 25th Dáil is unique in that, for the first time, a new party have taken their place in the House challenging and competing with the older political parties.  Secondly, the effort to establish this party, and its very nature, has led to a fundamental revaluation in political practices in that both the major parties have reacted by either performing responsibly in Government, as in the case of Fianna Fáil, or by devising ways of politically accommodating necessary Government action as in the case of the Fine Gael Tallaght strategy.</P>
    <P>The significance of this recently acquired maturity on the part of the two major political parties has not only broken the monopoly of the left on the formation of Government as alternatives to Fianna Fáil, it has also led to the most unique feature in the political history of the State, manifesting itself in a democratic consensus of the centre.  I wish to refer to this point.  However, this consensus is fragile and not one which the two major parties would choose themselves. It is in reality their short-term solution to alleviate the widespread pressure for better political standards which contributed so much to the formation of our party.</P>
    <P>Another distinguishing feature of this Dáil, which I ask Minister Burke to note, is that the Opposition parties have, for the first time in the history of the State and in reaction to the formation of the Progressive Democrats, made major efforts &mdash; as is their right &mdash; to introduce an alternative legislative programme or to amend existing Acts which have greatly benefited the work of this House. It is noteworthy and not without significance that it was in this Dáil that Deputy Shatter succeeded in obtaining all party agreement to the passage of the Judicial Separation Bill.</P>
    <P>As Chief Whip of the Progressive <Col N="497" /> Democrats it is my view that it is more useful to use Private Members' time as an Opposition party dealing with legislative matters than with motions.  I ask the Government to take that point on board. In their allegation that they held sole responsibility for introducing legislation they are in total conflict with the rights given to Opposition parties in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An important point is that although the Government &mdash; and through them the country &mdash; benefit from the current democratic consensus of the centre, the Government do not share or participate in it.  This point was brought home very strongly in the remarks made earlier in the week on this Bill.  Whenever the Government or individual Ministers attempt to ignore this consensus and the rights of Opposition parties, as they attempted to do in recent days, they dislike being reminded that they enjoy it on sufferance only.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Bill could have been used as an opportunity to debate competition policy and its role in economic development.  Some Deputies did so and I welcome their contribution to the evolution of policy in this area.  There is no doubt that when we discuss the issue again these contributions will be found to have been beneficial.  Unfortunately others did not make such a constructive contribution.</P>
      <P>I want, in this final speech from the Government side, to lay to rest some of the unfounded criticisms of our position and to make the position of the Government clear.  It is essential on so important a topic that the record show our position rather than the position that some have represented us as having.</P>
      <P>The Government are clearly opposed to this Bill.  The criticisms of the Bill have been detailed at great length by previous speakers, not all of them from this side of the House.  Because of the detail that has already been covered I will be brief in summarising the defects inherent in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Bill attempts to import <Col N="498" /> Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty into Irish legislation without the benefit of a proper study of what that might mean.  There is great haste in proceeding without the benefit of the study being undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission. If that study was not already well under way, or if the consequent report was not expected for a considerable time, then it might be legitimate to put pressure on for early action.</P>
    <P>However, this is not the case.  The Fair Trade Commission have been studying the subject for over a year.  They will report this year and an opportunity will be given for debate on that report.  It is only after the report and debate that a well informed decision can be taken on whether Articles 85 and 86 should be the basis for our competition law.</P>
    <P>The second major criticism is that, even if Articles 85 and 86 were accepted as the proper basis for reform of the system, the Bill does not do so adequately.  This is not a mere matter of drafting which could be readily corrected at a later stage.  It is a matter of the principles in the Bill.  Deputy O'Malley pointed to sections 1 to 3 as being the core of the Bill.  These are the sections which attempt to transpose the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 into our system, but there is one significant omission.</P>
    <P>Section 1 allows exemptions from the general prohibitions.  Article 85 does so too, but the Bill does not ensure, as Article 85 does, that an exemption must allow consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits from any such exemption. That is no drafting point.  That goes to the heart of what competition policy is about.  It is, as Deputy O'Malley said, the core of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, drafting deficiencies, some of which might be corrected. I make no great point of these.  It is necessary to recognise, however, that adopting the wrong starting point for legislation can result in tremendous difficulties when the attempt is made to draft back to the desired end.</P>
    <P>The third major area of difficulty in the Bill is the question of what powers should be accorded to what bodies in order to implement its provisions.  This is much more than a question of administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> It can be difficult to make proper administration arrangements in new situations but these problems are soluble.  What is of much more significance is the constitutional aspect of this issue.  Under present legislation the responsibilities and powers are divided among the Fair Trade Commission, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Oireachtas.  This arrangement has been described as cumbersome.  Even if it is, it does give legal certainty about the appropriate division of powers.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us provides no such certainty.  The Fair Trade Commission, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Oireachtas are all taken out of the picture.  The director is given powers of a judicial nature.  Such radical proposals should not be adopted lightly.  Is it really the wish of this House that, whatever about the Fair Trade Commission and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Oireachtas itself will be excluded from any role?  There is a clear constitutional issue about the appropriate assignment of powers and responsibilities that needs to be addressed. This point was made early on in the debate on the Bill but the Bill's sponsors have not answered it adequately.  I understand that this is among the issues being considered by the Fair Trade Commission and that they have sought legal advice on the point.  Here again we have reason to question why there is such haste to leap blindly into areas that are under examination.</P>
    <P>The final issue of significance is the burden which would arise from the implementation of the system envisaged in the Bill.  The present control of abuse system under the Restrictive Practices Acts has been criticised as cumbersome.  The prohibition system has been held out, in comparison, as a model of efficiency, certainty and ease.  That view of what would result from the Bill is far too starry eyed. It glosses over all the real difficulties. This is one of the real disappointments of the debate.  We had here an opportunity to tease out some of the difficulties that a new system might produce.  Of course the Fair Trade Commission are <Col N="500" /> examining the same issues.  This debate might have contributed something to the commission's deliberations.  Instead, all the difficulties were glossed over by the sponsors of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the system envisaged by the Bill to work it will be necessary for existing and future agreements to be examined to see whether the agreements can be exempted from the prohibition provisions.  I will leave aside who should conduct this examination since I have referred to that difficulty already.  What is involved in this examination?  The appropriate authority have to examine the impact of the agreement on competition.  Then the contribution to improving the production and distribution of goods or to promoting technical and economic progress has to be assessed.  Finally, a balance has to be drawn between the negative impact on competition and the more positive elements and a decision given.</P>
    <P>If the examination is to be more than superficial a great deal of time and expertise will have to be devoted to it. This cannot be done without cost.  The resources to carry out these functions will have to be provided.  In times such as these there has to be a clear justification for placing additional burdens on scarce resources.  We have not heard that justification. It is not possible to quantify the resources needed but if the economy is as littered with restrictive practices and agreements as some speakers have indicated there would be no light task facing the authority who would be charged with examining and deciding on exemptions.</P>
    <P>From what I and other speakers on this side have said, it is clear that we do not wish this Bill to proceed.  We have asked that it be withdrawn and I would make that suggestion again.  If the points that have been made on this side are considered objectively it will easily be recognised that to proceed with the Bill would be premature.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I want the Government's position to be clear.  The question of adopting a prohibition system on the lines of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome instead of the exisiting control of abuse system in the Restrictive Practices Acts remains open as far as the <Col N="501" /> Government are concerned.  We have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Fair Trade Commission were asked to examine this question as a result of discussions here just over a year ago.  They have addressed themselves to this task and will be reporting during the year.  Having set the task for them, can we not wait to see the results of their deliberations?  That is the position of the Government.  Wait for the facts to be in.  Take no hasty and unnecessary leap in the dark.  The Bill is not appropriate now, and the Government are clearly opposed to it.</P>

      <P>This evening a very clear question is being asked of this House. Do we accept the principle of creating a competitive environment which can foster its own dynamism, increase its output, streamline its operations and, most of all, create jobs or do we still adhere to the old protectionist ways?  It appears that the Government still adhere to them.  Adherence ro these ways have resulted in stagnation, a lethargic environment, no job creation and the haemorrhage of our highly skilled people through emigration.  There is no mystery about what the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill sets out to do.  It definitely is not a hostage to any ideological viewpoint.  We are all agreed in this House that we want to see a thriving economy but do we have the courage to create the framework that would unleash into our economy the competitive forces which already exist throughout Europe?  I would point out to the Minister that this is not a time for sitting on the fence or pretending to acknowledge what is necessary and simply doing nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate we have been given many examples of areas where there is no competition, where cartels operate and price fixing is rampant. These range over the whole gamut of our domestic economy.  To maintain the <i>status quo</i> would be a recipe for disaster <Col N="502" /> and would cause our economy to become irrelevant in the context of a growing European economy.  There are many areas where no competition exists. Take, for example, the area of freight transport.  As we are all aware, most of our goods are transported by road and sea &mdash; some 90 per cent of them.  A large percentage of these goods is now being exported via Northern Ireland.  This is largely as a result of the cartel of B &amp; I and Sealink charging exorbitant rates and operating restrictive practices in respect of freight shipment.  This has caused a large number of hauliers to look elsewhere and, unfortunately, they are being accommodated elsewhere on this island. The State through its control of B &amp; I allowed this monopoly to stagnate, to become cumbersome and extremely inefficient. This eventually led to job losses.  We now hear of the streamlining of operations, of forward planning, effective efficiency and productivity levels, all very laudable in their own way and necessary but is it not too little, too late, given that so many members of the workforce have lost their jobs?  What would have happened if this company had been faced with competition during the past number of years?  Would this problem have arisen and would huge losses have been incurred?  I believe they would not if real competition existed in the marketplace and the Government stopped bailing out a badly run organisation costing the taxpayer millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Because of our island status within the EC this is probably one of the most important areas in the development of our economy, yet the Government have still not got their act together.  This will only begin to happen when this House begins to pass the type of legislation before it this evening.  Wanting something to happen and setting about doing it are two different things.  While the Government have been lucky in many ways and have enjoyed a unique consensus in this House they have shown a complete lack of imagination when it comes to the bringing forward of legislation which would fundamentally change the way in which our economy operates.</P>
    <P>As we speak in this House tonight <Col N="503" /> there is turmoil in the bakery industry. The price war which has broken out and which is being led by a major supermarket chain is a clear example of anti-competitive behaviour and an abuse of its dominant position.  This price war not alone affects the price of a loaf of bread but also the foundation of the bakery industry.  The Minister has refused to answer any questions put to him by members of this party in this House.  It is wrong and unjust that one company because of their favourable position in the marketplace could effectively bring the Irish milling industry to its knees through the importation of large amounts of flour from the UK.  Also, the huge range of small bakeries throughout the country are unable to compete in what is a very false market.  I accept rationalisation is needed but surely the Government are not announcing that this should be the model used for any rationalisation undertaken in the future.  This is abuse of a dominant position and is not what is meant by fair competition in the marketplace. Their activities show the uselessness of the existing legislation and the urgent need for a Bill such as the one before us here this evening.  Surely at this late hour it should be possible for the Government and Opposition parties to see reason.  The very practices this Bill seeks to outlaw are occurring outside the gates of this House tonight.</P>
    <P>This Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill affects everybody in this country and is, therefore, very fundamental legislation which can bring direct benefits to the people we are supposed to represent in this Dáil.  Do this Government really want this country to be part of Europe in the fullest sense, or is it just a case of making the right noises to ensure that the few bob is thrown in our direction?  On numerous occasions I have heard various Ministers extol the virtues of other countries, such as Denmark, and they are held up to us as the shining light, the example for us all to follow, but words alone did not make these countries strong.  Clear planning and determination by legislative action was the key to a change of fortune.</P>
    <P>The attitude of this Government to an <Col N="504" /> integrated Europe is shrouded in mystery and it is done deliberately to cloak their inability to formulate a clear set of objectives. The Progressive Democrats are not prepared to sit back and see this happen. We want a competitive and dynamic economy operating on the domestic market as well as the international market.  If the two are not operating in tandem, then our chances of success are totally marginalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last week went into great detail about what he termed the drafting errors of the Bill before us tonight, at the same time totally ignoring the principle of what was being established and the appalling lack of legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at some of the points raised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The first point is the future of the Fair Trade Commision.  My answer is a very simple one; of course the Fair Trade Commission will have a future role and, indeed an enhanced role.  The Minister also questions whether his power to make restrictive practices orders will be retained.  I and my party would agree that on balance the Minister should retain this power, but again this can clearly be set out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the major smokescreens that has been thrown up by the Minister, and we have seen numbers of backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies slotted in here to perpetrate this myth, is that this Bill will impose a huge cost in time and manpower on the State.  This is simply not true and well the Minister knows it.  This Bill quite clearly seeks to allow an individual or a small company or indeed an association, to take direct action through the courts against any company by whom they feel they have been severely damaged without having to utilise the State apparatus to do so.</P>
    <P>The other concern is that a large number of companies will be involved in expensive litigation.  I put it to the Minister that if this Bill was implemented and a clear general prohibition on anti-competitive practices introduced in Irish law, then companies would desist from abusing their position in the marketplace, in the full knowledge that if they did not do so, they would be open to paying <Col N="505" /> substantial damages to injured parties. This is one of the principles that this Bill establishes and the Minister knows the desirability of this course of action.  Is the Minister seriously trying to suggest that in a small country such as ours we want to have two separate economies, one subject to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, which of course is the dynamic end of our economy, and the other subject to a different set of rules?  How can he and State agencies be treated seriously when they tour this country, and constantly hark on the theme of getting Irish domestic industries operative in the international market and at the same time here this evening give them no opportunity of preparing for the forces and laws which they will be subject to?  This is the most ridiculous and indefensible argument that I have ever heard put forward.</P>
    <P>One thing we have really seen established in this debate is this Government's real attitude to an integrated Europe. They simply have no conception of what it is about and no real desire to allow this country to become part of a new, integrated dynamic Community.  This is a disastrous state of affairs and raises many serious questions beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government and all the parties in this House know full well that the vast majority of Bills brought before this House are altered, it is hoped for the better, on Committee Stage.  Take, for example, the Companies Bill, which is before this House at present and has already been through the Seanad.  We have already seen hundreds of amendments made to that Bill, all of them necessary and in the interests of better legislation.  Is the Minister prepared to state here this evening that this Bill was badly drafted by a full staff of parliamentary draftsmen?  Of course it was not.  It simply took the course of all Bills brought to this House.  The principle of what the Companies Bill set out to do is still intact, and I put it to the House tonight that that is what we are trying to establish with this Bill.  We must give clear signals from this building to our economy and set down in no uncertain <Col N="506" /> terms the type of environment we want to see created.</P>
    <P>I assure this Government that the Progressive Democrats will hound them until we see some concrete proposals emanating from them and they will not be allowed to put this country into reverse because of their own ineptitude.  During this debate we also saw the true colours of this Government come to the fore, namely, their real desire for absolute dictatorial power which has always been a feature of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Where, I would like to ask them, does it state in the Consititution that legislation is the sole prerogative of the Government?  It is not, it is the sole prerogative of the Oireachtas, that goes for every man and woman in this Parliament, and no Government, and especially a Fianna Fáil Government, will be allowed to usurp that position.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at the role of the leftwing parties, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, the men who would have us all believe that they have cornered the market on protecting the weak individuals in our society.  How will they ever be able to justify not supporting this Bill when it quite clearly sets out to look after the small man, the man in the street, the small shopkeeper?  This Bill would remove them from the margins and give them a very definite role centre stage in the full range of business.</P>
    <P>If that was achieved, what would they have to shout about?  Their irrelevance to developing Ireland would be complete. I would suggest that the Labour Party should join up with their colleagues in the United Kingdom in walking off the cliff into the abyss.  They are now completely out of step with the whole Socialist movement and indeed Communist movement throughout the world who have taken a new and enlightened look at the whole operation of the world economy. The Labour Party of this country have not done so.  No, for them the people of this country cannot have real jobs, cannot play a real role in society, cannot operate in the real world.  It is only right, in their view, it if fits in with some monolithic ideology which is about as relevant today as goods being transported around the world by sailing ships. <Col N="507" /> I have given this consideration and it strikes me that this island is too big for them.  They would rather have something the size of Rockall which would allow them to put their slogans on top of it and have mutual admiration societies while the rest of the country underneath stagnates, decays and falls away.  How will they and this Government justify their stance to the consumers' association and to the ordinary people?  They will not be able to do so because there is absolutely no justification for their shameful behaviour here this evening.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the Consumers' Association of Ireland's news release circulated today.  They say about this Bill, that it</P>
    <P>...is a most welcome contribution in the law relating to Irish consumers as well as offering protection to many small and less powerful enterprises in the Irish marketplace.  It is also timely in that it proposes to set the posture of Irish business in good shape for the completion of the internal market in 1992.</P>
    <P>This night can be clearly marked down as the night when the tide turned on the Government and no amount of dam-building will keep the tide from going out, in its own relentless way.  The people are beginning to see through the negative and unimaginative approach that Fianna Fáil have in Government and, in particular, the young people are quite rightly not prepared to put up with it.  The great tragedy about this debate is that the Government know that the legislation is going to have to come into Irish domestic law, and no doubt when the Government <Col N="508" /> in the UK make their changes, our Government will once again be tripping over themselves trying to follow suit. But, surely, this is all so unnecessary. Have we not matured enough in this Dáil to operate in a responsible and constructive manner?</P>
    <P>By recognising what is worthwhile, we simply cannot walk away from this type of legislation and a huge range of other vital legislation.  The lessons learned in this debate must be taken on board by the Government.  They will not be allowed to continue in such an irresponsible and obstructive manner.  The country simply does not have the time to await the grace and favour of Fianna Fáil.  There are new challenges and new opportunities open to us.  For the sake of our young people facing emigration, can we not for once get this House in order and do right for the people?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will continue to bring forward a full and relevant legislative programme.  We, more than any other party in this House, have brought an imaginative and constructive approach to business and we will not be deterred.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Fine Gael Party for their support and recognising the importance of this Bill and the urgent need for its passing into Irish domestic law.  The enterprise Bill we have discussed for the last two weeks gives the Government the opportunity to utilise the consensus they have been given in this House and this party will not be deterred from responsible action.  I am proud to have had the opportunity to move the Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Before the commencement of Private Members' Business I reported progress on the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party Deputies which seeks to delete section 6 (2) (a).  My purpose in proposing the deletion of this paragraph is that I feel what is intended here is the privatisation of the regulation of building control and the compliance with building control regulations.  As I said earlier, this is the core of the Bill; it is what the Bill is all about.  It is proposed under this section that the Minister will have the power to make regulations which will enable the designers or builders of buildings to certify that the buildings are in compliance with regulations.  There is no obligation on the building authority or the control authority, which is in effect the local authority, to inspect a building to ensure that it is in compliance with the regulations.  There is an obligation on the local authority to provide a certificate of approval for the buildings.  Despite the fact that there is no obligation on them to inspect buildings they will have the <Col N="516" /> option to do so if they choose.  I would ask the Minister what building authority, control authority or local authority would in their sane minds inspect a building and then perhaps have to carry the liability thereafter if something is wrong with it?</P>
      <P>It has to be said also that the building industry is not one that has demonstrated its capacity to comply with regulations or indeed to build buildings which are entirely sound.  In my constituency in Finglas south in the region of 1,800 houses were built in 1972-73 under what was known as the low cost building scheme. In the early 'seventies there was quite a furore about the fact that the roofs on many of these buildings were shifting. The tenants of the buildings found it extremely difficult to pin down who precisely was responsible for this.  The matter was never satisfactorily resolved although the local authority did step in to restore the roofs in some way.  In some cases they had to take the roofs off completely and replace them with new roofs and in other cases they had to insert steel girders to keep the roofs from falling off completely.  Similar schemes were operated in other parts of the country, in Mayfield and Togher in Cork and in other local authority areas.  Houses were built under a low cost scheme for the local authority.  From that example alone it is clear that it is not possible to depend entirely on the self-certification system to ensure that the design of buildings is in compliance with the regulations.  For that reason I am not happy that section 6 (2) (a) should remain in place.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Bill enables the Minister to choose between self-certification and certification by local authorities.  It has to be said that there was a clear indication by Government in 1982 that self-certification was the direction in which they were going.  There has been no indication by anybody on the Government benches, either this Government or the previous one, that they have changed their minds in that regard.  There are no good grounds for believing that self-certification is in the interests of the people, whether they be ordinary householders or people who may eventually buy the variety of buildings that will be built under this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite interesting that there appears <Col N="517" /> to be some moves afoot to exempt two-storey buildings entirely from certification. That again would be a serious matter given that the vast majority of faults with buildings in the State, even under the present system of by-law approval, occur with household buildings, buildings which people either buy or rent, usually two-storey buildings.  That is a clear indication that we cannot trust self-certification.  Basically, that is my argument.</P>
    <P>I would turn again to the fact that the Stardust Tribunal made it clear that they did not think it possible to trust the industry to involve themselves in self-certification as regards fire regulations.  The Minister has taken that on board because he clearly gives the building authorities the right to inspect buildings and to issue certificates stating that they are in order. The Minister appears to be going along with the idea of self-certification for all other matters.  I would argue that it is as important to ensure that structures are sound as it is to ensure that the fire safety of buildings is sound.</P>

      <P>Before I hear another speaker may I have the understanding and co-operation of the Members, in dealing with section 6 and amendment No. 12 in the name of the Minister, that we discuss all the other amendments to the Minister's amendment, that is to say, amendment a1 in the name of Deputy De Rossa and others, amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Michael Keating and others, amendment 1a in the name of Deputy De Rossa and others, amendment No. 2 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 3 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 6 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 7 in the names of Deputies Keating and Quinn, amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies De Rossa, Mac Giolla, Sherlock and McCartan and amendment No. 9 in the names of Deputies De Rossa, Mac Giolla, Sherlock and McCartan?  I suggest therefore that we discuss these <Col N="518" /> amendments to the Minister's amendment and we can of course have separate decisions as required thereon.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>The House would agree that section 6 is the core of this Bill. All of us, no matter what our private professional expertise, are aware of the complexity of the legislation and of the fact that the substantial and indeed improved amendment which the Minister has tabled and which replaces section 6 has to a certain extent added to the complexity.  While I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy De Rossa &mdash; I can understand the concerns of people working within the local authority system, as a former employee of a local authority &mdash; it should be very clear what this Bill proposes to do at this point and what subsection (2) (a) proposes to do. This is essentially enabling legislation. Since the building regulations were first published in 1979-80 there have been about seven or eight Ministers for the Environment and, therefore, this is not a Flynn Bill.</P>

      <P>Some, like the curate's egg.  What we are deciding here is if this House should give to the Minister for the Environment of the day the range of options in terms of legislative powers to provide for the regulation of construction in this country by means of self certification, by means of a certificate of approval and by means of a fire certificate or any combination of all three.  Should the Minister be so given that flexibility and make regulations accordingly to put that power into effect and those regulations being required to be annulled or subject to some kind of scrutiny &mdash; albeit not a very good one &mdash; in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments marshalled against this <Col N="519" /> flexibility &mdash; I am speaking against Deputy De Rossa on this &mdash; and the principle of self certification is a long way away from some of the proposed methods of operation.  There is a big difference.  I have no difficulty with the principle of self certification.  Our State has no difficulty with the principle of self certification. The Revenue Commissioners, I would argue, accept the principle of self certification by professionals, i.e., properly recognised chartered public accountants and chartered accountants submit accounts which the Revenue Commissioners can scrutinise.  They basically accept the word of a bona fide certifier, in this instance, a chartered accountant. The Revenue Commissioners have an informal list of accountants whose signatures would attract scrutiny rather than allow a set of accounts to go through.  No doubt in time that could be the case in local authorities.  As we get down to dealing with this section, perhaps we should talk about how that kind of early warning system could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa quoted the findings of the Stardust Tribunal in relation to that terrible tragedy, the eighth anniversary of which occurred yesterday. Some people would argue that only a local authority should be responsible for-certifying and approving the construction of a building and that if that scrutiny is removed there could be tragedies such as the Stardust.  I do not want to trade on the deaths that resulted from the Stardust tragedy but that is the thrust of Deputy De Rossa's argument &mdash; if I understood him &mdash; and certainly the thrust of the briefing document I received from some officials and members of the transport union.  The reality is that the Stardust night club had by-law and fire officer approval.  I do not want to be accused of special pleading because I am here as a Labour Party Deputy who also happens to be an architect.  The real tragedy is that that building was not designed and executed by a properly qualified professional. I will deal with that point when we come to deal with the revised section 6 (2) (f) which reads: &ldquo;the designation of <Col N="520" /> the persons or the classes of persons by whom certificates of compliance may be given,...&rdquo;  The problem at present &mdash; subject to correction &mdash; is that even in the seven or eight local authorities throughout the country which have local by-law ordinances and requirements anybody can apply.  In the remaining part of the country there are no by-laws whatsoever. The regulatory control is very uneven.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa argued that the Stardust Tribunal found that somehow or other a system of individual control by the designer aggravated the fire problem. If that building was not designed in that particular way it would not have burned in the extraordinary fast manner in which it did.  We know about the rest of the findings.  The point I want to make &mdash; and I say this with all due respects to Deputy De Rossa &mdash; is that that building went through the kind of local authority approval system that he seeks to preserve exclusively.  Therefore, to argue that self certification would open the door to more Stardust type tragedies is not logical.</P>
    <P>It has taken us about ten years to get to where we are now.  The building regulations alone took an enormous length of time to draft and we are still stalled in terms of how we would administer those building regulations notwithstanding the publication of the codes of practice the Minister talked about yesterday.  They are simply that as he rightly admitted on television.  I made this point at a construction conference which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions held over the weekend.  If any other sector of industry, for example the food industry, had remained in limbo for a period of eight years with regard to regulations governing the costs, the operation, the specification and standards for their industry there would be outrage and uproar.  That is what is happening in regard to building products.</P>
    <P>We should give to the Minister of the day the flexibility to decide what is most appropriate to the industry, to the community and to the local authorities throughout the country and at the outset of this legislation to propose &mdash; as Deputy De Rossa does &mdash; to remove a major area of option.  I and my party have many <Col N="521" /> reservations about the way in which self certification would work.  We have thoughts on that matter and we will elaborate on them.  To argue at the outset that irrespective of what other system of approval we may have, we will not have any form of self certification seems to be wrong.  Given the history of this legislation and the various attempts at getting it onto the floor of this House, we still have a long way to go before the system will be operational and in place.  Therefore, I conclude it will be a long time before we get back to Leinster House to do the next Building Control Bill.  It would be a mistake &mdash; and I say this in all sincerity to Deputy De Rossa &mdash; to remove from any Minister for the Environment the option we have been referring to.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of the officials who have been involved in briefing us effectively.  I have expressed to them the reservations I am now putting on the record of the House.  The principle of self certification which is embodied in section 6 (2) (a) is one which should not be thrown out.  The standards by which it is administered and the safeguards which are built into it are matters for very extensive legitimate debate.  For that reason I cannot accept the thrust of The Workers' Party amendment in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a comment in relation to the discussion that is taking place.  I share the view of Deputy Quinn.  It seems to be unreasonable to seek to fetter the Minister in such a way that he would not be able to introduce the proposal contained in (2) (a) of section 6 of the Bill.  I do not believe the right way to go about matters is to seek to remove an enabling possibility from a Bill such as this where it is quite probable that the implications would be to place such an onus on local authorities.  They simply would not be able to cope and the whole of the desired system of checks, which one wants to put in place, would fall apart completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ensure that self certification works.  I do not blame people for having certain reservations about self certification as it has operated in a variety of areas over many years.  That is not <Col N="522" /> an argument against the principle of self certification, it is simply an argument against the slipshod way in which it has operated in some areas.  Without dealing with it in great detail, because Deputy Quinn has made the points extremely well, so far as I am concerned, this is a facility and an option the Minister should have.  It is practicable and reasonable and it is also in accordance with the philosophy my party would be putting forward.  There is room for honest professional people in this business.  There will always be a number of people who are unscrupulous in these matters.  It is up to all of us here to devise a way to ensure that those who would abuse such an opportunity would find that it does not pay because apparently up to now it did pay.  We will simply be burying our heads in the sand if we insist that local authorities certify every stage of the development and the various standards that should be in place.  It will not work as local authorities simply could not cope with that workload and it is totally unrealistic to suggest that they would.</P>
    <P>We must adopt the principle of self certification and ensure that it will operate properly and that there will be proper sanctions in force.  It is a reasonable subsection to have in the Bill as something that could be introduced or may be made available in the context of the building control regulations and the Minister will have the power to provide that arrangement if he sees fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the last two speakers on the matter of self certification. This complex legislation is extremely important.  We should not tie the Minister's hands at the beginning of the process to improve the legislation thus avoiding what happened in the past and ensuring it will never happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made a point on the problem connected with the certification of houses, especially low cost housing. Certainly, we had similar problems in our local authority area to the extent that second grants have been paid after ten or 11 years to improve the non-standard houses provided originally.  The certification process in itself is a step forward <Col N="523" /> and will ensure that somebody is responsible for the decision made.</P>
    <P>All members of the House would like to see the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal implemented.  I do not know whether all the recommendations can be implemented in full.  To date most of the recommendations have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>I would query if the right people in the local authorities have the final say on fire regulations.  County engineers have the final say and as far as I am aware the fire officers have to answer to the county engineers.  We are introducing rules and regulations that procedures must be followed but are we satisfied that the local authorities will ensure to the best of their ability that the right people are dealing with the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate any further on this aspect of the section.  In fact, Deputy Quinn summed up quite nicely what is involved in the section.  I am seeking only enabling powers &mdash; the regulations will come later &mdash; which will allow me to do the right thing, whatever that may seem to be, not just for me but for Ministers of the Environment who may make arrangements later on.  I have to tell Deputy De Rossa that I am not asking the House to leave matters totally in the hands of the Minister but I must point out that the Building Regulations Advisory Body is an important element of the legislation. I have not decided precisely who will be represented on the board but, obviously, architects, engineers, the construction industry, the local authorities and others will be represented.  I have not a closed mind on the composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that people who are directly concerned with the construction industry and how it might progress to the end of the century should be in a position to advise me as to the type of certification that would apply in various circumstances and not just where the by-laws apply. Consequently, it would be appropriate that the Minister should have a free hand at this stage and have the enabling powers to devise the procedures that would best serve the situation over the years.  I <Col N="524" /> cannot force anybody to accept that point of view.  All I can say is that the situation is not pre-determined and that the options are all laid out.  If the House gives me the enabling power the regulations can be made and the advice will be there for all to see.  It might very well transpire as time goes on that there may have to be alterations in the legislation.  I do not want to have to come back to the House, because I do not think we will be discussing building control legislation for a number of years.  Why tie ourselves with a rigidity that will cause problems down the road?  For that reason if I cannot convince Deputy De Rossa that this is the wise thing to do I ask him to press his point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by what I heard from the Minister or the spokespersons from Labour, the Progressive Democrats or the Fine Gael parties. To be honest, I find the attitudes of the other Opposition parties odd.  Earlier, when we were debating the Video Recordings Bill, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats Party spokespersons were quite unhappy about giving the Minister for Justice a wide brief.  In fact, similar terminology was used in the Video Recordings Bill as is used in this Bill.  I am not going to debate the Video Recordings Bill, a Cheann Comhairle, but I am making the point that there seems to be a difference in emphasis between the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue that it is far more important that we have specific regulations and that we give specific powers to the Minister to do what this House wants him to do rather than giving him the freedom to choose any number of different options on the advice of an advisory body which he appoints or sacks at will.  I do not accept that this is adequate, or an appropriate way to deal with the very important issue of building control, when the Bill does not include any proviso that the certifiers carry insurance.  At the end of the day, who will pay if there is a fault in the building?  The certifier, who may be a person of the utmost competence, if he has any business sense will set up a limited company which can fold at the first whiff of being sued for damages.  Will <Col N="525" /> the local authority be held responsible because they have issued an approval certificate arising from the certification? There is a whole range of issues that have been only touched upon or in fact ignored by the Opposition parties.  I find it quite odd that I am the only one who is raising these issues.</P>
    <P>We are giving the Minister very wide powers as to how buildings in towns and cities will be provided for generations to come.  I have had appeals not only from the Minister but from the spokesperson for the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fine Gael Party urging that we give the Minister an enabling framework so that he can choose the options in any given set of circumstances.  I do not accept that that is adequate.  With regard to the Stardust, Deputy Quinn claimed that I had made the point that the construction of the Stardust was to blame for the tragedy and because that structure had been approved by the local authority, that undermined my case.  My point was that despite the fact that the structure and the fire regulations were approved by the local authority, the tragedy still occurred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn with his professional expertise may be able to claim that the design of the building was partly to blame, but my reading of the situation was that the tragedy occurred because of the materials used for covering the ceiling and the furniture and because the exits were locked.  That had nothing to do with the design of the building.  Perhaps if the building did not have a roof or had a whole range of other devices the tragedy would not have been so vast, but I do not accept that as an argument in favour of self-certification.  We are, unfortunately likely to see a multiplication of that kind of tragedy if we go down the road of self-certification.</P>
    <P>The building construction industry is a cutthroat business.  No matter how honest or competent a certifier may be he will come under extreme pressure. The local authority will not have the power to watch the watchdog.  They may have the choice to do so, but they will not have the power or the resources. Part of the argument of the Minister in relation to this Bill is that local authorities <Col N="526" /> do not have the resources and therefore we have to go for self-certification.  We are giving the local authority the power to inspect but there is no obligation on them to inspect, and if they do not inspect they cannot be held responsible for not inspecting.  Who is to look after the interests of the householder or factory owner who has had a building built on his behalf?  All these points have to be teased out honestly.  I am astounded at the attitude of the Opposition parties to this section.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of insurance, why is there no provision for insurance in the Bill?  We have proposed an amendment to section 6:</P>
    <P>After subsection (6), to insert the following subsection: &ldquo;(7) Persons or classes of persons submitting certificates of compliance shall submit to the building control authority evidence that they hold professional indemnity insurance appropriate to the building being certified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If something like that is not provided for in this Bill what right of redress has anybody in the case of a defective building? Who can he claim against?  Perhaps we will get some answers to those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has made a constructive intervention.  I certainly support the amendment in the name of Deputy De Rossa and The Workers' Party in relation to insurance. If we are deciding in principle to legislate to provide a framework within which the building control regulations can be best administered we should have provision for self-certification.  The standards and safeguards can be discussed down the line on the section.  I have confined my remarks primarily to subsection (2) (a). I put it to the Minister that in the UK, whose system has a lot in common with our building industry in that a lot of the structures industry and standards are similar to ours, it is argued by some people that the possibility of self-certification was considered and rejected by the British authorities because it was considered to be illegal nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued by people opposed to the <Col N="527" /> principle of self-certification in any form that the Bill proposes to make a breach of building regulations a criminal offence and, therefore it is argued, that any designer who signs a drawing would have to sign the certificate of compliance and that failure to sign would be self-incriminating. I do not know if the Minister and his advisers are familiar with that argument or with the position in the UK, but it is that argument that is informing a lot of the opposition against self-certification in principle.  That is one of the concerns that has been expressed and I would like to have the Minister's position in relation to the UK experience in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disappointed if Deputy De Rossa persisted in equating the possibility of self-certification with a multiplicity of tragedies that might take place.  That is not in the best interests of reasoned debate.  There is no substance in the argument.  The Deputy cannot give any concrete evidence that self-certification would result in anything like the kind of tragedies he suggests.  The Deputy obviously has decided that he does not wish to see any element of self-certification in so far as an option available to the Minister is concerned.  It is a basic principle of the legislation that that option must be maintained by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Of course, the building regulations advisory body can be disposed of and new people can be added to it.  Another Minister might have people whom he would like to see represented but I have given an assurance this evening that the people who will be represented will be people with a direct interest in the building and construction industry and not just people on one side of the argument.  It is legitimate to believe that such people would have a reasoned position to make to a Minister by way of advice, but it is not mandatory on the Minister to accept that advice.  To seek to change the whole thrust of the legislation is unacceptable. If I was to concede what the Deputy is asking I might as well recast the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>Wait a moment.  Let us come to the position that those who are duly qualified in any professional discipline can be accepted as being responsible until proved otherwise.  The Deputy's suggestion that there is something inferior in a form of certification by self-certification, as distinct from that which is already in position, seems to be an attempt to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for a reason he let out in his initial submission &mdash; that he was pressing a particular union's point of view.  I do not mind the Deputy pressing a union's point of view, but the enabling legislation we are promoting here is a set of options available to any Minister irrespective of party.  If the self-certification system was chosen as the control system, that does not mean that the local authority would have no controlling function at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 gives the local authority power to serve enforcement notices if a building does not comply with the regulations, so they are not being squeezed out.  I get the very strong impression from the Deputy that there is some kind of veiled threat to do away with the existing system in favour of the privatisation of the whole certification process.  One cannot substantiate that argument because all the options are listed in the various paragraphs of section 6 (2).  I am not asking the House to do away with a system or to adopt an alternative system in isolation to others.  What I am saying is that the approval system can be operated by the local authorities and they are <Col N="529" /> responsible in the way in which they do their business.  Other options are self-certification by a designer or builder or the fire services arrangement.  I am asking the House at this stage, as a principle, to accept that the options set out in this section are reasonable ones for a Minister to ask for in enabling legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the local authorities power to inspect a building at any stage during construction or even following the completion of a building.  So, it is not true to imply that because self-certification might be applied as a method, the local authority will have no function beyond that.  Of course they will have a function and they will have a controlling function in the whole business.  There are circumstances where self-certification might suit better and for that reason I am asking the House to give me the enabling power to consider all the options and to seek advice from the industry and the professionals attached to the industry so that, having received that advice I can make the best possible decision.  I cannot concede the point the Deputy has made because otherwise it would change the whole thrust of the principles enunciated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister is not prepared to do that.  I want to take up the point in relation to the trade union view.  I have had the trade union point of view represented to me and I am sure other Deputies have also had that point of view represented to them.  I have also had the architects' point of view, although to a lesser extent for some reason or other, represented to me in relation to this Bill but my primary interest and concern has nothing to do with whether it is a trade union view or otherwise.  My primary concern is that there would be an independent body who would be responsible for certifying the construction and design of buildings and the safety of buildings in relation to fires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-certification effectively means that the person who designs or constructs a building certifies that it is okay and that is complies with the regulations.  The local authority can, if they so wish, send inspectors out at any time during the <Col N="530" /> course of the construction of a building to check if A, B or C is being done in accordance with the designs or plans.  The question I asked, and the Minister has not addressed this yet, is what liability the local authority will take on board by sending out an inspector in those circumstances. If a local authority send out an inspector at, say, the foundation stage and he does not make any recommendation in relation to the foundations but issues a statement to the effect that he has inspected the foundation but subsequently the foundations are found to be faulty, will the local authority be liable for the foundations in those circumstances or will the certifier who issued a certificate when the building was completed that the building complied with the regulations be liable?  I am asking what liability the local authority will take on board by sending out an inspector during the course of the construction. Are the local authorities taking on liability and if they are not, what is the point in carrying out an inspection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The quick response to that question is that if the local authority decide at any time to have a look at what is being done, whether or not approval is granted under self certification, they can inspect the building at any stage.  If they find that the building does not comply with the regulations they can serve the enforcement notice and if that notice is not complied with they will have recourse to the courts.  They will have the full power of the legislation to demand that the building complies with the standards and the regulations as set down.  I do not see any difficulty in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a running fine of £150 per day for every day one is deliberately in breach of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the breach continues, substantial fines are set out in the penalties included in the bill.  The local authority can at any time use the enforcement procedure and have a case decided by the court and the court will then have the opportunity of determining the level of the penalty to be applied.  I do not think there is any difficulty there.  It is <Col N="531" /> not a residual power attached to the local authorities; it is a fundamental element of the powers attached to them under sections 7 and 10 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter. It is a related matter but it deals with insurance and we will come to that in due course.  It is related but so far as I am concerned it is importantly different. What we are talking about is whether the local authority are the agency who should grant the approval or whether self certification should be put in place.  Whether or which does not matter in so far as getting the job done properly is concerned. The local authority have always had the power to see to it that the regulations are being complied with.</P>

      <P>The point I raised did not relate to the situation where the local authority, through an inspection, finds a building to be faulty, makes an enforcement order and the builder or whoever challenges that in court and there is a legal decision one way or the other.  My point is that if an inspector goes out and inspects some stage of a building and is satisfied that it is okay and subsequently a certifier certifies that the building complies with the regulations and a certificate of approval is issued but in one, five or ten years time a fault is found in that building will the local authority share the liability arising from that inspection?  That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the House I want to offer some professional experience in relation to this matter, fortunately not from the bar of the court. The reinforced concrete panels used in a number of buildings which passed the building regulations were defective but defects did not appear until after the buildings failed.  I am talking about buildings in the vicinity of St. Stephen's Green.  The panels were not constructed strictly in accordance with the minimum standards and specifications set out in the <Col N="532" /> regulations even though the local authority had granted by-law approval for them.  In those cases the aggrieved or institutional owner of the building sued everyone and anyone bar the local authority in the civil courts.  The people sued included the building design team, from the architect to the engineer and anybody else, the main building contractor and the sub-contractor.  In terms of whether &mdash; I think this is the thrust of Deputy De Rossa's point and I support the thrust even though I think it is misplaced &mdash; the local authority grant or withhold building by-law approval, or in this case building regulation approval once the Bill comes into effect, is no guarantee, as I read the Bill, and &mdash; perhaps the Minister can clarify this for me &mdash; in the event of a defect emerging in a building sometime in the future a private owner so aggrieved will be able to make a claim for negligence against a local authority in respect of that building, if, for example, under the present system under section 6 subsection (2) (c) a certificate of approval was in operation rather than a self certificate. If the method of administration of the building regulations was to be under subsection (2) (c), if a certificate of approval was issued by a local authority to the effect that building ABC was designed in accordance with the building regulations and five years down the road that building failed, the cause of the failure being clearly substandard construction, clearly in breach of the regulations, if there was some area of negligence within the local authority, my understanding &mdash; and I am subject to correction on this &mdash; is that the aggrieved private citizen's target of action would not be the local authority.  Whatever redress the private citizen would have would be against the design team and the contracting team that put the building in place.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is saying that a certificate of approval system administered by a local authority, which is another option that we propose to give to the Minister in this section, does not place any liability on the local authority, then we are not being even-handed in the way in which we are proposing in principle to deal with the system of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Perhaps the Minister may want to consider that point, or take advice on it. Deputy De Rossa is right to raise it. Whoever signs a self-certificate of compliance will be legally liable whether he is professionally qualified or has professional indemnity insurance.  A person of no substance may be involved.  So the civil case may result in no satisfaction to the individual involved.  In legal terms that person will be liable.  If he has professional indemnity insurance, that would be some cover.  The liability, which is the net issue, would be clearly attached to the person who signs the certificate that the building was built in accordance with the building regulations which, in turn, require minimum standards of safety.  It is fair to ask &mdash; and this is the substance of one of the points that Deputy De Rossa is making &mdash; if that implicit and explicit liability attaches to a private individual who signs a certificate of compliance, does not exactly the same degree of liability attach to a local authority who operate an approval certificate system under subsection (2) (c)?  Does the same degree of liability apply to Meath County Council for example, if they decide that they want to use that system of approval?  That is something which should be clarified, if not now, certainly during the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point.  One would have to say that the whole question of liability would be a matter for the courts, anyway.  I am not so sure that it would be proper even to give any lead in so far as where that liability might lie at this stage but I cannot envisage any liability attaching to a building control authority simply because they inspected a building.  It might very well be that if the authority, in carrying out the inspection, negligently overlook something and it is subsequently discovered that that negligence led to some other difficulty, then there might be a percentage of liability attached to the authority that carried out the inspection but it would be a very grey area.  It would certainly not be an area that we should discuss in any great depth here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn has rightly said, when these things happen the writs fly <Col N="534" /> everywhere.  What would be hoped to be achieved would be that one would stick somewhere.  Invariably, the history has been that it usually has stuck with the designer and the contractor, or both together.  Often they might be in one and the same situation.  There would certainly be some kind of collaboration or co-operation between the designer and the developer. We know the case to which the Deputy refers and that is where the liability fell there.  The fabric had to be restored and the panels replaced.  It was not at the cost of the local authority that had given the approval originally for the building to be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be proper to discuss either insurance or the liability attached to court actions taken because of mistakes made, from whatever source, in this Chamber, even on this section of the Bill.  We are not talking about the question of liability, which will obviously have to be determined by the courts.</P>

      <P>The question of liability is a serious matter for a person investing his life's savings or work in buying a house.  If after two or three years of living in that house he discover that the roof has shifted two inches, who is liable?  The question must be asked because it seems, from documentation that I have read, that the Minister's Department are proposing to exempt private housing completely from control. Who is going to be responsible?  We are talking about a serious situation.  Where does the buck stop?  The whole matter is entirely unsatisfactory.  I am not a professional person, an architect, a lawyer, a quantity surveyor, but I am seriously concerned about the direction in which <Col N="535" /> this Bill is taking us.  We are giving, not just this Minister &mdash; because he could be replaced tomorrow and the Government could be replaced next week or year; we do not know who will be in the Minister's place in six weeks' or six months' time or 16 years' time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It does not make any difference effectively but we do not know who will be making the decisions. We are talking about giving the Minister the right to decide between various options the consequences of which we do not know.  I am not satisfied that this is being dealt with as up front as it should be.  The question as to liability is an important one.</P>
      <P>The local authority, or the building control authority as they will be called, will be required to issue approval certificates and the person providing the building will be required to issue compliance certificates while at the same time the local authority will not be obliged to check whether or not the compliance certificate is factual, whether the certificate claiming that the conditions are correct, with regard to the walls, the roof, the various fittings, the insulation and a whole range of items, is accurate.  The local authority under section 6 (2) have no obligation to check any of these matters. They have no obligation to check that the building complies with the regulations or to ensure that the certificate complies with the regulations.  They have no obligation to check that the facts stated are true or accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we doing here tonight?  We are agreeing to give the Minister power to introduce self-certification if he is advised by an advisory body appointed by him and liable to change by him, the result and the outcome of which we do not know.  We do not know who will be liable, or who will certify, or what qualifications a person will require in order to be a self-certifier. My experience with the building industry leads me to insist that an independent building control authority should remain in place and have the absolute right to approve the buildings <Col N="536" /> from the foundations up.  I am not arguing that the authority should be absolutely under the control of the local authority.  They must be independent of the people who are designing and putting up the buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The entire essence of this Bill is control.  Control must involve some form of independent supervisory agency.  The reason this Bill is before us is that the building industry has been characterised by tragedy and mistakes, leading on occasion to great loss of life. We are trying to put in place a scheme which will last for a long time to make the construction of buildings safer for all.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party are opposed in principle to the concept of self-certification, simply because it does not involve elements of control.  The suggestion is that because the certification will be carried out by professional people there will be a response which will ensure security, control and safety.  That is not necessarily so.  Of course 99 per cent of professional people are people of integrity but being human, they are capable of making mistakes.  There is a need for an agency whose only concern is to see that standards are complied with.  We must legislate for the lowest denominator which can be identified.  We must bring everyone into the net because of the rogue operator.  There are within the ranks of all professions, including my own, people who are exposed as often at they are detected.  The building industry has a history of some discoloration.  It has perpetrated errors, intentional or otherwise, by means of using cheap materials, taking short cuts and producing generally shoddy work.  There are some buildings which should never have been erected. We must ensure that every eventuality is covered.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that professional people who are involved in on-site supervision will be subject to incredible pressures. The Minister would not be responsible if he did not recognise that the builder/developer has to meet a deadline and maintain profit margins and in many cases the only possibility of achieving his targets is by cutting corners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because it is not likely that this issue <Col N="537" /> will come before the House again for quite some time, it is suggested that this enabling provision should be included.  I have no doubt that if this section is passed the building industry will knock on the Minister's door telling him that the Act allowed him to proceed with self certification. The professional bodies representing architects, engineers and quantity surveyors would do exactly the same.  They would say it is a far more expeditious manner in which to deal with the matter.  It is to some extent understandable that they would hold that view because the delays in obtaining by-law approval from local authorities are inordinate and in some instances indefensible. We are told this is a problem of resources.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about taking another way because of lack of resources, then I am particularly worried.  Local authorities would welcome self-certfication because they would be able to cut back on their regulatory departments. They are losing employees at a colossal rate.  Dublin Corporation have shed almost 1,500 employees during the past two years, involving major reorganisation of staff.  If they could be relieved of the onus of maintaining the building by-law regulatory section they would be very happy.  They could divert finance and staff to other areas.  The local authorities, not being under any positive obligation to inspect every building operation, would close shop in this respect and there would be virtually no investigation, regulation or on-site inspection. Self-certification would be the only system in operation, without fear of interference by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think again about the introduction of this provision.  It is absolutely certain that the Minister would be subject to the most incredible pressure as a result of this enabling provision and there is no doubt that a self-certification system would be in place within a short time.  The Minister has indicated that this is his intention since he considers this to be the cornerstone of the legislation. In principle we oppose it because it will not provide for the lowest common denominator in the equation.  We must <Col N="538" /> be in a position to deal effectively with that and this legislation would not allow for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the last two speakers one would think that everyone involved in this work over the last number of years is determined not to comply with the regulations.  It has been stated that self-certification may be open to abuse.  However, I do not believe that any institution which provides finances for building, from the smallest house to the largest office block, would do so without having their own people certifying the overall work to their satisfaction.  That brings me to the next point in so far as the liability of local authorities is concerned. When problems arise, the first person to blame is the individual who signed the certificate in the first place.  Indeed, a writ may be served on a local authority if they approved and certified a particular building.  However, this legislation seems to indicate that they would be the last to be blamed.</P>
      <P>I know from dealing with people in this business that if there is a probem with certification the liability rests with the person who approved and certified the building.  Most builders are responsible and try to ensure that the job is done properly and they do not take short cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us have a certain degree of sympathy with the spirit of what the movers of the amendment are trying to achieve, a foolproof system which will legislate for good.  However, the reality is different and the last thing the country needs is more legislation which will be ignored or not enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment is put in place, the onus would then rest on local authorities to do all certification.  That is the system that operates at present and we know how woefully inadequate and unsatisfactory that system is.  It is not enforced and, therefore, if we now ask local authorities to take on the additional implicit burden outlined in the variety of subsections in the amendment, it is clear it will not be implemented.  There is no point burying our heads in the sand in that respect.  It will cause an extraordinary bureaucratic logjam in local <Col N="539" /> authorities or disparate and uneven enforcement in various parts of the country, which is the case at present in any event.  It is not a practical system as the local authorities cannot carry out many of their present functions which they are statutorily bound to do.</P>
    <P>The amendment is well intentioned but misguided.  It goes back to a very basic point.  I do not believe that the hallmark of legislation should be pinned to &mdash; as Deputy McCartan called it &mdash; the lowest common denominator.  People can be protected from the excesses of the abusers.  We should not so contrive legislation that we assume that everybody is at the abyss in terms of the work they do.  Self-regulation is a principle which essentially means that people are asked to certify that their work is right and true.  That will not work unless there are adequate controls and sanctions.  If these sanctions are severe and enforced people will be honourable in regard to self-certification. Sanctions are very important and if we go down the route of self-certification, which I believe is the collective way bearing in mind the realities in terms of local authorities, we must ensure that there will be proper enforcement.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make which the Minister might consider between now and the next time we discuss the Bill; it might remove some of the more extreme elements of self-certification and have the same ultimate goal that the removal from hard pressed local authorities of the bureaucratic, legislative and regulatory stranglehold which this proposal would have.  There should be a system of certification by qualified people, not necessarily members of local authorities, who would be asked to certify buildings or constructions in which they are not involved.  In other words, an architect, engineer or suitably qualified person might be asked to certify the work of some other profession.  There may be a suggestion that it is all one big club but it is not, no more than in any other area of economic activity.  In fairness, we must have some degree of trust in the people who operate in this professional field.</P>
    <P>One of the previous speakers referred <Col N="540" /> to the building industry's record.  On balance, in cases like this, the extreme example catches the imagination of the public and makes headlines, especially when a building is deficient.  However, the vast majority of construction is sound and is of a higher standard than in most other European countries.  Certainly in the case of local authorities, because of the by-laws, that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputies are being very unfair to me.  I do not want to dwell too long on this point.  Perhaps the movers of the amendment might clarify its aims.  Are they saying that under this amendment local authorities will have to regulate &ldquo;At varying levels of the actual construction&rdquo; the controls that are in place?  If so, anyone working in a local authority would say tell them that is just not on, because at present they cannot cope with their present obligations. Therefore, we must have some confidence in the professional training and integrity of the qualified person who should not be under the suspicion of being congenitally likely to certify work which is not up to standard.  I know many professional people who refuse point blank to certify anything not up to standard, despite the fact that there may be some individual down the road who may very well be willing to certify such work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The problem is the exception not the majority of people. This problem can be dealt with by looking at the sanctions and the question of enforcement and not by branding everyone <Col N="541" /> with the same tag.  This amendment is not acceptable, and the movers must know that in their hearts and souls.  If by some chance this amendment were to be accepted, I have no doubt that county and city managers all over the county would hold their heads in their hands and groan because they would know, as the movers must know, that it cannot work.</P>
      <P>We must involve the professional and qualified person in some way.  The suggestion that professionals would certify the work of other professionals might suffice and maybe the Minister may take a look at this suggestion between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to my colleagues in The Workers' Party, they are being unnecessarily doctrinaire, perhaps misleadingly so, in respect of this matter.  Deputy De Rossa, Leader of The Workers Party, used the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;. That brings out a certain Thatcherite, Pavolvian reaction from me and I think from most Members of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made the point in this debate that the professionals in the private sector who would have to sign these certificates would prefer if there was no system of self-certification. One of the reasons we have no system of building control regulations eight years down the road is the failure and a reluctance on the part of many people in private practice to take on the onerous responsibilities involved in self-certification. If this is privatisation for the benefit of private individuals I do not know who these professionals are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the benefits of a Committee Stage debate has emerged this evening in a manner I have not witnessed recently in this House.  The Workers' Party argue that, in the interests of the individual citizen, it would be preferable to have this system of regulation and control or supervision &mdash; the word used by Deputy McCartan &mdash; carried out by a responsible body, such as a local authority or some other body.  They were flexible on that. If that body in the exercise of their activities, <Col N="542" /> employing professionals make a mistake &mdash; 99 per cent of whom are scrupulously honest according to Deputy McCartan but who nevertheless are human and therefore make mistakes &mdash; and if a fault emerges, on the basis of what the Minister has said, the private citizen would have no redress in law in terms of liability against that body.  As I understand it, in the seven or eight local authority areas where building by-laws are administered if a fault emerges in a building that is clearly in breach of the building by-laws, and yet that building was certified as having being approved by the local authority, a person would have no recourse to law in terms of liability against the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have many reservations about self-certification, but the concern which motivates The Workers' Party amendment, as expressed by Deputy De Rossa and elaborated on by Deputy McCartan, is that self-certification somehow would remove protection from the individual because unscrupulous individuals will be able to certify.  Unlike the members of the medical profession the mistakes of architects are above the ground and become self-evident, but if a mistake manifests itself in a building which has been certified by a professional, the individual citizen can have recourse in law to file for liability on the grounds of professional incompetency or negligence against that individual.  If one were to start from a position which is not doctrinaire but rather was motivated by a genuine concern to protect the rights of the individual citizen, in the event of something going wrong, paradoxically there would be greater redress from the individual against the certifier who has self-certified that a building complies with the building regulations, but which subsequently turns out not to be the case. If the local authority had issued the certificate of building approval provided for in subsection (2) (c), on the basis of what the Minister has said there could be less protection for the individual citizen than at present.  I recognise that the Minister responded in an impromptu way, but we should get some considered views on this matter, if not this evening then later in the debate because I was not aware of <Col N="543" /> this point until this amendment brought it to light.</P>
    <P>References were made to the problems associated with low cost housing back in the early seventies.  I know many professionals working with local authorities, particularly in Dublin Corporation, who had grave reservations about signing such certificates of adequacy and certificates for payment for certain contractors in respect of low cost dwellings because they were unhappy with the standard of construction. They were directed by administrators in the local authorities to sign the necessary certificates.  I am talking about buildings in Deputy De Rossa's constituency which have become notorious because of the problems associated with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <P>Indeed.  It is possible that professionals who have the necessary technical competence could find themselves under duress from administrators to sign certificates.  My position remains the same &mdash; we should strive for self-certification as one means of administration but during this debate prompted by the proposal made by The Workers' Party to delete any provision for self-certification, a number of interesting points have been made.  Quite frankly, I do not expect the Minister to have all of the answers.  I wanted to make the point that we do not want to fall into some kind of doctrinaire trap but rather to recognise what is being proposed and what the safeguards are.  In the course of this debate I would like the Minister to address the question of accountability and liability either, on this section or on the relevant subsection.  I want to remind the Minister that I referred earlier to experience in the UK, and I wonder if he is in a position to give any response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has changed quite considerably since we started to discuss this amendment.  There is no doubt that the position of The Workers' Party has changed dramatically from what was expressed by Deputy de Rossa <Col N="544" /> at the start of his contribution.  It has been brought a good bit further by his colleague, Deputy McCartan.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa was pressing as a point of principle that all certification would rest in the hands of the local authority. Deputy Keating pointed out that that had not operated to the total satisfaction of everybody over the years anyway, but Deputy De Rossa, having pressed that point, seemed to throw it aside and it is now obvious that The Workers' Party are seeking some form of independent agency to be superimposed on everything, above and beyond the local authorities, self certification or any other mixture one might consider as an option.  That is an entirely different matter.  We are moving into an ideology now that was hinted at between Deputy Quinn and Deputy McCartan and I am not going to get into that.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan at least came clean on the fact that it is a fundamental principle of The Workers' Party that they are opposed to certification full stop, and no argument is going to convince them otherwise.  That is a narrow view and we are not here as a body in this democracy to talk in that narrow, tight, ideological framework, so he has lost the argument. The disappointing part about Deputy McCartan's contribution was it showed a strong anti-construction industry bias.  I was taken aback by it.  He is anti the construction industry to quite a degree. One could take the implication from some of the things he said that the construction industry are looking for avenues for corner cutting all the time and that was virtually the order of the day.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience has been that the vast majority of construction undertaken in this country is of a high standard and quality.  I am not saying mistakes have not been made.  We see evidence of that occasionally and it is always high news when it happens, but I cannot go along with the idea that the construction industry are seeking in some way to enhance their profit margins by cost cutting exercises at every opportunity that presents itself.  I say to Deputy McCartan that I respect the professional competence and integrity of the people who might, if <Col N="545" /> occasion arises, be given the opportunity of self certification.  I respect that professionalism if they are suitably qualified. Therefore, self certification is not antagonistic to my principles.  If self certification becomes the option chosen or preferred by a Minister it is not giving an open door to shoddiness in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>When certification takes place whether by a local authority, self certification or any mixture of both or third party, which is also an option that could be considered under section 6 (2), unforeseen circumstances sometimes arise following a certificate given in a duly professional way.  Negligence, incompetence, faulty materials and workmanship can be involved, and no certifier could have foreseen some of those elements.  A local authority might not be able to foresee all those elements either.  If you are to go down Deputy McCartan's road for a fully independent agency to be set up and to superimpose itself on the total scene of the building industry you will bring construction to a halt.</P>

      <P>The Bill stands apart from the liability issue.  I will argue that any time the Deputy likes but this Bill stands apart from that at this stage and the Deputies representing The Workers' Party here have made a great deal of play about the local authority administered <Col N="546" /> approval system or something super after that.  They are saying that without that kind of local authority approval system building defects will not be detected.  I cannot reconcile that with their amendment 1a to amendment 12.  I am taken aback by the level of inconsistency in what they are now promoting and what has been suggested by their amendment. I have waited for the end of this to bring this to their attention to see how far they would go.  In their subsequent amendment they are only talking about certifying in accordance with design, full stop.  How do they reconcile that with what they have been promoting here for the past hour when talking about the construction process out on the ground and so on?  They want me and this House to accept they would be quite happy to have a desk certification done in accordance with the design sent in.  That is the thrust of their amendment 1a.</P>

      <P>I tried to convince them.  I thought at least the Deputy, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Farrelly might see the sense of the case we were trying to make, as the Minister had made up his mind from the very beginning he was not going to see any sense in it or to accept it.  However, he must be aware, as I am; that the majority of Deputies sit on <Col N="547" /> this side of the House and not on the Minister's side of the House.  It was important to try to convince at least the Deputies on this side of the House.  It is a pity the Minister took the line of heaping abuse on The Workers' Party for the case we have been trying to make.  The Minister can check the record.  I did not state that the only alternative system to self-certification was retaining certification in the hands of local authorities. I did use the term &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; in relation to the proposal to self-certify because that is precisely what it is; it is putting certification into the hands of private individuals.  If the Minister can find any other definition of &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; I would like to hear it.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Quinn started the ball rolling for the Minister in relation to using the term &ldquo;doctrinaire&rdquo; and the Minister added &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; to that.  I have attempted to argue the case against self-certification on the grounds that the building industry as an industry have not proved themselves trustworthy in relation to self-certification.  The Minister knows that.  The evidence of defective buildings and whole estates which are defective is there for all to see when they got any leeway at all in relation to regulations.  Hardly a month passes in this city that regulations in relation to the planning laws are not breached and thrown to the winds by so-called entrepreneurs knocking down buildings. Would the Minister deny that?  We have to have regulations; we have to have an independent system of regulation and a system of approval.  The most effective one in existence at present is that provided by local authorities.  If the Minister wants to go down the road of establishing another independent body to do the job of local authorities we are prepared to consider that but we have not proposed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to drop the bluff about this matter and I ask Opposition Deputies to reconsider their attitude in relation to self-certification.  The question has to be asked, why is it that the Minister proposes to ensure that the power to make people comply with the fire regulations is retained by local authorities <Col N="548" /> when that in relation to buildings is not?  Why is it that he does not trust the building and construction industry in relation to the fire regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is important from the point of view of the health services in County Roscommon, the people of Castlerea and surrounding areas, and the patients in the hospital.  It is worth recalling that three years ago the Coalition Government were severely criticised by the present Minister for Health and his Minister of State for their handling of the health services.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, belatedly, on his appointment.  This is the first occasion I have had an opportunity to do so across the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Minister for Health in the history of the State was subjected to more abuse and blackguarded as much as Deputy Desmond was when he held that office. As a member of the Western Health Board I am aware that their allocation of £108 million is insufficient to run the health services in their area.  The budget has been cut by £3.7 million and it is no coincidence that that is the amount it cost to run St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea last year.  It is as a result of the cut in the budget that the board have had to consider closing institutions.  The Swinford complex is a clear example of the Government's lack of a health policy. The complex is capable of catering for <Col N="549" /> 156 patients but there are only 30 patients there at present at a cost of £91 per day to maintain.  That is a scandal.</P>
    <P>Three years ago the then Minister for Health tried to rationalise the health services and reform the system of care for psychiatric patients.  He proposed to transfer funding to the Swinford complex and to transfer mentally handicapped persons from Castlerea, Castlebar and Ballinasloe to it.  He also proposed improving community facilities for mentally handicapped persons.  Unfortunately, the Swinford complex, which cost £12 million, is almost idle.</P>
    <P>Tonight I am expressing my concern for the future of 130 patients of St. Patrick's Hospital, an institution which is scheduled to close in April because of inadequate funding.  It is envisaged that at least 30 of those patients will be transferred to a new acute admissions unit at the county hospital in Roscommon.  That unit will cost an additional £90,000 but that expenditure has not been approved by the Department of Health.  It is also proposed to transfer a further 66 patients to a psycho-geriatric unit which will cost £200,000 but the Department of Health has not provided the funds.  A further 20 patients will be transferred to a support hostel in Roscommon which will cost £130,000 but the money has not been provided by the Department.  It is proposed to transfer 14 patients to supervised hostels which will cost £100,000. The £520,000 required to erect those facilities has not been provided by the Department.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the decisions made by the Coalition Government in 1986. They envisaged opening an acute psychiatric unit at Roscommon hospital, providing hostel accommodation at St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, providing psycho-geriatric facilities at the same hospital and retaining the administration of psychiatric services for County Roscommon in Castlerea.  Deputy Desmond's plan was accepted by the people of the town, the staff and the patients of the hospital.  It is unfortunate that since the change of Government we have not been made aware of the Minister's plan for psychiatric services.  It was because of that that, as chairman of the <Col N="550" /> special hospitals committee of the board, I invited the Minister of State to meet the committee for an exchange of views on those services in our health board area, but particularly in Roscommon.  The Minister of State, generously, met the members of the committee for two hours on 14 November and gave an undertaking to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  However, that meeting has not taken place.  I can only assume that if the Minister of State was not misleading and deceiving the members of the committee, and myself, in November, he failed to persuade the Minister of the importance of meeting the committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to call on the Minister of State to arrange that meeting with the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, so that the members of the Western Health Board can learn of the Minister's plans for the psychiatric services in Roscommon.  On the other hand, the Minister of State might clarify the position thus eliminating the need for that deputation to travel to Dublin.  I do not want the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, to tell us, as he did on Monday, that the CEO said a subcommittee of the health board could not meet the Minister.  That is not true.  The health board have chosen representatives from the various programmes to meet the Minister, if the Minister of State will arrange it.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from column 2249 of the Official Report of 11 February 1986, where the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, stated:</P>
    <P>We recognise it will not be possible to rehabilitate all patients for independent living in the community.  We consider that patients who cannot be rehabilitated to this extent should be allowed to spend their remaining years in the hospital where they now live.</P>
    <P>Those were the remarks of the Minister for Health on 11 February 1986.  I call on him now to honour those commitments. The position has not changed.  All that has changed is his role from having been then Opposition spokesman to being Minister for Health now.  The buck stays with him.  If he is an honourable man, which is the image he tries to portray &mdash;<Col N="551" /> although at times I find it very difficult to see any such people on the far side of the House &mdash; I call on him to honour that commitment given in this House on 11 February, 1986.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there were many commitments given at that time which were not honoured, commitments on the part of the present Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden, when obviously he did not foresee himself holding his present office.  I think he was then Opposition spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I should like to quote again what the present Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, had to say at column 2256 of the Official Report of 11 February, 1986:</P>
    <P>I appeal for support from all sides of the House and I call on the Taoiseach, in the light of the seriousness of the situation and the callous manner in which this announcement was made, immediately to remove Deputy Desmond from the post of Minister for Health.  The Minister relied totally for support for his statement on <i>Planning for the Future</i> in regard to psychiatric services.  I suggest that the Minister read chapter 3.2 of that document......</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, that he has had over three years in which to read chapter 3.2 of the document <i>Planning for the Future.</i> I appeal to him and to his Minister to ensure that the provisions of chapter 3.2 are adhered to and are implemented in so far as the psychiatric services in Roscommon are concerned.  We are left with an acute psychiatric/geriatric unit at St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.  I appeal to them to ensure that, until such time as an alternative service is provided, psychiatric care for the patients of Roscommon remain in Castlerea.  The Minister also has an obligation to ensure that high support hostel facilities continue to be provided at Castlerea.</P>
    <P>Nobody can understand the position in which the people of Castlerea find themselves.  We are faced with the prospect of our hospital being closed down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> Yet the requisite funds have not been allocated by the Department of Health for the provision of alternative facilities. It is callous to expect St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea to live within their budget for this year.  For example, 70 staff at that hospital must go before 1 April next.  The Minister of State is well aware of that fact.  The obligation rests squarely on him to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister of State will be well aware from his constituency colleague, Deputy Doherty, who is chairman of the Western Health Board, that nothing can be done to prevent the closure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea without there being additional finance allocated by the Department of Health or the Minister implementing the provisions of section 38 of the Health Act, 1970.  I call on the Minister this evening to protect the future of people who live in institutions in Castlerea, who are unable to vote, some unable to talk or explain their present difficulties.  There is indeed an obligation on the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>I might point out to the Minister of State that his Minister protected the Regional Hospital in Galway in his letter of allocation.  I believe the Minister of State present has an obligation to protect St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that we have had a drastic cutback of £440,000 for community care services, leaving the Western Health Board with very few such services.  That cutback and the additional pressure that will be placed on those services resulting from the earlier discharge of patients from all our hospitals, particularly the general ones, because of shortage of funding will lead to a disastrous position within our health board area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that the provisions of section 38 of the Health Act, 1970 are implemented as far as St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea is concerned.</P>
    <P>I might now quote from column 2258 of the Official Report of 11 February, 1986 when the present Minister of State had this to say:</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to retain this hospital in Castlerea as a centre of psychiatric services in County Roscommon <Col N="553" /> to provide all the facilities necessary for people who will require such services.  Those patients cannot be moved from the institution.  What the Minister will be performing in this case will be a form of official euthanasia, because the patients there will die if they are moved from the security of the hospital.  That is a serious and grave decision for the Minister to make or for the Government.  It would.....</P>
    <P>The decision now rests with the Minister of State present.  Indeed the picture portrayed by the words of the paragraph I have just quoted will be appropriate if the Minister of State washes his hands of the position obtaining in Castlerea.  I call on him as Minister of State and as a Deputy for Roscommon, to take the necessary steps to ensure that the future of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea is assured until such time as alternative services to cater for the patients there are provided in the community.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is now three years since the publication of the report entitled <i>Planning for the Future.</i> The work put into the preparation of that report by senior officers of the Department of Health, notably the present Secretary, the retired Assistant Secretary, Seán Trant and the Minister's colleague present this evening, Frank Foley, was quite extraordinary.  Within 12 months of the publication of that report in March 1985 we proposed to change radically the whole structure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea and St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow.  It is worth recalling here the criticism heaped on Deputy Naughten by the present Minister of State at the Department of Health in the local newspaper, when he called on Fine Gael Deputies to realise that they were being sold down the river by what he described as the &ldquo;so-called socialist Minister for Health&rdquo;.  Equally I recall Deputy Doherty, as reported in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of 7 February, as having said that the people of Castlerea were in a state of <Col N="554" /> absolute shock, that he could not describe the shock felt among the patients, staff and local community, contending that the then Minister and Fine Gael Deputies had no concern whatsoever for the patients in the hospital. That kind of stuff was hurled across the House.  Indeed in addition, in the debate on 12 February, Deputy Doherty went on record as being of the opinion that the then Government was a junta Government rather than a democratically-elected one, describing their actions as crude and cruel.  In some ways one could maintain that the hands of the clock have turned&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, full circle.  The reality is that not only have the recommendations of the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> not been implemented by this Government but they have taken from the Western Health Board the resources which would have enabled them to do so.</P>
      <P>I might add that the allocation for the Western Health Board when I left office amounted to £112 million, on the outturn for 1986.  It is now down to £108.4 million for the year 1989, a major reduction.  The prospect of the provisions of that report being implemented throughout the west has been substantially impeded by drastic reductions in the basic allocations to the Western Health Board.  It was never the intention that these hospitals would close on the basis of financial stringency alone. Rather was it the intention that they would be closed on the basis that, over the best part of a ten to 15 year period, we would have a much better model which would involve substantial capital expenditure on hospitals and community care of mentally handicapped patients transferred from those hospitals.  It was predicted that the transition would cost the best part of £50 million over a 15 year period.  The capital allocation of the Department of Health has been cut from £57 million when we left office to £46 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for having given me the opportunity to point out to the Minister of State their hypocrisy, their blatant baulking of a serious effort <Col N="555" /> on our part to radically transform the delivery of psychiatric care which we found to be on its knees in 1982 when we assumed office, there having been no change whatsoever over the years.  When we tried to change things we were impeded every inch of the way.  I now call on the Government and the Minister, and indeed Deputy Doherty, to implement this decision of the Government in a sensitive and caring way and to ensure that the resources are made available to the Western Health Board to enable this to be done.  It is long overdue that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government should face up to their responsibilities because they blatantly and flagrantly refused to do so between 1982 and 1987 when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of psychiatric services in County Roscommon is a matter for the Western Health Board.  Nevertheless, in his contribution to the budget debate in 1986, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, announced that a number of hospitals were to close, among them St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea. A time scale of less than six months was proposed for the closure.  There had been no prior discussion with the health board or with the staff of St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In notifying the health board of their allocation for 1986 the proposed closure was formally notified.  The closures and the manner of their announcement were strongly resisted by my party at the time. We were concerned that the decision had been taken without regard to the consequences for patients if proper community services were not in place and for the staff since there had been no discussion with them on matters which vitally affected their future.  The basis put forward for this decision was the report, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which set guidelines for the development of the psychiatric services.  The recommendations in that report were accepted by the great majority of people involved in the service. It recommended a range of services <Col N="556" /> in the community to replace the mental hospitals.  It is clear from the report that these facilities must be in place before the change can be brought about.  It was unrealistic to suggest that St. Patrick's Hospital should be closed in six months and that has proved to be so.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions between the Department and the health board the various facilities to be provided in County Roscommon were set out.  Most of these are not even now in place three years later.  It was suggested also that a portion of St. Patrick's Hospital should be redesignated as a geriatric unit to cater for elderly people in the hospital but that has not been done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond, as Minister in February 1986, stressed in this House that his decision in relation to Castlerea was not only his own conviction but part of a collective Government decision.  It was an inevitable consequence of that decision that the necessary arrangements be made in regard to the welfare of patients and staff and funds provided for a range of services but this was not done.</P>
    <P>Saint Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea has a history, going back over the past 20 years, of progressive care for patients. Some would say this is the price of the progressive activities of psychiatrists and nurses in that hospital.  It is a record that cannot be endangered.  Evidence of it can be seen in the fall in patient numbers as the total of those in community care has grown.  This is not only in accord with the policies set out in <i>Planning for the Future</i> but shows that St. Patrick's Hospital was already operating to the highest standards even before that report was issued.</P>
    <P>Patient numbers in 1972 were just over 400.  By the end of that decade the number was down to 300 and it is now down to 124 patients.  This has been achieved without any reduction in the quality of care, rather the opposite. When we spoke on this debate in 1986 the number of patients was over double the present complement.  At that time I expressed deep concern &mdash; I stand over the statements I made in the House then &mdash; that no provision had been made by the then Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, for the patients who would be <Col N="557" /> ejected from St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that future developments will be of the same high standard. For this reason the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, will meet with the chairman of the health board, my colleague, Deputy Seán Doherty, and the chief executive officer, Mr. Eamonn Hannan, next Wednesday to discuss this matter.  I will be also in attendance at that meeting.  I would not wish at this point to anticipate the outcome of these discussions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Naughten has referred to the debates of 1986 I would also like to remind him of his contribution at that time.  He warmly welcomed, in a sense, the general thrust of the decision of the then Minister, Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any conflict between Deputy Naughten's view and mine on this issue.  The decision taken by the Minister and the Government in 1986 was premature.  No provision was made at that stage for the patients who would be removed from the hospital within six months of that decision.  The decision to close St. Patrick's Hospital was not made by the Western Health Board in 1986 but by the then Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, as a result of a collective Cabinet decision.  I am aware that the then Taoiseach &mdash; I made this point at the time <Col N="558" />&mdash; disowned the Minister's activities in Roscommon soon afterwards which I thought was grossly unfair as it was a collective decision.</P>

This directive must be implemented by early 1991 and would require the recognition of teachers with three or more years' training from other Community member states.

      <P>The method by which money for student grants is allocated to member states is fixed by the terms of the Erasmus Decision adopted in 1987.  These cannot be altered during the present phase of the programme which will operate up to 30 June next year.  However, I would like to inform the Deputy that at a meeting of Community Education Ministers in November last I pressed home very strongly the difficulties being experienced here under the present arrangements and emphasised the need for an improved method of allocation in the next phase of the programme.  The Commission are fully aware of our difficulties and they will be highlighted in bilateral discussions which are to take place later this month. I am confident that the arrangements in the next phase of the Erasmus Programme will be more satisfactory.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  The data shown is derived on the basis of the first post in a national school obtained by each teacher after graduation, and many of the teachers shown in the final column above may subsequently have obtained permanent posts.  However, details are not readily available of these numbers.</P>
    <P>2.  The figures shown do not take account of teachers employed on a casual basis as substitutes for those absent on sick leave, maternity leave, etc.</P>
    <P>3.  There are no part-time teaching posts in primary schools.  Both permanent and temporary teachers serve for the full school day.  The majority of teachers in temporary posts are serving as replacements for teachers absent on career breaks for periods of one to five years.  Service in permanent and temporary posts is pensionable and incremental.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the position regarding the provision of vocational schools in Milford and Stranorlar, County Donegal.  In the case of Milford, I am satisfied that in the context of rationalisation of provision, a single school development represents the best long-term solution to the post-primary education needs of the area.  Both school managements have been so informed. My Department are awaiting a response from County Donegal VEC on the <Col N="372" /> matter.  In the circumstances, the provision of a new vocational school does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in staff referred to arose because the enrolment in the school is not sufficient to warrant a replacement for the assistant teacher who was recently appointed as the new principal of the school.  This school had for some years the benefit of an amalgamation concession whereby four assistants were retained on an enrolment which would normally warrant only three.  This concession related only to the existing staff at the time of amalgamation and any vacancy arising after that date could only be filled if the normal requirements regarding enrolment were complied with.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the school staffing and am satisfied that it is in accord with the agreed arrangements worked out under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>In addition to the normal staff complement, the school benefits from a concessionary post allocated under my Department's special scheme for schools serving disadvantaged areas and also has a remedial teacher on the staff.</P>

    <P>It has been reiterated that no more than £500,000 by way of grant from the Exchequer can be made available to the company.  However, bearing in mind the importance of the Swansea-Cork service to tourism in the Cork and Kerry region, and having regard in particular to the funds pledged by local interests, the Government are prepared to provide, in addition to the £500,000 grant, a loan <Col N="375" /> facility of up to £500,000 which would be repayable by September 1989.</P>
    <P>This assistance is subject to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited confirming that it will be able to provide a full programme of services in 1989.  Discussions in this regard and in relation to the necessary detailed terms under which the Exchequer funds will be made available and repaid are ongoing between officials of the company and of my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Glas commissioned commodity teams to examine seven sectors of the horticulture industry, including hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture. The reports of the teams were intended solely for the guidance of the board itself. The teams made over 250 recommendations and the board had to assess and consider these with due regard to their practicability in the context of the overall plan for the development of horticulture and taking account also of current financial constraints.  In the case of the nursery stock industry, the commodity team identified better marketing as a priority and the board have already taken steps, in co-operation with CTT, to establish a co-ordinated export strategy for such stock.  Proposals in relation to taxation and VAT are also being actively pursued by my Department.  A revised system of certification of plants for export has now been brought into operation after consultation with the nursery industry.</P>
      <P>The targets set by the board for hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture are the creation of 400 jobs over the next five years and an increase in output of £7 million.  I am satisfied that the board's programme to achieve these targets is realistic and attainable and that it will fully exploit the undoubted potential for increased output and job creation in this sector.</P>

    <P>¹The information given represents the only breakdown available for excise duty purposes.  Category A motor vehicles consist mainly of private cars and minibuses.  The term &ldquo;Category B&rdquo; covers all other motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>²VAT is charged at the rate of 25 per cent on the VAT-exclusive sale price of the vehicle, giving a rate of 20 per cent on the VAT inclusive price.  Excise duty is charged at the rate of 24.7 per cent (for vehicles exceeding 2012 cc) or 21.7 per cent (other vehicles) of the recommended retail list price of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>³In so far as VAT is concerned there is no reliable information available on which to base an estimate of receipts from Category B vehicles.  However, VAT-registered persons are entitled to a deduction in their returns from VAT borne on business purchases of motor vehicles (other than cars and motor-cycles), and this would very significantly reduce the VAT yield from such vehicles. Therefore the rate and yield shown for Category B vehicles relate only to excise duty.</P>

He is regarded as non-resident in this country for tax purposes.  He is properly chargeable to tax on income arising in the State.  Under the provisions of section 153 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, where there is no foreign income, the full tax-free allowances to which the taxpayer would be entitled are granted against the Irish income.  The excess of his retirement pension over his tax-free allowances is properly chargeable to tax at the 35 per cent rate for 1988-89.</P>
