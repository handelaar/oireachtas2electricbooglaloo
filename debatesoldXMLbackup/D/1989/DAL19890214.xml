      <P>asked the Taoiseach the Government's plans for the financial Services Centre, Custom House Docks, Dublin 1 following on the report by British consultants (details supplied) commissioned by his Department; and if the report's recommendations to him will result in revised plans for the centre.</P>

      <P>The report referred to has been rejected.  It was not commissioned by my Department.  It was considered by the International Financial Services Centre Committee who advise <Col N="2" /> the Government on the development of the centre.  The committee took no action on the report because private banking facilities, subject to the existing practice on confidentiality, are provided for in the legislation governing the centre.  There is no question of altering the regime established by the legislation to permit or encourage undesirable secret banking or any other similar activities.  The highest standards of financial probity will be rigidly enforced in the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my brief visit, I intend to discuss with the new US administration and with members of Congress, as appropriate, bilateral economic and political questions, including US investment here, tourism, the status of Irish immigrants in the US &mdash; as well as Northern Ireland and any other relevant issues which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the report in the newspapers during the past fortnight that the Taoiseach is likely to discuss the Government's proposals for ending the political stalemate in Northern Ireland is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it without foundation because the Government do not have proposals or because the Taoiseach does not intend discussing them?  It is not apparent to any other Member of this House that the Government have proposals in relation to Northern Ireland. May I ask the Taoiseach if he has seen reports that the Libyan government intend, under the new administration in the US, to try to repair relationships between those two countries and, if that is so, can I ask him, through these new found relationships, to impress on the US administration the abhorrence we feel at the Libyan support for the Provisional IRA and to ask the US administration to end&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The new Committee on Defence Forces' Pay and Conditions recently announced by the Government will be comprised of the interdepartmental committee set up in June 1988 &mdash; chairman, Deputy Vincent Brady, Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence; and a representative each from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Defence and Labour with the addition of two retired members of the Defence Forces.  The last meeting of the interdepartmental committee was in mid-December 1988.  Arrangements are at present being made for the appointment of the two additional members.</P>
      <P>As regards the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Forces Pay, Allowances and Conditions the position is that it is not the practice to publish reports of committees such as this.  However, details of the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental committee, together with particulars of the revised rates of pay and allowances approved by the Government following consideration of the report, were set out in my reply to Questions Nos. 250 and 251 on 25 January 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on that occasion, the <Col N="7" /> Government accepted all the recommendations in the committee's report with one small amendment in regard to the phased payment of military service allowance.  Accordingly, non-commissioned ranks as a whole are getting an overall increase of 19 per cent, made up of an increase of 12 ½ per cent in basic pay and significant improvements in a range of allowances.  This is significantly greater than what they would have got under traditional pay relationships.  In addition, all the general pay increases provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Public Service Pay Agreement are being paid.  The average total remuneration of non-commissioned personnel increased by about 9 per cent on 1 January last.  By 1 July next the cumulative increase will be about 15 per cent rising to more that 21 per cent on full implementation of the pay awards.</P>
    <P>Officers who have not benefited from recent awards are getting an increase ranging from 10 per cent to 16 per cent when account is taken of the improvements in basic pay and in military service allowance.  These officers are also benefiting from the increases in security allowances and from the general increases to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to pay the increases in basic pay in one phase without breaching the Public Service Pay Agreement and undermining the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> These increases will be paid on the same phased basis as for other public service groups, that is, 40 per cent of the increases in basic pay with effect from 1 July 1989, subject to the terms of the Public Service Pay Agreement. The first phase of military service allowance was paid on 1 January 1989 and the balance will be paid on 1 July next.  All other allowances &mdash; mostly for security duties &mdash; were increased as from 1 January last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the second phase be paid out?  What about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister genuinely believe that the officers and <Col N="8" /> men will have confidence in this new interdepartmental committee to look after their pay and conditions in the future?  I want that question answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Yes.  For the first time the Defence Forces have a committee working on a continuous basis.  The committee were set up in June of last year by this Government.  I have already outlined the details regarding the committee, which will look into the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces on a continuous basis.  In addition, the Government decided to place on that committee two members who are retired personnel from the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This certainly smacks of the fox outside the chicken house, when one considers that up to now they had no confidence whatsoever in that body.  The Minister is wasting the time of the committee and of the officers and men.</P>
      <P>One very important question that I want to put regarding the committee is, what was their proposal with regard to the second instalment of the actual pay award, not the allowances?  When do they propose that that should be paid?  I want to know when this award will be paid, or if it is mixed up in the special pay claims that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced here on Budget Day.  All that was taken to be in the melting pot and nobody could be sure of anything after that.  Would the Minister answer, yes or no?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister guarantee to this House that the members of the Defence Forces are sure to get the second instalment of their pay deal?  Will the Minister answer yes or no? Also, I take issue with what the Minister <Col N="11" /> said.  As far as the actual pay increases are concerned, all the Defence Forces got as a special increase was 2.4 per cent in 1989, or 4.8 per cent of pay on 1 July.  The Minister is mixing up the whole question of allowances and pay awards.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of dissatisfaction and annoyance at this proposal. Is the Minister aware that most of these men have served since 1969 when there were no regular troops, particularly in Border posts?  It is a disgraceful way to treat men who have given loyal service because many of them are now at an age when they will be unable to perform normal routine duties undertaken by regular recruits.  It is Hobson's choice, either join the Permanent Defence Force or leave.  Will the Minister consider allowing the men at present serving to finish their present term of office as an alternative?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> That matter was considered but was not found feasible.  The decision was also based on legal and technical reasons.  Personnel who opt not to join the Permanent <Col N="20" /> Defence Force and who are being released from full-time service will be paid a gratuity calculated at the rate of 30 days' pay per year of service subject to a maximum of one year's pay.  An example of the average amount of a gratuity is as follows: a captain will receive about £12,160, a sergeant will receive £8,520 and a private will get about £7,309.  The amounts payable may be higher or lower, depending on the length of service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 25 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 August 1988 a total of 37 officers of the Permanent Defence Force applied to retire voluntarily as follows: Army, 16; Air Corps, 20; and Naval Service 1.</P>
      <P>Of the Air Corps officers, 13 were refused permission to retire voluntarily while seven applications are still under consideration.  All other applications for voluntary retirement were granted.  One Army officer applied for and was granted permission to resign.</P>
      <P>With regard to other ranks, a total of 490 personnel were discharged during the period 1 August 1988 to 31 January 1989. A man has the absolute right to a discharge on completion of his engagement or by purchase except during an emergency. The question of refusing applications for discharge under these headings does not therefore arise. Defence Force regulations also provide other grounds under which a man may seek his discharge, e.g. on compassionate grounds, but no record is maintained of any refusal to grant such discharges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of personnel who were discharged by purchase from the Permanent Defence Force in 1986, 1987 and 1988 was 137, 268 and 274 respectively. The corresponding figure for January 1989 was 13.  In the last six months a total of 138 personnel were discharged <Col N="24" /> by purchase.  This figure includes two sergeants, 15 corporals and 121 privates.</P>
    <P>One of the sergeants was a radar-radio mechanic, the other had no trade.  The 15 corporals included four who had no trade, three electrical artificers, three engine room artificers, two radar-radio mechanics, one shipwright, one aero mechanic and one military policeman. Seventy-eight privates had no trade, the remainder were as follows: 15 aero mechanics, seven drivers, five fitters, four armourers, two carpenters, two electricians, one butcher, one draughtsman, one painter, one radio mechanic, one radio operator, one joiner, one mechanic &mdash; Naval Service &mdash; and one telegraphist.</P>

    <P>In accordance with paragraph 39 (3) of Defence Force Regulations A. 11 a man who has been granted special leave prior to terminating his service in the Permanent Defence Force is permitted, before the time of expiry of such leave: (a) to extend the term of his original enlistment; (b) to re-engage to complete 21 years' service; or (c) to continue in service after 21 years' service.  The period of such special leave will be deducted from any leave for which he may be eligible should he again apply to terminate his service with the Permanent Defence Force.  For this reason, the number of men who have applied for discharge and who will actually avail of discharge is not certain.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that 192 men have applied for discharge by purchase from the Army in recent times and that is the total number of applications that lie currently before the Minister?  Would he accept that is a clear indication of the groundswell of dissatisfaction present in the Defence Force and the low morale which has caused so many men to reconsider their careers in the Defence Force? Does this large figure not give rise to grave concern to the Government about the continued effectiveness of our security forces if so many have applied to leave in such a short time, with the obvious rumblings of dissatisfaction we have heard on a regular basis over the last few months because of the pay and conditions?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The aircraft in question is being stored at Baldonnel. Facilities are being provided on a short-term basis pending the completion of a hangar being built by the company at Dublin Airport.  The facilities were made available on a repayment basis at a cost comparable to the normal commercial tariffs.  The following charges are being applied: landing fee £80 per landing; hangarage, including towing, £100 per 24-hour period.  The following facilities have been availed of up to and including 9 February 1989: landings 13; hangarages 39 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this facility ever extended in this way to any other owner of a private aircraft?  In other words, is there any precedent for a privately-owned aircraft regularly using the State's main Air Corps base?  Does the Minister not consider that there could be a very serious security risk involved in this practice? Surely he owes the House a fuller explanation than what he gave in his initial reply because, to say the least the whole thing is very sinister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> No, it is not.  The use of the aerodrome is subject to military requirements.  Facilities are not being made available in normal operational hours.  Any damage caused to State property arising out of such use is to be made good by the company concerned. To this end the company has produced satisfactory insurance cover in respect of public liability and fire insurance.  As I have said, it is a commercial matter.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Cúis sásaimh dom an Bille seo i dtaca le laithreáin thréighthe a thabhairt os comhair an Tí.  Is geall le tríocha bliain ó reachtaíodh an tAcht is deireannaí chun socrú a dheanamh ar an gceist dheacair seo.  Tá sé go maith in am iarracht nua a dhéanamh chun slacht agus eagar a chur ar ár mbailte móra agus beaga.</P>
      <P>One of the earliest and most enduring concerns of Irish local government has been to minimise and control, in the public interest, the impact of ruin and dilapidation on our cities, towns and villages. The various towns improvement Acts of the last century, and the public health provisions of this period also, all deal with various aspects of what we now know as urban decay or blight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern of these earlier statutes was principally with the physical or health dangers to the public arising from <Col N="104" /> neglected buildings.  This focus still survives in sanitary services legislation, which remains the competent code in relation to these non-amenity aspects of land dereliction.  However, with the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940 and its successor the Derelict Sites Act, 1961&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but could he confirm that the text of his speech is being circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that has been arranged.  With the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940, and its successor the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, legislative provisions were designed with a focus primarily on the amenity and visual aspects of land dereliction.  Derelict sites were to be cleared and rendered aesthetically acceptable not because of their immediate danger to health or safety but because they detracted from our enjoyment, and that of tourists, of our cities, towns and villages.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong, of course, to give the impression that measures to deal with land dereliction are, in Irish law, the sole, or even the principal, preserve of specialised derelict sites legislation.  Our physical planning system envisages, as one of its most important objectives, the presentation of amenities by planning authorities and the renewal of obsolete areas. It is mandatory on urban planning authorities to harness all possible effort and resources to achieve these ends.  The recently enacted urban renewal legislation is also designed to make more intensive provision for the renewal of certain urban areas, with rates and tax incentives available for this purpose and, as announced in the recent budget, a new £2 million scheme for works of environmental upgrading in designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, derelict sites legislation stand to the planning and urban renewal codes rather as does the Litter Act to more pollution.  In theory, if development plans, planning enforcement and urban renewal incentives were doing their job, we would not have dereliction <Col N="105" /> at all; just as if waste licensing and enforcement were operating perfectly there might hardly be any need for certain provisions of the Litter Act.  Both are necessary fall-back systems to deal with imperfect situations which arise despite the existence of more ambitious legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it would be wrong to build too much complexity into derelict sites or litter legislation.  Their basic purpose is to prevent and quickly remedy situations which are immediately and clearly offensive from an environmental point of view.  Longer term measures and structures to secure amenity and development are by and large proper to planning, urban renewal and other environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>The Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940 enabled local authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites but only by acquisition or the threat of acquisition. Apart from the absence of other mechanisms to tackle the problem, the definition of derelict site in that Act was also very restrictive.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961 introduced a different approach by widening the scope of this definition and by attempting to facilitate voluntary clearance and improvement of objectionable lands and buildings by property owners.  This latter objective was never comprehensively fulfilled and although the 1961 Act provided also for statutory notices requiring the carrying out of works by owners, these were not availed of to any great extent.  Another limitation of the 1961 Act was that it did not apply to dwellings and could only be used when the sites had actually become dangerous or injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood.  In effect, the Act became relevant only when the site was totally derelict, and no mechanism existed for preventing the running down of many a fine neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Before examining the details of the present Bill, I wish very briefly to sketch the contemporary background of dereliction against which its main provisions should be viewed.</P>
    <P>Urban decay is an extensive reality of our times and is dealt with at some length <Col N="106" /> in the EC Fourth Environmental Action Programme (1987 to 1992) (Official Journal, 7 December 1987).  That programme notes that population and new investment have sought locations away from the older, industrial conurbations which have been badly affected by structural change in the economy, leaving high levels of unemployment, derelict or contaminated sites, vacant buildings and an ageing stock of housing and infrastructure. As a result the situation in 1985, according to the EC was that, in many European cities, conditions are substantially worse than they were 10 or 15 years ago.  The action programme concludes from this that urban environmental problems must now assume an increased priority in Community environmental policy.</P>
    <P>Dereliction has, unfortunately, become a growing problem in many towns and cities of Ireland also and is taking away from their attractiveness to the inhabitants, to tourists and to potential industrialists.  The problem in Dublin is more extensive and apparent, and has been more fully documented.  A recent report prepared by Dublin Corporation in connection with the review of their development plan revealed that the total land area derelict within the Canal Ring was some 160 acres &mdash; or almost seven times the size of St. Stephen's Green, and that it numbered some 600 derelict sites in all.  While the urban renewal programme is now making considerable inroads into this problem in the Quays and Christchurch area, There is clearly much more work to be done.</P>
    <P>Decline and change of individual areas is of course an inevitable feature of the life of cities and towns but at the same time it should be the duty of all public authorities to do whatever is possible to mitigate its worst effects.  There is a need for positive and aggressive action if the dereliction is to be overcome in the foreseeable future and a principal objective of the Bill will be to give local authorities a legislative framework within which to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> The main purpose of the Bill is to provide more effective arrangements against land dereliction.  The Bill also repeals the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, and restates its relevant provisions, thus consolidating the law on derelict sites, and provides for an annual levy on certain derelict sites in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The main new provisions of the Bill are: to require local authorities to maintain a register of all derelict sites; to place a general duty on owners and occupiers of land, including statutory bodies, to prevent land from becoming, or from continuing to be, a derelict site; to provide improved enforcement and preventive powers for local authorities in relation to derelict sites; to give the Minister for the Environment reserve powers to direct a local authority to take enforcement action or to improve a derelict site in their own ownership; to enable the Minister for the Environment, after consultation with the appropriate Minister, to direct any statutory body to dispose of derelict land in their possession which is not necessary for their functions; to improve the procedure for compulsory acquisition of derelict land by local authorities; to provide for an annual levy, based on market value, on certain derelict sites in urban areas; to increase penalties.</P>
    <P>I now propose to comment on some of the individual provisions of the new Bill. Since a fairly comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum has been circulated, I will approach this task summarily and selectively.</P>
    <P>Part I contains mainly standard provisions related to the general implementation of the Bill.  It does however provide certain important definitions in section 3, to which I will draw attention as they arise in later substantive sections of the Bill.  Section 4 sets out a new and wider definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;.  This improves on the earlier definition in a number of ways: it includes dwellings, which as I have said were excluded from previous derelict sites legislation, and it adds to the previous criteria for dereliction considerations such as the <Col N="108" /> neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of structures.  Taken in conjunction with sections 11 and 12, the new definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; will also allow action to be taken against potential or incipient dereliction, as well as against actual dereliction.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the range of measures being provided to prevent and control derelict sites.  Under section 9, local authorities will be obliged, within a year of the commencement of the Act, to establish and maintain a register of all the derelict sites within their area.  This is a mandatory provision which will secure the active involvement of all local authorities in administering this Bill.  It is a matter of record that only a minority of local authorities were active in administering previous derelict sites legislation. We cannot afford such an optional approach faced with the importance of the problem which I have earlier outlined.</P>
    <P>The register of derelict sites will clearly establish the scale of the problem of dereliction in each area.  It will facilitate suitable follow-up action, and in the case of relevant urban land, it will provide a basis for applying the derelict sites levy.</P>
    <P>Section 10 establishes it as a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to ensure that their land does not become or continue to be a derelict site.  This obligation will rest not just on private landowners, but on statutory bodies also, that is, the full range of semi-State and public sector bodies with the exception of Ministers of the Government and the Office of Public Works.  I will explain this exception in a moment when I deal with section 14.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places a concurrent general duty on the local authority to use their powers so as to prevent land within their functional area from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 provide for specific enforcement powers in relation to the general obligations established by sections 10 and 11.  The standard method of enforcement will be a notice from the local authority requiring specified remedial works to be undertaken.  Failure <Col N="109" /> to carry these out will be an offence.  If this notice is not complied with, then the local authority will also be empowered themselves to carry out the necessary measures and to recover the costs from the owner.  All remedial works of this kind will be exempted development for planning purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 13 gives back-up powers to the Minister for the Environment to ensure proper enforcement of the Bill.  He will be able by direction to require a local authority to issue an enforcement notice in a particular case, to require them to act further on a notice already issued, or to make the local authority remedy a derelict site in their own ownership.</P>
    <P>Section 14 enables the Minister to require any statutory body to dispose of its interest in any derelict site where he is satisfied that the land is not necessary for the performance of its functions by the statutory body.  Before making any such requirement, the Minister would first consult with the appropriate Minister as regards that statutory body.  Apart from the blight issue, the holding of land by public bodies can affect the land market in urban areas by restricting the supply and encouraging overpricing of urban land.  In their report on urbanisation in Dublin (No. 55 of 1981), the NESC commented on this aspect in the following terms: &ldquo;Local authority actions contribute to high values in that the absence of a development or sales policy for derelict sites acts to restrict supply and induce blight&rdquo; (para. 3.10).  The Bill therefore aims at bringing about a situation where land owned by public authorities is properly utilised and brought forward for development as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; does not, as I have said, extend to Ministers of Government or the Office of Public Works.  It would be inappropriate, and inconsistent with the concept of the collective responsibility of the Government, that the Minister for the Environment should be in the position of issuing formal statutory directions to fellow Ministers regarding disposal of their land interests or any other matter. <Col N="110" /> While such a provision might, in the narrow context of this Bill, have an appealingly robust character to it, it would not be conducive to responsible Government.  If I have a problem with the policy of another Minister regarding the use of his land, then that is a matter to be raised and settled by Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that, on reflection, Deputies will see the sense of this view.</P>
      <P>Sections 15 to 20 deal with the powers of local authorities to acquire derelict sites outright, whether by agreement or compulsorily.  The provisions involved differ mainly in respect of drafting from the 1961 Act and do not require comment at this stage.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill goes beyond previous derelict sites legislation by attempting to deal with the economics of urban dereliction.  Environmental economists point out that all pollution involves a degree of market failure, in that the polluter is encouraged to act anti-socially by the fact that he bears no financial responsibility for the external costs which he imposes, through his polluting activities, on others.</P>
      <P>This general principle finds ready application in the case of much urban dereliction.  Because for economic or other reasons, redevelopment of a site is not attractive to an owner in the short term, he has ready encouragement, reinforced by the fact that unoccupied property cannot be rated, to let his property run down.  The public rather than the individual is the loser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various proposals have been mentioned over the past 15 or so years for some financial disincentive to be applied which would discourage owners from letting properties run down and so redress the market failure underlying much urban dereliction.  The Bill's provisions in this regard are fairly simple ones.  In all urban areas, or in such county council <Col N="111" /> areas as the Minister may prescribe, an annual derelict sites levy will be imposed by local authorities on so called urban land.  Urban land is defined in section 3 to mean any derelict site in an urban area which is not in the ownership of the State or the levying local authority, is not an occupied dwelling and is not affected by a CPO or a local authority planning reservation.</P>
    <P>All urban land will have a market value placed on it by the local authority, with appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, once every five years.  Each year the Minister for the Environment will prescribe a proportion of the market value of land for the purposes of the levy.  This may be prescribed nationally, or for particular local authority areas, but in no case may it exceed 10 per cent.  The proportion applied to the market value will give the annual amount of the levy.</P>
    <P>As the Explanatory Memorandum emphasises, the primary purpose of the derelict sites levy is not to create additional revenues for local authorities, but to operate as an efficiency tax and secure better use of urban land.  Consistently with this principle, if a site is rendered non-derelict within a particular year, the levy for that year will be refunded or waived.  Special arrangements may also be operated, at the discretion of the local authority, for <i>bona fide</i> site assembly.  If the local authority agree, a developer will be able to tender a bond for five years of the levy instead of actually paying the levy.  Provided the full development is completed within the five year period, no levy would then be payable.  Finally, provision is made for the waiver of the levy by local authorities in cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>Superficially, the structure of the new levy may appear to have much in common with site value rating, that is, a system of rating property on the basis of its optimum rather than its actual use. However, the new levy will not pressurise owners to realise the fullest economic development of derelict properties; it will only require them to make their lands aesthetically acceptable and consistent <Col N="112" /> with other sound neighbouring properties. The Interdepartmental Committee on Local Finance and Taxation rightly concluded in their report (PRL 89) of some 20 years ago that &ldquo;ownership of land in our society does not carry with it the ability or the obligation to realise the full potential profit from that land&rdquo; (page 43 of report).  The new levy respects this important principle.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with prosecutions and offences.  These have been deliberately designed to keep within the limits of District Court jurisdiction, given the desirability, which I mentioned earlier, of confining this Bill to fairly simple measures and procedures.  Part V deals with miscellaneous and largely routine measures in support of the main provisions which I have already described.</P>
    <P>I would hope for the support of the whole House for this Bill, which provides a workable machinery for tackling dereliction in a manner reasonable to landowners and to the community alike.  I wish to emphasise that I am open to all constructive suggestions for its amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Bill. All of us who have had the opportunity of being members of local authorities not only in the city of Dublin but throughout the country would like to see the outdated legislation brought up to date to do something about the real problems of dereliction. Dereliction has been one of the greatest scourges of the scenic beauty of our country.  Tourists visiting Ireland see many derelict sites &mdash; the Minister mentioned 600 in this city &mdash; and I am sure there is no other city in Europe where so many derelict sites can be seen.  That shows how serious the problem is.  The owners are not entirely to blame when we consider how the Department and the county councils have dealt with the problem.  It must be admitted that they did not deal with this problem and they were the people who were supposed to implement a type of policy that we, as Members of this House and as members of local authorities, could be proud of.</P>

      <Col N="113" /> This Bill was initiated by the former Minister for the Environment.  No doubt the present Minister has put his stamp on it and I do not see anything wrong with that.  He would be failing in his duty if he did not put his stamp on it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I would like to deal with and the Minister referred to a few of them in his speech.  He referred to the 1961 legislation and the fact that it did not include private dwellings. The abolition of the pre-1940 grant scheme led to an increase in the number of derelict dwellings and derelict sites throughout the country.  But there could have been a big reduction in the number of these houses and derelict sites if, over the last ten years the owners had been given grants to develop the derelict sites and to make the derelict houses habitable. A positive approach should be adopted if we are to successfully tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to make relates to the Department of the Environment and their lack of decisiveness. For instance, in my constituency 12 or 18 months ago, Navan Urban Council made an application to the Department for permission to sell one or two old houses &mdash; roughly 100 years old.  Customers were available for the houses when they became vacant, but it took 12 to 18 months for the Department to say we could sell that property.  Because of the delay the houses in St. Patrick's Terrace were ransacked and turned into derelict sites.  I would like to put it on the record of the House that that is one of the reasons there are so many derelict sites in towns and cities.  If this was the case in the town I mentioned, it must be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We must put our house in order.  The officials in the Department who deal with those requests should not allow ten, 12 or 15 months to pass before making a decision.  As a result of the indecisiveness in the Department, that site is worth nothing.  It is a derelict site, and as such is a loss to the Exchequer.  I have many queries, along those lines and I am sure other Members have too.</P>
    <P>There are a few points on the Bill to <Col N="114" /> which I would like to refer.  Will acquisition under the Derelict Sites Acts be regarded as simple and free of the extensive and lengthy provisions of the Housing Act 1966?  Perhaps this Bill would afford the Minister an opportunity to update and simplify the 1966 procedure of acquisition.  The information I have is that that procedure is very lengthy and drawn out, and that it takes an incredible amount of time to deal with the particular problems of the site.  If we are introducing legislation like this we should make it as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>While we are updating the 1961 Act we should be simplifying the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (3) refers to annuity on land acquired and vested by the local authority and in my view, this will only serve to add an unnecessary and complex burden on the local authority.  I believe that the procedures for tha annuity on land acquired and vested by the local authorities can be simplified as well.  In this legislation, we should try to deal with this and make the procedures as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>The legislation directs the local authorities to provide lists and registers of the number of sites in their area.  I know that in my own county over the past number of years we have put together lists of the worst sites in the county and work has been done on ensuring that the people concerned were made aware that the local authority wanted something done about the situation.  I would be surprised if most of the local authorities have not taken a stance on this issue and taken decisions to ensure that the issue of derelict sites in scenic areas are dealt with. In my area, over the past three years we have put a system in train and have made lists of the derelict sites and we are getting the owners to do something about them.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that all urban land will have a market value placed on it by the local authority and that a levy not exceeding 10 per cent of the valuation may be imposed.  I wonder if this is the right approach?  We are all aware of the controversy surrounding valuations.  It will take time for the valuations to be agreed.  The Bill provides for a levy of 10 <Col N="115" /> per cent of the market value, and is this not substantially cheaper than rates on such sites in the cities?  On the basis of my knowledge, I think it probably will be cheaper and more than likely in a great many cases will bring in less money than rates.  I wonder if that is the road to take? I believe there will be a problem with consistency and I ask the Minister for his views on that.</P>
    <P>We are trying to do something positive about derelict sites.  What is the time-frame envisaged &mdash; I know it says a year in the Bill &mdash; to allow people time to appeal, to do something about the problem? If the county councils, urban councils and indeed some Government Departments get their house in order, I believe we will have a very speedy consensus on how to deal with people who have allowed sites to go derelict.  As the Minister has stated in his speech, people have allowed their sites to lie there thinking that some day they will realise a substantial amount of money from whatever source.  In taking that into consideration, we want to ensure that the legislation can be implemented and this brings me to the point I want to make on staffing.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states that minor costs only will arise in implementing the Bill and makes provision for the payment of additional staff if required.  Extra staff would only be required in the larger counties, in the cities and the major towns and people may be deployed to deal with the work.  If we are serious about tackling the problem that is the only way it can be done.  It is stated that the &ldquo;operation of the Bill's new powers and duties will entail additional staffing and administrative costs&rdquo;.  What powers will the local authorities have to employ additional staff? We all know that in all sections of the local authorities they are laden down with work because of the staff embargo and I ask the Minister if extra staff are needed to do this job will the Minister for Finance give approval for same?  The Explanatory Memorandum states that the cost of extra staffing will be offset in the case of urban <Col N="116" /> local authorities by income from the derelict sites levy.  However, the Minister has stated that the levy may be refundable following an appeal.  I think that that sort of stop-go financing will not work and it does not indicate we are serious about dealing with dereliction.  I would like an explanation of this.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the Bill with which I do not have any problem. With regard to the question of Ministers having in their ownership derelict sites, I have no doubt they can come to an agreement on this.  However, I do not know if that is such a good idea.  We are giving the local authorities more powers and no doubt they will use them to improve the derelict sites in their areas but the biggest single problem is that they may not have sufficient staff to do the job.  If they have not sufficient staff, what will the Minister do?</P>
    <P>The legislation proposes that there will be substantial improvements within the space of one year and we would like to see this happen.  I am sure my colleagues who have spent much more time on issues connected with the environment will comment on this issue.  While the Bill overall is very good, I think there are some points that need attention.  Following the Minister's response that he will look favourably at our amendments, I am sure the legislation will be improved and we would like to see it enacted as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister in his speech.  The objectives of those remarks are very worthy and I hope they will be carried through.  I am not certain that the Bill is an adequate vehicle in all respects for fulfilling the aspirations outlined by the Minister in his speech but I want to commend him in at least one respect. Some of us have had the pleasure of, as it were, working in this forum on a variety of issues and I have always found the Minister to be extremely approachable and conciliatory in taking on board the ideas, suggestions and comments of the spokespersons from all parties.  That is commendable and the Minister should be <Col N="117" /> thanked for doing so.  I hope he will not think it churlish of me to say in passing that it conflicts fairly sharply with the attitude of a colleague Minister who in recent days seems to believe that an idea is perhaps deficient if it comes from a party who are not as big as his own.  I suggest that that Minister should have a word with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, on how things should be done and how to deal with people at the same time without having to be bellicose, belligerent and downright arrogant.  I do not find any of that in the Minister for the Environment's approach to matters and hence I believe that if one did an assessment of the amount of legislation going through the Dáil one would find that the track records of both the parties involved reflect very favourably on the Minister here today, as opposed to the more noisy and empty comments of the Minister who seems to believe that threatening people will solve everything.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech set out many of the objectives which all of us concerned about derelict sites, urban decay and urban blight would wish to see achieved. However, I think a somewhat closer scrutiny of the Bill will show that there are very many escape clauses and escape hatches in it and that unfortunately it will not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many positive steps in the legislation before us and in due course I hope to tease out how some of these may not be successful unless they are amended.  The essence of the issue is whether we are genuinely serious about taking on the question of dereliction.  If we are to do this we have got to have in place reasonable incentives for people who want to develop land and perhaps, equally important, if not more so, severe and meaningful sanction for those who believe that there is an economic advantage at present in acquiring property or land and letting it become derelict.  That is where the balance lies now and unless it is changed nothing else will change. Certainly an indicator of a lack of desire or commitment on the part of the Government in that respect could <Col N="118" /> seriously be said to be the derisory fine now proposed in the Bill, a maximum of £1,000, which in today's property market could represent as little as one or two days increase in the value of a site which is left to one side by an owner.  I am convinced that if we look again at the whole approach to sanctions &mdash; I do not believe they are the best way of making progress but ultimately they have to be the final safeguard &mdash; the Bill is porous in that respect and if we are relying on a carrot and stick approach, certainly there is no stick in this Bill.</P>
    <P>An enterprising speculator who is anti-social, and not all speculators are, will have no problem whatsoever in side stepping the main thrust of what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill, despite the fact that we would share common ground with him on the general aspirations of it.</P>
    <P>Dereliction is a serious problem.  As the Minister said in his speech according to a recent survey in the city centre of Dublin, and I am conscious that Dublin is not the only urban conurbation in this country, there are 160 acres of land within the canal ring, which boils down to about 600 sites.  I do not think it is unreasonable to extrapolate from that that there are probably the best part of 2,000 acres of derelict sites in the greater Dublin area and depending on one's definition of &ldquo;derelict&rdquo; that could be greater or less because the interpretation of derelict by various local authorities is arbitrary and subjective and does not always accord to what would be legally necessary to, as it were, fall to be used in such a description.</P>
    <P>There is a large repository of unused land in this city and if we look at the reasons for that I think we will find it is because those who are engaged in the deliberate creation of dereliction find they are financially better off if they allow that to happen.  It is no more complex than that.  There are a number of interested owners in that general area who for one reason or another find it impossible to develop a piece of property or who can do very little with land which they have inherited.  I do not think we should use a sledge hammer to crack a <Col N="119" /> nut in those cases but the majority of the sites we are speaking about are owned by people who have standing in the community, who have reasonable access to resources, who own property apart from these derelict sites and in respect of whom there is no reasonable excuse for allowing them to continue to ride a coach and four through this city.  I believe that in principle what they are doing to the city is no different from what we continually berate young people for doing in other parts of the city.  We do not have any problem in ascribing various names and derogatory terms to these young people and handing out sentences before the courts to them but if it is the area of property speculation it has a slight aura of respectability about it.  It is about time we called it what it is no more than a form of social vandalism by the majority of these people, and it should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>A fine of £1,000 is not the answer, no more than is the proposal in the Bill that local authorities in certain cases may decide to waive the need to pay a levy and so on &mdash; a hardship clause.  I am interested in a political environment which legislates for creating a facility to evade on the basis of hardship for those who own property but which does not do so for many people who do not own any property and who nevertheless have to pay their bills and debts, even people on social welfare who do not find there is any escape from paying, for example, a tax on a pension, even if it happens to be an old age pension.  I am interested in that kind of juxtaposition because I believe it needs to be explained and defended.  I do not accept this position because people who have property have obligations.</P>
    <P>During the past decade all we ever heard when one talked about derelict sites in this city was the rights of private property.  It is about time that the Minister and the Government said that there are obligations attaching to property, that these obligations should be carried out and that if they are not carried out within a reasonable time the State will move in to take over that responsibility, <Col N="120" /> acquire the sites in question at values which are minimal and develop them and that if they cannot be developed immediately they will be handed over to local community interests who can use them in the interim and do so without apology to anyone, just as we would apprehend anybody who abused a person or property in the city.  It is no more than a shade on the same continuum.  People who fail to fulfil their obligations in regard to these sites are guilty of anti-social action.</P>
    <P>At any given time the local authority in Dublin city, which is only one of many and not even the biggest in the country, would deal with something of the order of 300 sites which are deemed to be derelict. I suspect that is a minority of the sites which are truly derelict because those are sites which for one reason or another have come to the attention of the local authority, perhaps arising out of repeated complaints from public representatives, local communities or whatever. This is a serious problem and I am not convinced that the Bill goes far enough.  I believe the ultimate sanction has to be available, and that the ultimate sanction is the twin combination of a sufficient financial fine or sanction which says that at last it is now no longer profitable to let a site sit, that one had better develop it or get rid of it.  Up to now many owners believed that if they let a site sit it would be worth more at the end of the year.  This has to stop.  It means that the Bill has to be changed so that the fines provided for are in some way indexed to the appreciating value of the site, or perhaps a multiple of that.  Above all, people should know that for the first time the State is serious about this problem and that there is no longer a percentage in abusing one's neighbours and city by allowing sites to become derelict.</P>
    <P>As well as that &mdash; and I have some experience in this respect &mdash; the compulsory purchase acquisition procedure needs to be addressed.  It would be wrong to imply, for example, that all of the problem is being created by, as it were, unknown suspect private individuals who own parcels of land.  A significant contribution to the problem of dereliction in <Col N="121" /> this city and country is being made by Government Departments, semi-State bodies, health boards and local authorities who own between them very substantial land banks, much of which is allowed to become derelict in effect over many years, perhaps as long as ten, 15 or 20 years.  They are a huge part of the problem.  As Shakespeare asked one time &ldquo;Who will whip the whippers?&rdquo; We are placing the onus on the local authorities to chase the people who are abusing the rest of us.  I admit that the Minister has an ultimate sanction here.  The reality, however, is that in the normal course of events, the local authority will deem what is derelict, who pays the levy, and will exercise discretion as to whether a site is derelict.  With the best will in the world towards those local authorities, there is a conflict of interest here.  Naturally enough, their desire will be to keep that list to a minimum because they have to have regard to the implications, they have to call on people, send out notices, engage in all the bureaucracy and so on attached to it.  If the average hard pressed local authority clerical officer must make a choice, he will simply say that on balance it might be as well if they gave that property the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>In terms of compulsory purchase order procedure, local authorities have serious problems.  I cannot understand why we did not long ago try to compress the whole compulsory purchase order procedure so that there is not, in effect, a scale of development in terms, say, of housing.  My colleague, Deputy Quinn, will be very familiar with that from his time as Minister and as city councillor.  It can take as long as two decades to put together a site of 30 or 40 houses because of the ridiculous, outdated, antediluvian procedure of acquiring sites.  There is a particular site on the North Circular Road which is dear, or at least near to my heart, which I remember passing for something like 14 years when going to school and I think it is in the same condition as it was before I started going to school.  I was told that it was in the ownership of a local authority.  Some progress was made in the past few years <Col N="122" /> but it is still only at a certain stage of development because of an open-ended appeal by each individual owner to the highest courts, not just in this country but abroad.  I am not necessarily against that, but I am against the fact that that can take years.</P>
    <P>If there is a particular problem about the arbitration mechanism for adjudging values or acquiring property, perhaps it is time we decided to set up some sort of subsystem within the court environment where property would be dealt with independently, where all compulsory purchase orders would be decided on expeditiously, where the work would be done, not by circumscribing or whittling away people's rights but by dealing with the matter in a speedy fashion over a limited period of time.  It is quite preposterous that a significant contribution to urban blight has been caused by people who are elected, appointed to look after the public interest, but that is how it is right now.  This refers not only to local authorities but to Government Departments and health boards.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the comment in the Minister's speech, or indeed in the Bill, which says apparently that there will be one rule for the State and another for the ordinary citizen.  The thinking of my party is to the opposite.  It is that the State should give a lead, if anything, and that certainly there should be no exemptions for the State in this regard.  The State, by definition, will always be a major component in the property market and in the whole area of public policy, in the creation of certain infrastructural provisions, housing, hospitals and so on, and, therefore, they are involved in the land business and the acquisition business. If the environment in which they do that is seen to be one where people are subsconsciously encouraged to be slow or lethargic, then they will be, but they should not be.  A citizen should be able to believe that the property up the road owned by a private speculator who has decided to long finger it and the property owned by a health board that have decided to long finger it, perhaps for very laudable reasons in both cases in terms <Col N="123" /> of making some profit, will be treated the same in terms of the law.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the Derelict Sites Bill we must also address the question of ownership.  One of the problems that local authorities have had is that of finding out who actually owns the land. Quite honestly, there is not at present any even-handed approach to registration of ownership.  In some local authority areas there is no compulsory, mandatory obligation on anybody to register ownership. It is not uncommon for somebody to sell a site to a company or an individual and for that new owner not to register that ownership.  How then can we be serious about derelict sites and the pursuing of such owners, about levying them, if we do not even oblige them to register that interest?  That is minimal.  If we are going to tackle this problem we must at least have the resourses in terms of information on hand to be able to pursue people.</P>
    <P>The question of a levy is important in this respect.  If there are people out there who are recalcitrant and obstructive in terms of public policy, who do not want to play ball, who have avoided existing legislation, dodged and ducked, perhaps gone through the courts and resubmitted proposals, made planning applications at the last moment so that the local authority back off and then change the planning application, the matter will go on for ever.  The Minister knows more about that than I do.  If people have behaved like that up to now with their present status, they will do the same with the levy.  There is no way of enforcing the levy.  I do not know how you can get from somebody actual hard cash if you cannot already get from them compliance in improving their property.  It boils down to the same thing; that is, co-operation with public policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>Unless you seriously improve the sanctions &mdash; from the point of view of the Legislature, that is &mdash; I cannot see how you will get that compliance.  Those people will simply run a coach and four through the levy, also.  They will change <Col N="124" /> addresses, dodge and duck, delay payment. You will not be able to find them, in the first place, because there is no registration of ownership on a mandatory basis.  Instead of trying to get people to improve or develop their property, you will be chasing them for a levy, which would be at all times only a tiny fraction of the value by which the land has appreciated during the time when you have been pursuing the matter.  If we are to be serious about this, we should take it on four square and tell people that from now on we believe that the obligations of those who own land and property is at least as important as their rights, that those obligations are to the whole community and will be treated seriously.  If these people continue to obstruct public policy beyond reasonable limits, they are deeming themselves no longer fit to retain ownership and the State, acting for the common good, will do it for them.</P>
    <P>That is an essential part of public policy in this respect.  I know that some would say that it is going too far, or is not adequate, but it is essential.  The strange thing is that if you decide to go down that road the likelihood is that you will never have to use that power.  It means for the first time that you are serious and once you are serious then the boys and girls who have these properties and are in the business of riding a coach and four through existing law will decide it is time for them to begin to perform instead of sitting on property and land, as they are at present.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would be interested in finding out if the Minister has checked out the constitutionality of the levy.  I certainly hope it is constitutional, but have one or two small reservations at the back of my mind in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  The question of establishment of ownership is serious. That underpins the whole Bill.  If we are not going to be able to get to the owner, we will have a problem.  My experience, <Col N="125" /> and that of officials working in that area of public policy, would indicate that there is a problem there.  There is no reference to that in the Bill that I have seen.  The Minister might consider an amendment to oblige local authorities to register all ownership.  Right now, the Bill will operate on the basis, as I understand it, of a register and that register will be drawn up by the local authority.  However, it is a register only of derelict sites.  The definition of dereliction, its interpretation, will rest with the individual local authority.  I wonder if we will get great unevenness in that register as between one local authority and another, knowing, as a local authority will, that depending on how voluminous the register is, there will be an increase in their workload.  That increase in workload I have some sympathy with because all public bodies are increasingly hard pressed, but there is still some slack in some.  In some cases at least they will simply not have the resources to pursue the Bill in its entirety.  Will the Minister issue guidelines about this register? Would it concern him, for example, if he found that it was being taken on board seriously in one area and not in another which latter authority, presumably, would be able to escape their onus of responsibility here?</P>
      <P>I also note in the Bill that much of the interpretation of what should go on the register and how the levy should be interpreted boils down to words like &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. This word is mentioned a number of times in the Bill.  I shall not go into the Bill in detail now but an example is &ldquo;the name and address of each owner and occupier where these can be obtained by reasonable inquiry...&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is extremely subjective. If the local authority write to the last known address of a person who owns a piece of land, they will have made a reasonable inquiry.  It will not, however, solve the problem.  I am not convinced that the Bill has the necessary steel to make it work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; occurs later in the Bill where it is provided that it shall be the duty of every owner and occupier <Col N="126" /> of land, including a statutory body, to take all reasonable steps to ensure that land does not become, or does not continue to be, a derelict site.  This is heralded as a major new provision, but it is not worth the paper it is printed on.  The fact that people are told there is an obligation on them to look after their land will have no effect; they will simply carry on.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about the interplay of economic forces on the urban landscape.  It is about people deciding specifically to acquire property and to let it lie derelict for a period.  These are people who do not respond to injunction or plea.  If the Minister decides to treat them seriously and threatens to take over the job from them, they will know the game is up.  This Bill in itself does not mean the game is up.  There is a different focus of attention as between the Bill and the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>All Deputies have an opportunity in the context of this Bill to make a real assault on the problem of urban blight. Recently some people in this city who were about to apply for planning permission knocked down some buildings without giving the obligatory notice to the statutory authority.  The planning authority have yet to make a decision, but the statutory responses and sanctions in the face of deliberate, sustained assault on the fabric of the city are minuscule and irrelevant in comparison with the steadfast decision on the part of this kind of person to ride roughshod over the rights of the community.  This Bill may be the only chance this decade to do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with penalties.  Is the fine of £1,000 a genuine token of the Minister's earnest desire to tackle this problem?  If that is the watermark of his commitment, he is not serious.  My party will be tabling amendments, on which we hope to get some measure of acceptance from the Government.  We need a toughness of approach which is not implicit in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We all hope the Bill will work but my years of experience on the local authority scene lead me to believe it will not.  It is <Col N="127" /> not an accident that we have derelict sites and buildings and the problem cannot be dealt with by a flippant approach, an appeal to good nature or the minuscule sanction of £1,000.  A very different approach is required and the Minister must at least threaten to put the boot in. Nothing else will work.  The people he is dealing with have no hesitation in using the boot in any street in this city or elsewhere in the country.  The evidence of such activities is not pleasant.  The Minister should look at some of the cities in Europe, who would not tolerate for six months what we have tolerated for decades. There they make people understand that the State will act aggressively in pursuit of the common good.  This Bill will not allow the Minister or the local authorities to take such action and it needs to be amended if it is to succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his flush of legislative energy.  Quite an amount of legislation is coming from his Department but I should like to finish the first course before moving to the dessert. Until such time as we have the Building Control Bill completed and in place, with the regulations in operation, we will still have to live with unnecessary and arbitrary costs.  Now that there is a degree of upturn in the construction industry generally, the absence of a secure framework in that area represents a severe, unnecessary and self-imposed cost.  I hope the Minister's success in securing time for this Bill and the Building Societies Bill does not augur ill for the completion of the Building Control Bill.</P>

      <P>I know it will be before the House tomorrow, but we have a long road to travel.  I do not want to detract from this Bill, which I welcome unreservedly. Obviously there are additional points and amendments which could be added.  The Bill has been a long time in gestation and perhaps some of the weaker <Col N="128" /> points signal some of the private compromises.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains ten main provisions which will be welcomed by all of us who are members of local authorities which have an urban component.  The first provision is designed to widen the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;.  Secondly, local authorities are to be required to maintain a register of all derelict sites.  Both these provisions are necessary.  Let us hope in respect of the second that the local authorities will not plead lack of resources. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what steps, if any, are necessary in that regard. In my view there are many underemployed local authority engineers and others who could run that register.  The third provision places the general duty on owners and occupiers of land to prevent land from becoming, or continuing to be, a derelict site.  The Minister talked about the derelict sites levy as an efficiency tax, which is a fine concept.  Such a tax would prevent land from becoming derelict and would act as a spur to the owners of derelict land to put it to some use.</P>
      <P>The fourth provision places a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps.  That is a much bigger issue and I will come back to it at some general length because we are looking at one of the great villains of the piece in relation to the problem of dereliction in urban areas. The fifth provision is to improve tne enforcement powers.  Deputy Keating spoke about the realistic scale of the penalties and we will have to look at that on Committee Stage.  The sixth provision deals with reserve powers for the Minister, which are certainly necessary, particularly where a local authority fails, for whatever reason, at local level to carry out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seventh provision enables the Minister to direct a statutory body and the exemptions he has given to himself and other colleagues.  I should like to talk in some detail about that because I have direct experience in that regard and I do not share his confidence in the ability of Government Departments to stay on an even keel.  However, I will refer to that <Col N="129" /> later.  The eighth provision provides for improved procedures in relation to compulsory purchase orders with which I am sure we all agree.  I also have some thoughts on the annual levy on the range of prices and how it might be administered. However, we should not be over concerned about this, we should give ourselves some flexibility.  If we get it wrong, let us give ourselves some room to make it right.  We are talking about an uncertain market, how big the stick should be and how juicy the carrot.  If we do not get it right the first time we should not feel impeded by being unable to alter it.  I urge the Minister to bear that in mind. The tenth provision is to increase penalties, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>They are ten very worthwhile aims and objectives in this legislation.  I will now comment on why we should talk about them and our collective experience in this House in relation to where the focus of attention will be.</P>
    <P>I originally represented the Pembroke Ward of Dublin City Council and I now represent Dublin South-East which runs from the River Liffey to the River Dodder and from the coast in as far as Clanbrassil Street.  It is probably as good and representative a cross section of the rich and poor slices of urban Ireland as you will come across.  As I described on another occasion, my constituency runs all the way from the Iveagh Hostel to Ailesbury Road.  It encompasses all classes and groups of people, types of housing and indeed types of sites in between.</P>
    <P>The biggest single cause of urban blight &mdash; I had been thinking about this before I rose to speak &mdash; and the biggest single landowner of derelict sites in my constituency is undoubtedly Dublin Corporation. The second biggest holder of blighted and derelict sites is a statutory body.  For example, the State until quite recently owned the Sweepstakes site in Ballsbridge; it was not necessarily a derelict site but it easily came close to the definition.  The abandoned old Army barracks at Beggars' Bush is in disputed ownership between the local authority and <Col N="130" /> the Office of Public Works.  I could go on.</P>
    <P>In looking at the focus of our attention, which is how we deal with derelict sites, we must look a little bit further and ask how we deal with those statutory bodies who are outside market forces and who do not have to take account of them.  We have experienced a rising and receding urban property market in the past eight or nine years but, for a variety of self-evident reasons, the private owners of property have been forced either by a rising market tide or a receding one, to develop or dispose of their sites.  It is a unique characteristic of those sites which have been owned by statutory authorities who are not subject to market forces that such sites have not moved one way or the other although, of course, there are exceptions.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the provisions in the Bill &mdash; which perhaps were inserted in the Bill before it got Cabinet or departmental assent &mdash; and to ask him to look at them carefully.  Let me give a specific example. Not more than 500 metres from where I currently stand, in Upper Merion Street there is a superb terrace of Georgian houses which has, despite the logic of all rising market forces, remained quasi derelict.  While I do not wish to disrupt the thrust of a rising market tide from which the State might benefit let me give an example of how much persuasive powers one Cabinet colleague might have over another.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as a Cabinet Minister I was approached by a senior representative of statutory tourism interests in the city to see if one of the 15 houses which was vacant on Upper Merrion Street could, for the time being, be made available to a Dublin statutory tourism body on a temporary leased basis until the Office of Public Works had made up their mind what they wanted to do with the property and had the capital provision to implement it.  Pending the arrival of that heady day, the tourism body would, at no cost to central Government, have taken over the building in question.  They would have fitted it out and furnished it <Col N="131" /> so that all the tourists who came to Dublin to look at our fine Georgian squares would be able to see the inside of a Georgian building.  You can do that in Bath and other major cities with a strong Georgian tradition and which, uniquely as a tourist coming to this city, you cannot do.  I am speaking about 1984 or 1985. Despite what I thought was the consummate logic and common sense of my argument, the Office of Public Works and the senior Department, in spite of my persuasive powers, declined the offers of the tourism interests.  At the end of the day &mdash; this perhaps is more a testimony of my failure to persuade a fellow Cabinet Minister than the validity of the case &mdash; it was a departmental head to head whereby the Department of Finance, on the advice of the Office of Public Works, argued that on security grounds the houses had to be left as they were.  I offer that with a degree of circumspection to protect some of the innocent, if not the guilty.  The idea that Government Departments left to their own devices will allow common sense to prevail is patent nonsense because the building to which I referred is in a worse state of dereliction today than it was then and thousands of tourists have come through the squares of Georgian Dublin and have been unable to benefit from what would have been provided.</P>
    <P>I give that anecdotal example to query whether the Minister's proposal in this regard is wise.  He can take it from the content of my contribution that he can expect an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will, but the essence and the principle remain the same.  It is a good example to use because it is so glaringly stupid.  When we talk about the problems of dereliction the Minister for the Environment should look overall at the factors that in some <Col N="132" /> cases bring about dereliction.  It is nonsensical to introduce basically good legislation &mdash; in so far as we can evaluate it on Second Stage &mdash; and still allow local authorities to draw up grandiose development plans which will have as their consequence an imposed constraint on private or local authority owners of land or other statutory bodies from developing their own property.</P>
      <P>I want to give another related example and to ask the Minister and his advisers how they might respond.  There are legal problems which could very well have a constitutional dimension and I know the Minister and his advisers must have sought advice in relation to them.  Without being parochial or confined to my own constituency the principle is applicable throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us talk about a case where owners of private property along a particular street have been forced not to reinvest because they have been told by the local authority that any reinvestment post the date of the confirmation of the road widening line would not be the subject of compensation and in time the property becomes derelict.  What would happen in the event of the local authority deciding to change the line?  Lest I be open to the charge of speaking in abstract terms, let me be more specific.  Along the side of Charlemont Street there is a wide, open derelict site, a different kind of dereliction which I will refer to in a few moments.  As Deputy Stafford may know, the local authority have changed the road widening line three times in respect of the lower part of Lower Charlemont Street to the junction of Harcourt Street.  By their actions they have done more damage than the Wehrmacht or the Luftwaffe would have done to that area had we been a participant in the last world war.  Who would be held responsible for this dereliction if we were to attach a development levy or tax to that site?  A private property owner could, if he engaged consultants or professionals, argue with a degree of logic and with some justice that this dereliction was not of his choosing, was not caused through neglect on his part, but rather was a <Col N="133" /> consequence of ill thought out local authority action.  I put this forward in support of a variable levy or tax that we should attach to derelict sites.  Such a levy should range from between 3 per cent to 10 per cent of the market value of the site.  I would like the Minister to consider such a variable levy because there are cases where dereliction has been caused by forces not within the control of the private owner.  Here I am not referring to property, ownership of which is the subject of dispute within families, or property belonging to a person who dies intestate and the family of whom cannot come to an agreement as to what the share out should be.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years I have visited on a regular basis Lough Sheelin in County Cavan which is about a one and a half hour drive from Dublin.  In that time I have witnessed the disintegration of very fine country homes, two up, two down cottages, two storey houses and cottages.  Many of these houses lie in ruins today.  New houses have been built alongside these.  This area is not a million miles away from Deputy Farrelly's constituency and I am sure he could testify to the fact that throughout the length and breadth of County Meath many properties have fallen into disrepair.  At the same time local authorities have been building one off cottages.  We do not seem to have any mechanism which would allow local authorities to acquire property such as that belonging to the Farrelly family, members of which are now living in Boston, Birmingham, Brisbane and New York and the value of which could be fixed with the result that the property could be restored.  This could be done instead of a local authority building new cottages.  I would be interested in hearing whatever comments the Minister may have to make in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am presuming that the kind of property to which I refer comes under the new definition of a derelict site as contained in the Bill.  Unless the Minister makes some provision which would enable local authorities to deal with this problem we are going to continue to witness marvellous new modern houses being built <Col N="134" /> alongside houses which have fallen into disrepair.  Technically these properties are on the market but the cost of carrying out a legal search and obtaining the consent of the various members of a family is too prohibitive relative to the absolute value of the property in question.  Unless the regulations and the policy directives the Minister will devise consequent on the enactment of this legislation will enable local authorities with a large rural base to their functional area to deal adequately with this problem of dereliction, the entire problem will not be dealt with because it is not simply an urban problem.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I wish to say at this stage.  When we reach Committee Stage we will be able to deal with this matter at some length but I would like the Minister to bear in mind what the consequences may be if local authorities offload property onto the urban land market.  Presuming that this Bill will come into force on 1 January 1990, not an unreasonable commencement date, and if by next year local authorities will not be building any new houses &mdash; I am not going to get into the arguments of that debate one way or another &mdash; but at that stage local authorities who acquired land in central city areas for housing or residual land for road widening purposes may find that that land is surplus to needs because they have no proposals for the redevelopment of the land or because the original development plans cannot be funded in the foreseeable future.  The Minister may issue a direction that they dispose of that land within a short period. Such land then, coming onto the market for the first time and all together, perhaps, may cause disruption of the market in that there would be a glut of property on offer.  Because the local authority officials involved would want to ensure that their files did not contain any incriminating documentation, they would offload this land irrespective of the cost. We could then find land which had been acquired on behalf of the community being sold off very cheaply, for half nothing.  That would not be in the community's interest.  I would like to think <Col N="135" /> that in the regulations or the policy directives the Department would have for the disposal of such land, there would be a strategy for trying to find constructive developers, community interests, housing co-operatives or other such bodies who could acquire that land for developments of a desirable nature.  Having deprived local authorities of the capital funds necessary to complete construction projects and having failed to tackle the problem if the Minister were to give a direction to offload all land surplus to need within a short period of time we could be throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I would like to think that a local authority would be required to draw up an urban strategy before this legislation would come into effect fully.</P>
    <P>What I am saying here about local authorities would also apply to Government Departments.  The Minister in consultation with the local authorities should be able to give a direction to another Department to do something with land in their possession, either to develop it or to sell it.  I will be moving against the provision in the relevant section which would exempt them from any such direction retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make relates to land acquired through a compulsory purchase order by a statutory authority, for example, CIE in the city centre of Dublin, with the help and assistance of the local authority which land is not going to be used for the purposes for which the CPO was invoked in the first instance.  If that land is deemed to be surplus to their requirements and in a state of dereliction or potential dereliction and therefore comes within the ambit of the administration of that statutory authority to the extent that they feel they are covered by the provisions of this Bill, soon to be an Act, what protection or cover have the taxpayers to ensure that a person who was originally affected by that CPO cannot come back at the statutory body or local authority and say he has a double claim for compensation, that he was forced out, and that the local authority have not gone ahead with the CPO in the <Col N="136" /> original sense?  That is a variation on a problem that has existed in the past.  I would like some clarification from the Minister in relation to this requirement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the final emergence of this legislation from the Department of the Environment.  I congratulate the Minister for being able to bring it to this stage of completion.  As indicated by those who have spoken so far on this side of the House, we are trying to respond constructively. With regard to the kind of levy we put on derelict sites, I am not sure what the most effective form would be.  It is a form of carrot and stick.  If it can be legally done, I would be in favour of a range of levies or an escalating levy that accumulates over time; if it is not paid in the first year, the longer you hold on to the property the more expensive it becomes.  There should obviously be ways in which the cost of the levy is fixed as a charge to the site, but if we are talking of something between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the market value, it will discount or depress the price when the property is finally sold.  That order of magnitude on balance seems right, but I have sought professional assistance from our own people on this Bill and since it was published rather recently I have not had the full benefit of their response. However, on Committee Stage we should be in a better position to respond to that.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is open to our suggestions on that.  I think all of us on Second Stage are agreed that the levy should function as an efficiency tax, therefore the percentage arrived at should be the finely tuned balance between incentive and disincentive.  At this stage, I cannot go beyond that and fix a figure.  The problem about urban land economics is that a figure that would be right for one sector of the city would not necessarily be right for another or a figure right for rural Ireland would not necessarily be right for urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister can use this legislation with the other legislation to have some sense of coherent urban renewal policy for local authorities we may very well run the risk of forcing local authorities to abandon indiscriminately, to <Col N="137" /> get rid of or walk away from portions of land they have accumulated or acquired and which at present, for reasons which are self-evident, they have not the money to develop and service, even though they might like to do so.  Therefore, they offload this land on to an uneven urban market and probably compound a problem of development that is unsatisfactory or not socially desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party generally welcome this Bill as it is a considerable improvement on the terms of the 1961 Derelict Sites Act in that it widens considerably the definition of what constitutes a derelict site and for the first time makes provision for the imposition of a derelict sites tax or levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that the record of this country at national and local levels in relation to derelict sites has been appalling and the situation in the capital city of Dublin and other larger cities has been dreadful.  Large parts of Dublin have been deliberately run down and allowed to become derelict by speculators who had no interest in the appearance of our cities and the environmental consequences of such dereliction but were interested only in making as great a profit as possible.  Those who visit Ireland are often shocked at the extent of the dereliction in our towns and cities.  Any Irish person here who has visited great cities, such as Paris, Amsterdam and Moscow has come home with a great sense of shame about what is being done to our cities and towns.  A derelict site is a rarity in the cities I have mentioned.  A derelict site is all too common a feature of the urban landscape in most of our towns and cities.  Damage has been done in many parts of Dublin.  Areas of great architectural, historical and social interest &mdash; such as Mountjoy Square &mdash; one can observe, have been deliberately vandalised by speculators, and large areas of the inner city have been similarly abused. It is not just the city centres that have suffered this appalling blight.  Many suburban areas have been plagued by derelict sites, unfinished and rubble strewn <Col N="138" /> building sites, derelict and vandalised houses and so on.</P>
    <P>Derelict sites diminish the quality of life for everyone except the speculators. Speculators know, with the way land and building prices have been going in recent years, all they have to do is acquire a building or site, remove the roof, let it fall into disrepair, ignore it for a few years and the value of the site or building will grow far faster than the rate of inflation, so their investment will increase in value at a greater rate than if they had put their money into something like job creation or even simply into a bank or building society.  For the rest of society, however, the results of this money grabbing approach have been negative.  Derelict sites diminish the quality of life for people in many ways.  Apart from the unsightly nature of many of the sites, derelict sites or buildings can cause structural damage to adjoining buildings, leaving them vulnerable, attracting irresponsible dumping and causing health hazards by acting as breeding grounds for rats.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is an important step forward, it is not a full solution to the problem.  We can see problems about certain sections of the Bill and their implementation.  The decision to impose a derelict sites levy is particularly welcome. We have introduced an amendment to every successive Finance Bill since 1982 seeking the introduction of such a tax or levy, without success, but an indication of some progress is that Fianna Fáil have now come round to accepting the need for this measure.</P>
    <P>We are concerned, however, that the Bill sets the upper limit for a derelict sites levy at 10 per cent of the market value. Given the way land prices have gone in recent years, this may not be adequate. A speculator on a particularly valuable site could decide to leave it derelict, pay the levy and still end up with a fat profit. We believe that the upper limit should be removed.  Given the fact that local authorities will have the responsibility for policing and administering the whole scheme, why should the levy not be set by them?  Local authorities would be in <Col N="139" /> the best position to assess what level of levy particular sites should carry.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems both in relation to the imposition of the levy and other provisions of the Bill which arise from the definition of derelict site in section 4.  I accept that it is difficult to come up with a comprehensive, watertight definition of derelict site, but the definition used in section 4 could give rise to a number of problems.  Section 4 refers to any derelict site which, &ldquo;detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood...&rdquo;. Could this mean, for instance, that what would be considered to be a derelict site in an area of expensive housing would not be a derelict site in areas of cheaper housing, local authority estates, flat complexes and so on?  There is, we believe, an argument for setting specific criteria in relation to buildings and sites over and above those contained in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 4.  It might be difficult to do this by legislation, but it could certainly be done by ministerial order or regulation.</P>
    <P>In the same way, this could clearly affect the amount of levy payable as this would be determined by the market value of the land.  Buildings, land and sites are all inevitably more valuable in areas where land and houses already attract a high price, and lower in those areas where land and housing is cheaper.  This could lead to an anomalous situation where somebody has a small site in an upmarket area, which they cannot afford to maintain, could face a substantial levy, while a speculator who owns a site in a down-market area would escape with a small levy.  There is an argument for the establishment of a minimum levy, irrespective of the value.</P>
    <P>We are concerned also at the exclusions.  The levy will not apply to land owned by a State authority, by a local authority within its own functional area, occupied dwellings or land affected by a compulsory purchase order or a planning reservation.  It has to be said that the public sector, and local authorities, have <Col N="140" /> been major offenders in relation to derelict sites.  It is not too long since there were trees growing out of buildings directly across the road from the Merrion Square entrance to Leinster House, which are owned by the Office of Public Works.  The way in which local authorities have been starved of adequate funds by successive Governments has meant that they have not been able to deal with derelict sites in their own areas. There has been a particular problem in Dublin with houses owned by Dublin Corporation but located in the Dublin County Council area.  Houses have regularly been vandalised and even set on fire, very often because the corporation simply did not have the money to pay for security cover for vacant houses.  In the end, of course, the cost of refurbishing those houses is far greater than the cost of providing security would have been.</P>
    <P>The public sector at national and local levels have a responsibility to set the highest possible standards in ensuring that sites owned by the public do not become derelict.  It would clearly not make sense to have a local authority levying themselves for sites within their own areas, but they must not be allowed to escape the obligations in the Bill placed on others.</P>
    <P>There must also be concern that the procedures in the Bill are unnecessarily complex and may give speculators many opportunities to escape its provisions. The procedures for putting a site on the register on the first place are quite complex and, of course, then there is the provision for appeals to the valuation tribunal over the value put on a site.  As we have seen in relation to the planning laws, speculators can afford to retain the most accomplished and expensive lawyers in the country.  They have been able to run rings around local authorities when it came to the planning applications and I hope we will not be faced with a similar situation in relation to derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I understand that up to this a site which was railed off or surrounded by a hoarding was not considered to be a derelict site.  I would ask the Minister to confirm if this is still the situation.  If it is, it is a <Col N="141" /> major flaw which needs to be addressed. It is relatively cheap for any speculator to put up a 6ft. hoarding and slap a drop of paint on it.  That does not mean that the site is not derelict.  A site like that can still present environmental hazards and detract from the whole area.  There has been a site like this in O'Connell Street, Dublin, for the past ten years which has been like a missing tooth in the streetscape.  A previous speaker referred to the problem of identifying owners of derelict sites.  We would like to see local authorities given more power to pursue the owners of such sites.</P>
    <P>Generally, we welcome the Bill with the exception of the reservations I have expressed.  I hope it will mean the end of derelict sites in our towns and cities.  If that happens our environment will be greatly improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  In my four years as a member of Dublin Corporation one of the greatest problems I have come across is that of derelict sites.  Some of the small derelict sites have created great problems for local representatives, residents' associations and community councils.  Two or three houses in one street may be left derelict.  There is hardly a street in the inner city of Dublin that does not have at least one derelict site.  I am pleased that a provision such as section 4 has been included because heretofore it was impossible to move against the owners of derelict sites. I accept that very often there are genuine reasons houses become derelict but the owners have a responsibility to those who live adjacent to those buildings. Those people, at great cost to themselves, keep their own property in good repair.  We are all aware that within a short time of one or two buildings in a street becoming derelict the whole street will be run down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I only learned last week that the Bill would be discussed this week because I would have liked to have had more time to prepare my contribution. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he would listen to any sensible suggestions made during the <Col N="142" /> course of the debate.  In my view the quality of life means being left to live in the comfort of one's own home and not to have adjoining buildings allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>In most cases buildings are allowed to become derelict by speculators whether individuals or builders who may feel if they leave them idle sufficiently long, they will get a better price on eventual sale.  Gardiner Street in my constituency is located on the route from Dublin Airport to the city centre.  At the top end of that street on both sides there are some magnificent dwellings which would qualify for urban renewal grants.  Yet there are perhaps six of them which have been allowed to become derelict already while other house owners on the same street have endeavoured manfully to maintain them in good repair.</P>
    <P>When we have been approached by the owners of those houses kept in good repair we local authority members and public representatives have discovered that, because of the law obtaining there was no way the owners of those badly maintained premises could be forced to do anything with them.  We have felt totally powerless at times to do anything to help.</P>
    <P>However, the provisions of this Bill will enable something be done about such premises.  We must remember the principle of the carrot and the stick.  Where there appears to be no endeavour on the part of the owners of such properties to maintain them in good repair, I believe they should be acquired by compulsory purchase order which I know is a long, difficult exercise but after all, some premises have taken ten to 15 years to fall down.  Even if it takes a couple of years to acquire such premises, at least those people endeavouring to maintain the remainder of the area in good repair will feel something is being done about the problem.</P>
    <P>I note that the fine to be imposed for contravention of the provisions of this Bill shall, on summary conviction, not exceed £1,000.  The Minister has said that he would examine that provision.  The concept of there being anything up to a <Col N="143" /> 10 per cent fine on the offending property will help.  When the provisions of this Bill are enacted it would be my hope that the owners of such badly maintained properties would move quickly either to dispose of them or proceed with their renovation, using them for the purpose for which they were built originally.  Any funds raised through the imposition of fines should go to local authorities.  I have always been supportive of the principle of giving local authorities adequate powers. Although local authorities will have to have recourse to the Minister, it is good that they are being given additional powers under the provisions of this Bill. The Minister is aware of the problems obtaining with regard to such properties and sites and also that there are defects in the provisions of this Bill.  However I am confident that he will do all in his power to overcome these problems.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there have always been what might be termed the ordinary, small speculator endeavouring to form a tract of land on which to build some development.  However, there were also the larger scale speculators who bought property, did absolutely nothing with it, leaving it to fall into ruin.  It was a shame to see some of the beautiful old houses around the city, some not far from the centre, being allowed become derelict in that way.  Ultimately this meant the local planning authority had no option but to allow their owners knock them down and build more valuable houses on the site.  That was a crying shame, a blight on our society which must be eliminated.  I know that my party will do their best in that endeavour.</P>
    <P>There are also sites owned by Government or semi-State bodies.  Sometimes they contend that, while they own such property or sites they do not know to what use they will put them.  They are allowed to leave such premises idle or sites unused.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  They must decide to use such premises, putting forward plans for their use, showing how such plans will be funded and within what period.  I agree with the Minister that any Government <Col N="144" /> Department owning such property must stipulate what they intend doing with it and, if it is not the intention to use it immediately, they must dispose of it. Even if they have plans within ten or 15 years for is usage &mdash; in order to expand some service they provide &mdash; that should not give them the right to hold on to it. They must be forced to sell such property or sites at their market value.  If, in ten or 15 years they require other properties or lands, they will have to buy them on the open market.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said that other Government Ministers would not be directly responsible in regard to derelict sites.  I have no doubt but that the Minister &mdash; if he decides that something should be done &mdash; will make forceful representations within the Cabinet.  It has been my experience that whenever a problem seemed to be the responsibility of two Government Departments it was easily resolved between them.  I might give the example of a recent bad fire in North Brunswick Street school when I met the Ministers for Education and Health.  At that time the Minister for Health was the owner of the old St. Lawrence's or Richmond Hospital. Within three or four days of my asking he allowed the school move into the hospital premises on a short term basis.  Political parties or public representatives should bring pressure to bear in relation to such matters because it is in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Bill presents an opportunity for us to look at the overall planning and development of this capital city.  Perhaps public representatives, planners and Ministers should examine the city as a whole, ascertaining what development is possible.  This would mean that, when approached by prospective developers, we would be able to say to them: this is what we would like to see developed on, say, the Quays, Gardiner Street or wherever and, if you move in to effect such development, you will have our co-operation as long as you comply with the requisite statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>It is about time that planners acted on rather than reacted to developments.  We <Col N="145" /> should be able to restore this great city to its original state, resolving any problems that may arise with regard to prospective developments and their funding.  Indeed taxpayers would not be tolerant of our wasting funds which are scarce at present. There is no doubt that, throughout our society there is need for money for all types of developments.  We should bear in mind also that there are Regional Funds at our disposal which could be used for the elimination of certain derelict buildings and sites.  We should ensure that certain types of buildings are not left derelict for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>Protected buildings, for instance, cannot be touched but through neglect they often fall into dereliction.  St. George's Church, off Dorset Street, is a most beautiful building which was constructed in 1814 or thereabouts.  We wonder where we can get funds to maintain the church. There is no point in just maintaining the outer structure.  We must maintain the interior as well.  There are a number of old churches, particularly Church of Ireland churches in the inner city where the population has dwindled, and there is a problem in maintaining them.  Many are falling into disrepair and are becoming derelict.  It is time we looked at that problem within the ambit of this Bill.  As a member of Dublin Corporation who has worried for a number of years as to how we would handle the pockets of dereliction around the city, I am delighted that this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill which I have no doubt will be successful.  I am sure any problems associated with it will be sorted out during the course of Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been pending for some time. Although the last speaker thanked the Minister for introducing it, I doubt if we would have had this legislation as quickly before us without my colleague Deputy Boland having introduced a Private Members' Bill quite recently.  No doubt that prompted the Minister to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>For a long time now we have all been complaining about dereliction particularly in urban areas and we have complained that we have not the law which would enable us to take the necessary action to develop sites which had been left in a disgraceful condition.  I hope this Bill will enable us to solve dereliction problems by imposing on landowners the responsibility to ensure that their land or property does not cause dereliction problems.</P>
      <P>I note that a register is to be kept by the local authority.  It is well known that one of the biggest offenders with regard to derelict sites are local authorities. They will now oversee their own derelict sites by looking after the register in which their names will figure prominently.  Who will oversee the local authorities?  I hope the Minister will ensure that they are not excused if they say that they have not got the money to do what they want to do with regard to derelict sites.  That would not be good enough.  There is no point in penalising a landowner for adopting the same attitude as the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities will have to give leadership and will have to show that they intend to develop the property they own. When I was in the Department we gave fair-sized incentives to the local authorities to deal with dereliction but they did not do enough to combat the problem. If I were in the Department again I would set up separate authorities for this <Col N="147" /> work rather than giving it to the local authorities.  I set up the Customs House Docks Authority and we can all see how quickly they moved on the 27 acres involved.  Much more land by way of special incentive was given to the local authorities but it has not been developed as quickly or with the same energy and ingenuity.  Perhaps the local authorities do not see this as their job.  It might be better to set up an authority with a lifespan of from three to five years.  In the way we could quickly eradicate much of the dereliction.</P>
    <P>We need only look at the quays and some of the north inner city of Dublin to realise what I am talking about.  We gave incentives to the local authorities to try to deal with that dereliction and to date not much has been done.  I know there was opposition, for instance, to the setting up of a streets commission which I thought was a good idea.  I know that local authorities object to these sorts of ideas but such a move would have been a move in the right direction.  Local authorities have an important role to play but we should not be afraid to set up new authorities to do specific jobs if we think it is necessary.  I know there is the fear that it is very hard to dismantle an authority that has been set up but in the future I visualise the establishment of authorities with a limited life to ensure that cities and large urban areas are kept in good order.</P>
    <P>Dublin has much charm and a long history.  It has many great buildings but if they are allowed to disintegrate there will be an order to knock them and, possibly, subsequent bad development. Dereliction affects not just land but buildings.  Frequently one sees in the middle of a very nice row of houses a couple of derelict houses which are just rotting away for whatever reason.  There is a grave need to ensure that owners of such property are made to do something about it.  We see dereliction in areas which are now bedsit areas with railings pulled asunder and plastic refuse bags just thrown there.  In any legislation we <Col N="148" /> should be concerned about how our cities and towns look.  I am concerned with buildings and I feel that there should be a reasonably good incentive given to ensure that listed buildings and buildings of merit are kept in good repair.  In Paris, for instance, one must decorate one's property every so often.  That is not a bad idea.  From the landlord's point of view the property is kept in good condition, and from a general environmental point of view, the property does not become derelict.</P>
    <P>It is provided in this Bill that if the landlord does not maintain his property the local authority will have to move in and do it and put a charge on the property. That is important but the fee that is charged must be a reasonably substantial one, and we are talking about it being based on market values.  I hope that such fees as are collected in this way are recycled to enable people to improve property, to give some sort of incentive, particularly in designated areas because as buildings get older the cost of maintaining them becomes a major problem. We could probably use the tax system to encourage ongoing repair and refurbishment of properties.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say I have noticed a general improvement in Dublin in the past few years.  I am happy with the improvement and I feel this Bill will be a big help.  The development market is getting better and the planning process should be looked at.  Too often there are objections, some very frivolous.  There should be a way of dealing with third party objections if they are being made just for the sake of objecting. If a development is not in line with the general streetscape I am all in favour of taking action.  However, developers should not be impeded from putting up good developments.</P>
    <P>Public bodies own a large slice of derelict properties.  Who will find them or push them into doing something?  For too long nothing has been done in this area. The Minister should look at this and be very strict with local authorities who are not bringing forward derelict sites for development.  If such sites are not brought forward for development in a <Col N="149" /> particular period they should be obliged to sell the property to people who are prepared to do something.  It is not good enough to say that they may be building a road there in 20 years' time.  Road engineers naturally dream about roads and take great satisfaction out of planning magnificent roadways; roads are needed but often we are talking about 20 and 25 years in the future.</P>
    <P>One can see the dereliction in places like Clanbrassil Street and Cork Street. One only has to look at Parnell Street and North King Street where there is a lot of dreadful dereliction in a very quaint part of Dublin, a part of Dublin that would look really magnificent if it were treated properly because it still has the old character about it.  There is this dead hand put on.  For example, in 1905 we started talking about widening High Street but it was only widened about ten years ago.  That is the sort of timescale we are talking about, so there will be a lot of dereliction.  We see the gaps and they are terrible, but look at all the shop-fronts and buildings that are propped up. We are told this is because there will be road widening.  There must be a better way to plan road structures, of getting on with it and coming up with a nice streetscape in line with whatever proposals are there.  I know that goods and serivces have to be moved and, therefore, roads are necessary.</P>
    <P>Havoc has been wreaked on towns and cities throughout the country by the sterilisation of vast areas because of road proposals.  Local authorities draw up maps and draw up plans to build roads but it can take 20 or 30 years before the work is actually done.  Local authorities are responsible for this dereliction we are talking about.  They should improve the image of urban areas in particular.  I am not saying that there is no dereliction in rural areas; there is but it is much easier to deal with.  I hope this legislation will be passed, that it will be taken seriously and that it will be implemented by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In many cases the development of a site takes time, but during that period the area should look reasonably well.  Quite <Col N="150" /> near where I live, on Charlemont Street, there is a site which has been overgrown for a number of years and looked dreadful, but recently work has begun to clean up that site.  Dereliction is like a disease; it tends to move from one area to another.  People are not inclined to develop the area beside a derelict site because that site takes from the value of their property.  Hopefully when we start improving these areas it will encourage people to come in and develop the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue. Some changes will be needed and I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will look favourably on our amendments. It is not a political Bill or one with which we would be seen to score points.  We want to improve it and to ensure it is on the Statute Book as soon as possible. As public representatives who had an interest in this area over the years, we want to monitor the progress of the legislation and to see that it operates in a reasonably fair way.  This legislation is not meant to hound landowners but to remind them that they have a responsibility and a role to play in the purchase and development of land.  If public bodies do not intend using the land in their possession, they should be encouraged to dispose of it so that it can be developed by the private sector.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a number of houses have been allowed to go into decay. When we go to the local authority they say there is nothing they can do about it because it is private property and to interfere with it would be unconstitutional. We have been hearing these hairy arguments for years.  The local authorities should be able to put a charge on property and do what is necessary to develop it so that life will not be miserable for people in the area who are trying to maintain their property.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and I hope it will be successful, but the Minister will have to keep an eye on the local authorities. As soon as the legislation is passed the local authorities should implement it and the Minister and his Department should monitor progress from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support and admiration for this Bill, the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989.  My only regret is that legislation such as this did not come before this House many years ago.  Had legislation such as this been on our Statute Book many years ago, the Irish countryside, the rural and urban environment, would be in a far healthier state.  We would have fewer eyesores to desecrate the landscape and many fine features to adorn it.</P>
      <P>However, ours is a land rich in those features which make for healthy and pleasant living in landscapes that are the envy of other nations.  I mention other nations with particular emphasis as I believe that it is our undoubted environmental quality that bring visitors to our shores to boost our tourist trade.  I am equally sure that our clean green image is the keenest and most acknowledged feature that enhances the attractiveness of our high quality food exports.</P>
      <P>While I have expressed regret that legislation such as the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, is only coming before us at this time, I wish to congratulate the Minister for this comprehensive and well constructed instrument which I am sure will be acknowledged in time by posterity as the key piece of legislation which protected for them their birth-right as reflected in our environmental heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also at this stage to pay a well deserved compliment to Bord Fáilte for the great work of national consciousness raising they have brought about through the institution of the National Tidy Towns Competition.  Bord Fáilte, through the aegis of this nationwide annual focus on the visual and physical environment, have done a service to the nation of incalculable value.  This Bill will bring great joy and satisfaction to the thousands of voluntary workers who over the years of the Tidy Towns Competition have reduced the levels and evidence of dereliction in their various communities. Taken in conjunction with other legislation <Col N="152" /> in litter control, planning, pollution control, toxic waste control and other legislation with environmental protection features, it brings us further along the road of environmental integrity.</P>
    <P>This Bill has overtones and features which will be appreciated by the professional staffs of local authorities throughout the country.  It will be equally appreciated and welcomed by the elected representatives of county councils, borough corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners.  In recent years local authorities have complained loudly, and sometimes bitterly, about what they perceived as an erosion of their powers. They have similarly expressed disappointment at the lack of effective legislative provisions in areas of environmental control such as the containment of the activities of ruthless and well advised developers who skipped and side-stepped existing directives in a shameless pursuit of profits and others who indiscriminately scattered the wastes of manufacturers and processes on lands convenient to their places of activity.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives real power to local authorities. It has the necessary measures enshrined in its provisions to enable local authorities to effectively deal with the offenders by way of immediate deterrent or subsequent sanction.</P>
    <P>I do not have to draw the attention of this House to the necessity for this legislation.  We are all too familiar with environmental black spots in our towns, cities, villages and the countryside in general. Neither rural nor urban landscapes have escaped the scourge of dereliction.</P>
    <P>In urban areas deliberately planned dereliction has been used as a tool by a minority of unscrupulous developers. First, an area of potential development is identified.  Then a plan is drawn up to put together a portfolio of exploitable properties.  At the earliest opportunity a property is acquired.  The property is left unoccupied and vandalism is encouraged rather than prohibited.  Then the roof is removed to ensure all sorts of laudable objectives couched in terms of public <Col N="153" /> safety.  The roofless structure has the twofold effect of generally reducing property values in the area and of spreading decay to adjoining properties so that they are soon vacated, sold and added to the portfolio. This process of planned dereliction can take a long time before the objective of a complete portfolio is attained.  Right across the city, north, south, east and west, you can see fine streets decimated in this way.  You can see it in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway or any other place you care to mention.  It is essentially an anti-social procedure that local authorities were up to this time virtually powerless to control.  I would urge local authorities everywhere to use section 10 of the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, to curb and eliminate this dubious practice.  In fact, if the Bill did nothing more than prevented portfolio building by the strategy of planned deliberate dereliction if would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 the duty of reasonable action falls upon the local authority and section 12 outlines the power of local authorities to take action directly or require the owner or occupier to do so. It would be very difficult for a local authority to implement their powers under this section if they were remiss in any respect in their duty as owner, or occupier, of lands in their own control.  This Bill is a real double edged sword from which there is no escape.  The power of the Minister in section 13 should prove an effective brake on local authorities whose lands fall short of the requirements and aims of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are in all our towns and cities substantial buildings, former institutions, factory premises and the like, no longer in use.  Up to this time such premises have been allowed to fall into utter disrepair and dereliction.  In many cases these are old stone buildings of great character and it would be a pity if under the terms of this Bill there was a headlong rush to demolish them.  Demolition is not necessarily the best remedy for derelict buildings and consideration should always be given to the possibility of restoration and potential use.  Such buildings might well be ideal places to house crafts centres <Col N="154" /> or to convert to enterprise centres to stimulate local manufacture and employment. To encourage this I believe that the provisions of &ldquo;section 27 relief&rdquo; should be extended at little or not cost to the Exchequer to cover the refurbishment of buildings such as old mills, warehouses, institutions etc.  Instead of bringing in the JCB and tools of demolition the owner should be encouraged to refurbish the buildings to provide work space, or other units for small scale productive enterprise on such leasehold terms as would allow the owner to recoup in time his outlay by writing off the capital costs against rents accruing from the development.</P>
    <P>I say this from experience as a coordinator of an employment group in my own town of Malahide and from my experience of many other groups in my constitutuency of Dublin North, for example, groups in Skerries, Balbriggan and Portmarnock where the biggest problem they have as enterprise groups and employment community groups is finding a building for the various activities.  There are plenty of good ideas and of energy but the problem if that they cannot find suitable properties in their own community, yet we can all identify these properties in our towns.  If there was the right incentive private investors would invest in these properties and would play their part.</P>
    <P>In simple terms the refurbishment and development of a centre used for the provision of work space, incubator units or short term lease space used for productive enterprises through a write-off of capital costs against rents accruing from the development or, preferably, against other rental income, on the basis that the rent would not accrue unless such money is spent, there is no loss to the Exchequer. I believe this should assist in the current commendable attempts to stamp out the black economy by ensuring that a proper environment is made available to small businesses who are willing to comply with PAYE, PRSI and VAT regulations and become part of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The objective of channelling available risk funding away from non-productive investment into job creating projects will <Col N="155" /> also be greatly assisted.  The tax amnesty has proved that if you give an incentive people will respond.  I would ask the Minister to look into this proposal to see if in the immediate term, or even in the future, it is worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has wisely redefined the term &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;.  The restrictive definition in the 1961 Act led to a situation where a process of progressive decay had to be tolerated up to a point where the offending &ldquo;land&rdquo; or structure was in a dilapidated or dangerous condition before it could be deemed to fall into the definition laid down by the Act. Under section 6 of this Bill, the 1961 Derelict Sites Act is repealed and the new definition which allows action to be taken in cases of incipient dereliction is to make for the effective control of dereliction. I would suggest that local authorities, in addition to setting up a register of derelict sites, should also hold a register of marginal properties which they would keep under review.  Owners of such properties would be informed of the penalties and restrictions to which they would be subjected in the event of further dereliction of their said properties.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not lay down in strict blow by blow terms how this register shall be compiled nor does it essentially limit the extent and detail it might usefully contain.  In compiling the register it might be useful if local authorities included details of construction and known former uses of the structure or other details which would be of interest to historians, social geographers and other professionals. Such detail, apart from its value in purely scholarship terms, would also be of interest to genealogical researchers or former generation Irish in search of their roots.  We have been lax in the past in recording our heritage, and since habitations and the derelict sites of habitations provide such useful background information we should see the opportunity value of this nature in the compilation of the register.</P>
    <P>The marking of the sites on the ordnance maps of the district would also be of benefit.  The cross reference enabled <Col N="156" /> by all of this would facilitate future research, bearing in mind that genealogical research is easily harnessed as a tourism incentive.  It might be useful if the Bill directed the local authorities to review this register on an annual basis and to invite inspection of the register by way of public notice at a given time following this annual review.  A copy of the register might be made available at an appropriate public office during this period, such as perhaps at a public library, as we review our planning lists weekly.  In addition to the desirability of informing the owner as is provided for in the Bill there is merit in wider publication of entries to inform other citizens who might be careless of their civic duty in regard to lands in their care.  There is a process in place to redress their negligence even to the point of compulsory acquisition under the terms of section 16 of the Bill or the penalties laid down in sections 28 and 29.</P>
    <P>Section 26 allows for a bond in lieu of the levy subject to a guarantee of completion of development within five years where the derelict land is part of a developmental scheme.  In the interests of maintaining an attractive visual environment I would like to see some on-going maintenance provisions being a part of the five year concession.  Development work is more usual and indeed more likely to be offensive in urban areas.  The cumulative impact of such developments on tourism in key areas is a matter for concern and protracted tolerance of dereliction is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Having been associated with Malahide tidy towns committee for many years I am very pleased indeed with the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in section 4.  Having attended the annual prizegiving of the Bord Fáilte competition on the five occasions when Malahide was awarded the distinction of tidiest large town I had the pleasure of meeting with representatives of tidy towns committees from all over Ireland.  In discussions with them it always became immediately clear that derelict sites were the major problems encountered by them in their local <Col N="157" /> areas.  Their frustration at the powerlessness they felt in the face of this ugly menace became immediately evident.</P>
    <P>The definition of derelict site in section 4 encompasses comprehensively the matters of greatest concern as expressed by this important representative group of voluntary community workers.  The definition includes the visual, and the physical components of dereliction, decay and neglect.  It is sufficiently wide and clear to make for the easy identification of sites deemed to be offensive under the terms of the Bill and the excellent co-operation which has always existed between tidy towns committees and their respective local authorities will be greatly facilitated.  Persons actively engaged in their own community area are usually acutely aware of cases of incipient dereliction because they notice the progressive deterioration from its earliest stages.  This gives added impact and effectiveness to sections 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>It has also been noted by those concerned with the physical environment that neglected sites invite more neglect and quickly become tipheads where unthinkable people dump household rubbish thus compounding the neglect and dereliction.  Thus one can see that the notion of incipient neglect is a very important feature of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on a point raised by the previous speaker on road reservations.  I believe it is time that the Minister made provision in the Planning Acts for temporary permissions.  In giving temporary permissions, I am thinking of permissions based on community needs, such as a scouts den, crèches, or for community use.  As has been outlined by the previous speaker, this can often lead to a ten or 20 year road reservation with various problems pertaining to it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the future, service employment will be a very important factor.  Tourism is at the heart of service employment so, in effect, this Bill is also a tourism measure.  There is nothing more disheartening for an hotelier, restauranteur or housewife with a bed and breakfast facility to find that the approach to their premises is marred by <Col N="158" /> an ugly eyesore.  At a time when world attention is more and more directed to the quality of the environment and when the quality and purity of foodstuffs is the supreme marketing focus, it is most appropriate, timely and opportune that we should in this House be putting on our Statute Book a Bill which has such impact on these factors.  It should be greatly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Flynn, the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly and the Department on the fact that over the past month we have seen the introduction of this Bill, the Water Pollution Bill and in the budget we have seen the provision of moneys for the recycling of waste and for improvements to major beaches.  In my view this is all in the interests of the environment, tourism and the food industry and in the interests of the country as a whole.  I certainly welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill and I welcome it.  I believe it is important to sketch in the background which has made it necessary.  It has been said with some accuracy that one's first impression of a place is lasting.  It is unfortunate that a first impression is lasting because sometimes it can be erroneous.  Tourists, be they native or foreign, form an impression when they get to a place for the first time.  In the case of Ireland, our cities, towns and villages are the windows through which people view our country. When people leave our shores they take with them an impression of our buildings and this leaves an indelible impression on them.  Certain buildings are synonymous with certain parts of the country, for example, if they visit Limerick they will see King John's Castle, St. Mary's Cathedral, the Walls of Limerick or the Treaty Stone.  In Northern Ireland they will see the Giant's Causeway.  They may have seen Blarney Castle and if they visited Dublin they will see the fine buildings in the city such as the GPO, the Mansion House or Dáil Éireann.  These buildings form an indelible impression in a person's mind and become synonymous with the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> We have buildings of character, antiquity, distinctiveness and style; we should be proud of them and do what we can to preserve them.  There has been some terrible vandalism down the country and many fine buildings were demolished sometimes by so-called patriots and sometimes through carelessness by people who should have known better. However, we will leave that point for the present.</P>
    <P>Having made the point about our fine buildings, there are far too many derelict sites with ruined buildings which disfigure our cities, towns and villages.  This Bill is meant to correct the legacy of dereliction. As I have said, it is a useful Bill but there is room for improvement.  It is an improvement on past legislation but with some changes it could be made a better Bill.  I welcome many of its provisions.  It contains two important improvements: first, it requires that a register be kept by local authorities and this would mean that public representatives and the public could go to the register and see the extent of derelict sites in their area; secondly, State property may be included in the register, but the operative word is &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the Minister may &mdash; and again the operative word is &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; direct any such State body to dispose of such land or otherwise develop it.</P>
    <P>Public bodies such as the Office of Public Works, State Departments or local authorities should give an example in this respect.  There is no point in coming here as public representatives and castigating private developers, as I will be doing soon, without looking at the mote in our own eye.  We have nothing to boast about.  Indeed, the Office of Public Works presides over derelict sites in many parts of the country which I could name, but I will not do so as it may become wearisome to list them out.  Similarily, State Departments and local authorities have nothing to boast about in this respect.  It is important that we ourselves set a good example.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is drafted, the Minister may, if he so chooses, and without <Col N="160" /> recourse, unfortunately, to a public hearing permit a local authority to compulsorily acquire a derelict site.  I believe the Minister should have left it open to discretion, that these sites should be the subject of a public hearing and that the Minister should base his decision on the outcome of a public hearing.  That would be fair and would be seen to be fair. The Minister should also set a definite timescale for the process of acquisition. If this matter is to be left totally in the Minister's hands, it is probable that no decision will be taken in contentious areas or controversial cases.</P>
    <P>The provision for valuing sites and imposing taxes as a proportion of the valuation is also welcome, but I believe that instead of valuing sites every five years as provided for in the Bill, the sites should be valued every year.  I believe that this could be open to abuse.  For example, if an area were due for redevelopment, an owner could cheerfully pay a tax on the derelict site and wait until the site increased in value before disposing of it, thus making a handsome profit.  If at all possible we should seal off this loophole.</P>
    <P>On the question of bonding of sites which are expected to become part of a larger development, I believe there is a big loophole which is open to exploitation. If the value of the bond is not based on recent values, the tax payable could in certain circumstances be deferred for ten years and paid at the values of ten years previously.  I submit this would entirely negative the intention of the Bill.  One reason we have had so much dereliction in our towns and cities is that local authorities have not had the powers to compulsorily acquire these sites in the past.  I believe that local authorities should have had these powers and should have been able to acquire these sites giving the owners a fair and reasonable price.  If I had power in this matter I would have the powers given to local authorities to pay the owner a fair and reasonable price if he did not develop the site within a five year period.  The local authority could then develop the land, perhaps by building bungalows for old <Col N="161" /> people, who are now often sent out to outlying estates where they are open to crime and vandalism.  Indeed, we could enhance our cities by building bungalows for old people in the derelict areas.  As another option, the local authorities could sell the land to commercial interests.  This power is to remain in the Minister's hands.  However, I believe he should delegate it to the local authorities and there is no reason to believe they would act irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with another aspect of the Bill.  The Minister is repealing some legislation but it appears he will only be bringing in part of the new legislation. That is not good enough.  For example, some of the building regulations are still not implemented 25 years after enactment. That is not just good enough. There is no reason whatsoever that the Minister should introduce this Bill in a selective and piecemeal manner.  All the provisions are important and should be introduced together as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 12 which gives powers to local authorities to carry out certain works on derelict sites and to recover the cost from the owner is not amended in any great way from previous legislation.  Experience has shown me, unfortunately, that as a member of a local authority it is notoriously difficult to get owners of derelict sites to pay the costs the local authority incurred in making a dangerous building safe.  I see little hope of getting those owners to pay any cost that would be involved.  I would like to see the Minister giving more powers to local authorities to use their discretion in this matter and to enable them to recover the cost in a prompt manner.</P>
    <P>I am also unhappy about a provision in section 24 of the Bill.  Money owed by an owner of a derelict site may be waived if such an owner cleans up the site.  This provision is far too loose and should be tightened up because an owner who gives a cat's lick to a site could have all his costs waived.  That is not good enough and we should not allow that to happen. I believe the Minister has too much discretion on the amount of levy that should <Col N="162" /> be imposed on the owners of derelict sites.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had added a few words to section 31 (2) of the Bill he could have provided for important archaeological and historical excavations to be carried out on certain derelict sites thus preventing possible holdups on these sites when building operations commence. The addition of a few words to this section if important historical finds were made on these derelict sites, would have a twofold purpose: first, it would enable the sites to be excavated and the finds brought to the surface could be presented to the National Museum, and secondly, it would stop possible delays afterwards in sensitive areas where excavations will have to take place in any case.  By adding a few words to the Bill we could do an awful lot in this area and by using our intelligence and common sense we could get over any difficulties.  This section is far too loose and the power to waive costs should rest in the hands of local authorities.  They are the best people to judge; they know when costs should be waived.</P>
    <P>It has been said in the past that Irish people are visually lazy and even illiterate and that for all our creative skills in writing we do not use our eyes in a way that would enable us to see some of the blackspots on our landscapes.  It is 67 years since this State was founded and it has taken that time to bring this Bill before the House.  It is a sad reflection on us as a people that this amount of time should have passed before the introduction of such a Bill and it is an indictment of successive Governments and public representatives of all shades that this should be so.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I welcome this Bill but because of the manner in which it has been drafted and the powers the Minister has vested in himself, the success of the Bill will depend on how serious and determined the Minister is in enforcing it and giving effect to its measures.  If the Minister is serious and determined in ensuring that this Bill is implemented, it could transform our society and our cities, <Col N="163" /> towns and villages.  This is a very important Bill.  The acid test of this Bill will not be its passage through the Dáil &mdash; I believe its passage will be fairly smooth and the debate to date has been very enlightened &mdash; but the elimination of derelict sites and their replacement by buildings of character and distinction.  This is what the Bill is all about and I hope that this objective will be realised as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Derelict sites are a familiar sight in many of the cities and towns in Ireland, but in dealing with dereliction I want to concentrate mainly on Dublin because I am most familiar with the effects of dereliction on our capital city.</P>
      <P>Dublin is a very old city and for those of us born and reared in it, it is a very beautiful city.  However, on closer inspection one can pick out the areas of decay which have accumulated over the years. Most of the present inner city buildings of Dublin are pre-Georgian and were built in the 1600s and 1700s &mdash; as far as South Richmond Street and the South side and the North Strand area of the North side.  In the 1800s and early 1900s the Georgian and Victorian buildings and squares were built.  When the original owners of these houses passed away, they were inhabited in the main by very large working class families, some of whom were very poor and lived in cramped conditions and one would often have heard of very large family units living in one room.  There was little or no maintenance carried out on these buildings.</P>
      <P>When Dublin Corporation started to build housing schemes in the inner suburbs of Dublin in the thirties and forties to rehouse these people many of these buildings became redundant.  Some were turned into offices and small factories, and those which remained in private residents were no longer viable as the rates on them were very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1977 Fianna Fáil removed the rates on such houses but it was too late to save large areas of the city as the bulk of the new middle classes were on the move to the rapidly expanding suburbs, thus <Col N="164" /> depleting the number of people living in the inner city.  In the years that followed the businesses, factories and service industries which had used these buildings started to evacuate them in favour of the newer more modern buildings in the industrial estates of the suburbs.  These industrial estates provided more space, better and safer parking and better access to the main road networks to the north, south and west of the country.  This left in the inner city of Dublin, both on the north and south side, a considerable number of old properties, closed up, derelict or turned into slums or flatland. Georgian structures which were poorly maintained have resulted in once fine buildings coming to the end of their lifespan.</P>
    <P>Restricted or rent controlled tenancies meant that landlords spend nothing, if possible, or very little on the maintenance of their properties, thus in the long run cutting the lifespan of the buildings.  Wet rot, dry rot and rising damp became rampant. The foundations and basement walls of most of the imposing granite and fine brick based Georgian buildings in the city were built in black stone from the Dublin mountains, which is notorious for soaking water.</P>
    <P>In the forties and fifties, but mainly in the sixties and seventies, property developers and development companies started to buy old properties with the intention of amassing over a period, usually many years, a valuable development site or sites which resulted in one, two, three and more houses in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other cities and many country town streets and terraces &mdash; and sometimes whole streets &mdash; being left derelict for years, causing a blight on hundreds of streets, terraces and squares around the country which has continued until this day.  The acquired plots would eventually fall into the hands of property tycoons, and would-be tycoons, and we have seen the results of this all around us in Dublin.  The results are the developments which have taken place since &mdash; for example, Hawkins House, D'Olier Street, O'Connell Bridge, Nassau Street, Lower Mount Street, Baggot Street, <Col N="165" /> FÁS, St. Martin's House, Bank of Ireland Headquarters, Mespil Road, Burgh Quay, Westland Row, Aungier Street, Clare Street, etc.</P>
    <P>There are many contradictory opinions as to the taste of these developments, and I would have a more critical opinion, but that is not to say that taste has been forgotten in some of the ventures which have taken place, for example, the Ballast office on Westmoreland Street, the mock Georgian terraces on Lower Leeson Street, Edmond Farrell House on St. Stephen's Green East, the retained facade of the Methodist Hall on the south side of the Green, and the concern shown for the retention of past craftsmanship by the Irish Civil Service Building Society in removing the signs of posters from their fine sandstone building at the apex of Westmoreland Street and D'Olier Street beside O'Connell Bridge.  Other derelict sites have been redeveloped to follow modern trends and prove that our cities are not behind the times.  A few good examples are Busaras, the American Embassy, the Central Bank and the EBS head office in Westmoreland Street.</P>
    <P>Present dereliction in Dublin can be seen on the quays, North and South, the South inner city, the North inner city, as well as various infill stretches all over the city and suburbs, but dereliction affects all cities in Ireland and most if not all, country towns and villages.  Some of the main reasons I see as a cause of dereliction are property development, lack of proper maintenance by owners or occupiers, people who die intestate leaving property, and road development plans of local authorities.  Dublin's road development plan goes back to the fifties, and the results of this can be seen in the city quays, both North and South, and in my constituency in streets such as Clanbrassil Street, New Street, Patrick Street and Cork Street.  All of these have been affected by the local authority road development plans which have caused whole streets to become ghost streets.</P>
    <P>Lack of population in the inner city is also to blame.  People have moved over the years to the suburbs of cities and <Col N="166" /> towns as they have become more affluent. Planning wrangles and recessions which make people hold on to derelict sites until better times come along are also factors.  The fact that car parks are a viable proposition when there is a shortage of car parking in cities and towns also play a part.</P>
    <P>Derelict property affects tourism.  One can imagine how the tourist feels on being driven from Dublin Airport into Dublin city for the first time, through Gardiner Street, Mountjoy Square, City Quay or the Liberties.  To see so much of the capital city falling apart would make anybody want to leave Dublin as quickly as possible.  Derelict sites also attract cider parties and other anti-social activities.  Old structures can be a danger to life and limb and a number of deaths and very serious accidents have occurred over the years because of these buildings. Such buildings are unsightly and have a depressing effect on the people who live in the areas or pass through them.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and Government are powerless at the moment to deal effectively with this terrible blight on the landscape. Local authorities are sometimes hindered in finding the owners of derelict sites or buildings that are old or in a dangerous condition, owing to the property being under a limited company or an offshore company name, or because of the use of nominee directors.  All of us as public representatives have come across such cases.  I want to make the point here that the incentives being made available to developers and property owners in the designed areas are working to help to clear some of the problems and I hope to see these designated areas extended in the near future.</P>
    <P>A good point of the Bill is the register that will be invaluable to the local authorities concerned, to monitor effectively the use, intentions and the progress of work on derelict sites.  The levy will ensure that the number of such derelict sites will be reduced, thus helping to improve our environment.  The levy is not greater than 10 per cent of the market value of the derelict site and the owners or occupiers can appeal to the Valuations <Col N="167" /> Tribunal established by the Valuation Act of 1988.  Valuation of the derelict site will be made at the point of its being on the register and at five yearly intervals thereafter.  When the site is no longer derelict the portion of levy paid for the year will be returned.  The fewer sites left derelict, the more building jobs are created.  This has an overall benefit on the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The provision of a bond from developers allows them to enter into an agreement with their local authorities whereby a derelict site which is part of a proposed development or future development by them is exempt from payment of a derelict site levy for five years until completion of the project.  If the project is not completed within five years payment of the levy for the full five years will be made on the derelict site.</P>
    <P>The Bill will place a duty on owners and occupiers of land, including statutory bodies, to prevent the land from becoming derelict or from continuing to be a derelict site.  The Bill provides for improved procedure for the compulsory acquisition of derelict land by local authorities, thus increasing the possibility of its being developed by others.  The Bill's purpose is for the better use of land and not to raise additional revenue.  It will mean improvement of our towns and cities and our environment and, most important, it will be for the benefit of the people now and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The 1961 Derelict Sites Act has operated with a good degree of success.  Property owners in general have co-operated in acting on foot of notices served on them. There are, of course, some obvious weaknesses in that 1961 Act.  The Bill before the Dáil contains some welcome provisions, such as the imposition of a levy on sites which are not being maintained or developed and the improvement of the powers of local authorities to deal with derelict sites.  The inclusion of structures in the definition of derelict sites is welcome, as are the additional enforcements and acquisition powers proposed. <Col N="168" /> In my constituency there is not a serious problem of derelict sites, with approximately only 20 acres of vacant land in the Cork city area.  Cork is benefiting in recent times under the designated areas scheme and property owners are responding positively.  In association with this Bill, an extension of the time limits, together with a judicious review of the geographic boundaries, will further encourage development and enhance the urban fabric.</P>
      <P>There are two separate designated areas in Cork city.  The larger area of 81 acres is generally in the south and west of the commercial core and includes the South Parish, the Marsh area and part of Shandon Street.  A small area of 18 acres is located to the north of the city at Blackpool. Development in the larger of the designated areas has been modest.  There are a number of significant projects nearing completion or in progress.  These include the construction of apartments and offices at South Terrace and the construction of apartments and a commercial area in the old fire station at Sullivan's Quay.  In both of these schemes, Cork Corporation have been able to assist with site assembly.</P>
      <P>The success of the South Terrace development has generated considerable interest which is expected to produce further developments in this area.  The old fire station and South Terrace developments have demonstrated that apartments can be marketed successfully in the city centre at price levels which make such development economic.  As there is no tradition of apartment construction in the centre of Cork, property market circles were somewhat sceptical of the prospects for this type of development. Such demonstration projects are important and there are already indications that the removal of this psychological barrier will generate further apartment construction inside, and probably also outside, the designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation have disposed of a site at Cove Street for a small scheme of private houses and are involved in a joint venture scheme with the National Building Agency and Michael O'Halloran <Col N="169" /> Limited, Builders, for the construction of apartments and houses at White Street. It is also expected that a joint venture housing scheme for about four houses will be constructed at St. John's Park in co-operation with Share, the Schoolboys' Charitable Housing project.  Cork Corporation have provided family houses and accommodation for old people in a very fine urban renewal project at Grattan Street.  Another area of Cork city where development has been assisted by the designated areas scheme is Washington Street.  These buildings have been refurbished for offices.  A number of other projects in the designated area are at planning stage.</P>
    <P>Housing is an important sector for the Cork designated areas because prospects for conventional commercial development are less good than in other areas. The very large Merchant's Quay development limits the scope for other major shopping developments.  A situation in which major developments like Merchants Quay can go ahead outside the designated area is obviously much healthier than one in which such developments are dependent on public subsidy, because development in the Cork designated areas rests less on conventional commercial development than in the other designated areas.</P>
    <P>The importance of tapping sources of use and demand which are new to the city centre is increased.  New private housing is one such source of demand. There is also some interest being expressed in premises, in office type accommodation, or computer software operations.  Multistorey car parking and related activities are also being pursued through a corporation competition at present, although the resulting development will not necessarily occur within the designated areas.</P>
    <P>The potential of Cork's two channels is being explored through a waterfront study which will be completed shortly.  The study seeks to identify areas of opportunity and new sources of useful demand which could be attracted to such areas.  Much of the designated area of <Col N="170" /> Cork consists of buildings requiring repairs or reconstruction rather than cleared sites and a high proportion of housing is involved.  Improved incentives for the refurbishing of existing dwellings could be of benefit in the Cork designated area.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The move from a control of abuse system to a prohibitive system, which is the primary proposal of this Bill, is not a particularly new suggestion.  It was first made in 1977 when, oddly enough, the Leader of the party proposing this Bill was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He concluded then that the proposal was too costly.  It is inevitable that we will move in the direction proposed by the Bill.  However, there is a number of problems.  There is inevitably a degree of inflexibility which could occur if we move in the direction proposed by the Bill.  That is not adequately addressed.  A second problem which is not addressed is the need for a substantial bureaucracy if we move from the present system to the proposed prohibitive system.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned that there are constitutional considerations.  I believe the additional powers given to the Director of Consumer Affairs would prove to be unconstitutional.  It is somewhat ironic to see Fine Gael support this Bill when some time ago they objected to very similar powers being transferred to the Attorney General, who is, after all, a constitutional officer, on the basis that these could be potentially unconstitutional.  Wavering on behalf of Fine Gael is not particularly new.  The Minister outlined some significant drafting errors which will have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> An investigation by the Fair Trade Commission of the possibility of incorporating Articles 85 and 86 into domestic legislation is currently in hand.  The Fair Trade Commission in March 1988 invited submissions from interested parties.  For a variety of reasons, not least the fact that they have had additional powers thrust on them over that period, they have not yet concluded their consideration of the submissions and of the issue.  The study by the Fair Trade Commission should include a number of important constitutional issues.  For that reason and other reasons which I have outlined, the proposals in the Bill &mdash; welcome as they are and inevitable as a move in that direction is &mdash; would represent something of a leap in the dark.  While I am not prepared to condemn the Bill and its principles out of hand, it is premature and it would be better to await the Fair Trade Commission's proposals and introduce the necessary legislation on the basis of mature reflection on all the issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm Fine Gael support for this Bill, large sections of which seem to be extracts from a Fine Gael policy document.  Despite what Deputy Roche has said about drafting and costing problems, it is impossible to justify the hostile reaction to this realistic and necessary measure.  We have been treated in recent days to three public tantrums relating to this issue.  First we had the bluff and bluster of the Minister on a radio programme on Saturday morning. Subsequently a statement was issued by an anonymous Government spokesperson and today we had the Government statement that they would not tolerate legislation emanating from Opposition parties.  We will not be cowed or bludgeoned into submission.  The Government are adopting a silly and selfish approach.  Surely proper legislation containing measures for the betterment of society should be considered seriously and not dismissed because of the quarter from which it might come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to believe that this minority Fianna Fáil Government would oppose a <Col N="172" /> Bill which is in line with Government policy on 1992.  I would remind Fianna Fáil that consensus works both ways and there is a responsibility on the Government in this area.  Are Fianna Fáil irresponsibly looking for an excuse to go to the people?  An issue such as this Bill is a disgraceful excuse and could not justify such action.  How can a Government whose Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, continually preach the marketing message that our domestic market is now Europe, justify at the same time our current restrictive practices legislation?  When modern Irish industry was in its infancy the Fianna Fáil protectionist policies of the thirties and forties were the norm. This, perhaps, helped create an Irish sentiment that competition in the real sense should not become an issue.  Competition is now a reality.  We cannot afford an outmoded economy and we cannot wait to implement changes in structure.</P>
    <P>The Government allocate resources for the promotion of competitive manufacturing industry through such organisations as the IDA, SFADCo, Udarás na Gaeltachta, CTT, CBF, etc, yet no State organisation is given the task of assisting and promoting competitive practices in other professions.  With the evolvement of the internal market we cannot afford delays which reduce our competitive edge.  We may soon be the only island nation in Europe, but this will not protect our economy.</P>
    <P>The current legislation introduced by the Fianna Fáil Governments of 1972 and 1987 is too cumbersome and lacks realism.  This Government have failed to address the issue of restrictive practices. Why is there a refusal by Fianna Fáil to take action dealing with restrictive practices? No significant study of enterprise has been published during any of Fianna Fáil's recent terms of office.  The only studies in this area were published while Fine Gael were in office.  It must be said that studies on enterprise published through the semi-State sector do not address the issue of restrictive practices. Three studies published in recent years virtually ignore the area of restrictive <Col N="173" /> practices, yet they are being used as textbooks references by over 4,000 current marketing students.  The studies to which I refer are <i>Venture Initiation in Irish Society</i> and <i>Enterprise: the Irish Approach,</i> both published by Joyce O'Connor in 1983, and <i>Education for Enterprise &mdash; an Irish Perspective,</i> published by John A. Murray in 1986.  All these marketing students can see from current State publications and studies is an outmoded policy.  The time has come &mdash; not for publishing more reports &mdash; but for taking effective action.  The continuation of restrictive practices on the part of the professions, including restrictions on advertising and scale fees, are an outmoded source of frustration. Cohesive legislation is urgently required.</P>
    <P>Current legislation means that the process of eradication of abuse is too narrow and this has been pointed out by previous speakers who referred to the prolonged procedure which takes place before this process is completed.  A seal would cross Ireland on dry land quicker than action taken in this area.  Uniform legislation on all trade practices is required.  Practitioners and consumers must have access to information and the right to knowledge.</P>
    <P>This Bill attempts to achieve the required measures to redress the situation, but it only does so partially. Under the Coalition Government the then Minister for Industry and Commerce requested the Fair Trade Commission in April 1984 to undertake a wide ranging study into the rendering of professional and analogous services.  The investigation looked at two groupings, medical and non-medical.  The commission have reported on advertising restrictions and scale of fees in accountancy and engineering professions.  The report of the commission needs to be addressed by a more elaborate Bill.  Much of this Bill is premature prior to having the results of the work of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>The commission are currently investigating the architectural and legal professions and this format will probably be used for all remaining investigations. <Col N="174" /> Therefore, I suggest that the Bill should make an allowance for these reports, although I appreciate that time is of the essence in the 1992 race.  The commission feel strongly that a supply of professional services is desirable in the public interest, leading to higher quality at lower prices, increased choice, innovative and more efficient forms of organisation and service. Fine Gael agree with this general approach.</P>
    <P>We are about to face an enormous change for the professions, the right to freely establish in any country; technological development and greater consumer awareness will change the whole economic climate.  More open and efficient professional services will be demanded.  In 1992 it is estimated that the current number of companies will be halved.  This will occur through economies of scale and standardisation.</P>
    <P>We cannot compete on economies of scale in Ireland, our largest Co-operative, Kerry Group plc, would not rank as large in Europe, Larry Goodman may be the beef baron of Europe, but very few Irish companies can match anything the size of our European competitors. We must, therefore, rely also on efficiency and quality of service and products. Current restrictive practice legislation is against such development. Without a competitive environment within our own business sectors we will not survive.  The competitive provisions of the European Community are being increasingly manifested and currently the international, not domestic trade, is subject to the application of Community competition laws.  Under the Treaty of Rome, the Community is formally committed to the elimination of anti-competitive behaviour which is expressed in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. Article 85 relates to anti-competitive behaviour by two or more undertakings and prohibits as incompatible with the Common Market all agreements between undertakings and concerned practices which may affect trade between member states and which have as their object or <Col N="175" /> effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the Community. This relates to price fixing between competitors, agreement on market shares, production quotas etc.</P>
    <P>Article 86 is aimed at preventing abuses by firms in a dominant market position when an effect on inter-state trade is involved.  Community law covers all agreements or practices which are capable of threatening the freedom of inter-state trade between members in a manner which could harm the objectives of the Single European Act, but conduct affecting member states only is governed by national legal order.  We must as a nation do something to restructure our restrictive practices.  This Bill at least tries to address this.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection policy needs to be addressed but this Bill is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>We entered the European Community in 1973 to gain access to 320 million consumers and rid ourselves of the isolation which affected our economy for a generation. Our ability to go to the European marketplace, unfettered by the hitherto restrictive practices which hampered our growth potential over the years, has been the cornerstone of our unprecedented economic growth in the seventies and eighties.</P>
    <P>Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome govern business dealings between entities in the Community and ensure that the prejudices imposed by national boundries will not be used to the detriment of one European in his dealings with another.  They do not protect an individual or entity within the borders of a country whose desire to earn a just living can be severly dented by the unscrupulous attitude of those whose interests are governed by considerations other than the common good.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have always believed that what is good for the child is good for the nurse and we find the reluctance of the Government to allow provisions which will afford Articles 85 and 86 type protection to individuals or companies in <Col N="176" /> Ireland doing business with each other inconsistent with the dictates of reason.</P>
    <P>The Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, proposed by the Progressive Democrats expresses our thinking on the medicine which is required to ensure that enterprise will not be scuppered by unscrupulous monopolies whose interests are inimical to enterprise.</P>
    <P>The arguments expressed by the Government speakers are not logical and do not impress me.  The Government are looking for any excuse to scupper the Bill which, while it has limitations and does not go far enough, deserves full consideration. It will get the support of the Fine Gael Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot fully lend my support to the proposals in the Bill.  I support the Minister's cautious approach of waiting for the advice of the experts in the restrictive practices area to come back to him and for him to come back to the House to make recommendations on foot of the advice.</P>
      <P>I do not purport to be an expert on competition law or policies but, from a quick perusal of the large volume of learned articles, regulations and legislation in the EC and of a national character, it seems to be a very wide, confusing and complex area.  Under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, which was amended by ministerial order and the Amendment Act, 1987, we have had our own way of dealing with restrictive practices.  While there may be criticisms of that system and dissatisfaction, now is not the time to rush headlong into changing it.</P>
      <P>The fundamental thinking behind the Bill is not to assist Irish business or the consumer in any way but to force an ideological conviction down the throats of the public, the consumer, the worker and industrialists, which stems from a free trade mentality in America&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the air transport sector there have been grave public misgivings within the past few months, particularly following the tragedies at Lockerbie and in the Azores.  It is suggested that the cost-cutting allegedly associated with these unfortunate disasters can be traced back to the competition in the skies.  We need to take a look to see if competition policy in sensitive areas where there is a high risk to life and limb has gone mad. I venture to suggest that during the next year or so many a searching comment will be made in relation to this headlong rush by the airlines into competition and the consequences this may have for safety and on the methods used in the manufacture of planes and their components. Anyone who reads newspapers cannot <Col N="178" /> be but concerned at the reports of cost-cutting and the allegations about the lack of attention to detail in the manufacture of planes.  One would have to ask if this inefficiency is as a result of the mad pressure of a market economy gone wrong and of the need to ensure that politicians in various countries can claim political kudos for reducing airfares?  I would not like anyone to think I am against the lowering of air-fares&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but for goodness sake can we not have a little bit of moderation, reason and foresight?  It is in the context of those comments, dramatic though they may be, that I would consider the proposals contained in this Bill.  In fairness to the proposer of the Bill and its supporters in Fine Gael, they all acknowledge that the Bill is defective, yet they say it should still be considered.  What I am saying is that public safety, social policy and employment considerations along with other facets of human activity must be taken into account by each of us before we could give an undertaking to support the Bill.  I advise caution on the part of those who propose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that it is in the interests of the business community that this legislation be put through the House and that it is slightly provincial of us not to push this legislation through at the dictation of the Progressive Democrats.  It is quite unfair to do so.  The last Fine Gael speaker taunted the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, in respect of his marketing message.  I support Deputy Brennan and believe he has done a very good job in raising the consciousness of the business community on the importance of marketing.  I believe and I would claim to know a little bit about marketing that each little producer in our disorganised, highly competitive economy should aim at the European market and should look at the possibility of entering into slightly restrictive arrangements, such as franchises, joint ventures, integration of production and marketing through other <Col N="179" /> non-definable activities and, in the farming area, producer groups for mushrooms, beef and lamb.  This would involve the altering of the competitive structure but not in a way that would be to the detriment of the consumer; quite the opposite in fact.  It would be altered to the benefit of the consumer.  There would be the assurance of a constant supply of goods, the quality of which would be properly controlled.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and the Government have been successful in pushing and promoting such an approach.  In fairness, other governments have also pushed and promoted such an approach to their enormous credit.  I would think that a farmer who wishes to get involved with a producer group, be it for beef, mushrooms or horticultural produce, would have second thoughts about getting involved in any such quite harmless relationship in the commercial sense when he is told that such a relationship would be illegal under this Bill unless an exemption is granted.  It is not good enough to say that exemptions would be granted so as to allow these activities to continue.  We are at too sensitive a stage of our economic development to allow such uncertainty to creep in and to place the business community, the agricultural industry and the workforce at the mercy of bureaucrats who are not in a position to make decisions quickly enough.</P>
    <P>I doubt if we would be doing the right thing by pushing forward legislation such as this.  I am all for waiting for the experts in the restrictive practices area who know how the system works to come back with very sound advice.  It would be highly irresponsible of any Deputy to suggest that we ignore the advice of the experts. I am not saying that we should accept the advice they give us but it would be very foolhardy to go to court, so to speak, without a lawyer.  In this case our lawyers are the civil servants and those who work with them in an advisory capacity who will make available their collective wisdom both to the Government and this House.  I suggest we use their advice as a springboard to concentrate our thoughts. <Col N="180" /> Because of its inadequacy and brevity this Bill, if enacted, would leave the business community in a tailspin of doubt as to what they would face.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this debate, the philosophy of competition has to be defined very adequately.  Very often the concept of pure competition is associated with pure efficiency.  If we know anything about the evolution of economic theory, we know that the concept of pure competition is purely theoretical and that pure competion, such as the pure competition in the traditional agricultural sector, in practice brings with it this destabilising cobweb theory which creates the cycle of surpluses and shortages, a cycle which plagued the food supply of the world for centuries until economists and administrators began to understand how this purely competitive market had within it the seeds of instability and the capacity to provide feast or famine.  But this was to the great detriment of political stability and human welfare, leading to the consequence of regular, cyclical famines in the history of the world, many of which continue in the lesser developed countries because you have nothing going on except this mindless, natural, law of the jungle, free market competition and a large number of unregulated, unplanned producers of goods such as we have in the African states and many of the Asian states which are plagued with constant food shortages.  I am not discounting the influence of natural plagues and disasters such as floods, drought or whatever. These interfere with the free market mechanism of these countries and in an exogeneous way knock out the workings of a free market.  Of course, they themselves lead to instability and exaggerate and exacerbate the instability in these markets.</P>
    <P>When we go to solve the problems of these markets and these countries where there is less development than in the so called western world, we immediately address the problem by saying we have to establish systems within the market which will control the market, and thereby we are introducing restrictions. These restrictions must not work to the <Col N="181" /> extreme detriment of the consumer. They are medicine which used moderately can be largely and greatly beneficial. We will suggest to the farming population of many of these lesser developed countries that they introduce mechanisms, which we have found useful to us in our economy, whereby the market is not used merely as a vehicle for disposing of what is produced but whereby there will always be a means over and above the market which is governed by higher humanitarian motives to ensure that a surplus will be kept from season to season, from year to year, so that a population depending on that market will not starve.</P>
    <P>That is putting the situation in relation to free competition in fairly dramatic and clear terms.  I am not suggesting that the intent of the Bill goes as far as to say we should be totally and utterly at the mercy of the free market but is it technically possible to develop the vast range of law, regulations, case law and administrative structure at the expense of the State to put in place the total administrative and legal machinery which this Bill implies?</P>
    <P>If the Bill is brought to its logical conclusion by having it go through this House and having whatever vast drafting errors it contains amended satisfactorily to a workable state, can this economy carry another layer of bureaucratic activity such as is associated with this Bill?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who wants to set up a reasonable marketing strategy by way of franchising, joint ventures, integrations or any relationship with any other person within the economy and very often with persons who come from outside the economy such as the European firms who will be coming in here to operate on the domestic scene.  All these arrangements will be subject to doubt.  If we set them up we will have to go to this vast hierarchy of experts, bureaucrats and judiciary who will be fostered by the thinking behind this Bill.  We are looking to Government and this House to ensure policies of cost saving will be brought about in the Exchequer to ensure the level of taxation will not be as high as it has been, interest rates will be kept down and, above all, the economy will work on smooth wheels.  Give or take a few instances in this economy where restrictive practices are working, we have an economy which is beginning to move in high gear, where restrictive practices are not an extraordinarily significant element which holds back the performance of the economy, but where taxation and interest rates are still major impediments to economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be procedural problems relating to the administration of this legislation when it achieves full flower through the various ministerial activities and dictates of precedent.  We do not know how the legislation is going to work in practice under a common law system.  We know how this type of legislation operates on the hybrid, mainly civil code system of the EC.  We know there are problems about ensuring the confidentiality of legal advice and ensuring that trade secrets would not be revealed unfairly through possibly vexatious litigation.  Given the propensity of Irish people to litigate issues in court, I am not at all satisfied that business will be sufficiently protected against vexatious litigation, brought not for the purpose of achieving an award or damages in court in respect of restrictive practices, but rather for the sake of achieving a competitive advantage on a reasonable and fairly acting competitor. <Col N="183" /> The rules of procedure under this legislation would need to be fairly pointed out by the proposers of the Bill before I could give my wholehearted support to it. There are vast gaps to be filled between the prohibitive system of the EC and our present regulatory system.  Persons could institute proceedings in court for the purpose of getting a long range of discovery against the defendant company against whom damages would be sought and providing no security for costs in the event of that defendant being successful against the michievous plantiff.  None of these areas is dealt with by the legislation and all need to be dealt with.  I will be interested to hear how these threatened difficulties can be avoided in the operation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would expect more of Fine Gael than coming in here and doing in a soft hearted manner what they have done today.  I would have expected them to examine legislation such as this with a more circumspect and responsible attitude rather than coming here and merely nodding the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; of approbation with no serious analysis of the difficulties of the legislation. I am not trying to raise red herrings, I am merely mentioning practical difficulties I see arising.  If I was an expert on competition law or a practitioner involved in EC competition law I am sure I could more eloquently point out the difficulties.</P>
    <P>When we consider the economic successes in Europe in the last few years we find that Community policy is not as well geared to free competition as the Progressive Democrats would have us believe.  One of the greatest successes in EC policies has been the common agricultural policy.  It has been a success because it ensured that Europe could feed itself.  Europe came out of the Second World War almost in a state of famine and deprivation.  The CAP has ensured that there will be stability in agriculture prices and that farming families, especially those in Ireland, will have an opportunity to plan their future on the land.  I have no doubt that were it not for the somewhat regulatory practices, which <Col N="184" /> in some instances might have been called restrictive, such as in regard to the quota and intervention systems, European agriculture, and Irish agriculture in particular, would have been like that of the US and other countries.  In those countries there has been a total depopulation of the rural countryside and social structures there are dictated solely by the laws of the economic jungle.  There is no countervailing influence of the social aspects of policies like the FEOGA policy of the EC.</P>
    <P>We must pause and consider the benefits of the FEOGA policy.  The competition policy of the EC is highly qualified by social considerations.  Are the proposers of the Bill willing to import into it the social qualifications which hedge around the harshness of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome?  I suspect they are not interested in maintaining levels of employment or in ensuring that we maintain our quality of life.  In my view they are interested only in pursuing a narrow, single-minded concept of competition which is outmoded and alien to our system.  The proposers of the Bill should await the advice of the Restrictive Practices Commission and then redraft their Bill.  If not, they should await Government legislation on this topic and give Irish businesses an opportunity to pull out of their long-suffering misery under a system of high taxation and high interest rates.  Businesses should not have to face the threat of further bureaucratic interference and uncertainty arising from the facile nature of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a contribution to this important Bill which, as the House is aware, was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Cullen.  Its main objective is to <Col N="185" /> ensure that the Irish economy operates in a more efficient manner and that the Irish consumer benefits by paying a lot less for a whole range of products and services.  The way this desirable and necessary objective can be brought about is by doing away with monopolistic controls and anti-competitive practices which at present exist in many sectors of Irish industry, private and public.  I do not want any of my comments to be taken as applying solely to the public sector because there are many private sector companies who need to have the provisions of the Bill applied to them.</P>
      <P>Most speakers have indicated a welcome for the general principles of the Bill.  Even Deputy Abbott, almost grudgingly, gave some approval for the principles we are trying to address.  However, he made some extraordinary comments during his contribution.  He seemed to suggest that competition would give rise to a lowering of standards and that we were seeking to allow manufacturing to take place in an unregulated way.  He appeared to link that suggestion to the Lockerbie disaster by claiming that if our Bill was adopted we would end up with more such disasters.  That was a disgraceful comment.  It is unhelpful and has no relevance to what we are trying to do. Most Members accept the need to end protectionist policies and to open up trade and services to competition.  Obviously, that will be good for the consumer because he or she will get a better deal and it will make for greater efficiency in the way business operate.  Those changes will have to come about if we are serious about preparing for the rigorous competition that will open up with the advent of the single market in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister acknowledged that the issues raised in the Bill were very important.  He recognised the need to address them but then suggested that the Progressive Democrats should withdraw their Bill on the grounds that it was poorly drafted and was premature as the Fair Trade Commission were at present considering this whole area.  He told us he was awaiting their report.  That represents a complete cop-out on the part <Col N="186" /> of the Minister, and he knows it.  The Minister cannot on the one hand accept the need for greater competition while, on the other hand, oppose legislation that is designed to bring that about.  I suggest to him that he cannot kick to touch forever on a vital issue like this by claiming that he is awaiting a report from the Fair Trade Commission.  He is a Minister with responsibility in this area and he must face up to the fact that one of our major problems is the prevalence of restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and professional services.  He must be aware that they give rise to unacceptable cost handicaps for the Irish consumer and adversely affect our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that this problem exists but, on the other hand, he is not prepared to do anything effective about it.  Instead, he lectured the Opposition in the course of a radio programme last weekend and told us the Government would treat a defeat of their view on this issue as an election issue.  I must ask him if he seriously thinks we are going to be cowed into submission and withdraw our Bill in the face of such a threat.  He knows the Government cannot in all honesty run away from such a Bill which is required under the Treaty of Rome and which would be of such benefit to consumers here.</P>
    <P>There was another lecture in this morning's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> by an unnamed Government spokesman who pointed out that the Government's responsibility was to introduce legislation and that that responsibility should not be usurped by other parties, particularly smaller parties, and that we should not use our Private Members' Time in a way in which was never intended.  That is the height of arrogance.  We have a perfect right, as indeed has any party in this House, to introduce legislation which we feel is important and necessary.  We fully believe that this legislation is important and necessary and we are pleased with the support that has already been indicated for it.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister is under any illusions, we feel that this Bill is very <Col N="187" /> necessary and if the Minister wants to make it an election issue, so be it.  We have no qualms about that.  The fact that there may be some drafting defects is not a reason for opposing the Bill.  This party have already indicated our willingness in previous contributions to accept amendments which might improve the legislation on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that this can be dealt with in a constructive manner if the Government want to proceed in that way.  It is the principle of the Bill that matters, not minor drafting defects.  Calling on us to withdraw the Bill is ignoring the urgent necessity to update our domestic law to prohibit anti-competitive practices which are not appropriate to a modern economy and which are completely out of line with the spirit of 1992.  We hear so much from the Government about 1992 and still, here is a measure highly relevant to it and the Government have indicated that they will not support it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is purposely modelled on the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome with our courts being given power to award damages to persons who have been the victims of anti-competitive practices.  What is wrong with that?  It is the most effective way of breaking up collusion, price fixing, non-competition and restrictive practices generally.  As I understand it, the Minister is resisting the prohibition approach that we have outlined on the grounds that we already have in existence a control of abuse system under our present legislation. This system is completely ineffective and very cumbersome.  Orders under current legislation are rarely made. I put it to the Minister that it would be much better to prohibit these anti-competitive practices and to provide a system where the court could award damages rather than rely on the theoretical powers which are available to a commission and the Minister, especially as these powers are rarely availed of.</P>
    <P>Last week previous speakers to this debate highlighted a number of problems in our economy because we do not have in force legislation such as that proposed <Col N="188" /> in this Bill.  My party leader drew attention to the excessive profit margins on non-alcoholic drinks in certain premises and to the ineffectiveness of the present law to deal with that.  Similarly Deputy O'Malley pointed out the very high interest rates being charged by the two major banking groups on the credit card services provided.  This is being done through a price fixing agreement that takes no account of the general low level of interest rates that currently prevail and the present low rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton in his contribution stated that when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce his hands were tied when he tried to open up the whole practice of conveyancing.  He felt that conveyancing should not be the sole preserve of the legal profession and that people should be able to shop around to have this work carried out at a cost less than that set out in the scale of fees operated by solicitors.  It is crazy to have to pay a hefty fee for this service where, for example, there is an estate of 300 houses being built on registered land and where there is no problem with title and the subdivision maps have been drawn up by a competent surveyor.  In that case the solicitor still gets a fixed percentage on each of the 300 transactions for just rubber stamping the documents.  That was given as an example of the difficulties that arise by not having in force legislation such as is proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  Deputy Bruton indicated that had happened in 1982 when he was Minister and here we are, seven years later, and we still do not have an adequate means of addressing that issue.  Indeed, if we do not pass this Bill it will be several more years before we are able to address the points I have just raised which need to be resolved because these practices are anti-competitive and the solicitors' profession are in a privileged position in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>There are other examples that could be given where monopolies or dominant positions have cost the consumer dearly. I will dwell for some time on CIE because they hold a monopoly under the 1932 Road Transport Act to provide passenger <Col N="189" /> carrying services for the general public. At present anyone from the private sector who makes an application for a licence to provide public road passenger transport services has his application referred by the Department to existing operators for vetting.  In the overwhelming number of cases the existing operator is CIE who are exempt from the licensing system so that CIE are effectively being asked whether the existing licensed service operating in or near the proposed new route is adequate.  They are being given a veto on new entrants into the market.  That is insupportable but it has been going on since the legislation was passed in 1932.  It is absolutely ludicrous.  It provides a complete block on competition.  The monopolistic control conferred on CIE under the 1932 Act has not resulted in an efficient, reliable and cost effective service for the travelling public notwithstanding the fact that CIE received State subventions totalling £130 million last year.  This is underlined by the fact that there is no growth in the passenger numbers using CIE services, despite the very high costs for motorists.</P>

      <P>Given that I have a limited amount of time left and I have dealt with CIE, I would like to proceed by mentioning another State body briefly in case I do not get an opportunity to do so later.  I refer to the ESB who have a dominant position in the market.  They are charged with breaking even each year as far as their accounts are concerned, but the requirement does not really convey anything about the performance of the company since they are in a position in which they can pass on all their costs to the consumer.  The company's track record has been very poor in relation to any commercial activities it has undertaken and my party leader drew some attention to that also.  Because the ESB are able to cross-subsidise these loss-making trading activities with revenue out of the electricity account they are in a privileged position.  Consequently, they can afford to engage in generous credit campaigns for the sale of white goods and other goods in their appliance shops. That constitutes an abuse of their position. The requirement on the ESB to show transparency in their accounts is justified but they do not have to do so. Consequently, they are able to cross-subsidise many of their loss-making activities which is unfair to other competitors in that sector.  This is applicable not only to sales of appliances but also to repairs and installation contracts in which they are heavily involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies drew attention to this in 1986 and recommended that the ESB should divest themselves of this type of ancillary activity.  That recommendation <Col N="191" /> is gathering dust which is why we need the provisions of this Bill.  They will ensure that such recommendations, well founded, are not ignored and that companies such as the ESB engaging in the practices I have outlined are forced to trade fairly with others in the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I will not give other numerous examples.  I could draw the attention of the House of companies abusing their dominant positions and engaging in anti-competitive practices.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the provisions of this Bill are necessary if we wish to give our consumers a fair deal, render business generally more afficient and be ready for the competition we shall have to face in 1992.  In the course of his remarks last week the Minister accepted the need for such change but it appears he is not prepared to do anything about it at present.  He has advanced an outdated, irrelevant defence of the legislation obtaining.  He uses the excuse that he is awaiting a report on this matter from the Fair Trade Commission, claiming that there are some drafting errors in this Bill.  None of those constitutes valid reasons for opposing this Bill and the Minister knows it.  He also knows he is responsible for ensuring that anti-competitive and restrictive practices are eliminated in the interests of our economy and of giving the consumer a fair deal. Rather than blustering about an election and issuing threats, he should take the principles of this Bill on board.  At the very least, he should not oppose it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is somewhat deceptive.  It is somewhat like the impression one gains on first looking at Chapman's Homer.  It appears to be a great protection of consumers' interests. All the hype in recent days has been to the effect that nobody could possibly oppose a Bill that protects consumers rights and so on.  Of course its provisions do not really protect consumers.  Deputy Pat O'Malley's contribution gives an indication of what was in the minds of the Progressive Democrats in introducing this Bill, which was that the people they really want to nail are semi-State companies who, they claim, have a dominant position in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>As Deputy De Rossa has said, it is contended that unbridled competition is sufficient to protect the interests of consumers, with everybody competing on the open market, allowing the best man to win.  The falsity of that argument has been demonstrated repeatedly, in recent years adequately demonstrated in the United States where unbridled competition among airlines had meant that there are now fewer airline companies operating there than heretofore.  We can see the effects of unbridled competition here in the supermarket business, which has led to one endeavouring to gain a dominant position in the market, a good example of which at present is Dunnes Stores.  It is interesting that they are endeavouring to do so by way of the most basic commodity, the loaf of bread.  If one achieves a dominant position in that commodity one is then in control of a large segment of the food chain and also of the type of bread that will be produced. This means one is in an almost monopolistic position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the most basic commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the end result of unbridled competition. Of course, when one would achieve that dominant position then the Progressive Democrats would be endeavouring to do something about that.  While in the short-term it may be in the interests <Col N="193" /> of consumers to dash from one supermarket to another to buy the cheapest product, it will not be in their interests in the long term.  It may appear for the first four to six years that the whole exercise is in the interests of consumers but in the long term it will be they who will lose.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill would appear to be aimed at the semi-State sector whose practices seem to annoy the Progressive Democrats enormously.  They have endeavoured constantly to emphasise the damage being done by the semi-State sector through lack of competition, price fixing, contending that they are playing some type of dirty deal role.  Of course, the fact is they are run by public servants who have nothing to gain themselves but rather who want to produce the best possible service for those they serve.  It should be remembered that the top executive among them will be earning a wage perhaps high in some cases but not as high as his counterpart in the private sector.  Yet, they are working on behalf of the community in order to provide the best possible service.</P>
    <P>Of course they are restricted in many respects in what they can do through lack of capital for development and so on. That has been the case particularly with regard to transport.  One only has to think of all the mud heaped on CIE and various transport companies over the years.  The only reason a semi-State company was put in charge of transport here was that private sector competition led to such chaos people in many areas did not have any transport.  In fact, in the areas with greatest potential for transport there was unbridled competition leading to two, and sometimes three, buses competing for passengers in the same queue.</P>
    <P>That is what unbridled competition leads to.  Therefore, the State had to step in to give a service to all the people of the country, to provide the service that the people wanted.  To break CIE into private companies again would be going back to the old system of fantastic transportation in areas of high density population and none at all in areas of low density population where transport is <Col N="194" /> more needed because of distance and so on.</P>
    <P>The argument that Deputy O'Malley used in relation to the ESB is a very strange one.  He is simply dealing with the area of ESB shops selling electrical goods.  Everyone in the electrical trade will agree that the ESB are not being over-competitive but are charging a higher price than anybody else.  They are depending on people coming for the security and the service for the goods they sell, and the HP arrangements.  Those are the major factors.  There is very good reason for people to go to the ESB to buy electrical goods at a much higher price than they could get them from many other electrical dealers around the country when they look at the number of electrical dealers selling goods cheaply who have suddenly closed shop and disappeared off to Spain or some such place, leaving people with &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; for a certain length of time covering service, maintenance, repairs etc. and walking out on all those guarantees.  The last was Cannon Electric.  I cannot remember all the names, but there was a whole series of electrical firms that disappeared; some of them were featured in an RTE programme a couple of years back.  To suggest that if the ESB handed over all their shops to private enterprise there would be a better service for the consumer is a total lie.</P>

      <P>Why can they not sell electrical goods?  They are dealing with electricity.  They are best at servicing electrical goods and they know the best electrical goods.  They stand over the <Col N="195" /> quality and standard of their electrical goods.  People who have bought electrical goods from them, although they paid a higher price than they would have paid in other outlets, are very happy that they have done so.  Deputy O'Malley says that the ESB are in another business so that if they can make a profit here they can transfer that to cross subsidise another area.  Let us just look at private enterprise. The thing to do now is to diversify. People who are into selling beer, like Guinnesses, are into things like boats on the Shannon.  People in the sale of cigarettes, like Donal Carroll, are into various other projects and can cross subsidise also, and there are no complaints whatever about that from the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate. There is a continuing assertion from the <Col N="196" /> people who proposed the Bill that there is a lot of collusion involved in price fixing and a lot of abnormality in commercial practice here that this Bill would deal with.</P>
      <P>I have heard some examples from the speakers opposite concerning the problems of the banks, the problems in connection with the ESB, the margin of profit for soft drinks in our public houses and, in the last contribution by Deputy O'Malley, in regard to CIE.</P>
      <P>We need to put the whole Bill into perspective.  If we are talking about four areas only there is not a very great problem with competition.  Perhaps we will hear more examples as this debate continues. Even in regard to the examples that have been given a lot of points could be made, and a lot of action has been taken by the Government to deal with the so-called monopolies, for example, CIE.  One of the best deals one can get as regards comfort and efficiency is the early morning CIE train from Ballinasloe to Dublin which makes the journey in one hour 35 minutes.  If one were Stirling Moss one could not do better than that. That is for a £10 return ticket and, as the advertisement says, one can have the freedom of the city with free transport on the Dublin buses all day if one has nothing else to do.  However, Deputies like myself are usually anxious to get to the Dáil as early as we can.  That is an example of a very good service.  I admit that the private buses which run in competition with CIE have led to the service being so good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a reason for saying that CIE provide a bad service. They provide an excellent and very comfortable service for people from the west.  Nobody needs to worry too much about the service we have from CIE. There is competition there already through the very good bus service and the CIE train service.  That is one example that refutes the Deputy's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in regard to the banks, we <Col N="197" /> were discussing only last week a Bill from the Minister for the Environment on the building societies whereby the building societies will now provide a full range of banking services, conveyancing and all the services that we would normally associate with the bank.  That Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House. The assumption that there are a lot of problems with anti-competitive practices in this country is very wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>What needs to be stressed is that we are competitive, costs have been reduced, we have low inflation and low interest rates and we can compete as has been shown in the food industry, specifically the meat industry.  That should be highlighted here.  Deputy Mac Giolla made an interesting point on the bread war.  Even if anti-competitive practices were removed in that case there would still be a bread war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The supermarkets may say that the customers will get cheaper bread, but at what cost?  It will result in a loss of jobs in the bakery industry and also in very bad quality bread.  It is only right that the Minister should have the powers to bring in orders, as he did recently, to ensure that below cost selling will not continue.  As Deputy Cullen has said, Ministers do not like doing that but it has to be done where industries, such as the bakery industry, are put under threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>To say quite glibly that we have anti-competitive problems and that if we get rid of them everything will be all right is not the answer.  We do not want instability because that leads to <Col N="198" /> monopolies, as the Deputies opposite said.</P>
      <P>When listening to the debate in the last number of weeks about the bread war, it brought to mind the issues we discussed in the Dáil in the late seventies when we were concerned &mdash; and as a rural Deputy I am still concerned &mdash; about the proliferation of multinationals coming into this country, opening big supermarkets, and putting the small family shopkeeper out of business.  No reference has been made by the speakers on behalf of the Progressive Democrats to the fact that there are social considerations that should be adverted to in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be only right to stress that as a small open economy in which we have shown that we can compete, we should not be scaremongering about anti-competitive practices.  The suggestion in this Bill that Irish law should be changed from the control of abuse system to the prohibition system was made by the Restrictive Practices Commission in 1977, but it was not acted upon because it was considered that a prohibition system would be much more costly to enforce.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, has stated very clearly that he does not want to bring into legislation a system that will be very costly, a bureaucratic system which would ordain that extra costs would be incurred by the country and by the Government on behalf of the people of the country.  He said very clearly that in a time of scarce resources he would prefer to await the final report of the Fair Trade Commission.  I agree that we should wait until that report is produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation by the Fair Trade Commission of the possibility of incorporating Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into domestic Irish legislation is currently in hand.  The Fair Trade Commission, in March 1988, invited submissions from interested parties, representative bodies and undertakings in relation to the proposed study.  Completion of this study has been delayed by the increased workload faced by the Fair Trade Commission in carrying out their <Col N="199" /> new functions under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, as well as the need to get the Attorney General's advice on legal aspects.  The Minister has given those reasons &mdash; the cost involved and the constitutional question &mdash; and it would be only practical that they would be accepted by the proposers of this Bill.</P>
    <P>While there is mention in the Bill of the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, we are not too clear about the role that is envisaged for the Fair Trade Commission.  When replying to this Bill we should be told what will be the role of the Fair Trade Commission in future.  In this country there is a Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and a Fair Trade Commission.  The Minister has the power, as has been seen in the bread war, to make orders under section 8 of the 1972 Act.  The orders cover such goods as radios, building materials, motor cars, groceries, carpets, motor spirits, intoxicating liquor, jewellery and electrical appliances.  These are very important orders.</P>
    <P>The Government, since coming to office, have acted on matters like below cost selling of groceries and the receipt in the grocery trade of what is known as &ldquo;hello money.&rdquo;  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who piloted legislation through the House and the present Minister, Deputy Burke, who as Minister for the Environment brought in planning laws to deal with multinationals getting involved in major supermarkets in this country, have a very good record in trying to ensure that anti-competitive practices do not affect the smaller business.</P>
    <P>A very good point was made by Deputy Pat O'Malley when he said we must talk about competition on an equal basis.  One of the major problems for our small retail outlets, whether in the bakery business or any other small family business, is that they are operating very much on an unequal basis when competing with the major supermarkets and multinationals. I would like, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, to share my time <Col N="200" /> with Deputy Chris Flood, if the House is agreeable.</P>

My comments are to some extent based on experience.  Coming from a commercial background, I have had some involvement in the economic development of the country.  I have also had an opportunity to participate in the commercial interaction of the economy.</P>
      <P>While the whole question of anti-competitive practices needs to be addressed in the interests of the orderly development and expansion of our economy, we have to extend great care as to how we devise legislation to deal with the issue which is addressed in this Bill.  From a fairly cursory examination of the Bill I am not convinced that this is the correct way forward to deal with anti-competitive practices.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Derelict Sites Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I was speaking about improvements to and the refurbishment of existing dwellings which would be of benefit in the Cork designated areas.  The development has not yet commenced in the Blackpool section.  In Cork the seizure of vacant lands in urban areas took place in the late sixties and seventies.  This practice is now more infrequent on account of the city's plan to discourage the buying of vacant lots cheaply and holding them for profit. This is not only an amenity issue but also <Col N="201" /> a problem with the land market.  The type of people who are holding on to vacant land are, first, those who purchased land quite some time ago at bargain prices or those who have inherited same; secondly, those who have held on to land which they did not pay money to maintain and, thirdly, people who over-rated their prospects by buying land in the hope of it being purchased by a developer for office blocks etc. and hang on to these sites in the hope of making a big profit.</P>
      <P>The Bill needs a mechanism whereby purchasers of these sites are discouraged from holding land which could be used for amenities.  In relation to the tax benefits introduced in this Bill, which I understand are to encourage owners to clean up these sites and put the land on the market, I feel that the benefit would be to the advantage of the purchaser and not the seller.  The tax benefit is, of course, beneficial to the functioning of the land market and should discourage the holding of land for long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I am aware that many vacant sites are kept very clean and tidy by their owners but it is still a problem in urban areas.  Often these sites or buildings have had their roofs removed in order to remove the rates liability for their owners.  This aspect of the law should be changed in order to eliminate this practice.  Many such buildings are kept clean and tidy by their owners but are still very unsightly.  In appropriate cases, perhaps it would be advisable to allow owners to maintain their vacant buildings without the onerous rates bills, which they face at present, by introducing some form of graded rates for such buildings. The encouragement to owners of derelict buildings should be directed towards holding these sites for the shortest time possible.  In many cases these sites could be sold into public ownership at reasonable prices which would reduce the actual cost of providing housing, schools, hospitals etc. unlike the present situation where the owners of these sites have very high expectations of large profits from property held by them for very long periods.  I welcome this legislation which should have come before the <Col N="202" /> House many years ago and I wish the Minister and the Bill every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I speak on this Bill it is appropriate that I should remind the House that the Minister for the Environment and, indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment have already introduced the Water Pollution Bill.  In the budget they made provision for the cleaning up of our beaches and recycling of waste and now with the introduction of the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, we can truly say that we have two Ministers who care for the environment.</P>
      <P>The Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, must be welcomed by all as a major improvement on its predecessor, the 1961 Act.  The massive increase which we have seen in dereliction has obviously been a major concern to all of us and raises significant questions relating to the inadequacy of the present Act and the underlying reasons for this increase in derelict sites. It is also significant for us as a people that we become increasingly aware of our environment and, as I said at the outset, as a Government we are adamant that we should encourage urban renewal. Indeed, Deputy Burke in his speech to the House emphasised the major effect urban renewal has had on the city of Cork and all over the country.  It is significant that the Government have provided these incentives to reactivate economic activity in our larger cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The perception of tourists and visiting industrialists of our urban areas is extremely important.  I can point out that in my own city of Cork the IDA have been particularly vocal on the condition of some of the derelict properties on the approach roads to the city.  The same applies to every city and town in the country.  Indeed, the IDA contend that such buildings and sites can have an adverse effect on the perceptions of intending investors in our country.  They further contend that by their buildings shall we know them, to coin a phrase. Therefore, the general lack of care for our environment could prove harmful to the attraction of high tech industry, one <Col N="203" /> which is renowned for the high level of hygiene and environmental awareness.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill; the wider definition of &ldquo;derelict sites&rdquo; is welcome in that it now includes dwellings which were excluded from the 1961 Act.  This, taken in conjunction with sections 11 and 12 of the Bill, will mean that action can be taken by local authorities against early dereliction.  When we come to the control of derelict sites there is a major step forward on the previous Bill in that many local authorities chose up to now to ignore derelict sites due to the fact that the costs involved in restoring or in refurbishing them could never be recouped by them.  Now local authorities under this Bill are mandated to maintain and establish a register of all the derelict sites and this will ensure their active involvement in administering the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another positive result is that we can now quantify the scale of dereliction in each area.  We can provide a follow-up system and in the case of urban areas we can allow the imposition of a derelict sites levy.  On the question of a levy, it strikes me that we have been extremely successful when we have provided a carrot for our citizens.  Nowhere was that more evident than in the tax amnesty, which brought in £500 million.  It strikes me also that people would be much quicker to get rid of dereliction if they were granted an incentive to do so in some way.  There is a disincentive for a person who immediately refurbishes his derelict building, in that the person suddenly has a rateable commercial property on his hands. Indeed I know of a recent exmple in my own area where a person was paying absolutely no rates on a derelict property because the roof had been removed, but immediately on the refurbishment of the property, he was faced with a rates bill of £1,100 per annum.  Therefore I would suggest that the Minister might consider an option for the owners of such properties, namely a five years rates remission for such premises which were converted into commercial entities, thereby increasing the prospects of job creation.  The <Col N="204" /> Minister should also consider the possibility of extending in some cases section 27 to derelict sites and buildings where again there was conversion to industrial activity.</P>
    <P>Under the old Act there was a major problem with the establishment of ownership. I know of several instances within my own county council area where the local authority found it extremely difficult to establish the identity and the address of the owner.  In fact, in one instance &mdash; and a row of houses were involved &mdash; the owner was living in Australia and his legal representatives refused point blank to give his address. For refusing to do so they were levied the paltry sum of £5.  Thankfully that situation has been rectified and now the fine has been increased substantially.  Perhaps the Minister should make it compulsory when property changes hands that the rating authority would be notified of the name and address of the new owner and that the rate records be given some legal status when it comes to dealing with derelict sites.  To cite an example, when the Register of Titles Act was introduced, it was envisaged that the Land Registry system could be gradually extended throughout the whole country, but as it transpired only counties Carlow, Laois and Offaly had this applied and no further steps were taken to have it extended to the other counties.  I would also point out that at present town properties are registered in the Registry of Deeds and not under the Register of Titles Act.  I ask the Minister to check the feasibility of having the Registry of Titles extended.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the unscrupulous measures taken by some people to induce dereliction for their gainful purposes and for those, section 29 with its provisions for increased fines is more than timely.  However, one also has to be aware that people who have been left derelict properties by way of wills or by the next of kin dying intestate may not have the means to refurbish the property. Obviously I would express concern that such persons might be criminalised under section 29, and again I suggest to the Minister that he could make provision for <Col N="205" /> exceptional cases as he does by way of exemption in other sections.  In the same vein, I refer the Minister to section 12 (3) of the Bill.  Under the 1961 Act when notice of dereliction is served by the local authority, there is provision in that Act for an appeal to the Minister.  However, in section 12 (3) of the Bill, I have not been able to locate such an appeal system.  I hope the Minister will be able to enlighten me on this because there could be a constitutional problem in that if there is no right of appeal the section as it is stated may offend one of the principles of natural justice, that is that no man can act as a judge in his own cause.  Therefore there should be a provision in the Bill to appeal to the Minister after the serving by the local authority of a dereliction notice.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an amazing step forward and I recommend it totally to the House. However, I ask the Minister to consider carefully the number of points I have raised in my speech.  Finally I would like the Minister to examine the preservation order on historical and cultural buildings. While in fact many of these buildings have been preserved, many have fallen into ruin.  I would ask the Minister to see if certain incentives can be made available by way of restoration work where a preservation order is in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak again on this very important Bill. I assure the Minister of my wholehearted support for it, and I believe that every effort will be made to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are implemented. The Bill has been welcomed by all sides of the House.  However, I would sound a note of caution, in that we might try to undo in the short term what has happened over a long number of years.  We might try to move too hastily to correct many of the unsightly buildings and sites which are so prevalent in the countryside.  By doing so, we could inflict great hardship on people who through no fault of their own find that they have a derelict site or building which they cannot afford to keep in good repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, we have a major and <Col N="206" /> widespread problem on our hands.  Anybody who travels around the country and takes note of what is happening around him will know that it has become quite common to see unsightly developments, indiscriminate dumping of old cars or rubbish.  The local authorities will have to have more power to put an end to this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the last speaker on the Land Registry and I would welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil to the provisions of a land register.  In fact this was well under way during the term of office of the last Government.  Of course, it would have been a very useful exercise and would have given us up-to-date information on the ownership of all our lands in the country.  This is a policy that should have been pursued, whether we were in favour of a land tax or not, which is an altogether different issue.  The compilation of a land register was very important work and I know that in the counties where the officers had completed their task they had come up with very useful information, which could now be used in the Bill apart altogether from the purpose for which it was set up.  There is an idea abroad that if a person takes the roof off a commercial building it will no longer be liable for rates.  It should be stated clearly that this will no longer be the case.  Once the roof is removed, a building will go into decay and become unsightly.  Obviously some people believe this is a means by which they can bypass paying rates on commercial buildings.</P>
    <P>Housing schemes can be unsightly because when they are completed the residents who move in paint their houses in various colours.  They can be blue, red, black, green and purple in some cases. There should be regulations whereby a colour scheme would be part and parcel of a housing development and one could only paint their house brown, grey or whatever.  This could be done by the developer, whether a private developer or a local authority.  There needs to be some direction in this regard because as one approaches a town or village one can see housing schemes which are a maze of colour and these can be very unsightly. Both the residents and the authorities <Col N="207" /> responsible for these housing schemes should take notice of this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the urban renewal scheme. The work which has been carried out under that scheme is impressive.  The first impression one gets of anything is usually the lasting impression one has.  I come from a Border region &mdash; I make no apologies for being parochial about this matter &mdash; and if we want to attract people from Northern Ireland to trade with us the urban renewal scheme will have to be extended to Border towns and villages. Many people in these small towns and villages make a gallant effort to maintain their buildings but because of economic difficulties in that region it is noticeable that these towns and villages have become neglected.  The urban renewal scheme should have been extended to all the Border towns and villages, with no apologies made to the rest of the country, because of the impact they have on people coming from Northern Ireland. One or two towns have been singled out for particular reasons.  That is fine as an example of what can be done but I hope that in the further development of that scheme all of the other towns and villages along the Border will be included.  Clones was earmarked to receive a certain amount of funds but to date it has not received any of these funds.  Clones is an &ldquo;island&rdquo; town in the Border area which is much in need of an uplift and money spent there would be well spent.  There is no doubt that when one becomes accustomed to looking at something it can go unnoticed but when visitors see an unsightly building or whatever they can be put off by it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is more than welcome because it will draw attention to what is happening in our countryside.  Many of these problems are caused by absentee landlords and I welcome that part of the Bill &mdash; if I am correct in my reading of it &mdash; which provides that in order to acquire a site it will not be necessary for a local authority to establish the ownership of a site.  That is a welcome development because it is unfair to local residents, whether they be urban or rural, who are making a gallant <Col N="208" /> effort to maintain their homes and their area to have a derelict site in their area because somebody who is not resident there and who has no input into it will not spend money on such a site.  If people are not prepared to spend money on cleaning up or developing a site it can be screened off in a short time and at a minimum cost with wooden screens that can be painted.</P>
    <P>County councils have authority to move in and acquire derelict sites.  This is a welcome provision but before they do so every effort should be made to establish the ownership of the site and to find out why it had become unsightly.  It may well be that the person who owns the site may be in financial difficulty and for that reason I believe funds should be made available to the local authority which they could disperse to people in difficulties.  One cannot legislate or penalise people into undoing what has been done in our countryside over a long number of years but they could be encouraged to carry out improvements, and the best encouragement one can give is to offer people a reward for bringing about the changes which are needed.</P>
    <P>Rapid progress is being made in regard to developments in my county.  We have an excellent county manager who intends to announce an inter-county competition between towns and villages of a similar size which will give local communities an initiative to bring about the improvements he believes are necessary.  This is a welcome development and it should be taken up by other counties.  The Tidy Towns competition is run on a national basis, and I believe it should be continued, but when competitions are run on a county basis, for example, inter-county sport competitions, they create more of an interest and stir people into doing things which will be to the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to dumps, whether they are local authority dumps or areas of land used by people for dumping.  Local authorities are very often the culprits for the manner in which these dumps are maintained.  Every town has its own dump adjacent to it but I believe there <Col N="209" /> should be a centralised dump for the refuse from towns and villages.  Rather than having a dump adjacent to each town, one large area perhaps of wasteland or bogland could be screened off from view, an area which is generally not being used by the public or by visitors. There may be some additional cost involved, but probably in the long term such a large dump would be cheaper to maintain than a large number of smaller dumps all over the country which are poorly maintained, to say the least.</P>
    <P>In Clonee there is a problem with people who are trading in car parks. There is an unholy development there and I cannot understand how it is allowed to continue.  This is alongside a road where many residents keep their homes and farms in excellent condition.  There is nothing nicer in the springtime of the year than to see people out painting their gates and whitewashing the walls.  It is a great tradition with us to maintain our holdings.  It is very discouraging that down the road from such well-kept dwellings a group of travelling people, I suppose, can set up camp, bringing in all sorts of car bodies and scrap machinery, start a dump and begin cutting these vehicles up.  I do not understand how or why these people are allowed to behave like this.  Is it that the local authority have not powers to prevent it?  If they have not, the powers should certainly be given to them.  I do not know if such powers are included in this Bill.  Such dumps are prevalent and quite noticeable.  A stop should be put to this immediately.</P>
    <P>People from urban areas often go for a drive on a Sunday afternoon.  Having gathered up all the rubbish around their houses they put it in the back of the car, drive out to the country and, when there is nobody looking, they throw it across the nearest hedgerow.  The identification of a car number should be sufficient evidence, even if people do not know who are in the car.  The car should be traced and the people prosecuted.  It is wrong that people can do that sort of thing and get away with it.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome the Bill.  The Government should move with caution <Col N="210" /> and try not to undo what good we have been doing.  The countryside has been subjected to attack over a number of years.  Where absentee landlords are involved, or people are not in residence locally and there is no attempt to improve an unsightly development, these people should be gone after.  With local residents I would exercise caution so as not to humiliate anybody.  This could have a bad effect.  I assure the Minister of my support and welcome for the Bill.  It should have been introduced into this House many years ago.</P>

      <P>I particularly welcome the opportunity to participate tonight in this debate on the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989.  The views I am going to express will be largely based on personal experience as a local public representative on Dublin County Council and I hope my views will contain many of the comments made to me by my constituents throughout the part of Dublin I represent.  These comments are from people who have experienced the utter frustration of trying to deal with derelict sites in their own area, or neighbourhood over the years, under the legislation available to them until now.  It is hoped this Bill will become law as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How often have we been faced at public meetings with demands from residents to deal with a particular eyesore or derelict site in their area?  When we refer the matter to the local authority we find frequently that for a variety of reasons, largely going back to the inadequacy of present legislation, the local authority are unable to deal with the problem.  This has had a tremendous impact on communities, on the older communities which saw the increase in derelict sites in their areas and on the newer communities, the new housing areas where, although housing estates were being developed, places around those estates were being allowed to decay and become derelict, causing great concern and discomfort to both types of community.  This legislation is an attempt rapidly to correct the situation which has been allowed to get out of hand for far too long.  Basically, <Col N="211" /> we are dealing with the inadequacies of the 1940 and 1961 legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister when opening this debate made a number of telling points which put the legislation in perspective.  He sought to highlight clearly for us the reasons for the legislation being necessary. We must understand the impact of derelict sites on the environment, on people living in the immediate area, and the effect the general sense of dilapidation derelict sites can have to those who see them, perhaps for the first time. This legislation seeks to confer on the local authority primarily, the power to deal with derelict sites, which power all of us have realised for some time they have lacked.  Many of us, having the benefit of serving on local authorities, will know that there is very much an involvement in development plans which are largely drawn up or renewed every five years and very often during discussion on such plans the issue addressed in this Bill comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us something of the history of the legislation in so far as it attempts to deal with derelict sites. He has shown quite clearly that the legislation available to local authorities at present is extremely weak.  One local authority, Dublin Corporation, find that there are, in a very small space between the canals, something in the order of 600 derelict sites.  That is an enormous number and obviously it is causing tremendous disquiet to those living in the area concerned.  Perhaps it has given rise to the drift from inner city areas out to the suburbs, something which we now recognise is not necessarily a welcome trend in population movement.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to try to provide local authorities with powers to deal with the issue of derelict sites.  It is extremely timely and follows on a number of very imaginative Bills brought forward by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, to strengthen the hand of the <Col N="212" /> elected representatives of local authorities. One frequently hears the complaint from elected representatives at local level that their powers in relation to local matters are extremely limited.  This Bill represents an attempt by the Minister and the Minister of State to give back substantial powers to local authorities. The elected representatives are familiar with the problems of their own areas and are best qualified to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is no more important issue than derelict sites when it comes to the exercise of power by locally elected representative organisations.  Local assemblies are in a position not only to harness the powers within the local authorities but also to call upon voluntary effort to deal with derelict sites.  This has been shown to some extent by some of the more enlightened local authorities who have been able to devise schemes in which tenants' associations and other interested groups and organisations play a specific role in cleaning up areas which have become eyesores.  Voluntary organisations have contributed very significantly to the enhancement of their neighbourhoods, but local voluntary effort, no matter how well disposed, is not always able to deal ultimately with the issue.  For that reason the Government have brought forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Bill was not strong enough to deal with this problem, it would be a waste of time, but any examination of its contents will show that the Minister sets out to give teeth to the Bill.  It contains provisions which will allow local authorities to take very strong action once notices have been served on the owners or occupiers of derelict sites.  There is a fundamental difference between this legislation and the Acts of 1940 and 1961. The 1940 Act contains only the threat that the local authority will be enabled to acquire derelict sites if the owner or occupier does not put them in order. There is no case to make nowadays for a local authority dealing with this issue by threatening to acquire a piece of property. This would lead to enormous difficulty in the expenditure of taxpayers' money to acquire sites which would be of <Col N="213" /> no use to the local authority.  That was one of the fundamental weaknesses in the 1940 Act.  The Minister here deals with the problem by way of levies.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty for a local authority has always been the definition of the derelict site.  Those of us who have experience of serving on local authorities have frequently brought a particular site to the attention of the management, asking that it should be investigated.  Frequently the manager reports back that he cannot define the site as derelict under existing legislation, although we know that by comparison with neighbouring sites the site in question is clearly derelict.  Nevertheless, legal opinion is often otherwise. The Minister has addressed this problem by widening the definition.  This will strengthen the hand of the elected representatives and the management of local authorities in defining derelict sites on a much wider scale.  Problems of definition have heretofore allowed for the continued existence of derelict sites, despite complaints by individuals and local representatives.</P>
    <P>An important provision of the Bill is that which requires a register of derelict sites to be drawn up by every local authority within one year from the commencement of the Act.  They must establish and maintain a register to be known as the derelict sites register. Although it might not be realised by some contributors, this outstanding provision means that any elected representative or other interested person can, by contacting a local authority, discover if a particular site is on that register.  If so, the matter can be pursued with the local authority so that action can be taken under this legislation.  If the site in question is not included in the register, the local authority can be alerted to undertake the various procedures necessary to have it entered on the register.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill.  The work of elected representatives will be made much easier when discussing this issue.  It will be possible for the management of local authorities to name all derelict sites within their area and to apply pressure, if required, to have them <Col N="214" /> dealt with as provided for in this Bill. This provision will strengthen the hand of the local authority.</P>
    <P>It will give the ordinary person better access to information relating to derelict sites in their own areas, an issue that might concern them because they live beside the derelict site or work beside one.  That is an extremely important insertion in the Bill and I am delighted, as someone who has served on a local authority, to see it because it will strengthen the hand of the elected representative, the manager of the local authority and ordinary individuals who may have a problem in regard to sites in their area.</P>
    <P>The legislation also refers to the power of the local authority to acquire derelict sites.  Generally, the Bill confers power on the local authorities to do this but I do not favour local authorities acquiring sites just because they happen to be derelict. However, the legislation is strong enough to allow for local authorities to take other measures in regard to most of the derelict sites.  I do not think that any of us would be anxious to see local authorities acquiring, willy-nilly as it were, sites just because they happened to be derelict and which would not be of any use to the local authority in question.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly refer to the levies which can now be charged by local authorities to owners of derelict sites over a number of years.  This gives teeth to the legislation because, without a penalty or financial implications of some kind for the owners of these sites, the Bill would be worthless.  I am glad the Minister and the Minister of State take a similar view, that legislation of this kind would be worthless without financial penalties being imposed.  Therefore, I am particularly pleased that up to a maximum of 10 per cent &mdash; depending on what the Minister may decide &mdash; of the value of a site can be levied by the local authorities in any one year.  This will quite clearly spell out to the owners of such sites that the time has come for them to put their houses in order and that we will no longer accept a situation where sites are allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that they <Col N="215" /> become derelict.  If they decide to go down that particular road a financial penalty will be imposed which will, I hope, encourage them to ensure that the sites are kept clear and do not become an infringement on people's rights in an area as far as a clean and healthy environment is concerned.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister recognises that there will be an occasional case which will involve hardship.  We accept this can happen in any legislation which has a punitive clause.  However, there is a waiver which can be utilised at the discretion of the local authorities and taken into account.  The Minister is very fair-minded about this and recognises that individuals can have difficulties for a whole variety of reasons which mean they may not be able to respond in sufficient time to avoid a financial penalty.  The Minister is to be complimented for allowing the waiver to be included.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Bill which will strengthen the hands of local authorities and in a special way it compliments and reinforces the view of the Minister and the Minister of State in their intention to give back real, significant and substantial powers to local authorities and their elected representatives which we all recognise have been taken away or eroded.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on this excellent legislation. I note that all sides of the House have warmly welcomed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill which follows a number of others from the previous Administration.  It is another step in the right direction.  If its provisions are enforced it should ensure that our streets and rural landscapes will be considerably improved, creating a better urban and rural environment for all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly a new awareness among urban and rural dwellers of the importance of making our environment better and cleaner.  Some progress has been made but we still have too many derelict sites in the private and public <Col N="216" /> sector which are a blight on the countryside. At a time when we are trying to promote tourism more aggressively, it is a major drawback because when you compare our environment with that of most European countries we are sadly lacking.  We are certainly at a considerable disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> England, Germany and Northern European countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the powers the Bill will give to local authorities.  The 1961 Act was used effectively by some local authorities, and this was referred to already by Deputy Burke.  Cork Corporation implemented the 1961 Act very forcefully and got results.  However, most county councils and local authorities did not implement the Act vigorously and, as a result, there are many derelict sites around the country.  If more use had been made of the 1961 Act and if there had been a greater commitment towards its enforcement, there would hardly have been a need for the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, by giving more powers to local authorities to tackle and control the problem, should be more effective than the 1961 Act.  It should result in the elimination of many of the eyesores around the country.  However, its implementation depends on how seriously the local authorities take it.  Certainly their record in this respect is not great.  If they are not serious in this regard the Bill will be ineffective.  I welcome the commitment by the Government in this respect and there is a more rigorous policy now in regard to water pollution, for example, which has been effective.  If the same philosophy is pursued in relation to this Bill there could be a major improvement. It depends on the goodwill of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister may mention the problem about financing local authorities in relation to carrying out the various directives in the Bill.  Do local authorities have sufficient manpower to carry out a survey of derelict sites?  What criteria would be used in deciding whether a site is derelict or not?  Would an objective assessment be carried out or would the individual surveying the site decide?  Perhaps this is <Col N="217" /> already included in the Bill, but I would like the Minister to comment on this matter.</P>
    <P>If a person cannot maintain their home at a certain standard it is possible that it could be considered to be derelict.  This may strike fear into many people.  I would like the Minister to outline the limits to which a local authority would be able to go in deciding what is or is not a derelict building and what resources would be made available to cash starved local authorities to implement the various provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which would enable the Minister to force local authorities to clean up their act. Local authorities are major polluters &mdash; I think 30 per cent of pollution is caused by local authorities.  Because of cutbacks in the public capital programme the number of treatment plants being erected is smaller than that of previous years and this is the kernel of the problem.  It is very important that the local authorities clean up their act.  If we put pressure on the private sector to clean up their act it is only fair that the local authorities also do the same.  Unfortunately, the local authorities are as culpable as private enterprise.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the provision which would enable the Minister for the Environment to direct local authorities to improve derelict sites in their ownership. In this regard I would like to refer to the many old single rural cottages which in some cases remain in the ownership of county councils in the west, the occupants of which have emigrated.  In many cases no one has taken over the ownership of these cottages with the result that they have fallen into disrepair and have become unsightly.  Some action is needed.  I hope this Bill will place an obligation on the owners of unoccupied houses in the private sector to get rid of them, to knock them down, to maintain them or sell them because they should not allow them to become eyesores.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned at the number of dilapidated old housing estates in our towns and cities.  I am aware that the Government operate a good scheme for <Col N="218" /> the refurbishment of houses in our towns and cities given the constraints under which they have to operate, but we still have a long way to go before we rid ourselves of the large amount of bad housing around the country at present. Houses in which elderly people live, whose families have been moved out to live in newer estates, have been allowed to become run down.  Nobody seems to care about them.  These houses should be refurbished or the tenants should be rehoused.  It may be very difficult to transfer elderly people from homes in which they have lived most of their lives to newer estates, but this is a major problem, as these old housing estates do not add to the appearance of our smaller towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The house improvement scheme helped considerably to improve our housing stock.  Under that scheme, especially in the countryside, many people were helped to maintain traditional style buildings which would otherwise have disappeared and been replaced by new houses.  It is important that these buildings be preserved as they add to the attractiveness of the countryside.  They appeal to tourists and Irish people alike. I ask the Minister to consider reintroducing some form of house improvement grant scheme, particularly for external repairs to roofs and walls.  It is very important that we do this as in many cases people cannot afford to carry out the repairs required to make their homes look good.</P>
    <P>Urban decay has been a feature of Irish life since the beginning of the century, especially in our larger cities.  Even though the problem has been arrested in Cork, Limerick and, to a lesser extent, in Dublin progress is very slow.  The Minister in his speech said great progress has been made in certain areas, for example around Christchurch.  I travel here via that area most mornings and it seems that there has been a proliferation of derelict sites in that area during the past few years.  It is absolutely ridiculous that this should be so.  Perhaps it is not too bad for those who live in this country but tourists who use that route must get a <Col N="219" /> very bad impression of Dublin.  The same must be true of those who arrive by train and travel along the quays from Heuston Station.  It is one of the most dilapidated stretches in the whole country.  I appeal to the Minister to place special emphasis on that area through which many tourists pass, as its present condition must have a very negative effect on them.</P>
    <P>It is very important that derelict buildings be redeveloped in accordance with the traditional architecture of the area. As far as possible, the front of the buildings should be retained with the rear of the buildings being replaced.  There is nothing worse than seeing a modern building in the Sam Stephenson mould in the middle of period architecture which has stood the test of time and which still looks good &mdash; there are many such examples around the city &mdash; whereas buildings such as O'Connell Bridge House are as unsightly as some of the derelict sites scattered around the city. There appears to be a growing awareness that the front of a derelict building should be retained, especially if it is of stone. One such example is the present redevelopment of a building in Mount Street which retains the traditional front with the rear of the building being replaced. That type of development must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the success of the incentives for urban renewal let us not forget the previous Government introduced the legislation.  I would like to thank the Minister for coming to Tralee to announce the extension of it to that town where it has made a major impression and been very successful already.  We have a conference centre, and although that did not replace an existing building it is very welcome.  Various schemes are in progress in Tralee and it is good to see scaffolding back and building going on there.  Many building jobs in the town would otherwise be devastated.  This scheme could be extended to include further urban areas around the country. Even in Kerry a case could be made for some of the bigger towns like Killarney, Listowel, Cahirciveen and Kenmare.  I <Col N="220" /> know if it is extended too much, revenue for the local council could be cut down; nevertheless the county council would lose no current revenue.  Anyhow the advantages of extending the scheme would far outweigh the loss of potential revenue for the councils, create much needed employment and improve the streetscapes considerably.  I would like the Minister to extend the scheme as he considers fit and appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some of the provisions in the Bill.  It is a good idea to require the local authorities to maintain a register of all derelict sites in their areas.  In that regard it would be very important to determine ownership of the sites.  In many cases a solicitor or auctioneer could be fronting whoever the owner is.  For example, nobody knows who is the owner of the Blasket Island. We know the people who represent them but nobody claims to own it.  I am referring to the Great Blasket not to be confused with other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when drawing up a register that the real owners are identified.  The Bill provides that the owners have to be informed beforehand. It is not good enough to inform the representatives of the owners of the sites. People should have explained to them why their building was being put on the register and many of them would respond and ensure that it would not go on the register.  The register could be placed in the media, the local papers especially, to indicate where exactly the derelict buildings are.  People should be encouraged to report derelict sites which may be off the main run and out of people's notice.  Co-operation of the public and of councillors should be sought to ensure that all derelict sites are put on the register and the local knowledge should be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision placing a duty on owners and occupiers of land to prevent it from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site is linked more or less to the register. In this regard we should have a public <Col N="221" /> education programme starting in the schools.  It is mainly adults who own sites and a public awareness and education programme run over TV could make people aware of the importance of preserving and conserving sites and of the damage that could be caused to the environment and the economy.</P>
    <P>Some of us may not have studied the Bill too deeply but if people were aware of what is involved in this type of legislation they would respond accordingly. People generally and even Members of this House are unaware of many Acts that apply to their constituencies and constituents. If this Bill is to be successful it needs a public awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new powers given in the Bill to local authorities to take action on derelict sites and to require information on ownership.  The Bill will enable local authorities to acquire derelict sites compulsorily and if the matter goes to court the owner will have to be made known.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has some interest in architecture, especially rural architecture, I am very supportive of this Bill. People should be educated to appreciate what we have and what we should hold. Unfortunately, many derelict sites here represent an age that is gone.  Many of the buildings on them are from the 18th and 19th centuries.  It is a pity that in a very irresponsible fashion we have destroyed much of the architecture of that period.  A certain type of tourist comes to Dublin to admire its architecture. We have lost some of our best architecture including some old town houses used by the aristocracy of by gone days.  Many of these buildings have become dilapidated beyond repair.  I hope with such legislation as this we as a nation will develop a greater appreciation of our past.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister, and his Minister of State, for their positive action in regard to the environment but we must not forget the last Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland, who did a lot of good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue and I hope it eliminates the shabby buildings in all areas.  The improvement in the appearance of our countryside, our cities, towns and villages is of paramount importance.  We must aim to maintain the high standard our emerald isle is held in by our fellow Europeans. Far too often we have had a complete let-down on that high profile.  I note from the explanatory memorandum that the Minister blames public authorities for the many derelict sites and buildings. That is true in many cases but the Minister must bear in mind that local authorities, due to a lack of finance, are unable to deal with derelict sites.  Will the Minister give an assurance that local authorities will be provided with adequate finance to eliminate derelict sites in their areas?  There is little use in introducing a Bill to deal with derelict sites if local authorities are not given adequate finance to implement its provisions.</P>
      <P>Most of the derelict sites owned by local authorities have been earmarked for the building of council houses and the Minister should ensure that those authorities are given adequate finance to erect houses on those sites.  There are thousands of young couples and young people on local authority housing lists but due to a lack of funds councils are unable to provide them with accommodation.  I should like to compliment local authorities who are erecting modern type dwellings for their tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities may find it very difficult to trace the owners of derelict sites and buildings and for that reason I would like an assurance from the Minister that he will not allow local authorities to move hastily in compulsorily acquiring those sites.  They should explore every avenue to try to locate the owners of such sites many of whom emigrated to America, Australia, New Zealand and the Far East.  It will be difficult to locate them but local authorities should do everything possible to trace them.  Justice should be <Col N="223" /> done in those cases.  I hope the Minister does not use this legislation as a battering ram.  He is being given a lot of power under the Bill and I hope he does not use the big stick of power to take over derelict sites.  He should encourage local authorities to act with restraint before they compulsorily acquire derelict sites.  I accept that compulsory acquisition will be necessary in many cases if we are to rid many of our towns and villages of derelict sites but where possible councils should try to reach an amicable agreement with the owner.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the introduction of a rateable valuation system on such sites will lead many owners to sell them. A rates demand each year will spur those people into action.  Will the Minister give the House details of his proposals for the huge tracts of land that adjoin our national primary roads?  As one drives from Dublin to Cork, or along any national primary routes, one can see acres of land that were acquired for road realignment lying idle.  If some of those lush acres of land were in parts of my constituency we would have many visible farms.  However, that land is completely overgrown with weeds.  If I had a farm adjoining that land I would sue the local authority under the noxious weed legislation because the seeds of nettles and other weeds blow into adjoining holdings. The Minister should give local authorities finance to clear such land of weeds.</P>
    <P>Some of our semi-State bodies are responsible for derelict sites.  In the constituency represented by the Minister of State, Bord na Móna have left large tracts of cut-away bog idle.  That could be utilised profitably rather than being left to produce noxious weeds such as daisies and buttercups.  High class masonry buildings in our cities, towns and villages should not be demolished and the Minister should make special grants available for the restoration of such buildings.  The house improvement grant scheme introduced by the last Government helped the <Col N="224" /> restoration of many derelict buildings.  I appeal to the Minister to restore those grants.  He should bear in mind that when the grants were available the building industry prospered.  Fianna Fáil Members have often highlighted the importance of the building industry and told us that it was the greatest industry for creating employment.  For that reason I cannot understand why a Fianna Fáil Government abolished house improvement grants.  We were improving the condition of houses and restoring them for generations to come.  I appeal to the Minister to reintroduce the house improvement grant.  If the Minister does so I can guarantee that there will not be a derelict building in any town, city or village in the next decade.  Those grants proved their worth in restoring the environment and in restoring dwellings, some of them unique stonebuildings which will outlast bricks and mortar dwellings, the type of building which will never be built again.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also use his good offices with the Minister for Finance to get special concessions for individuals to purchase and restore derelict buildings and sites.  Concessions could be worked out with reference to the register which local authorities have to compile and produce to the Minister.  The scheme that was used for the inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford could be used along with the register compiled by the local authorities.  It is not asking too much to ask the Minister to make concessions available.  Driving up the quays in Dublin this evening I saw a placard saying that it was cheaper to develop property in a certain area and telling people that they would get special concessions for developing buildings in the inner city.  We saw what they did in Cork city where a huge area of derelict buildings has been restored because of special concessions given to developers under the Finance Act.  The same concessions should be given to individuals and firms who are prepared to invest their money to restore derelict sites.  This <Col N="225" /> would circumvent a lot of the costly litigation that local authorities will have to endure under the criteria in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I see that the local authorities are to be armed with two new effective weapons to combat dereliction.  First, they can serve a notice on the site owner requiring work to be done and, failing compliance, they can enter onto a site and carry out the work with power to recover the cost. I cannot see that working in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is exactly the same. No matter what way the Minister tries to whitewash it, he still will not sell it to rural Ireland.  The Minister will only sell it if he agrees to my request tonight. The Minister should re-introduce house reconstruction grants and give sufficient money to the local authorities to develop lands they purchased years ago on the understanding that they would have enough money to develop them.  A lot of local authorities have not developed building land because of lack of finance. For that reason I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to make the task easier for local authorities who are willing and able to proceed with building programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is to be successful we will have to work with local authorities and with individuals and we will have to make finance available so that county councils <Col N="226" /> can proceed with their building programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to join in the general chorus of welcome for this measure which is, it is generally acknowledged, long overdue. A drive through any part of rural or urban Ireland will testify to that.  I join with the general commendation of the Minister for introducing this Bill which we hope will be rendered effective in solving the problem it sets out to address.  I pay tribute to the former Minister for the Environment and former spokesman for environmental affairs on this side of the House, Deputy John Boland, for the measure he brought before the House in 1988, the measure which Deputy Sheehan alluded to but which might not have the precise detail of the Government measure but which is largely parallel in content.  It certainly is parallel in intent and motivation towards solving the problem we are addressing this evening.</P>
      <P>I will not go into detail in relation to specific provisions of this Bill which will be addressed from all sides of the House on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Farrelly, our acting spokesman this evening said, there are a number of reservations on this side of the House in regard to a number of its basic tenets and clauses. As we debate the various provisions we will be seeking to ensure that they are rendered watertight.  It will be our hope that there will be no loopholes remaining and that the Bill will go on to the Statute Book as a milestone in eliminating one of our worst scourges, that is these abysmal derelict sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An impression all Members seemed to have was that derelict sites constituted largely an urban problem, that it was essentially a city problem with no relevance to rural areas.  Yet a coast to coast tour of the country, a drive through any village or town will be ample evidence that it is a nationwide problem.  So many derelict sites are a blight on our landscape. Indeed they are an indictment of <Col N="227" /> us and our commitment to environmental matters that to date we failed to address the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the best innovations ever in terms of bringing about an improvement in the overall national facade and environment and rendering our countryside attractive to tourists has been the proliferation of Tidy Towns committees. Every town now has its dynamic group setting about a general cleanliness campaign and another in relation to the restoration of villages and towns, their facades and grass areas, which they have done with considerable distinction. Indeed it is a source of pride to such groups that they have managed to leapfrog each other in terms of the competitiveness of producing the goods.  Each year there are new areas, villages and towns emerging as victors, people transferring from the achievement of results in one category to others, with an enormous sense of local pride being engendered. However, one of the most demoralising features of that Tidy Towns campaign has been the inability of local committees to address the age old problem of dereliction. How demoralising it is for a community to landscape their gardens, restore their footpaths, have the local authority play their part by way of input into local development, enabling them to utilise the most imaginative shapes, fashions and designs on the facades of their villages and towns yet allowing one black spot &mdash; the derelict site &mdash; to affect the end result.  Therefore it will be seen that it is not an urban problem only but a rural one also.</P>
    <P>As I drove into the city along the quays this morning, as I looked objectively at Ellis Quay, Arran Quay and Ormonde Quay in the knowledge that this Bill was being introduced in the House today, I was forced to reflect on how the quays must appear to visitors, to people who may have just driven through the Phoenix Park, in all its glory and splendour and then descended onto Arran Quay. <Col N="228" /> Ormonde Quay and Ellis Quay with their facades bordering one of the most beautiful rivers in Europe, the Liffey.  Such facades can only be described as so pock marked and derelict as to constitute something equivalent to a mouthful of bad teeth.</P>
    <P>I welcome the incentives offered by the Government in relation to the development of the inner city, the tax incentives available as inducements to private enterprise to move in and develop the inner city.  We must encourage and engender positive action.  However, we must be precise in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  While we may all have a general notion as to what constitutes dereliction, we may well ask what is the precise technical term encompassed in this Bill.  I welcome in particular the twin provisions introduced, that is the introduction of a register, the obligation placed on local authorities to remedy derelict sites and land and also the imposition of a levy on the owner of a site which becomes derelict.  Those are two valuable provisions that must be implemented. However, it has to be said that when we devolve power on local authorities to enforce these provisions very often we find that the policemen themselves are the most culpable.  It is my belief that when this register is drawn up we will discover that the greatest culprits in relation to land with a considerable element of dereliction will be the local authorities themselves or other State agencies.  In anticipation of such an eventuality I would urge the Minister to give the necessary funds to local authorities, semi-State organisations and health boards to put their houses in order. One cannot convert the poacher to gamekeeper unless one provides him with the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed on this side of the House in regard to the need not alone to introduce house improvement grants for the refurbishment and reparation of ordinary <Col N="229" /> dwellings but a specific grant for the preservation of houses of special character. There are many stone dwellings throughout the country that have fallen into a state of dereliction or that are about to reach a state of repair beyond redemption requiring urgent attention.  There is nothing more galling than seeing a house of particular character fall into disrepair, eventually being subjected to the one fell swoop of the bulldozer and converted into rubble to fill in a tiphead somewhere. Always I am aghast to see what might be termed priceless material in terms of fine quality cut stone, in the form of blue Bangor slates which are no longer available at any builders' providers being dumped as rubble, covered over by topsoil, obscured for posterity.  It is my belief that there is much building material, such as cut stone, slates and traditional red brick that could be recycled for facades or for use on the entire structure of reestablished buildings in the old style.  I would urge the Minister to investigate the possibility of recycling materials of that type.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact of life that we have departed totally from old style, traditional buildings.  It is my hope that the fashion will go the full circle so that the old facades will be restored as a permanent feature over the next 20 or 30 years.  It would be my hope that we will depart from the bland, boring type of structure that has become so much part of the prize-winning architecture of this city.  I should like to see the reincarnation of the old designs, with the necessary prizes or incentives being offered architects to direct their ingenuity towards that end.  I agree that we should be cautious in relation to CPOs but that when the decision has been made by a local authority to invoke the CPO, the whole process should be greatly expedited.</P>
    <P>I concur with the sentiments of Deputy Deenihan that we have failed miserably in the educative process by not giving the necessary appreciation of what is old and good.  Last night on television we saw a <Col N="230" /> prime example of a person of considerable standing in the community being responsible for the demolition of an old, priceless church in the Minister's own constituency in the village of Kilmain. I can easily identify with the wrath of the local community and their determination to have preserved what was a very fine structure but which was felled without their knowledge.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  It is a milestone in terms of the preservation of buildings of architectural merit and the demolition of buildings which constitute a danger in terms of their fabric and of removing from the landscape, once and for all, one of the sad blemishes that is so characteristic of modern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is long overdue. In particular I welcome section 4 which extends the definition of a derelict site to include private dwellings.  One of the problems facing local authorities up to now has been the difficulty of dealing with private dwellings in rural towns and villages.  The introduction of this section is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Included in the wider definition is derelict land.  Perhaps the Minister would take the opportunity when replying to explain in more detail what sections 11 and 12 really mean.  Is the Minister talking about land specifically in cities, towns and villages or about land in the broader sense of the word?  This needs to be clarified to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ideal for local authorities to maintain a register, and perhaps they could categorise the different types of property. As the previous speaker said we have many valuable traditional type properties around the country which are of aesthetic value and historical significance.  There is also the more common property which has traditional value peculiar to the Irish countryside, towns and cities.  It is important to define the various categories so <Col N="231" /> that priority will be given to the preservation of the more valuable historical ones.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that when sites become derelict some very fine traditional frontages are not retained but knocked down, constituting a major loss to the general structure of our towns and villages.  In the past much damage has been done.  If this Bill does something to preserve what remains it will be doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill puts an onus on occupiers is important, but I am concerned that statutory bodies, including local authorities and semi-State bodies who are supposed to implement the legislation, have been major offenders in contravening the legislation while pursuing other people who have contravened it. There is a duty on the Minister to ensure that they themselves put their own house in order before proceeding against anybody else.</P>
    <P>In rural areas outside of Dublin there are many derelict dwellings.  Many are derelict because of the social problems that have arisen in those areas, particularly in the west where there was a high incidence of emigration, and nobody at this stage knows who the owners really are.  I wonder if the Minister has discussed with his counterpart, the Minister for Justice, what approach to adopt in such cases.  Do they intend to set about establishing ownership or do they intend just putting a compulsory purchase order on and acquiring the property regardless of who the owner is?  These are matters that must be considered sensibly because, for many people, leaving their homestead was a sad and emotional affair, and many had aspirations of returning.  If some of these were to return to find the homestead had already gone into State ownership it could lead to some difficulties. Perhaps the Minister would outline what his Department intend to do in such instances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The Bill excludes all other Departments and the Office of Public Works claiming that the Minister for the Environment would deal with his various colleagues in Government and, in the event of being unable to work out a satisfactory conclusion with those Ministers, would have the matter discussed at Government level.  I wonder how practical it is for every single Department to have to work out with individual Ministers how they intend disposing of derelict sites owned by those Departments.  That is a very loose provision which could lead to a certain amount of negligence or oversight. I would not be happy with that state of affairs.  There is a need for everybody to be specifically accountable to somebody.  Other Government Departments should not be exempt from direct scrutiny.  Perhaps the Minister would, at the conclusion of this debate, outline in greater detail the reason for this exclusion as it has not been explained to my satisfaction. I am concerned about this because in my experience the statutory body itself is often the biggest offender. That is unfortunate and it is unfortunate that that statutory body should be imposing its will on private individuals while itself not complying with the legislation.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland the home improvement scheme was an extremely valuable one from the point of view of retaining our traditional farm homestead and village house.  It was introduced because the Government of the day felt there was a need to draw more people into the towns and villages where people were leaving. The take-up of the scheme was far in excess of what the then Government envisaged.  Like previous speakers, I urge the Minister to reconsider the introduction of a home improvement grant scheme.  As Deputy Jim Higgins has said, it should be introduced primarily to retain the old type building, the old frontage and the general old type rural house.</P>

    <Col N="233" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to you, Sir, for your courtesy in allowing me to raise this matter.  I realise that there are many demands to raise matters on the Adjournment and you have to take each request on its merit.  Therefore, it is all the more appreciated.</P>
      <P>My main concern in raising this issue is that having discussed it both publicly and privately in the past number of months, Dún Laoghaire may lose the prospects of a marina or marinas.  The danger as I see it is that people who will be making proposals will be talked out of Dún Laoghaire and will consider elsewhere. I understand that in areas like Skerries, Malahide and Greystones people are very anxious, and quite properly so, to seek to improve the seafront and seashore environment and, for that reason, they would see Dún Laoghaire's lost opportunity as their gain.  As I have said, I do not begrudge these areas marinas; quite the contrary.  Nor do I begrudge them any type of development that would better their communities. What I am trying to do is to establish once and for all Dún Laoghaire's right to a marina, arising from the report of the planning review group.  I am asking the Minister and his very able deputy, the Minister of State, to implement the recommendations of the report of that review group as a matter of some urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the prerequisites to the setting up of a marina is the setting up of a harbour authority.  The review group envisages a harbour authority as comprising a chairman and six people who know what they are talking about in the context of marina and harbour development; no more and no less.  I ask the Minister urgently to set up that authority, tomorrow if possible.  The authority would then see it as their function to implement the main recommendations of <Col N="234" /> the report.  The review group who produced this report was chaired by Professor Dermot McAleese, Professor of Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin.  I would like to congratulate him and his colleagues for the excellent report, the manner in which they reported so quickly and the very succinct, pithy and direct recommendations set out in it.  This group of people met with many people and considered many proposals and submissions.  Seventy-four submissions were made to them by individuals, including myself.  In addition, they met people with proposals for marinas.</P>
    <P>It is these organisations that I am concerned about.  If Dún Laoghaire and the groups in Dún Laoghaire who are against the development of a marina or marinas continue to put pressure on organisations of this nature they will go elsewhere and that is the danger.  I see the development of a marina in Dún Laoghaire, in the Coal Quay harbour in the first instance, the inner quay harbour, the first phase development proposed by Marina Developments (Ireland) Ltd., as the key element to the development of Dún Laoghaire.  At present people are complaining about the lack of activity in the centre of Dún Laoghaire.  If the marina is built in the first instance on the Coal Quay harbour the ripple effect for the building of other marinas will be immediate. The general area of the seafront, the derelict pavilion site opposite the Town Hall, the Salthill Hotel site and the Dún Laoghaire market site are all right for development.  If the proposals for a structured and ordered development of the marinas in Dún Laoghaire are taken on board then these other developments will automatically fall into place to the inestimable advantage of the community in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>There are about 7,000 unemployed people in Dún Laoghaire at present. When I knock on the doors at the next general election, in Sallynoggin, Ballybrack, the heart of Dún Laoghaire, Loughlinstown and Shankhill, I will be <Col N="235" /> asked why I did not support developments in Dún Laoghaire.  I will be told that by not doing so I am not helping to create work for our young people who have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>This is a marvellous opportunity to begin the ordered and proper development of Dún Laoghaire and the offer of a number of organisations should be accepted in relation to the development of marinas in Dún Laoghaire.  I am talking about proposals from Marina Developments (Ireland) Ltd., a private organisation which I would imagine will be looking for regional funding, and the most recent proposal by Carlisle Leisure Development, a proposal for the development of the Carlisle pier area of Dún Laoghaire harbour, prepared by the National Yacht Club and the Royal St. George Yacht Club.  That is a wonderful proposal.  If the Government would make an immediate decision in relation to the harbour authority and let them get on with the proper and structured development of Dún Laoghaire harbour it would be of great advantage to the community there.</P>
    <P>My concern is that Dún Laoghaire will lose these development offers.  If you go to any part of England or the Continent and look at the seafronts they are packed with marinas, with consequent huge economic advantages to these areas.  I am not talking simply about a marina park for 300 boats.  There are huge spin-offs such as chandlers, boat builders, ship suppliers and all sorts of additional ancillary matters which lend themselves to being part of a marina.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire must be one of the finest harbours in Europe, if not in the world.  It certainly is one of the most under-developed harbours and for that reason I would like to see its proper development.  As far as many people are concerned, it is a place to pass through on the way to somewhere else and that is unfortunate because Dún Laoghaire is quite a beautiful place and could be made <Col N="236" /> more beautiful in an ordered and structured fashion.  There is a first-class hotel there, the Royal Marine Hotel which was recently renovated and which is a great credit to the people who carried out the work.  There is the Fitzpatrick hotel and the Court Hotel in Killiney, marvellous and very well used hotels.  There are also guesthouses and so on.  If Dún Laoghaire harbour was developed the benefits and advantages to those guesthouses and hotels would be immense.</P>
    <P>If the marina or marinas are developed all the existing facilities can be retained. The yacht clubs will remain relatively untouched.  The Motor Yacht Club have a very genuine and legitimate concern about the inner harbour, or Coal Quay development, which they consider might affect them.  I understand from the developers that they would have access to their club and to a great extent they would remain untouched by whatever developments would be considered.  Of course, the needs and desires of the local people would have to be taken into account.  It is unbelievable to hear people talking about the deprivations they will suffer in the context of bird watching or of walking, of being in some way deprived of these amenities because a marina or marinas will be set up in Dún Laoghaire. The reality of the proposals I have outlined is that the east pier and the west pier will remain untouched and will continue to be used as pedestrian ways.  Of course, they should remain untouched. At present the west pier is covered by grass, it is underutilised and unwalked on to a great degree.  The east pier is probably the most walked on pier in the country.  What facilities are available in the harbour which is underutilised?  What are the facilities for these walkers on both piers?  None, there is not even a restaurant on the seafront available to the gnáth duine who goes out there on a Saturday or Sunday to walk during these fine winter mornings and afternoons. Apart from a person selling ice cream at the end of the east pier there is no facility <Col N="237" /> available there to the thousands of people using that pier.  This is nothing short of scandalous.  There is a disgraceful lack of facilities in the area of the departure of the boat to England.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons I believe a marina will attract people into the area. As a spin-off there will be additional facilities for the ordinary person for whom so much concern has been expressed in the past number of months. I am as concerned for those people as anybody else but I have an obligation and a duty to judge what I consider to be what is right for Dún Laoghaire in its future economic development.  I am entitled &mdash; and I do not think this is being denied me &mdash; to the right to express my views as to how Dún Laoghaire should develop.  It should be developed by taking this report, not in any piecemeal fashion because the piecemeal development of Dún Laoghaire harbour would be a disaster, but <i>seriatim</i>, and applied accordingly. It is a marvellous report.  It represents effectively the philosophy for the future development of Dún Laoghaire.  Everybody has had a say.  We know exactly what people think and now the time has come to judge the merits and get all these thoughts together, shake them about, and come up with a decision. I believe an immediate decision is essential for this development.  If we do not proceed with this development as a matter of urgency, we will wave goodbye to what is on offer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced recently that there was to be £23.5 million from the Regional Fund for Ireland, including a figure of £1.78 million for a marina in Kilrush, County Clare.  Good luck to Kilrush.  I hope they have a marvellous marina and that it is of great benefit to the people there.  At the time the Kilrush marina proposal was announced, the Dún Laoghaire proposal was announced also and we are still talking about it while the people of Kilrush are getting on with it.  That sort of regional aid is also available for Dún <Col N="238" /> Laoghaire because, as we know regional aid applies to the whole of Ireland and not just to any particular corner of it. The advantages of having this sort of development are immense.</P>
    <P>A proposal was made by Dún Laoghaire Corporation in 1983 to include the infill of the &ldquo;gut&rdquo; on the outside of the west pier.  That was a very good proposal, one that should be viewed and considered in the overall development of the harbour and its marina or marines.  I say marina or marinas because I would hope to see more than one marina, perhaps more than two, three marinas, may be.  These should be developed taking account of the report of the planning review group on the one hand, the type of development proposed by Marina Developments (Ireland) Limited and on the other hand the type of development proposed by the Carlisle Leisure Development group, the two yacht clubs as I have already mentioned. There were other proposals by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The Power Corporation group in association with Brent Walker suggested the infill of 100 to 150 acres of the 250 acre harbour.  I think that was pie in the sky and I would not be in favour of it.  At the same time a proposal of that nature &mdash; and it was a proposal to be funded by £100 million &mdash; should be looked at and the proposer given the courtesy of at least having the idea examined.  Personally, I would be against it the suggestion of the group.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire Harbour is one of the prime and most important amenities in this State.  We must recognise Dún Laoghaire as a port of national significance.</P>
    <P>There was a report by McCarthy and Partners on behalf of the joint working party, the working party of the four yacht clubs.  That report considered marinas for the middle harbour at the east pier, Carlisle pier area, the west bight area, the east bight, the old harbour and inner harbour and again that is worthy of consideration. I have already mentioned the Marina Developments (Ireland) Limited <Col N="239" /> proposal for the Coal Quay or old quay or inner city or whatever one wishes to call it.  We also have the Carlisle leisure development to which I have also referred.  There has also been an input from Sealink Car Ferries.  The Dún Laoghaire Borough Council have made their views known.  The report of the planning review group was made known to the Minister in November or December of last year.</P>
    <P>We have been speaking in the Dún Laoghaire area about the question of a unified car ferry terminal.  I see no reason why a unified car ferry terminal could not be seen side by side with the marina development.  I can see all these interests being attended to in whatever marina development starts first.  Sail training would go on apace, public access and amenities would be uninterrupted, the sacred east and west piers would continue.</P>
    <P>There is some suggestion that if the area on the &ldquo;gut&rdquo; side of the west pier were developed, in some way the west pier might have to be breached.  If it was to be breached it would be done in the best interests of Dun Laoghaire harbour. That is why I would ask the Minister to urge his colleagues in Government to implement the proposals of the report of the planning review group.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil freagra a thabhairt don Teachta David Andrews maidir le forbairt Dhún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>In 1987, a company called Marina Developments Ireland Limited &mdash; MDIL &mdash; was formed with a view to establishing marina facilities at Dún Laoghaire using private funds.  The MDIL submitted a proposal to the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works for a two phase project which would provide marina facilities in the inner harbour and in the old harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 8 April 1988, the Government <Col N="240" /> announced that approval had been granted to MDIL to proceed with their plans for the marina.  From the time that the details of MDIL's proposals became public, concern was expressed about the development over such issues as access to the harbour, environmental considerations, traffic and car parking facilities and the impact of the development on the mooring facilities already available in the harbour.  Particular concern was expressed about the lack of information available to the public regarding the proposed development.</P>
    <P>On 27 April 1988 at a one day conference organised by Dún Laoghaire Borough Council to discuss the future development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, the Minister for the Marine announced the establishment of a planning review group to examine overall harbour policy. On 23 June 1988, the planning review group, comprising two officials from the Department of the Marine, two from the Office of Public Works and two from Dún Laoghaire Corporation under the chairmanship of Professor Dermot McAleese of Trinity College, was formerly appointed.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Deputy Andrews, but prior to his contribution tonight, I was well aware of his concern and his commitment to the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  It is gratifying to hear him reaffirm this, if that is at all necessary.  I appreciate his concern that this development should take place and that it be carried out in an orderly manner, as he has said, and that the views and concerns of all should be taken into account.  I expect that Deputy Andrews will fully acknowledge that every effort was made to ensure that the views and concerns of the people of Dún Laoghaire were taken into account by the planning review group.  I appreciate his kind comments on the planning review group under the chairmanship of Professor McAleese.  There is no intention of carrying out any development, whatever the Government may decide, in a piecemeal <Col N="241" /> fashion.  The development must be planned and not take place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I believe that anything other than a planned development would prove unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the planning review group require the group to consult with the Harbour liaison committee, a committee originally set up under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and reconstitued for this purpose.  The committee met for the first time on 4 August 1988 and made a submission to the planning review group on 9 September 1988.  This submission, which is reproduced in full as an appendix to the planning review group report, was taken into account by the group in their conclusions.  The review group report published on 8 December 1988 was welcomed by the Minister for the Marine.  He considered it a comprehensive, considered and professional blueprint for Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The group's recommendations constitute an outline management plan for Dún Laoghaire Harbour and Deputy Andrews has referred to this.</P>
    <P>The planning review group recommend that the management and development of the harbour should be entrusted to an authority consisting of a chairman and six ordinary members to be appointed by the Minister for the Marine on the basis of their competence to contribute to the running of the harbour.  All the recommendations have been taken into consideration.  There was general agreement that some sort of harbour development is necessary and indeed desirable.  However the planning review group felt that any new development in the harbour should respect its essential characteristics and the high quality of the existing environment.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for maintaining the spread of activities that have traditionally been carried on in the harbour. The planning review group's report considers the commercial use of the harbour, <Col N="242" /> the future development of the ferry terminal, the use of the harbour for leisure and amenity purposes and marina development in the harbour.  The report concluded that the ferry teminal plays a key role in formulating a plan for the harbour.</P>
    <P>The planning review group examined possible options for the future of the terminal. They felt that Dún Laoghaire is uniquely placed for marina related leisure activities.  However, the present system of swinging moorings in the harbour has a number of serious drawbacks.  A marina would boost the local economy of the area and for these reasons the planning review group favoured the principle of marina development in Dún Laoghaire and set down criteria for such development. They evaluated possible marina locations within the harbour.  The group considered the proposals from MDIL for the provision of a marina at Dún Laoghaire and examined the objections raised to the development.  They concluded that the balance of public good lies with allowing the first phase of the MDIL project to go ahead, subject to certain safeguards.</P>
    <P>The development of the area known as the &ldquo;gut&rdquo;&mdash; and referred to by Deputy Andrews &mdash; west of the West Pier is discussed in the report.  A comprehensive plan for the harbour and all is facets must include provision for this area.  Its importance derives from its role in providing potential development land in the harbour area.  The group recommend, <i>inter alia</i>, that land is needed to accommodate marina related commercial and leisure development, particularly support services for marine development within the harbour.  Given the scarcity of land within the harbour, the obvious location is on existing and now reclaimed land behind the West Pier.</P>
    <P>The proposed construction of a marina will certainly lead to job creation.  Wherever marinas are built, jobs are created in its construction and, of course, there are long-term benefits as a result of a <Col N="243" /> marina along our coast as it provides full-time and part-time employment.  The Deputy has referred to the importance of the ancillary industries which are linked to any marina development.  We would be most anxious that in any development, jobs would be created as a result.  There is a knock-on effect and indirect benefits can be derived from a marina development. I concur totally with Deputy Andrews' comments on the importance of a marina to Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The planning review group's report considers the options for the future management of the harbour and sets down criteria for the management of it.  As I have stated earlier, the recommendation is that there should be a harbour authority. I fully appreciate Deputy Andrews concern that Dún Laoghaire may lose the prospect of the development of a marina and that if there is considerable talk we may talk ourselves out of the development. I assure the Deputy that this will not happen.  The discussion will not go on for very much longer.  The Government and the Minister for the Marine will not waste time reaching a decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> The planning review group's report has been considered by the Minister for the Marine and also examined by officials from the Department of the Marine.  As a result, the Minister has already formulated proposals which will shortly be put to Government.  The Minister confirmed this in the House some few days ago in answer to a parliamentary question. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make any announcement in advance of the Government's consideration of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that the Minister will not be making an announcement until the Government have had time to consider the proposals.  I will bring to the attention of the Minister the concerns expressed in the House by Deputy Andrews.  I can assure him that the Government have not wasted any time over the past 12 months, and will not waste any time over the next few weeks, in reaching a decision on the future development of the harbour.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 February 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria used in the last survey in 1982/83 and also in the present survey are that an area must have less than 7.8 per cent of ploughed land, must have a stocking rate of less than one adult bovine livestock unit per forage hectare, must have a family farm income per male farm <Col N="53" /> worker not exceeding 80 per cent of the national average, must have a population of not more than 27 inhabitants per square kilometre and must have at least 30 per cent of total working population engaged in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the EC Council Regulation on producer groups is to encourage farmers to form themselves into groupings in the interests of concentrating the supply of agricultural products and adapting production to the needs of the market.  The producer group concept is particularly aimed at regions of <Col N="54" /> the Community where production is disorganised and fragmented resulting in serious structural deficiencies at supply level.</P>
      <P>When the Regulation was being extended to Ireland priority was given to those sectors most in need of structural improvement at producer level.  The pigmeat sector was not included in this priority list in view of the high degree of concentration at production level with about 85 per cent of production coming from only 6 per cent of the holdings.</P>
      <P>The producer group Regulation will enter into effect in Ireland in the four sectors (beef, sheepmeat, cereals, potatoes) agreed by the Council in December 1988 when a set of detailed implementing rules are finalised by the EC Commission over the coming months.  I will be waiting to see the level of interest in and uptake of the produce group measures in these four areas before deciding on the question of seeking their extension to other production sectors.</P>

      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  Her case was then transferred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the categories of persons who became entitled to pensions under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1988, whose entitlement was removed by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisons) (Amendment) Regulations, 1989, and the circumstances in which this arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1988, (S.I. No. 263 of 1988) which came into effect on 13 October <Col N="61" /> 1988 gave entitlement to old age (contributory) pension on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to certain persons who failed to qualify for pension because of gaps in their insurance record prior to April 1974.  These gaps occurred because, prior to April 1974, social insurance coverage for non-manual workers only applied if their earnings were below a certain limit.  This limit was increased from time to time and, as a result, some persons found themselves being intermittently in and out of insurance thus causing gaps in their insurance records.  These gaps could affect entitlement to old age (contributory) pension for which a minimum average of 20 contributions since the date of entry to insurance is required and in some cases as a result of the gaps people failed to qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>It has emerged, however, that the 1988 Regulations as they stand extend entitlement to <i>pro rata</i> pensions to categories other than those for whom they were intended, namely, persons who moved prior to 1974 from full to modified insurance not covered for old age (contributory) pension and at earnings above the insurable limit and who came back into insurance in 1974 at the modified rate.  They are part of what is known as the &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; category and the provisions introduced in 1988 were not intended to apply to them.  The problems associated with mixed insurance generally in relation to social welfare pension entitlements are being examined at present by the National Pensions Board as part of its review of State, Semi-State and private occupational pension arrangements.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 18 of 1989) introduced with effect from 2 February 1989 is to confine entitlement to <i>pro rata</i> pensions, as originally intended, to those who became compulsorily insured at the full rate or contribution on 1 April 1974 following the abolition of the insurable limit.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment payments is subject to the conditions that a claimant must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  The Department must be satisfied that claimants continue to satisfy these conditions while they are in receipt of payment and for this reason all claims are subject to review from time to time.</P>
      <P>Reviews of entitlement may take the form of reviews of individual cases which warrant specific attention or they may consist of reviews of certain claims selected on a random basis.  Persons whose claims are reviewed may be asked to supply evidence of the specific efforts they have made to find employment.</P>
      <P>Officers from the Department's external control unit regularly interview claimants at the Department's network of local offices, and at signing centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Approximately 800 postal claimants sign each week at Howth Garda station which is a signing centre for North Cumberland Street Employment Exchange. This arrangement is provided to facilitate those signing on locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday, 24 January, two control officers of the Department's External Control Unit, attended at Howth Garda station as part of their normal duties. The gardaí made a room available, on <Col N="63" /> request, for the purpose of the interviews, to afford privacy and confidentiality. The control officers identified themselves as social welfare officials to the general queue, as is the standard practice, and none of the claimants should have been unaware of their identity.</P>
    <P>Claimants, who were selected at random, were directed by one control officer to the interview room and asked briefly by the other control officer about such routine matters as their efforts to get work and their availability for work. None of these interviews lasted more than a couple of minutes as each of the control officers was aware of the need to avoid unnecessary delay to claimants awaiting interview.  Where it is necessary to conduct a somewhat more prolonged interview the practice is not to conduct these in Garda stations but in departmental offices or suitable rented premises.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the present arrangements in relation to these routine interviews at Howth Garda station signing centre are satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Total employment did not fall in 1988.  It actually increased.  Notified redundancies declined from 26,000 in the year to April 1988 to 23,000 in the year to end December. It is not possible to quantify the relationship between movements in job losses, including notified redundancies, and net employment.</P>
      <P>The 1988 labour force survey showed an increase in total employment of 6,000 in the 12 months to mid-April of that year.  The continued strengthening in economic activity shown by available indicators since then supports the view that, apart from the public sector, the trend in total employment continued upward.  While it is not possible to make a firm estimate of the end-1988 employment increase, it should be somewhat less than the April labour force survey figure of 6,000 because the upward trend has to be adjusted to take account of the decline in public sector numbers.</P>

      <P>The Denny Street culvert was constructed in 1975 on the basis of advice and information available at that time to the local authorities.  Following the severe flooding that occurred in 1986, Tralee Urban District commissioned a report on all the sources of flooding in the town.  Arising out of this report, the urban council submitted urgent proposals to my Department for modifications to part of the culvert at the junction of Ashe Street and the Mall.  Approval issued to the carrying out of these works as part of the Mounthawk/Balloonagh Drainage Scheme which is currently under construction.</P>
      <P>In October 1988, approval issued to preliminary proposals for major flood relief works and it is now a matter for the Council to advance the planning of these works.</P>

      <P>Charges are imposed on all persons, including medical card holders, in Eastern Health Board accommodation on a long term basis, in accordance with the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1954 as amended by the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965.</P>
      <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed in any particular case health boards have full regard to the person's circumstances.  Allowance is made for any commitments the person may have, e.g. rent, mortgage, insurance premiums, hire purchase payments etc. and a reasonable amount is left to the person to meet personal needs.  In general 75 per cent of a person's income is taken by the board and the remainder is left to the person to meet personal needs but this can vary depending on individual circumstances.</P>
      <P>Such charges are generally imposed from the date of admission to a long-stay hospital or home if it is reasonably clear that the person will be there on a long-term basis.  There can be delays in some cases as it can take some time for the board to fully investigate a person's circumstances and decide on the appropriate charge.</P>

      <P>Where a person is granted both a service pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, 1937 to 1988, and a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1980, the schemes provide that the service pension is reduced so that, in general, the total of both pensions will not exceed the sum of the greater pension plus one-half of the lesser.  The disability pension is paid in full.  The principle involved is not unique to Defence Forces' personnel but applies generally in other areas of the public service. There are 110 officers and 297 other ranks personnel affected by the operation of the provisions in question.</P>

As the present grading system has now been in use for some 20 years, however, it is considered opportune with the advent of computerisation to review the system in consultation with interested parties.</P>

      <P>The initial allocation of teaching staff in respect of full-time day courses for the current school session (1988-89) was issued by my Department to County Sligo VEC on 14 July 1988.

      <P>Following the issue of the final teacher allocation by my Department on 25 October 1988, the committee submitted a further appeal on the basis of staff shortages in certain subject areas.  It was not possible to authorise a further increase in the allocation in that regard as concessions had already been made under the various headings decided by the Government arising out of the deliberations of the Central Review Committee of the Programme for National Recovery.</P>
