    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the various speakers over the past few weeks, and particularly over the last couple of days, one could be pardoned for coming to the conclusion that we were living in a country that had taken on a new lease of life, in the past two years, but particularly in the past few months.  The impression has been created, for reasons best known to all concerned, that we have embarked upon a new era, that everything is running as was intended, that everything in the garden is rosy, also that the country is on the right course, that the people are happy, that there is sufficient to meet the needs of everybody and that there is nothing to worry about.  When one looks at the various commentaries particularly in the business world, we see commentators coming forward &mdash; some the heads of State or semi-State agencies &mdash; and exclaiming in unison that the country is now on the right course, that good Government is in control, that stability has been achieved for the first time in many years, that great expectations are the order of the day and that great achievements are already well in hand.  I am afraid reality is far from that very rosily painted picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have found, as I am sure every Member of the House has found, that <Col N="881" /> one issue that has received a great deal of public attention in recent times is poverty. As a public representative I would have to state that the true picture is far from the one we have seen painted from the benches of the Government over the last few days.  Never, as a public representative over the past ten or 12 years, have I had evidence of hardship such as I am now having with individual constituents, in the past six months in particular. I am not talking about hardship within a particular income sector but about hardship right across the board.  I am talking about people in middle income groups who have high mortgages and may be unfortunate enough to fall ill, or require medication, perhaps on a continual basis, and who await a refund of medical expenses under the refund of drugs scheme.  Eventually they find that they are owed a considerable amount of money by the health boards who do not appear to have the money to pay out.  The situation drags on, with ever-increasing hardship on them.</P>
    <P>Great acclaim has been given to an alleged achievement but the national debt, on which so much attention has been focused, has not gone away.  From being the responsibility of the nation, it has merely shifted onto the backs of the people.  There are more people owing more money per head than at any time in my experience, certainly as a public representative.  That is borne out by the number of individual cases each Member of the House must face up to in his or her daily life meeting constituents and dealing with their problems.</P>
    <P>I have often heard it said that what this country needs is tough, stringent action to bring the economy around and that is quite true.  However, in doing so great care should be taken to ensure that the country does not have its back broken in the process, like the old story of the ship trundling along and sudden action being taken which puts serious pressure on the superstructure.  I am concerned and disappointed at the evidence that I see among the community.  On the one hand we have the continuous barrage of publicity and public relations stating that <Col N="882" /> everything is going well, but the reality we all know.  I do not want to be too political but this House is a political arena.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of State sitting opposite of the posters we all saw a couple of years ago.  One of these depicted long dole queues.  The implication there &mdash; although nothing was said, mind you &mdash; was that theses dole queues would be shortened.  There is no question about it, the dole queues would be shortened in a particular fashion.  The people who were in those queues, albeit not in the best circumstances.  are now far away from these shores.  They have long since emigrated to the United States, Australia, the United Kingdon and elsewhere, The 70,000 people who left this country last year are no longer part of those dole queues.  The 70,000 people who will leave this year will not be in those dole queues, either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have achieved part of their strategy in a peculiar and perverse fashion.  They have reduced their responsibility in that area by exporting our greatest asset, our young people.  They now do not have to worry about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are attempting to enhance the tourist industry by the same stroke.  When these emigrants return at Christmas and during the summer season they are then called tourists and counted as such.  They are welcomed at our ports and airports and are encouraged to spend their money here.  This is a new kind of economics.  I am truly amazed that anybody, any Government or party, could have thought up that strategy.  It is unique and very neat and people do not <Col N="883" /> seem to have copped on to it just yet. People have simply been transferred out of this island and are now counted among our visitors.  This is a rather peculiar way in which to improve the tourist industry's achievements and, at the same time, reduce the unemployment figures.  Of course, the actual figures have not been reduced at all.  We have off-loaded a number of people but the figures are still high and are growing.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar problem about determining the actual number of jobs created over the past 12 months.  Ministers have refused to answer this question about the net number of jobs created until it was dragged out of them in recent times.  We now know there was a net loss, that there are less jobs in the country than there were last year.  If that process continues we can only assume that there will be a repetition last year and, if the Government stay in office &mdash; hopefully they will not &mdash; the year after.  This House of Parliament is being brought into a certain amount of contempt because we, as Members of the House, find it so difficult to get this information.  It is the old three card trick job &mdash; now you see it, now you do not.  We ask questions, for instance, about what particular Ministers intend to do in relation to job creation and to the development of industrial sites and so on.  It is said that the Minister is not responsible to the House but, oddly enough, when the Minister wants to make an announcement about the creation of jobs he appears to have a particular responsibility then.</P>
    <P>If this House is to be in any way relevant we should come quickly to the realisation that if Ministers continuously reserve their responsibility to the giving of good news then the people will not only have contempt for the institutions of the State and the people in them but contempt for everything for which we stand in this House.  That is a serious development.  I have repeatedly seen parliamentary questions being deliberately parried.  When asking specific questions which this House has a right to have answered, the elected representatives do <Col N="884" /> not get the answers to which they are entitled.  The cloak and dagger and hidden stuff simply is not on.  It is quite all right for other arenas but not for this House.</P>
    <P>I refer now to specific areas where the budget has missed a great many opportunities. Let us take agriculture.  I appreciate the improvement in relation to refund of VAT which is helpful to agriculture, but over the whole agri-business, agriculture and food, despite the great hoo-ha in the past year or so about the creation of extra jobs, the result has been sorely disappointing.  With all the talk about the creation of jobs in the food idustry, particulary the meat industry, we find it ironic that probably half of the meat processing plants are closed at any given time.  They are on a three day week, on short time, or shut down altogether awaiting supplies.</P>
    <P>The Minister said not long ago that he could not create four-year-old bullocks in 18 months.  It does not take four years to create beef.  The Minister has been in Government for two years and it is time he had a look at those animals to see if they will soon be ready for slaughter.  If not, we will have to shed slaughtering capacity, which is already grossly under-utilised. At the same time there are on-going indications of further expansion of slaughtering capacity.  It is very fine to say we need slaughtering capacity but it is equally important to recognise the futility of wasting time, money and effort in creating extra capacity which will not be utilised.  The underlying motives must be called into question.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Teagasc have operated during the past 12 months is highly questionable because obviously they have not had the required resources. The decision was taken to axe a number of research stations to enable Teagasc to operate within certain financial limits. There were no questions about the degree of service the board would give, their responsibility to the community and the reliance of the farming community on Teagasc.  The decision was simply based on lack of finance.  I hope the chairman pointed out to the Minister well in <Col N="885" /> advance the consequences of such a short-sighted policy and knocked often at the Minister's door, as he was wont to do in the past, to explain the likelihood of the complete disintegration of the research, education and advisory services if this process is allowed to continue.  I hope the chairman trenchantly informed the Minister that the policies now in force will result in serious problems within a couple of years, having regard to the pivotal role of Teagasc in agri-industry.  I hope the Minister in turn explained how he expects the chairman to run Teagasc in the future, given the financial limitations laid down.</P>
    <P>When we are drawing up our budgets at health board meetings we must be aware of the various interdependencies and the danger of the domino effect if one thing goes wrong.  The same applies in regard to the budget.  If money does not come from Europe we will have a serious problem.  The allocation for the running of the local authorities, for instance, is far short of what is required. Unless manna appears in the form of European money a far more serious problem will develop.  The Minister for the Environment claims he has increased the money available to local authorities but it does not even skim the top of the problem. Each year the increasing needs of local authorities far outstrip the increased allocations, as the Minister knows.  Every local authority has made a pre-budget submission to the Minister on which he should have acted.  Given that he has increased the allocation last year, there is still no way it will meet requirements in 1989.  Consideration has been given in some counties, including Kildare, to closing roads because they have become impassible.  Kildare has one of the heaviest traffic volumes.  County engineers are writing to public representatives telling them that lack of funds make it impossible to make any improvements in the road structure in the next 12 months. Everybody recognises that towards the end of the year the coffers are becoming bare, but that is an awful admission at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the allocation of funds to a <Col N="886" /> local authority, the main criterion should not be road mileage but the volume of traffic and the number of persons using those roads.  The two are separate but interrelated.  The concentration of population in an area will naturally contribute to an increased volume of traffic but there is also the problem of heavy vehicle traffic.  The fact that County Kildare is next to the capital city has a huge impact on the road network which is not experienced in other counties.  There are main and county roads in Kildare which are in a dreadful condition and have a traffic problem equal to that of national primary routes in counties like Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon etc.  I mean no disrespect to those counties.  Nobody in a Government Department seems to have come to grips with the reality of the problem that those traffic volumes have a serious impact on the condition of those roads, which were never built to handle such volumes.  As a result of short-term action in hard topping the roads some years ago to bring quick relief, those roads are breaking up.  There has been little or no response from successive Ministers to our repeated requests to have something done about it.  I listened with interest to the speech by the Minister for the Environment and I am very disappointed that we are still crying in the wilderness.  The Minister must contact the managers in the local authorities who are worst hit, namely those adjacent to the main centres of population.  Commuter traffic generated by that population is the cause of our problem.  The biggest single issue anywhere in the rural areas of County Kildare is the condition of our roads and it is unacceptable to say that the local authority have been given more money than last year.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to provide education for our young people to equip them with proper life skills so that they will be able to seek elsewhere jobs which obviously are not at home.  Let us look a the educational system which is in place for them, for instance, the VEC system as it applies to most counties.  I know how it applies in most counties.  I know how it applies in County Kildare and over <Col N="887" /> the past 12 months classes have been disrupted, cut out altogether and school hours curtailed.  It is not possible to employ caretakers or maintenance people and to provide materials for the carrying on of particular classes in practical subjects in various schools.  They are not isolated incidents; they affect every single VEC school in County Kildare. Parents and teachers have repeatedly made representations to us as public representatives about the matter.  In order to maintain subjects in certain schools, teachers have to travel to four schools per day to take classes, as otherwise the class is disbanded, the subject is not taught and somebody loses out.  The only way that things are kept going at present is that parents contribute and it has become increasingly evident that, in order to provide a reasonable standard of education in the VEC system, parents are expected to support the system financially.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years we prided ourselves on the fact that we had a free education system.  A few years ago there were very loud, strong and repeated complaints from the then Opposition &mdash; who are now in Government &mdash; about the alleged attempts to disrupt the educational system.  It was said we were trying to downgrade or even strangle it and that was in response to a small move in relation to school transport which would have saved about £3 million.  An awful lot of things have happened since then which are seriously detrimental to the system and there is now a growing trend of opinion that there is an attempt by stealth to downgrade or impoverish the VEC school system which as been the open avenue to education for everyone. It was a well known and recognised system whereby all children could aspire to getting a good standard of education, simply because the system was well financed and looked after for many years. That is no longer the case and there appears to be an attempt to downgrade it and to financially strangle it over a period of time so that people will no <Col N="888" /> longer send their children to those schools.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Ministers opposite to take note of that trend before it is too late.  Practical skills are necessary if our students are to obtain employment at home and abroad. Greater emphasis should be placed on the VEC system so that there is some semblance of an attempt to give them the education they require.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Carey said that inflation would increase over the next 12 months or so.  It will increase much more quickly as house property seems to have taken off.  That may be seen as a positive sign by the Government that the country is back on is feet.  I do not accept that; the property market has stabilised simply because it is based on money coming in from the UK, America, Australia and elsewhere.  Countless people living and working in London and elsewhere are buying house property here.  Of course that is good but one should remember the kind of inflation that has assailed the property market in those countries and we may well import that inflation.  If stability is to be based on imported inflation it is of little benefit to the economy and we will pay a very high price for it in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance was asked about harmonisation of taxes and excise duties in 1992.  He said that if anybody could tell him how to get £40 million or £50 million he would be delighted to hear it.  With that attitude prevailing, I do not know how we will survive in 1992 because nobody will do our work for us.  It would be good policy to start putting something in train now and to gently slope towards the area it is intended to go.  It would also be good policy for the Government to give some indication of what they intended to do to bring our VAT and other tax levels into line with those of our competitors because in 1992 we will either have achieved harmonisation or face the competition of those within the Community who will have brought their various systems into line.  I strongly urge the Minister to think carefully about this matter, and there is no use in asking us to provide <Col N="889" /> £40 million.  He is the Minister and is in a position to do that.  The Government have been in office for two years and it is long past the time when he should be blaming a previous administration.</P>
    <P>Coming from the County Kildare constituency I could not let this opportunity pass without referring to the continued discontent within the armed forces.  I do not know whether anybody on the Government side recognises the discontent. The recent announcement on pay increases has been greeted half-heartedly because it is regarded as a half-hearted attempt to resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>The 1989 Budget has been formulated against a background of substantial economic progress over the last 12 months, and it is designed to maintain and improve that rate of progress. There is still a long way to go and we remain vulnerable to developments, financial and economic, outside our economy and beyond our control.  Our overall priority must be to secure a steadily expanding economy, inherently sound and capable of absorbing adverse international developments.</P>

    <P>The economic progress achieved in 1988 has nevertheless created a limited margin for manoeuvre in 1989, enabling us to take further steps towards achieving the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The core economic aim of Government policy is to bring about, and secure, the kind of economic growth which can be maintained over time.  We can step up the rate of job-creation, our priority goal, only through accelerating the pace of economic growth on a sustainable basis.  Accordingly, the <Col N="890" /> Government policy objectives underlying this budget are, firstly, to continue the strict control of Government spending and borrowing, secondly, to improve the position of the deprived in our society and those on low incomes, thirdly, to lighten the burden of personal taxation; and fourthly, to promote increased employment to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Even though the state of the public finances has been greatly improved, the Government had to approach this budget with great care.  It is not unlike a situation where a forest fire has been brought under control but is far from being totally extinguished.  Were we to become careless or give way to pressure, it could quickly flare up again and wipe out all that has been gained.</P>
    <P>Government borrowing by the end of 1988, even discounting the effects of the tax amnesty, was halved <i>vis-á-vis</i> two years before, down from 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to an underlying 6 per cent in 1988.  In actual terms the borrowing level at 3.3 per cent of GNP was the lowest for 30 years.  The dramatic reduction in borrowing has been achieved only because this Government imposed and followed through with substantial reductions in Government expenditure, which amounted to close on 5 per cent of GNP over three years.  Those reductions have been absorbed without any major loss of effectiveness in essential public services and with special regard to the protection of the least well off.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure here has now been brought broadly into line with the OECD average.  The impact of these spending cuts has been partly offset by falls in interest rates and greater confidence.  It has not prevented a significant recovery in economic growth.  GNP grew at an average rate of 3 per cent over 1987 and 1988, after many years in which there was no growth at all.</P>
    <P>The extra revenues enabled us to repay £443 million of the foreign debt last year so that it fell by 3 per cent to 51 per cent of GNP.  Those who press claims for additional expenditures should keep in <Col N="891" /> mind the fact that even in the exceptionally good circumstances of 1988 the national debt still rose by almost £1 billion. The debt ratio remained stable last year at 132.9 per cent of GNP.  However, at £24.5 billion it is still relatively far above that obtaining in any other European country, and must be reduced to a lower and safer level.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the effects of maintaining confidence any reduction in the cost of servicing the national debt releases a greater share of revenue resources for other purposes, such as the improvement of social services, tax relief or capital investment.  The fact is that debt service at well over £2 billion pounds a year constitutes almost a third of total tax revenues, a proportion which has not yet begun to decline.</P>
    <P>The budget continues the process of reducing Government borrowing.  The target of 5.3 per cent of GNP is only very slightly above the lower end of the 5 per cent-7 per cent target range that we previously identified as necessary to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio.  It is 3 per cent below last year's Budget target of 8.2 per cent.  We are in fact a year ahead of schedule.  Even the most stringent commentator this time last year would have regarded a target of 5.3 per cent in 1989 as outstanding progress in so short a time.  These figures show that progress is being fully maintained, and that the success of the tax amnesty in achieving an earlier stabilisation of the debt/GNP ratio has not deflected the Government from keeping up the momentum in reducing our indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit at 4.1 per cent is also over 2 per cent below last year's budget target, and is well below the level of any time during the last ten years.  The current deficit is now less than half the peak level of 8.5 per cent in 1986.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that it will be a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; if the Government achieve their financial targets is absurd.  The record shows that the 1987 and the 1988 budgets both ended comfortably within target. This Government have clearly shown <Col N="892" /> their determination not to tolerate a slippage in our targets, for whatever reason, but to adhere firmly to the limits of expenditure set out in the Book of Estimates. The unanimous view of expert financial and economic commentators is that the targets set out by the Minister for 1989 for the public finances can and will be met.</P>
    <P>The reception from the markets for the budget was very positive.  NCB for example commented:</P>
    <P>Today's Budget has confirmed the stance of fiscal policy and will help to underpin the re-rating of Irish markets that has occurred over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Some commentators such as DKM go so far as to suggest that the Government are on course for a budget surplus in three or four years' time.  Davy, contrary to sceptics in the House, say that</P>
    <P>Our analysis of the budgetary arithmetic suggests that not alone can the targets be reached but that the EBR will finish the year below target.</P>
    <P>Coopers and Lybrand state:</P>
    <P>The present Budget...is likely to be positive in terms of its effect on confidence, in that it continues the process of fiscal correction while simultaneously reducing personal taxes.</P>
    <P>The beneficial fall in interest rates by 6 per cent since March 1987, and their stability over many months, despite a sharp rise in UK rates during the autumn, was a direct result of the improvement in the public finances and the stability of our currency in the EMS.  With our low rate of inflation it has relieved pressure on family incomes and made investment plans much more attractive in all sectors of productive economic activity.</P>
    <P>These developments enabled us to relax exchange controls ahead of schedule. The point has been made that our interest rates have essentially been realigned towards those of other EMS countries. We cannot, of course, make ourselves immune to interest rate trends world wide, but German interest rates <Col N="893" /> are likely under foreseeable conditions to remain lower than dollar or sterling interest rates.</P>
    <P>Our rate of inflation last year at 2 per cent was below the EC and OECD average, and about one third of the current level in the UK.  The cycle of annual price increases, both by public utilities and in the private sector, has been broken.  In fact there are notable examples of price reductions in electricity and telecommunications, for example.  The moderate wage increases in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> over a three year period have been a crucial factor in bringing the rate of inflation down so dramatically and have created a climate of industrial peace.  On both counts we have turned in the best performance since the early sixties.  It is impossible to over-emphasise the beneficial effects of this situation and the importance of maintaining it.</P>
    <P>All these developments have allowed us to improve our competitiveness.  For the second year running the value of Irish exports has increased by 14 per cent to 15 per cent.  This is a very high rate of export growth, and for the first time exports have exceeded £12 billion giving a trade surplus of £2.1 billion.  The December monthly trade figures were particularly encouraging, as they showed an increased trade surplus compared with the previous year.  The industrial production figures that appeared last Thursday were also extremely encouraging. Export growth is not confined to the multinational sector, but is also being experienced in domestic industry.  For the second year running also we had a significant balance of payments surplus in 1988.</P>
    <P>But the most important development of all is the recovery in employment which began in the year to April 1988, when the number in employment increased by 6,000 after a fall of 66,000 in the previous five years.  With regard to any doubts about the standing of the particular figures, I simply wish to point out that the previous Government in their plan <i>Building on Reality</i> based their targets on the annual Labour Force Survey <Col N="894" /> as the most accurate indicator of employment numbers.</P>
    <P>Misleading attempts are made to compare the figures for job creation in manufacturing and related services, which were on target at 20,000 last year, with notified redundancy figures of about 23,000.  This figure relates to all sectors of the economy &mdash; less than half even in manufacturing &mdash; and I understand that actual redundancies are lower than notified redundancies by about 7 per cent. The 20,000 figure of course does not include job creation in tourism, construction, horticulture, forestry and marine and the State agencies, and even these are by no means an exhaustive list of the other employment sectors.  The progress report on job creation published in December by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gave an estimate for 1988 confined to the above-named categories that added up to 29,000.  This would strongly suggest that the rise in employment continued through the year, and the Government are confident that this will be reflected in the 1989 Labour Force Survey.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures have also shown some limited improvement in 1988.  In December, for instance, unemployment was 7,000 below the previous December.  There has also been a continuous seasonally adjusted decline in unemployment since last August.  We must accept, however, that unemployment and emigration are still far too high and that an enormous effort to reduce both these evils is needed.  Significant improvements are possible if determined action is initiated in those sectors of the economy which have growth potential.  This is the approach we are adopting in the national development plan to be submitted to the EC Commission and in the supplementary capital budget included in the budget.</P>
    <P>A strong growth in investment of about 7 per cent is now predicted for 1989.  It is estimated that the specific measures in the budget will result in the creation of several thousand new jobs.  No budget for a long number of years has been more <Col N="895" /> employment and development oriented than this one.  Overall we expect employment to increase by some 13,000 in 1989. Ninteen eighty-nine should see a third successive year of positive growth.  The 3 per cent forecast in the <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> is the highest official forecast at budget time for many years.  Taking the three years 1987 to 1989 together, it shows that we have succeeded in returning to a situation of economic growth after a long period of decline, notwithstanding the immediate necessity that we faced of making substantial reductions in Government expenditure. At the time of the last election, I proposed a target of 2.5 per cent annual growth.  We now seem set to achieve an average growth rate for the three years 1987, 1988 and 1989 of at least 3 per cent which represents a major improvement over previous years.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make any sense of the criticism that the budget does not contain any proposals for tax reform.  Those who make these sort of vague generalisations should understand that the principal tax reform that the ordinary hard pressed taxpayer earnestly wishes to see is a reduction in the excessive amount of personal taxation that he or she pays.</P>
    <P>In recent years the burden of personal taxation in this country reached intolerable levels.  It was inhibiting economic growth and employment and very definitely resulted in the emigration of large numbers of our talented, highly-trained young people.  The 25 per cent reduced rate was abolished, levies were added to the standard rate, the 45 per cent rate was increased to 48 per cent, and for a period the top rate of tax went to 65 per cent and then to 58 per cent.  As a result of inadequate indexation well over 40 per cent of taxpayers found themselves in the higher bands, and at one stage single people were paying at the top rate on incomes of under £10,000 a year.  A significant poverty trap was created, that reduced the incentive to work, and at all levels of income people were discouraged <Col N="896" /> from putting in any extra effort or undertaking new activities because of the high level of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Income tax rates in both the UK and the US were very low by comparison with ours and this exercised a very considerable attraction for many individuals here and it also affected our capacity to attract certain types of industry and services to Ireland.  Of course we cannot, and should not, attempt major reductions immediately which could not be sustained by the state of the public finances.  We have had enough of high budget deficits, high rates of inflation and balance of payments difficulties.  We are not going to slip down that slope again.  Tax reductions are needed, but both for economic and financial reasons they have to be moderate.  Private consumer demand is growing satisfactorily with a 3 per cent volume increase forecast this year.  The standard rate of tax has been reduced from 35 per cent to 32 per cent for the first time in over 20 years.  It is a move of major significance &mdash; a milestone.  This is the feature that has already attracted most attention abroad.  The reduction will benefit all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This move clearly indicates the direction in which we intend to go, as circumstances permit, but it would be unrealistic and imprudent to try to pre-empt future budgets which must be framed in the context of prevailing national and international circumstances. Nothing demonstrates more clearly the emptiness of the criticism levelled against this budget than the fact that Opposition speakers have had to resort to attacking the Minister for not saying what will be in next year's budget.  Radical tax reform has become a catchword for parties at a safe distance from the realities of Government.  It completely ignores the very considerable amount of reform undertaken in this and last year's budgets.</P>
    <P>In fact, over the past two years we have done much to improve the equity of the tax system.  In our first budget we introduced the withholding tax.  Last year the tax amnesty brought in large amounts owed by the self-employed.  The system <Col N="897" /> of self-assessment has also successfully been introduced.  PRSI was extended to farmers and the self-employed, and the social insurance cover of public servants and public sector workers currently on the modified rate of PRSI will be extended, in accordance with the quite clear recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism that the corporate sector and property have not been asked to bear any additional burden.  I would remind these critics that major changes in corporation tax were made in the 1988 budget, coming into effect this year.  The yield from corporation tax will have increased by roughly 25 per cent over two years, and there will be a further increase in this yield when export sales relief comes to an end from April of next year.  Thanks in large part to the tax amnesty the yield from capital taxes last year was up by over 50 per cent, and even this year's estimate is 12.5 per cent above the figure for two years ago.</P>
    <P>Taking this year's tax concessions together with last year's we have fulfilled several times over the main pledges made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> on taxation.  The proportion of taxpayers on the standard rate was brought close to two-thirds last year, and remains at 63 per cent under this budget.  It would not have been desirable to let the proportion on the standard rate slip back from the close to two-thirds level we have achieved.</P>
    <P>The spread of the concessions is broadly equitable.  They have been concentrated on the main body of taxpayers, though we have also been able to reduce the top rate by 2 percentage points.  The modest curtailment of mortgage relief to help pay for some of the income tax reliefs has to be seen against the background of the dramatic lowering of interest rates since March 1987.</P>
    <P>The new tax exemption ceiling and the exemption for children will be of help to farmers on low incomes, and I acknowledge that there are many in that situation. At the same time it is right that farmers who have reasonable incomes should pay <Col N="898" /> the amount of income tax appropriate to those incomes just as other sections of the community do.  The tax yield from farmers, contrary to what is generally asserted, has increased significantly in line with their incomes.  The yield of £34.5 million in 1987 went up to £80 million in 1988 inclusive of the amnesty.  This year it is expected to be very substantially up on the figure of two years ago, broadly reflecting the recovery in farm incomes. As the Minister for Finance indicated, the equitable system of farmers paying on the same basis as other sections is right and proper and should not and will not be changed.</P>
    <P>I wish to direct particular attention to the new exemption limits provided in the budget, because I believe the importance of this particular reform for the lower paid has not been fully appreciated.  The facts are that at present a married man on PAYE with two children and an income of £6,400 pays £425 in income tax. Under the change made by this budget his tax will be reduced to nil.  When the improvement in the family income supplement scheme is added to this tax change, the position of lower income families will be considerably improved.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the Minister's proposal in regard to child benefit.  The background to this proposal is as follows.  This Government, like their predecessors, have received many representations about the wasteful element and indeed inequity involved in paying child benefit to very high income families. An examination of the records of this House will show that concern about this situation has been expressed at different times on all sides of the House.  My pre-decessor, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, spoke about it on a number of occasions. The Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Barry Desmond, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, was even more forthright.  On 28 March 1984 he stated that he did not see any justification in very wealthy people across the board, without any reference to their income, receiving children's allowances.  But he added:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> However, it is almost impossible to talk politically about a rational, social policy on this issue.  Automatically, every politician outside of those who wish to talk rationally takes immediate advantage and accuses one of being anti-mothers, anti-children, anti-family and anti-children's allowances.</P>

      <P>The reference in the Official Report, volume 349, columns 571-2.  The Coalition's <i>Building on Reality</i> stated that `children's allowances are not well directed payments' and proposed that they should be taxed.  There was, therefore, a measure of agreement that there was an anomaly in this situation that should be addressed.</P>
      <P>One of the drawbacks at present is that because of the complete lack of selectivity Governments are inclined to give increases to better targeted schemes and give those schemes priority over child benefit.  If the child benefit scheme is to be improved on a regular basis for those who really need it, there should be some element of selectivity.  One way would be to give any new increases up to a certain level of incomes only.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has put forward a proposal for examination and discussion, the Government having decided in principle that all aspects of the suggestion should be examined, and in particular what administrative costs and difficulties would be involved.  The income limits contemplated were never intended to affect low or middle income families, and the Government were thinking in terms of not less than £30,000 per annum.  It was also the intention that any savings at the upper levels would be used to improve the benefit for those on lower incomes.  I wish to state categorically that there was no specific decision taken to include this change in the next budget.  This could only be done after all aspects had been fully examined and in particular the administrative difficulties and costs carefully assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> The Government are very conscious of the difficulties encountered daily by those who have to survive on low incomes.  At the same time the cost of social welfare payments is one of the problems we have to confront in managing the public finances. The really acute social problems of 20 or 30 years ago, such as widespread housing problems and seriously over-crowded living conditions, have been largely eliminated.  Much has been done to improve the situation of the elderly.  The problems of today must therefore, be correctly identified and addressed on an up to date basis.</P>
    <P>This Government have consistently, even at a time of severe expenditure reductions, taken action to protect the less well-off and those on social welfare. That cannot be honestly denied.  There have been no significant reductions in any major schemes.  From the beginning we ensured that social welfare increases were paid from the normal date, and fully covered the rate of inflation.  We rejected the advice of some economists and international agencies to cut social transfer payments.  Anything of that kind would be completely alien to our political philosophy.</P>
    <P>But we have gone considerably further than just maintaining welfare payments at the same level.  In both this year's and last year's budgets we have consciously targeted additional assistance to those most in need.  We have in large measure followed the strategy and the priorities set out in the Commission for Social Welfare report, by improving the basic payments for the long-term unemployed, improving child income support and extending the free fuel scheme.  For instance, from these last two budgets, a single person on unemployment assistance will have received an increase of 25 per cent or almost £10 a week.</P>
    <P>We have also particularly concentrated this year on the problems facing low income families, whether any family member is at work or not.  There are a number of measures designed to help with bringing up children.  Low income <Col N="901" /> families with significant numbers of children are being exempted from tax altogether, as a means of obviating the poverty trap.  We have also given more money for the homeless, and for the direct relief of poverty by experienced organisations.</P>
    <P>In general, there has been a good reception for these measures from most of those concerned and the agencies involved with their welfare.  We accept that more still needs to be done.  I want to give an assurance, in line with my political philosophy, that a fair share of any increase in national income will be directed by this Government to the least well off and particularly to those whose problems are most acute.  We will make further improvements in the system as resources become available.  It is only by increasing national output that we can safely and securely improve the situation of the least well-off in our community. To seek some other remedy will only bring worse deprivation on a wider scale ultimately.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> ensures that social equity is a specific national objective.  This budget advances this objective by direct action in the areas of social welfare and taxation and by initiating a major programme of investment and job creation.  The most effective way of eliminating poverty is to steadily increase the number of persons in well-paid employment.  It is also the way to bring emigration to an end.</P>
    <P>The major external influence on the Irish economy in the years immediately ahead will be the completion of the Single Market in the European Community. Our economic performance as a nation will be deeply influenced by the extent to which we can successfully adapt to this new environment and exploit all the opportunities it offers.  The Government are fully conscious of this reality and are actively and comprehensively engaged in planning for this new situation.  No member state has done more, has made better arrangements or is more advanced in their preparations than we are.</P>
    <P>Three weeks before we came into <Col N="902" /> office, the Delors Plan outlining a Community programme to make a success of the Single European Act and establish the Single Market by 1992 was published. The far-reaching significance of that plan and the historic opportunity it presented for us to accelerate our economic and social development was immediately obvious.  It matched our commitment to national recovery based on economic development and growth.  The proposed increase in, and our access to the Structural Funds to improve our competitiveness and efficiency fitted exactly into our own plans for these objectives, as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Accordingly, we had no hesitation in quickly and enthusiastically endorsing and supporting the Delors Plan.</P>
    <P>Following up that endorsement, we put in place as expeditiously as possible new arrangements to handle the detailed negotiations and follow-up action required to implement the Delors proposals in so far as they affected this country. To give these matters the highest priority at national level and to ensure the greatest possible degree of co-ordination of effort we established a committee of ministers and secretaries, under my chairmanship, to take control and direct our preparations for the Single Market and the Continuing negotiations involved at Community level.  This committee is a new departure in Irish governmental organisation and is designed to ensure that our progress towards the Single Market in 1992 will be steadily, skilfully and smoothly achieved.</P>
    <P>The next step was to secure the agreement of President Delors and the Commission to establish within the Commission a task force composed of Commissioners and Directors-General presided over by the President to match and relate to our Committee of Ministers and Secretaries.  This working arrangement represents a new departure also in relations between the Commission and a member state.  It enables the speedy and effective co-ordination of national and Community policies and measures which <Col N="903" /> is essential since both the Irish Government and the Commission now have the same objectives &mdash; to raise the economic and social position of Ireland ever closer to the Community average until full cohesion is achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to Structural Funds, which under the Delors Plan are to be doubled by 1992 for the least prosperous regions, we obtained recognition of Ireland as an Objective I region and, specifically, as a least prosperous region within Objective I regions for whom Structural Funds aid will be doubled by 1992, subject to the submission of suitable programmes and plans.  We will insist that the commitment in regard to the Structural Funds to a special effort for the least prosperous regions and to a doubling of the aid to Objective I regions ensures our full share of the doubled Structural Funds.  For this purpose we will submit, before the end of March, the national development plan for five years which will be the basis on which the European Commission will enter into a formal commitment on aid from the Structural Funds.  That plan will be one for development through growth, which is also the basis of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It will be a plan integrated around that objective, because faster growth is necessary if we are to achieve our national economic and social objectives and attain standards comparable with those enjoyed by our Community partners.</P>
    <P>We have already identified in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the social partners the sectors of our economy whose development can lead to faster growth and greater employment. The major step forward in the meeting Ministers recently had with Commissioners in Brussels is that we have reached agreement with the Commission that these are the programmes they will support, when they are spelled out in detail in our national development plan.</P>
    <P>The objectives and programmes which the Government and the European Commission will combine to achieve and implement through the plan now being finalised have been agreed by the <Col N="904" /> Government and the Commission.  These objectives and programmes have also been agreed with the social partners through the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The objectives of the plan are: to prepare the economy to compete successfully in the internal market when completed in 1992; to stimulate the economic growth needed to reduce unemployment and to raise <i>per capita</i> incomes towards average Community levels; to improve further the state of the public finances; and to accompany economic growth by a greater social dimension in our society.</P>
    <P>Two types of programmes are now agreed.  One set of programmes will be directed at improving our competitiveness by reducing the costs imposed on our economy by Ireland's peripherality, inadequate infrastructure and low population density.  The second set of agreed programmes are directed to developing our productive economic capacity.  The programmes to improve competitiveness are the following:</P>
    <P>an efficient road and transportation network, including urban areas, must be built to reduce transport costs within Ireland;</P>
    <P>adequate port and airport facilities and access to them and other means of transport must be provided to minimise transport costs to markets abroad and to minimise transport costs for imports of materials and components and for tourist traffic;</P>
    <P>comprehensive, up-to-date and competitive telecommunications, and energy networks;</P>
    <P>development of sanitary services to meet economic and social development needs as well as environmental requirements;</P>
    <P>the protection and enhancement of the urban and rural environment.</P>
    <P>The programmes agreed to develop the productive capacity of the economy are the following:</P>
    <P>the provision of direct financial <Col N="905" /> assistance for industrial projects and both direct and indirect support towards strengthening and expanding the technological and marketing capacity of the industrial sector including the public industrial sector;</P>
    <P>the development of services industry particularly international services;</P>
    <P>the development of tourism, particularly through the provision of a suitable tourism infrastructure;</P>
    <P>the improvement of agricultural efficiency and structures and the development of agricultural-based industry;</P>
    <P>the development of the fishing industry, including the aquaculture industry;</P>
    <P>the development of the forestry industry;</P>
    <P>the implementation of rural development schemes to stimulate fully the capacity for wealth and employment creation in rural areas;</P>
    <P>the provision of training and work experience schemes, particularly for unemployed youth the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups such as the mentally and physically handicapped;</P>
    <P>ensuring that particular skill shortages are met by suitable training programmes.</P>
    <P>They are the programmes and the objectives of the five year plan.</P>
    <P>The plan will provide a framework for five years in which our development potential will be integrated for the first time with an agreed programme of strategic Community aid.  That is the reality we are now bringing into being and is the fruit of carefully conducted, vigorous negotiations at European level over the past two years.  The plan will concentrate on increasing the competitiveness of our economy and strengthening its productive capacity, so that we can take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the completion of the European internal market.  This must be achieved in a <Col N="906" /> way that is consistent with further improvement in our public finances and budgetary position.  We have also successfully negotiated the acceptance by the Commission of suitable investment in the agreed programmes from sources other than public funds in projects and infrastructural facilities of public interest.</P>
    <P>The European Commission have welcomed the thorough and comprehensive work presented to them by the Irish Government in the recent discussions between Ministers and Commissioners. It was clear to the Commission &mdash; and they so stated &mdash; that the progress made would enable the plan to be submitted by 31 March next, as required.  The national development plan will be elaborated by sub-national plans for each of the seven regions into which the country has been divided.  I want to emphasise that this was not a requirement by the European Commission.  As far as the Commission is concerned, Ireland is one region, but the Government were anxious to mobilise the views and resources of all parts of the country for this national development plan and in particular to involve the local authorities.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Irish Industries have expressed in the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> their satisfaction at the opportunity being given to them both at national and at sub-national level to have an input into the plan and their satisfaction with the arrangements for doing that.  The Government have in fact brought the maximum possible degree of democracy and local consultation into play in this process.</P>
    <P>The working groups for each of these sub-regions will soon be in a position to finalise their documents setting out the development objectives and strategies for achieving them for their region.  The advisory groups for the regions are being and will be fully consulted in the process. At its completion, we will, for the first time, have a clear statement of the objectives desired for each of the seven regions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the general strategy of the budget and the specific measures to <Col N="907" /> be incorporated in our national development plan provide a sound basis for growth in the years immediately ahead. No-one can be complacent about 1992 but I am satisfied that Government policy is providing the right conditions for investment and expansion and that this process will be supplemented effectively by increased support from the Structural Funds.  There are a number of key areas to which the national development plan will endeavour to direct massively increased investment, both public and private.  A major effort will be required to improve the efficiency of our transport infrastructure to maintain competitiveness in the single market.</P>
    <P>When the Channel Tunnel opens, Ireland will be the only EC country without a land connection to other member states.  Transport costs of Irish firms serving mainland Europe are some 75 per cent to 100 per cent higher than those on the mainland.  A significant reason for these high costs is the deficient state of our national roads and the access roads to our principal ports and airports.  Arising from the successful discussions in Brussels on 16 January, the Government have provided an additional £44 million for road works in the budget.  This brings the total State provision for road grants in 1989 to £194 million which is the highest annual provision ever made for road grants in real terms.</P>
    <P>Of the additional £44 million provided, £34 million will be spent on national roads and £10 million on county/regional roads. 1989 will be the first year in a strategic plan designed to bring Irish national roads up to European standards.  The Department of the Environment have practically completed a blueprint for the medium to long term development of Irish roads.  The total cost of road needs over the next 20 years has been estimated at £8.7 billion.  This includes £2.9 billion for the improvement of our national and major urban roads and access roads to our principal ports and airports.  We are confident that we can do this work within ten to 12 years on the basis of a partnership between the State, the EC, the <Col N="908" /> local authorities and the private sector. The Minister for the Environment will submit to the EC an operational programme for national roads based on the strategic plan before the end of March. This will dovetail into the Government's national plan.  He also intends to publish the Blueprint for Road Development by next June, taking into account the views of the EC Commission on the operational programme in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements for funding from the EC Structural Funds, grants will not only be available for State-funded road improvement projects but also for projects such as toll roads where revenue is generated.  These developments provide a welcome boost to private sector investment in roads.  In particular, the prospects for such investment in the Dublin ring road look very promising. The Minister for the Environment will shortly be inviting bids from Irish and foreign firms for a franchise for tolling the ring road.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that county and regional roads are extremely important for all aspects of rural development including tourism, especially agri-tourism, industry, agriculture and forestry. There has been a serious deterioration in the condition of these roads in recent years.  For these reasons, the Government have agreed to a three year programme, costing £150 million, for certain works on county and regional roads; £47.4 million will be provided this year; this is an increase of £10 million over what would have been possible on the basis of estimates published last October. The Minister will be announcing details shortly.</P>
    <P>The upturn in domestic economic conditions should ensure that the increase in total employment seen in 1988 will be repeated in 1989.  With exports continuing to grow and improved domestic conditions in 1989, a rise in manufacturing employment is likely to be achieved. The priority objectives set for the industrial development agencies are the job creation targets agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The business confidence which has emerged in <Col N="909" /> Ireland has given new impetus to development and investment in the manufacturing sector, as clearly indicated by the year-end statements from the IDA and SFADCo.</P>
    <P>The small business sector has become a critical feature of job creation with every indication that the new incentives and programmes implemented by the industrial development agencies have helped speed up the pace of development in this sector.  An increasing number of small companies are responding to the need for high quality management and business structures as a foundation to grow into the large Irish firms for the future.</P>
    <P>Irish-owned industries show signs of responding to the new growth in the economy and the potential of the Single European Market.  Several major Irish companies are committed with the IDA to undertake significant investment in Ireland.  In the dairy co-operative sector, strategic investments will lead to the internationalisation of a number of the co-ops.  The major growth of IDA-backed investment in R and D projects in the food sector can, generate significant new production capacity in the coming year.  The response to international market demands, for example, by the furniture and joinery sector during 1988 has already produced improved results and will continue to show growth in 1989.</P>
    <P>The central objective of our development approach for Irish industry during 1989 will be to continue to encourage internationally competitive Irish industries to become European majors in the single market of 1992.</P>
    <P>International investment into the manufacturing sector in Ireland will continue at a strong pace during 1989, with a substantial pipeline of projects in discussion with the IDA and SFADCo.  The arrival of Fujitsu Isotec from Japan is an important development in this regard.</P>
    <P>The key target areas, electronics/ engineering, pharmaceuticals, international and financial services and consumer products have yielded considerable jobs and continue to show good promise from the investment during 1988.  These investments are represented <Col N="910" /> by both new and expanding projects.  In international services we continue to break new ground and the sector is becoming an increasingly important job creation area especially for graduate employment.</P>
    <P>In 1989 a strong emphasis will be placed on promoting Ireland as a key location for US and Far Eastern companies investing in Europe in preparation for 1992 and the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>Over £14 million has been invested by the Custom House Docks Development Company in the Irish Financial Services Centre site in 1988, and it is estimated that £35 million will be spent this year by the company in further construction work.  Over 200 people are employed on the project at present.  This is expected to increase to 500 over the next six months as new construction work is commenced. To date 55 companies with an estimated employment content of 1,300 upwards have decided to establish in the centre.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism has had two successive years of significant growth.  The targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> call for a doubling of foreign visitor numbers over the period of the plan, an increase in tourism revenue of £500 million and the creation of 25,000 additional jobs in the Irish economy.  We are now well on course for achieving these targets.</P>
    <P>Overall tourism revenue in 1987 exceeded £1 billion, an 18 per cent increase on 1986.  This growth continued in 1988.  In their end of year review, recently published, Bord Fáilte estimate that overseas visitor numbers in 1988 exceeded 2.3 million, 13 per cent ahead of the 1987 performance.</P>
    <P>The progressive marketing approach successfully adopted in the previous two years will be maintained this year. Towards the end of last year the Government provided a further £5 million for marketing purposes, on condition that it would be matched by the industry, to further boost visitor numbers in 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> The industry agreed to match this allocation, and the resulting £10 million marketing programme is already under way.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that there will be substantial investment in the tourist industry this year from both domestic and international sources.  Indeed, significant investment has taken place over the past two years; new hotels in Dublin and in Adare, Waterford and on the Black-water. Bord Fáilte have approved marketing and development plans under the business expansion scheme in respect of 33 tourism projects involving planned investment of almost £45 million.  A further 15 projects involving planned investment of over £14 million are under consideration.</P>
    <P>We are confident that greatly increased funding will be available from the Structural Funds to support both public and private sector projects of public interest and access beginning this year.  The budget provided for a new scheme of grant assistance costing £14.5 million which will be included in the national development plan to be submitted to the EC Commission.  The objective of the scheme is to stimulate private sector development of new tourism products such as outdoor pursuit and activity centres, recreational facilities in resorts, marine facilities and cultural centres which are analogous to public facilities.</P>
    <P>The tourism developments carried out under this scheme will be complemented by a range of other tourism-related works to be undertaken by State agencies, including a £1-2 million package for a programme of amenity and environmental works by the local authorities on some of our larger beaches.  The Office of Public Works will undertake a major investment programme costing £3.5 million to enhance and expand facilities at their major visitor attractions.</P>
    <P>Another sector on which we have been and will continue concentrating in the national development plan is forestry.  It has been performing well during the last two years.  National planting in 1988 had increased to 15,000 hectares from around 9,000 hectares only two years ago.  This <Col N="912" /> Government took the decision to step up planting when it came to office, and to reorganise the State forests on commercial lines, which it has now done by setting up Coillte.  The opportunities and incentives for private planting have been well publicised and are being taken up. The special advantages in timber production that this country enjoys and the market opportunities will now be better exploited.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the Irish economy following the budget are good.  The process of recovery will continue and strengthen on a broad front.</P>
    <P>Our supplementary development budget and our tax relief measures will give a boost to employment.  We have addressed the situation of those in the country who need help.  We can look forward this year therefore to a higher level of employment and some rise in living standards.  This is a sound budget and a fair one.  It has been accepted as such by the majority of the general public.  We are steadily laying the foundations of a better country for all, and creating a more caring and fairer society.</P>

      <P>Sílim go raibh deis ag an Rialtas sa cháinaisnéis seo tabhairt faoi mór-dheacrachtaí eacnamaíochta na tíre, deacrachtaí a n-aontaímid go léir sa Teach seo in a dtaobh: an ráta ard dífhostaíochta agus ag éirí as sin an ráta ard daoine atá ag fágáil na tíre gach bliain, an bochtanas agus an ráta ard cánach.  Bhí deis againn staidéar a dhéanamh ar an cháinaisnéis le seachtain anuas agus amharc go díreach ar cad atá ann, agus is beag atá ann chun tabhairt faoi na mór-dheacrachtaí thuas luaite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cad tá sa cháinaisnéis leis na deacrachtaí dí-fhostaíochta a réiteach.  Ag labhairt san Dáil an lá sin d'admhaigh an tAire Airgeadais agus an tAire Leasa Shoisialaigh go raibh an ráta dífhostaíochta i rith na bliana thar 230,000 duine agus d'fhéadfadh sé bheith, fiú amháin, níos airde. Is uafásach an scéal é sin, mar cuimhnímid go raibh ceannaire ar Rialtas Fhianna Fáil ar an raidió Domhnach amháin roinnt blianta ó shin agus dúirt sé nach bhfeádfadh aon Rialtas cur suas <Col N="913" /> le ráta dífhostaíochta os cionn 100,000 duine.  Is mór an t-athrú é sin ar an rud atá ag tarlú i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Cad atá sa cháinaisnéis faoi choinne laghdú a chur ar an líon daoine atá ag dul ar imirce gach bliain?  Bhí a fhios againn le cúpla bliain anuas go raibh idir 20,000 agus 30,000 duine i gceist ach de réir na bhfigúirí is déanaí atá ar fáil agus a luaigh mo chomhleacaí, an Teachta Michael Noonan sa Dáil seachtain ó shin, d'fhéadfadh an ráta imirce a bheith chomh hard le 70,000 duine sa bhliain anois.  Ag dul trí óráid an Aire agus trí oráid an Taoisigh, anseo inniu, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an fhadhb sin againn agus is beag atá sa cháinaisnéis chun tabhairt faoi.  Cuireann oráid an Taoisigh díomá orm nach ndearna sé aon tagairt do na deacrachtaí atá againn sna ceantair Ghaeltachta faoi láthair.  Tá na deacrachtaí atá againn ar fud na tíre le fáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta chomh maith.  Tá líon na ndaoine dífhostaithe chomh hard, nó go minic, níos airde sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ná mar atá i gceantair eile faoin dtír.  In a theannta sin, tá an ráta imirce sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ag méadú agus ag treisiú gach uile seachtain.  Tá oileán amháin i mo dháilcheantar féin, Oileán Árainn Mhór, a bhfuil beagnach 20 faoin gcéad den phobal tar éis dul ar imirce ó thosach na bliana seo.  Bhí cuid acu sa bhaile arís i rith na Nollag agus don Athbhliain ar feadh seachtaine ach tá 200 duine de phobal an oileáin sin tar éis é a fhágail ón gcéad lá d'Éanair ar a dtriall go dtí an Bhreatain Mhór agus go háiteanna eile. Ní ansin amháin atá sé ag tarlú ach ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ar fad.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé díomá orm nár luaigh an Taoiseach Údarás na Gaeltachta ina chuid cainte anseo inniú.  Mar is eol don Teach, tá an jab céanna le déanamh ag Údarás na Gaeltachta sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus atá le déanamh ag an IDA agus ag SFADCo i gceantair eile na tíre.  Caithfidh mé a admháil anseo go bhfuil an obair deánta ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é i 1979.  Cuireadh airgead agus acmhainní ar fáil dó le linn dár bpáirtí a bheith sa Rialtas agus nuair a dhearctar siar ar na figiúirí feictear gur éirigh leis líon na bpostanna sna ceantair Ghaeltachta <Col N="914" /> a árdú gach bhain.  Nuair a chuamar as oifig i dtosach na bliana 1987, bhí 5,000 duine fostaithe i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht ar thug an tÚdarás tacaíocht dóibh.  Faoi láthair, is eol don saol Gaelach go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra ag an Údarás.  Sílim go bhfuil athrú ag teacht air maidir leis an obair mhaith a bhí á dhéanamh aige ó bunaíodh é.  Don chéad uair riamh i stair an Údaráis, tá gach uile chomhartha ann go mbeidh isliú i 1988 ar an uimhir daoine a bheas ag obair sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Má táimid dáirire faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht, ag iarraidh go mairfidh siad beo, ní féidir a dhul ar aghaidh lena leithéid seo do pholasaí.  Cén fáth go bhfuil sé seo ag tarlú?  Cad iad na cúiseanna atá leis?  Tá cúpla cúis leis, i mo thuairim.  Sa chéad áit, tá ísliú 13 faoin gcéad ar chaiteachas caipitil an Údaráis beartaithe do 1989.  Is ionann seo agus an t-ísliú a déanadh sa bhliain 1988 sa chaiteachas caipitil.  Fágann sé sin gur dearnadh ciorradh de 26 faoin gcéad ar an airgead a cuireadh ar fáil don Údarás chun fostaíocht agus slite beatha a chur ar fáil do na daoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu sna ceantair seo.</P>
    <P>Is é an tarna cúis go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra ag an Údarás faoi lathair ná gur tugadh treoir dóibh i mí Meán Fómhair nó Déireadh Fómhair na bliana seo caite, a chuir cosc orthu a dhul thar 65 faoin gcead de chaiteachas na bliana 1988 maidir le haon deontas nó caiteachas i rith 1989.  Tá sé seo ag cur bac ar an Údarás, i láthair na h-uaire.  Is é an toradh atá air seo ná nár éirigh leis an Údarás oiread agus tionscnamh amháin tionsclaíochta a cheadú i gceantar Gaeltachta ar bith, ó mhí Bealtaine nó mí Meithimh anuraidh.  Tá sé seo go léir ag cothú deacrachtaí uafásacha dífhostaíochta agus imirce.  Níos measa fós, tá sé ag briseadh ar mhuinín muintir na Gaeltachta san Údarás, Údarás a raibh meas acu air ó bunaíodh é.  Tá muinín an phobail san Údarás ag teip agus ag dul i laige agus dá bhféadfainn é a rá, tá féinmhuinín an Údaráis féin in ísle brí, i láthair na h-uaire. Tá lión na bhfeidhmeannach tar éis dul i laghad le bliain anuas.  D'fhág beagnach 20 faoin gcéad acu an tÚdarás <Col N="915" /> sa tréimhse sin; ghlac siad íocaíochtaí iomarcaíochta, chuaigh siad go dtí eagraíochtaí eile nó d'fhág siad an tír.  Mar sin, tá rudaí in ísle brí.  Cuireann sé díomá orm nár thug an Taoiseach aon chomhartha ná aon nod ina óráid go dtiocfaidh athrú ar an scéal.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go gcuirfí na hachmhainní ar fáil don Údarás chun timpeall 50 tionscnaimh ar fad, atá ina luí faoi láthair in oifigí an Údaráis, a chur i bhfeidhm.  Chruthódh na tionscaimh seo na ceádta post sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá géarghá ann go dtabharfaí cead agus treoir don Údarás na tionscnaimh seo a scrúdú agus tacaíocht airgid a thabhairt dóibh más fiú iad chun tionscail a sholáthar a mhaolódh ar an imirce agus a chruthódh breis fostaíochta. Tá sé ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh bliana, beagnach.  Is eol dom go raibh cruinnithe ann idir an Údarás agus oifigí an Rialtais agus na Roinne Airgeadais agus tá súil agam, ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht, go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal sin go gairid.</P>
    <P>Tá cruinniú ag an Údarás Dé hAoine seo chugainn, agus níl aon rud a chuirfeadh gliondar níos mó orm féin ná ar gach éinne a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht agus ina bhfuil ag tárlú inti, ná go dtabharfaí a gcinn don bhord an obair a dhéanamh lena ceapadh iad: fostaíocht a chruthú agus cuidiú le tionscail ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ceantair imeallacha is ea na Gaeltachtaí. Is beag a bhí sa cháinaisnéis chun deacrachtaí na gceantar imeallacha a réiteach. Dúradh go bhfuil sé ar intinn cursaí cumarsáide, boíthre agus mar sin, a fheabhsú, sa phlean atá ag dul go dtí an Eoraip, ach níl a fhios againn fós, go baileach, cad atá ann.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur chaill an Rialtas seans iontach nuair nár ainmnigh siad an Ghaeltacht mar cheann de na ceantair arbh fhéidir cabhair a fháil ina dtaobh ón Eoraip faoi choinne infrastructure agus mar sin a fhorbiart iontu.  Tá na Gaeltachtaí scaipthe ar fud na tíre.  Tá an Taoiseach féin ina Aire ar an nGaeltacht agus tá Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta ann chomh maith agus is mór <Col N="916" /> an trua nár dearnadh ceantar ar leith den Ghaeltacht agus iarratas a chur chun na hEorpa ina leith.  Ta deá-mhéin agus deathoil san Eoraip do cheantair ina labhartar mion-teangacha na hEorpa agus ceapainn go mbeidís an-bhaiúil leis an nGaeltacht dá ndeanfaí an t-iarratas.</P>
    <P>In the budget introduced last Wednesday the Government had an excellent and unprecedented opportunity of tackling major economic difficulties facing us &mdash; unemployment, emigration, poverty and the high level of personal taxation.  When one has had time to examine the proposals and measures contained in the budget, one notes there is very little evidence to indicate that these measures and proposals will have any positive effect on the underlying economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the area of unemployment there is an inherent admission in the Minister's own statement that unemployment will remain at the unacceptably high level of 232,000 for the remainder of this year. This is a far cry from the figure of 100,000 quoted by a previous Leader of Fianna Fáil as being absolutely unacceptable and intolerable.  The Minister has made financial provisions in the budget for an average rate of 232,000 people unemployed for the coming year.  This may be on the optimistic side.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask what the Government could do to generate employment in the economy.  Is it possible for a Government to adopt budgetary policies that would result in the creation of more jobs?  I believe it is.  It is significant that any progress made by the Government towards the stabilisation of borrowing and reducing the deficit has been achieved by cutting back on the capital programme, the very area where jobs can be created. The public capital programme has been decimated whereas the current programme has been more or less untouched.  In other words, any progress made in the fiscal area has been at the cost of jobs.</P>
    <P>There has been a drastic fall-off in infrastructural development that can have devastating consequences for further economic development.  The <Col N="917" /> national roads programme has almost come to a standstill.  The development and extension of our primary roads network has been virtually abandoned.  We all know the importance of having an adequate road network throughout the country.  It cuts transport costs for industry and ultimately leads to extra employment simply because good roads enable our industries to be more competitive. There is an urgent need to extend our primary roads network particularly into the west, areas that are so far from ports and markets.  Industries established in these regions are operating under severe handicaps and the cost of transport can often be prohibitive.  There is little evidence in the budget that the Government understand the seriousness of the problem. There is less money for roads in 1989 than there was six or seven years ago.  A major road building programme would be of great benefit not alone to industrial development but would also create much needed employment.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Government have fallen down drastically is in the sphere of local authority housing.  One of the proudest achievements of the last Government was their record in providing funds for local authority housing. Never previously in a four year period did we have as many houses provided in the public sector.  Top quality homes were built in every part of the country.  In my own county alone, well over 1,000 houses were built and progress was made in tackling our endemic housing shortage.</P>
    <P>However, this Government have simply scuttled the public housing programme. Proposed housing schemes have been abandoned in every part of the country.  Waiting lists are getting longer and we are again into the era of families living in inhuman conditions, in damp old houses and mobile homes.  All of us as public representatives, know the extent of the misery these people are living in. What is the Government's response?  It is simply to reduce the housing allocation, and depriving these people of any hope of being provided with proper homes in the future.</P>
    <P>Are these the policies of a caring <Col N="918" /> Government?  Are these the policies advocated by Fianna Fáil in Opposition when they castigated the then Government for being right wing, monetarist and Thatcherite?  Let me also add that the excellent scheme of house repair grants introduced by the previous Government through the Department of the Environment and Roinn na Gaeltachta mar atá fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil deireadh curtha leis na deontais freisin, deontais a chuir go mór leis an chaighdeán tithíochta sa tír agus a chuir fostaíocht agus obair ar fáil do chonraitheoirí agus do dhaoine eile.  Má tá tú i do chónaí taobh amugh den Ghaeltacht, if one is outside a Gaeltacht area now, no matter what reconstruction work one carries out, no matter what extensions one provides there are no grants whatsoever available and in san Ghaeltacht féin tá isliú suntasach ar an deontas atá á chur ar fáil.  Bhí sé ábalta £7,000 agus £8,000 a fháil faoin sean scéim agus anois tá sé anuas go dtí £2,000.</P>
    <P>The only housing initiative introduced by this Government is the tenant purchase scheme where the pool of local authority housing is being disposed of. Could not some of this money be allocated to a major housing programme that would alleviate some of the harsher conditions that many families are living under and, at the same time, give a badly and urgently required boost to the building industry where unemployment is so high at present?</P>
    <P>These are some of the initiatives that could be taken in this budget.  However, I believe the Minister missed the opportunity. I am sure he would have the support of the entire House if he tackled these problems.  Of course, we all know that there is a strong correlation between unemployment and other serious economic and social difficulties.</P>
    <P>One of these is emigration.  The emigration problem was first brought to the nation's attention by Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition.  I remember the huge billboards that were erected in various parts of the county.  I remember particularly on the approach road to Dublin from the North the huge billboard depicting a long line of people outside the <Col N="919" /> passport office and the slogan underneath asking &ldquo;Is this their only future?&rdquo;  I must admit it was a very arresting poster and slogan which made us all aware at the time of the seriousness of the emigration problem.</P>
    <P>The previous Government initiated many imaginative schemes for young people in an effort to keep them at home &mdash;training programmes, unemployment incentive schemes, enterprise allowances schemes, social employment schemes, to name but a few.  These schemes were fairly successful and succeeded in keeping the flow of emigration at around 20,000 to 30,000 per year according to the official figures and statistics available to us. However we were castigated in the Dáil and throughout the country at that time by Fianna Fáil and accused of exporting our young people like cattle.</P>
    <P>Private Members' motions and Adjournment Debates were initiated in the Oireachtas to highlight the seriousness of the problems and to augment the effects of the poster campaign.  To give them their due, they succeeded in convincing the country that emigration was at a crisis level when it was at between 20,000 and 30,000.  Then, of course, the 1987 general election came and went, but it did not solve the problem of emigration which is still with us not, I regret to say, at 20,000 or 30,000 per annum, but, according to the latest statistical evidence available, at the astronomical and frightening level of perhaps 70,000 per year or more.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, highlighted this figure in the Dáil last week.  He said the difference between the net number of those coming into this country and those leaving was 73,000.  This figure might not be 100 per cent accurate, but it is a fair indication of what is hapening at the moment.</P>
    <P>The devastating effects of emigration are to be seen and felt in every townland and parish throughout this country. Entire areas are being deprived of their young people.  The fabric of many urban and rural communities is being torn apart.  Sporting organisations are no <Col N="920" /> longer able to field teams.  Places of entertainment are becoming cultural Saharas. In my own constituency one island, Arranmore, has sacrificed almost 20 per cent of its population to emigration since January.  Not alone are young, educated, energetic, idealistic people fleeing this land of ours but a new and more sinister dimension to the problem is manifesting itself.  Entire families are leaving &mdash; fathers, mothers sons and daughters &mdash; and are heading towards the UK and, those who consider themselves more fortunate, to the United States and further afield.</P>
    <P>All this is presided over by a Government that shed so many crocodile tears when in Opposition.  One can justly ask, where are the billboards, posters and slogans of yesteryear?  Where are the pictures showing the long queues outside the Pasport Office, at airports and other points of departure?  We are entitled to ask, what is in this budget to stem the vicious flow of emigration?  What policies and measures are being adopted and implemented to keep our people at home?  What incentives are to be found in the budget to convince our people at home that they have a future in this country or what incentives can we offer those who have already departed to consider returning home?  We may indeed ask all these questions but I am afraid the answer to each one is &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  This is one more illustration of a party who offered so many solutions when in Opposition but are delivering so little when they are in Government.</P>
    <P>This Government are perceived by some, particularly the media, as being solely responsible for controlling the fiscal aspects of our economy.  They are being hailed as financial wizards for reducing the rate of inflation to about 2 per cent and the level of borrowing to 6 per cent.  It has been conveniently forgotten that the previous Government reduced the rate of inflation from almost 20 per cent in 1982 to 3 per cent in 1987 when they left office.  That was a major achievement but it is inclined to be over-looked by many commentators, and perhaps by ourselves also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Another example that illustrates the progress made by the previous Government is the budget deficit.  In 1981 it was spiralling towards 20 per cent of GNP. However, in 1987 before leaving office we succeeded in reducing it to slightly over 10 per cent and we did that despite the constant and vicious opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We succeeded in doing that in Government without any consensus or co-operation from the Opposition. They used every opportunity, both inside and outside the Dáil, to generate anti-Government feeling.  Indeed their efforts outside the House were often more successful as I do not believe they once succeeded in inflicting a defeat on the Government in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Most of us who are public representatives remember attending protest meetings throughout the country, anti-health cut meetings, anti-education cut meetings and so on.  This was well orchestrated and we got absolutely no co-operation from the Opposition at that time. There was no such thing as putting the economy and the country before narrow political party advantage.  Every Government measure, good or bad, had to be opposed both inside and outside the House.  Is there anyone in this country today who thinks Fianna Fáil would act differently if they were still in Opposition? Is there anyone who seriously believes that the Taoiseach would have it in him to adopt a Tallaght strategy if still in Opposition?  Indeed, Fianna Fáil are the chief architects of our recent economic troubles.</P>
    <P>How many people recall the general election of 1977 and the manifesto at that time?  During the campaign Fianna Fáil promised to abolish every progressive form of taxation, including rates on domestic dwellings, car tax, wealth tax and capital gains tax and, to complete the circle, they promised to provide full employment in the eighties.  We know what happened between 1977 and 1981. Unfortunately, most of these promises were kept and the taxes were abolished but during those years they borrowed £12 billion in the process to fill the vacuum that was created.  We should never forget <Col N="922" /> that major figures in this Government were also members of the 1977-81 Administration that launched and set in motion the economic locomotive that created the present difficulties.  They are implementing policies that are coming to grips with the crisis, with the support, understanding and consensus of the major Opposition parties but we should always remember it was their irresponsibility that got us into the difficulties in the first instance.</P>
    <P>With the consensus available to the Government at present, the Minister had a golden opportunity in the budget of tackling the great economic difficulties, namely, unemployment, emigration, taxation and poverty.  Imaginative policies to stimulate employment in the development of our natural resources could be undertaken.  For example, the fishing industry that has such great and excellent potential has again been left in the doldrums. Fishing vessels are tied in ports and fishermen are even emigrating.  On my way to Dublin last Wednesday I gave a lift to two fishermen from Donegal who boarded a plane in Dublin and headed off to England.  Never was the fishing industry hit as seriously as it is now.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing something about these matters the Minister has presented us with a patchwork budget, a patch here and a stitch there, without any definite plan of action.  It does nothing to solve the great problems and it certainly contributed nothing to our preparation for 1992 and all that it involves.  To put it in a nutshell, it is a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would once again like to refer to the difficulties being experienced in the Gaeltacht.  I have discussed this matter already with the Minister of State and perhaps in his contribution today or tomorrow he may have some good news for us on that front.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy McGinley and others, and indeed to his party leader, emphasise the excellent and unprecedented opportunities that exist at present.  I am glad they acknowledge that these opportunities exist.  I would stress that the reason they <Col N="923" /> exist now is that the things they are saying we should do are not being done, that the things that were done in the past, particularly in the mid-eighties, are not being done.  That is really the secret of economic recovery and it has to be recognised as such.</P>
      <P>I came in here last night and listened to Deputy Carey on the Opposition benches.  I found it amazing that he had absolutely no sense of guilt, remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the damage done to this country between 1983 and 1987.  He was in no way penitent. He actually tried to fault Fianna Fáil for the fact that they, when in Government, spent £12.5 billion of taxpayers' money.  It is my job to remind Deputies McGinley, Carey, Dukes and other, but most of all the public, of what happened in the mid-eighties and to contrast it with what is happening now.  I will continue to repeat the words of people such as Deputy McGinley, that we now have an unprecedented opportunity to do something and I will say why that is so.  In that way the public will understand what is happening.</P>
      <P>Last year I stressed that more money had been borrowed, wasted, spent &mdash; whichever way you like to put it &mdash; from 1983 to 1987 than had been spent since the foundation of the State.  Deputy McGinley would like to skip a period and go back to 1977 &mdash; others can go back as far as 1969 &mdash; but I am interested in the present day.  If the Government's performance must be compared with that of another Administration the obvious comparison is with the 1983-87 Coalition.</P>
      <P>Even Deputy De Rossa in his contribution admitted that one cannot but be struck by the very favourable climate for investment.  In the Official Report for 25-26 January 1989, volume 386, column 334, Deputy De Rossa went on to outline the various excellent factors as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growth is at 2 per cent, having been a minus figure for several years, manufacturing output is soaring, productivity is high, industrial disputes are rare, exports are booming, imports <Col N="924" /> down and we have the highest balance of payments surplus within the EC.</P>
    <P>It was not the Taoiseach not any Fianna Fáil Minister who said that but Deputy De Rossa.  The same Deputy told us that farmers' incomes are rising speedily &mdash; one might not think so after listening to Deputy Durkan and others this morning &mdash; and that interest rates are down and profits are booming.  I admit I am quoting Deputy De Rossa selectively but he stated these facts.  We must recognise that he is the Leader of his own party and that he is accepting what I might be trying to persuade people to realise is happening.</P>
    <P>I must speak to the ordinary man on the street because many of them are finding it difficult to understand how things can have changed so rapidly in such short time, that is from February 1987.  They remember the shambles that was created in the previous short four year period.  At meetings people who are not politically involved will ask how it has been done and how is it that Labour and Fine Gael, when they had a majority in this House, could achieve nothing like it.  We have heard Members speak here in the context of the 1983-87 period as though Fianna Fáil could have voted the Coalition out of office.  Of course they could not, unlike the position of the Opposition today.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at what has happened because it did not happen by accident.  There are dozens of examples of programmes and issues that the former comrades in arms were due to carry out but failed to proceed with.  In many other cases there were ideological differences, there were rows and there were even differences within each of the two parties at times about what should happen. There were two efforts at the tax amnesty, for instance.  I do not know the exact figure that was realised but it was something of the order of a few hundred thousand pounds.  Let us compare that with the tax amnesty of last year.  A local radio Bill was hatched by one of the junior members in the Coalition for three or four years but probably because of ideological differences either within his own party or across the board, nothing <Col N="925" /> happened in that case.  Now we have a commission and we have control of the position.  Many other things were attempted, but they were either botched or did not see the light of day at all. People will ask what has been happening since.  We have a committed and totally dedicated Taoiseach leading the Government and he is in touch with the real needs of the country.  He is not living in any ivory tower and there are no theoretical considerations blinding him to the reality of what is needed.  We have a team of Ministers who are capable and innovative and who work together.  There are no ideological hang-ups or clashes and this is very important.  When these clashes took place in the Coalition it was the ordinary punter in the street, the taxpayer and the young persons who were suffering.  Their futures were being jeopardised.</P>
    <P>There are dozens of examples of the initiatives that have been taken.  As recently as last night we witnessed the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, getting people together in this country, in a way that he has already done internationally through the international marketing houses, to ensure that the local market which was being plundered by foreigners would not be plundered in future.  He wants them to get in, become professional, grab up the local market and create jobs for our own people rather than for Germans, Italians or anyone else.  That was the kind of initiative we needed rather than the theoretical nonsense that took place before.  There has been movement in many other areas but generally we have reached the present position as a result of having a combined, active and capable team in Government. The Taoiseach this morning touched on many of the areas where initiatives have been taken.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are capable of working, given the leadership and the opportunity.  They are capable of competing, probably better than most in the world.  Perhaps I am being a little chauvinistic in my approach but I believe we <Col N="926" /> are the best if we are given the opportunity. We need the leadership and we are now getting it.</P>
    <P>There are other areas such as tax reform.  The Taoiseach made a statement this morning which proves that he is in touch with reality.  He said that people should understand outside of the vague generalisations, that the ordinary hard-pressed taxpayer only wishes to see a reduction in the excessive amount of personal taxation he or she pays.  I agree totally with that.  This is the kind of attitude we need to have because for too long I have been one of those who collected a wage packet on a Thursday or Friday night and found that 50 per cent of my expected wages had been taken by the State.  We have people here who have never had the experience of drawing an ordinary weekly wage packet and this has been one of our problems.  They have the theory but in practice they do not know what it is all about.  They should have that experience and they should know that that is what matters to the person on the ground so I am delighted with the Taoiseach's reaction this morning.</P>
    <P>I can give schedules of how that ordinary PAYE worker will gain from the budget as will every section of the community. I am not too worried about the theory of it or about expanding the tax base or about much of the other hogwash we get here when people are trying to make a case for arguing with the Minister for Finance.  The reality is that people will gain as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>The general reaction of the public to the budget could be put under three headings. There is almost universal agreement on the main thrust of the budget.  Certainly, the reaction I received from people was that the correct measures were being taken.  I went out and spoke to people &mdash; obviously, many of them would know I was politically involved &mdash; while others contacted me.  These were not all Fianna Fáil people but the reaction of all of them was that the correct measures were being taken.  The reaction of the various interest groups, some of whom made submissions, is extremely favourable.  There are, and always will <Col N="927" /> be, groups who feel that not enough is being done in a specific area.  It is acknowledged that even God himself could not please everybody.  However, there is the development of a social conscience and that in itself is good because it will give the Government the support they require to make changes.  I think many of these people might have tended to ignore poverty in the past and I see a danger that they might ignore economic reality.</P>
    <P>It is worth stressing the overriding factors inherited by the Government in February 1987.  As I said last year and in the previous budget contribution, almost everything is dictated by economic factors &mdash; the £24.5 billion debt, 50 per cent of which was run up in the four year period, 1983 to 1987, 250,000 people idle and more than one million people in receipt of social welfare payments of one type or the other.  This mess was left.  The majority of interest groups believe that the correct decisions are being taken to clean up the mess.  I accept that nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and there will always be minor issues to be argued, and it is important to recognise that, but the general reaction reinforces the Fianna Fáil view that we are on the right course.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the reaction from Opposition politicians.  Last night Deputy Carey read at length from a paper, I think he was quoting from the <i>Donegal People's Press,</i> telling us how Fianna Fáil and the Minister had got it wrong.  To counteract that argument, in fairness, I must quote from my local newspaper, and the <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> probably summed up best the reaction of Opposition politicians to the budget.  The very simple headline read: &ldquo;Unable to pick holes in budget&rdquo;.  It is a fact that they were unable to pick holes in the budget. The proof of that is that most of the discussion has concentrated on an issue that is not included in the budget but is being examined to see if it needs to be amended next year, that is, the question of either taxing or doing away with payment of child benefits for certain people. This is a hardy annual.  The fact that there <Col N="928" /> is such a concentration on this area shows how firm the budget is.</P>
    <P>Many comments made by the Minister were either deliberately misdirected or misinterpreted.  The Taoiseach laid on the line this morning what is being looked at.  He quoted previous Ministers, and I think Mr. Richie Ryan first suggested that this area should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Last year, I said I was worried about any suggestion to tamper with child benefit and the reasons I gave them are now being reinforced.  I said I felt the cost of implementing means testing would be greater than the benefits gained.  I also said this was the only direct payment to the housewife in very many cases, and I felt that if there was a cut off point, unfortunately it will be the PAYE worker, the legitimate taxpayer who is billed on every shilling earned, who will suffer.  Those outside the PAYE sector will be able to manipulate figures to ensure that their income is under the quoted figure.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, obviously I agree totally with the people who say that as far as possible, the money should be kept for the less well off.  The Government have been doing this for the past 12 months or more and the figures are there to prove it.  As an aside, there must be a few ladies getting a guilt complex about this because they are the few unfortunates who are misquoted every time anybody wants to have an emotive go at this topic.  I feel sorry for those three or four women.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate there was a lot of huffing and puffing about the Minister scoring own goals or having the goal at his mercy and shooting wide. However, I think these football style analogies lacked enthusiasm.  Everybody was aware that the country had been brought to the edge of bankruptcy and I hope it is now recognised that our hard work will bring us back from the brink. Constructive criticism is always helpful, but meaningless clichés like scoring an own goal, and kicking the ball wide do not help anyone.  They are useless rhetoric.</P>
    <P>As I said, most of the critical comment has centred on a matter that is not <Col N="929" /> included in the budget, and hopefully the public will take note of that.  This issue had been raised by some commentators during the silly season and by one or two interest groups, but their lack of comment was noticeably absent in the past week.  The next time they raise this issue, we might remind them of that fact.</P>
    <P>We should look at the social welfare programmes and how they affect people. When this Government introduced their first budget, there was very little time to educate people on the various programmes and the strategy behind them. To some extent, an attitude of blind loyalty was asked for.  By the time the second budget was introduced, the public could see that the previous crazy spiral of mismanagement had come to a halt, and, at this stage they can see, as was spelled out by Deputy McGinley, Deputy Carey, Deputy Dukes and others, there is room to manoeuvre and that there are options open to us.  Let us look at the reasons for that.</P>
    <P>An extra £71 million has been injected into social welfare to ensure that the Government promises of providing for the less well off are adhered to.  This increase has been added to last year's vastly improved benefits.  If we look at the overall figure, we will have a true picture of what has happened in less than two years.  That figure cannot be argued with.  It is equally important to point out that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has brought forward a massive programme of legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with social welfare was the incidence of fraud and the wastage of funds.  In certain areas people were getting money to which they were not entitled.  The Minister has worked on a two pronged approach: first, to ensure that very good rises were given to the least well off &mdash; I think a rise of 10 to 12 per cent is a very good rise; second, to ensure that there is legislation to deal with people in the black economy or those who were deliberately using fraudulent methods to claim money or to ensure that we can divert funds to the least well off.</P>
    <P>People may try to gloss over these <Col N="930" /> social welfare increases and say that a 12 per cent increase from a very low base does not make a great deal of difference. I have to emphasise that this is the first time that an increase in the region of 12 per cent has been granted.  Last year the Minister was very courageous when he tackled many little needling issues &mdash; such as split payments of pensions, or troubles caused by changes in the PRSI scheme, etc.  Now he has taken up other issues. The family income supplement was first introduced during the Coalition period, but it was neither advertised nor funded properly and most people were totally unaware of it.  In contrast, this Minister is ensuring that all local groups are aware of it.  He is advertising the scheme widely and providing an extra £1 million this year to ensure the scheme is expanded, that the threshold limits are improved and that the payments are extended to a greater number of children.</P>
    <P>For some time many of us working in the community care area have been making a case for free electricity units for the elderly.  We have been asking that they be allowed carry forward any unused units.  Many of them are terrified by technology, they are not aware of the method of reading the meter, and they are afraid to use all the units to which they are entitled.  People were pleading with Labour Ministers, Fine Gael Ministers and probably Fianna Fáil Ministers on this issue, and I am glad to see a change is being made and that elderly people will be entitled to carry forward units of free electricity that have not been used in one billing period.  This is a major step forward for the elderly and should not be under estimated.  This is a simple enough measure, I do not know what it has been costed at, but it will be a major benefit for the elderly, particularly when they can carry forward the units they do not use in the summer period to the winter period.  I thank the Minister and congratulate him on taking yet another initiative.</P>
    <P>The allocations of £500,000 to the St. Vincent de Paul Society and £100,000 to the Samaritans are welcome.  Another £1 million has been set aside for special <Col N="931" /> housing for the homeless.  Last year people sneered at the allocation of money to the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Somebody actually said that it was teaching the poor to be poor.  That was a snipe at the least well-off section of our community. We all need constant education, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pointed out earlier on.  There is a need to teach people how to manage their incomes.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society have done tremendous work in this area.</P>
    <P>On finance, we could at this stage almost use a series of one-liners and Deputy De Rossa has pre-empted my efforts in this regard.  He has lauded the changes that have taken place; Exchequer borrowing coming down from £2,145 million in 1986 to £1,057 million in 1989.  We might as well spell out the difference &mdash; £1,008 million.  It is worth stressing, for the benefit of the person in the street, that this is the lowest borrowing level in 30 years.  People are blinded by talk about billions of pounds, but it is made up of single units of currency, one punt at a time.  The current budget deficit was referred to this morning by the Taoiseach.  The difference between the present time and 1986-87 is phenomenal.  People are asking how this could have been achieved.  It has been done by careful management, a co-ordinated effort by the Cabinet and by good leadership.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to interest rates being down by 6 per cent.  There was much talk about the cut in the relief in mortgage interest rates.  It should be pointed out to the ordinary mortgage payer what the benefits are to him or her.  An example is given that the cut in interest rates will mean a saving of up to £1,800 to a person with a £30,000 loan. That fact should be pointed out and statistics can be worked from there.  The ordinary person on the street should not be under-estimated when doing his or her sums and will recognise all these facts.  It is worth pointing out that when we say we are 6 per cent below UK rates, there was much reaction when we broke with sterling.  I cannot quote the sources but <Col N="932" /> from memory I believe that there was a fair measure of criticism at the time, that this was a reaction by people like the Taoiseach in being anti-British.  Of course, that was rubbish.  That expression was used in an emotive fashion at that time.  The real reason for the break with sterling can now be seen, as can the benefit to our country.  We now have a level of economic independence which we would not have if still linked with sterling. The arguments used at the time should be researched.  Many people attacked the Taoiseach just for the sake of attacking him, but that was an important break for us and for our industry, for agricuture and other sectors.</P>
    <P>Inflation is down to just over 2 per cent, the lowest in 28 years.  When asked by constituents why this could not have been achieved between 1983 and 1987, the answer is that it is because of these factors that we have been drawn back from the disastrous results of that period. The new records in growth in exports and so on did not just happen.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and the Minister for Finance would not wish to hog the limelight in this regard.  Every Minister has been making his or her own positive contribution.  Growth in exports and other matters are very much related to the national agreement with the working partners and also to the efforts of the Minister for Labour.  We now enjoy the best labour relations for approximately 30 years and this did not happen by accident. It was hard work in co-operation with the social partners, attention to genuine complaints and grievances and attempting to work on them.  There were no kite-flying or high profile activities at all, just sheer hard work and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is to be congratulated for his work.</P>
    <P>It is very important to have industrial peace.  It is very important to ensure that there are no stoppages, particularly in areas of exporting.  Working with the other Ministers who have responsibility for marketing, we have improved the situation. The record growth in exports again shows the commitment of another Minister.  It is the same down along the <Col N="933" /> line, for example, with the Minister for the Environment.  There is the example of not imposing the 5p increase on lead-free petrol, in contrast to the action of a previous Minister in the Coalition Government who gobbled up all the benefits of a cut in oil prices.  He believed that if petrol prices were kept up people would not make non-essential journeys but that was a negative attitude.  Now we have a positive approach of exempting lead-free petrol, to encourage people to use it rather than normal petrol.  All these things are being done, in contrast with what was not done in the past.</P>
    <P>There was criticism levelled in Cork last week because the Government had the &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; to delay for three months in giving a decision on allocating another £3 million for a ferry.  That criticism came from people who sat in this House between 1984 and 1986 when the Government delayed for three years, without even tackling this problem.  There was also criticism about lack of money for refurbishing houses.  Last night I was able to welcome a £3 million allocation from the Minister for the Environment for the refurbishing of housing for the elderly people of our city, people who had been ignored for years.  We must compare performance in 1988-89 and between 1984 and 1986.  Everybody who wants to evaluate this budget correctly and evaluate Government performance should forget about 1977, 1972, 1969 and 1916 and should compare the performance of the two most immediate Governments, the ideologically differing partners of 1983 to 1987 and the present committed united Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some interest to some of the points made by Deputy Dennehy.  Following the logic of his argument, I should compliment the Government on the mildness of the month of January because the Government seemed to have had as much of a hand in that marvellous turn-about in the fortunes of the world's climate as they would appear to have in the fortunes of the country's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to concentrate <Col N="934" /> my remarks on three specific areas.  I want, first, to talk about Ireland's relationship with the European Community in the context of the development plan which Deputy Reynolds, the Minister for Finance, talked about at length in his budget speech.  I want to talk about the budget strategy in a broad way and about employment which is an issue that unites everybody in this House with regard to their concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, said something which I want to put on the record because it is very relevant to what I shall proceed to say and argue.  This quotation is from the Official Report, column 239, Vol. No. 386, of 25 January 1988 and it reads:</P>
    <P>The preparation of a development plan designed to enable us to accelerate the development of our economy in partnership with the European Community is nearing completion.  The plan will set out the Government's strategy for maximising use of the increased funding which will result from the decision to increase the resources of the Structural Funds.  It will play a pivotal part in the building up of the economy over the next five years.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is classified as a single region for European Structural Fund purposes, the Government decided to set up an extensive local consultative process on the preparation of the sub-national programmes which will set out the detailed implementation of the development strategy adopted in the plan.  The purpose of this is to ensure that local interests will have an input into the programmes.  Through the Department of Finance, which provide the chairmanship and secretariat for the seven working groups that are drawing up the sub-national programmes, the local interests have a direct line of communication to the Government.</P>
    <P>The national plan will be formally submitted to the European Commission not later than 31 March next. The proposals in it will then have to be examined by Commission staff to <Col N="935" /> ensure that they comply with the regulations governing the three Structural Funds.  The Commission will then establish what is known as the Community Support Framework which will set out the priorities for Community assistance and an indicative financing plan.</P>
    <P>That is what I would regard as a parliamentary lie.  I repeat that the Government have been deliberately misleading this country for the past seven or eight months.  There has been no such local consultative process.  Yesterday in this House the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs backed off in a pathetic way to a question from me about the regular reports which she assured the nation were coming from county managers after the meetings of these working groups.  That was a lie and if she did not know it was a lie, she should have known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Leonard) Acting Chairman (Mr. Leonard)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Leonard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to refrain from using the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will naturally confine myself to its correct parliamentary usage, but the dictionary is bereft of any more accurate description of what would be described in the local vernacular as misleading information.  This Government have been deliberately misleading the public.  The Minister of State said on radio that to the best of her knowledge county managers were giving regular reports after each working group meeting about the formulation of these development plans.  That is not true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not reporting back.  A secretive process is going on in relation to the preparation of a development plan.  According to the Minister <Col N="936" /> for Finance the preparation of this plan, which is to be submitted on 31 March, will play a pivotal part in the building up of the economy in the next five years.</P>
      <P>I have been raising consistently since last June the preparations for this historic shift in terms of resources.  For whatever reason this Parliament and the public representatives throughout the nation, including members of Fianna Fáil who do not happen to be chairman of county councils, have been specifically and deliberately excluded from the process.  The public have been conned into thinking that they have a role by way of submitting proposals.  The various working groups have received bundles of proposals from all sorts of community groups which, I have been informed, are effectively being ignored.</P>
      <P>This State for the purposes of the European Regional Development Fund and the enhanced Structural Funds is classified as a single region.  This House is the only comprehensive democratically elected assembly representing that entire region which qualifies for such support. Despite repeated requests, as recently as this morning on the Order of Business, we are being denied the possibility of debating what this Government are proposing to present to Brussels on our behalf on 31 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the last general election produced a new Government; it did not turn the Republic of Ireland into some private estate managed and owned by the Fianna Fáil Party.  In so far as they will be using taxpayers' money to look for support from Brussels, this House has a right to see what is being proposed.  We are being denied that right, yet we are told by the Minister for Finance that this is one of the major things that will happen to this economy in the next four or five years.  This is a fundamental denial of basic democratic rights.  It is not even smart.  If the Government of the day were able to go to Brussels on 31 March and present an overall document about which there had been an enormous amount of consultation and which had been <Col N="937" /> endorsed in our national Parliament following a debate, it would greatly strengthen the hand of the Government in relation to the transfer of resources which we so desperately need.  The secrecy which has been so obsessive and defensive during the past 18 months is not only an affront to the democracy of our Republic and to the rights and privileges of elected Members of this House but is also counter-productive to the interests of the Government and the citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which we are grossly deficient by contrast with the rest of the Community is in regard to our road transportation system.  Our national primary roads are substandard, which imposes a heavy cost on goods being exported from the Republic.  In some areas the national primary roads are grossly deficient.  The general consensus is that we need a massive investment of capital into the national primary road system so that when the completed internal market comes into effect on 31 December 1992 we will have an improved road system in place.  There is effectively no mention of this in the budget speech delivered by the Minister for Finance. He talks about giving approximately £150 million for county and regional roads over a three-year period.  It is not disputed that this expenditure is needed.  It will amount to about £47.5 million this year.  An extra £60.5 million will be contributed by direct Exchequer expenditure of which £34 million will go for road improvements.  He did not state that the £34 million will be for improvements in the national primary road system.  Significantly, there is no multi-annual planning, no suggestion of a three year plan, as there is for county and regional roads. There is no mention of the National Roads Authority which was to be the agency which would bring us up to speed in relation to our national primary road system.  All I can conclude is that in one area where we would benefit significantly from our application to Brussels for structural assistance&mdash;the roads system at national primary level because that is where we would be on an equal footing in <Col N="938" /> comparative and competitive terms with Brussels and the rest of the Community &mdash;the Government have not got their act together, do not have a coherent strategy for the National Roads Authority and do not know how much capital sums they want to spend on our national primary system over the next three or four years. If they knew what they were going to spend&mdash;estimated by the National Roads Authority at £3,000 million&mdash;to bring our roads system to comparative equality with the rest of the European Community, they would be trumpeting it loud and clear in the budget speech. Instead, the trumpets are silent.</P>
    <P>If the Government have not got their act together in relation to the roads system which will benefit from financing in a significant way from the increased Structural Funds, particularly under the European Regional Development Fund, then we can only conclude that they have not got their act together elsewhere.  We can also draw the conclusion that the reason for the obsessive secrecy in relation to the publication of the various plans is that the entire thing is a total mess.  I am forced to that conclusion but I would love to be proved wrong.  Therefore, I invite the Government to publish the draft plans currently in the various sections of the Department of Finance and allow the House to have a debate and to endorse the proposals if they meet with our approval.  The Minister and his colleagues would then be able to go to Brussels and not be humiliated as they were immediately after Christmas when they went to Brussels cap in hand like mendicant friars on some kind of mission or pilgrimage to the mainland of Europe looking for some kind of hand out only to be told to go away and do their sums. What did the Commission say to the Government?  In column 240 of the Volume to which I referred earlier it is stated that the Commission understandably could not give any formal commitment to the level of funding which will be available to Ireland in 1989.  In January the Commission could not give any formal commitment.  Decoded, the Commission told the Ministers where to get <Col N="939" /> off, to go away and do their homework and to come back with the proper proposals because the Commission knows what sort of money it will spend in 1989. With anger, I must say that the Government are misleading the citizens of this State in the way they are handling this issue and their obsessive secrecy is compounding my fears and my worst worries.</P>
    <P>The budget strategy is working to the extent that interest rates have been reduced.  The strategy is working to the extent that they are operating within an economic climate which internationally, despite a lot of fears, is still buoyant.  The Dow Jones Index in the United States, New York Stock Exchange and the FT Index in London indicate that share price levels and the volume of share dealings have now virtually recovered&mdash;and in some cases exceeded&mdash;the peak which was achieved prior to Black Monday over 13 months ago.  The wind is at the back of the Government who operate a very open economy highly dependent on world economic factors.  That wind has enabled them to achieve the first leg of their strategy which is the reduction of interest rates.  That strategy has been substantially augmented at local level by the massive reduction by the Government in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about who is paying for the reduced interest rates which has excited the financial sector.  It is the person who has to wait six to nine months for a hip replacement in a public ward, it is the person whose child attends a school where a teacher has not been replaced, it is the local authority tenant who looks at a queue getting longer by the day in terms of being housed.  It is every member of our community who depend on the support of the welfare state to augment their own economic frailty as they try to combat the difficulties of surviving.  It is the cutbacks on the backs of the weak and the vulnerable which have reduced the Government's need to borrow money domestically which has driven down the rates of interest.  That is the army whose long and lonely march has brought about the <Col N="940" /> victory for the Government in terms of reducing interest rates, the army of the weak, the vulnerable and the poor, many of whom as they fall victims, do not have the resources themselves or the support of the welfare system in hospitals or anything else, to aid and comfort them and to bandage their wounds.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are not without compassion.  Indeed there is considerable concern in many quarters of Fianna Fáil in relation to the havoc wreaked in some sectors of the social welfare system.  They are being told that this is done in the name of the economy and in the name of getting the investment climate right and that the key element in the investment plan is interest.  I accept that reducing the rate of interest is critical in any economy that needs to invest a lot of capital in order to secure tangible economic growth.  However, this is where the second part of the budget strategy is not working and where the Labour Party diverge fundamentally from the present consensus that seems to underpin this minority Government in this House.  Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats believe that having lowered the rate of interest to its substantially low rate now relative to what it was over the last five or six years or even longer, the private sector will automatically respond and that its response will automatically generate employment.  We have been down this road before.  In 1977 interest rates were not reduced for the private sector but money was thrown at it like confetti at a wedding or snuff at a wake. There were pleas to the private sector to avail of all the grants and extra Government funding which was available at the time.  Deputy McCreevy will remember that.</P>
    <P>The private sector, other than setting up a Mickey Mouse organisation called The Response from Industry, a hyped up front of a number of concerned businessmen which was supposed to stimulate investment in a number of quarters and which disappeared without trace after about 18 months or two years, did what it is always good at&mdash;which is why it is called the private sector&mdash;it looked after <Col N="941" /> itself.  I do not know why the Government or the combination of parties supporting them are so naive in their belief that people who run a private sector enterprise will not be concerned primarily with maximising their own position.  If that happens to produce extra employment it is a bonus but it is not why they are in business in the first place.  Therefore, a heavy reliance on private sector investment leading automatically to job creation is naive and does not tally with experience in the past.  If you think that is ideological claptrap I suggest that you read the plea from the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he brought out a whole array of businessmen and entrepreneurs, wined and dined them in Malahide Castle and begged them to invest in the hope that some jobs would be created.  That was reported in yesterday's newspapers.</P>
    <P>There are problems in relation to the correlation between capital investment and job creation as to whether that investment would be privately or publicly inspired.  The traditional relationship between capital investment and job creation in the manufacturing area has started to break down.  The old presumption in terms of ratios of pounds invested for job creation no longer applies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA have alleged that many new jobs have been created, at an enormous cost, but despite this we were told on the opening day of this session of the Dáil that last year the number of redundancies outstripped the number of new jobs created.  Unless public or private investment has a specific job creation element built in it will not create the number of jobs we need to create in the short term.  The Labour Party are of the view that there needs to be a joint approach in terms of investment, that the State should use its influence but not in terms of a Malahide Castle policy, and should not have to beg or implore entrepreneurs to invest money.  Rather we believe that it should come forward with specific proposals and enter joint ventures with private companies so as to <Col N="942" /> maximise resources and ensure that there is planned growth to produce the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is in relation to employment as distinct from overall budget strategy.  Apart from the intention to reduce expenditure there are no great surprises in the budget.  It is a steady-as-she-goes budget and the Government hope that the confidence of the business community will be retained. To the extent that that was the main intention I have to say that that objective has largely been achieved.  Regardless of what party are in Government and how much money is invested in the short term this country, with a present unemployment rate of 18 per cent along with whatever emigration figure one wishes to choose, is going to face a massive unemployment problem in the short term.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the way in which the Government have consistently refused to increase the allocation for direct labour programmes, such as the social employment scheme.  On coming into office in 1987 they reduced the amount of allowance paid to some participants in the social employment scheme.  In 1988 some of the allowances paid were frozen at a time when social welfare benefits were increased.  This resulted in the gap between the two levels of payment narrowing to the extent that in some cases it was not worth the while of some people, particularly young people, to go on the scheme.  Belatedly there has been an increase of £5 in the allowance paid to a single person with a <i>pro rata</i> increase for a person who is married.  I am not aware of the full details.  To the best of my knowledge they have not been announced as yet.</P>
    <P>Recently a study was carried out by FÁS on the real economic cost of the social employment scheme.  For those who may not be familiar with the scheme let me summarise what the aims of the scheme are.  It aims to provide part time employment for those over the age of 25 and who have been unemployed for one year or more.  They are required to work 40 hours in a two week period either on <Col N="943" /> a day on, day off basis or a week on, week off basis.  The work they do must be of benefit to the community, not to the commercial gain of the employer. Many people have taken up posts as caretakers in schools and have found jobs in community projects, such as the restoration of canals, and in environmental improvement works up and down the country.  Currently there are about 10,000 people employed on this scheme. The cost per head is about £100 per week. This cost is made up of the allowance paid to the participant, £65 if the person is single or £85 if they are married, with the balance being made up by the cost of materials and administration.  After taking into account the savings made in social welfare and elsewhere the actual cost to the taxpayer amounts to £25 a week.  I admire some of the things the Government are trying to do.  I have not been blind to the positive achievements gained by any Government or any individual but I would put it to the Government that no matter what they do or no matter how fast they do it they are not going to transform the unemployment figures in one year, three years or five years.  Those out of work for over a year are in need of a job or some other activity and they need to have it next week.</P>
    <P>If one takes away work from somebody they take away something very fundamental, that is, their natural right. When we meet a stranger for the first time we might ask them their name, where they come from and what they do. If the person cannot give an answer to the third question, he can give no response to that natural inquiry, like a three legged stool a key support of their fundamental identity is swept away and they lose dignity and self respect.  As we know, in many cases they physically deteriorate. That is the cancer, the curse of unemployment that has to be confronted.  If our economy is not strong enough in a conventional way to confront the problem we need to intervene directly and we can do this by way of dramatically increasing the amount of money to the social welfare system, for example, <Col N="944" /> through such schemes as the social employment scheme.  I have made a quick calculation and found that if an extra £50 million a year was made available an extra 40,000 people could be put on the social employment scheme with the result that a lot of community work around the country could be done in areas where there is genuine deprivation and in areas of urban dereliction.  As well as this they would be working and would be receiving more than they would receive on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The first two points I made, that there is secrecy in relation to the allocation of the European Structural Funds and that the strategy behind the budget is only partially working as employment is not being created in the orthodox economy, lead me on to the third point I wish to make which is that we desperately need to deal with the problem of unemployment and that this can be done by reallocating a very small amount of the £7 billion contained in the budget for 1989.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Quinn, I regard myself as a fair minded commentator on the Irish political scene and on the Irish economy, perhaps to my detriment in the past.  While Deputy Quinn's approach to the problems of the economy might be different from mine &mdash;he holds a philosophy that is different from mine&mdash;it would be most churlish of me not to congratulate him on making one of the most constructive speeches I have heard from the Opposition benches. I am one of those people who believes that budget day is one of the great over played days in the season.  Perhaps this is because it comes shortly after the Christmas period when the needy do not have a lot to write home about.  It is portrayed as the day that is going to affect all our lives.  Even those who would not know what a current budget deficit is are of the opinion that something dramatic happens in Leinster House on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budget day presents the Minister for Finance with an opportunity to outline what Government policies are and what <Col N="945" /> the Government intend doing in the following year.  The amount of money played around with on budget day is very small as the major decisions are made before the publication of the Estimates. Because of the approach adopted by the Government since coming to office they have allowed themselves more scope to announce pieces of good news on budget day.  Such an approach had been lacking in the preparation of Budget Statements over a long number of years.  While the amount of money played around with on budget day is very small, budget day presents the Minister with an opportunity to comment on what the Government have done and what they intend to do in the following year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but as I have had some experience in this area, I am speaking with a degree of historic knowledge.  Therefore, let me ask him if he is not aware that processing applications from existing unions, some of whom have now successfully merged, took what appeared to them, and, indeed, to many others, an inordinate length of time and that inordinate length of time frustrated the desire of those unions and the support of many other people in this House that they should rationalise.

      <P>I can confirm that it is Government policy because it is the expressed view of the House that we should have amalgamation of unions.  We want to do everthing possible to encourage that.  With that in mind, and in the light of complaints that have been made in relation to the operation of the Registrar's office, I had a meeting with the Registrar recently.  The Deputy will be aware of the application of the FWUI and the ITGWU to amalgamate, a major item to be considered by the Registrar. <Col N="950" /> To help in the consideration of that application, and to ensure that there will not be any delays in dealing with it, we have arranged that a former member of the staff of the Department of Labour who is very familiar with this area, will be employed on a temporary basis in the Registrar's office.  The Registrar is totally committed to helping in the processing of applications for amalgamation. However, he must meet his strict legal responsibilities and must consider all applications in a particular way.  Within the constraints of his responsibility to carry out a detailed examination of all applications he has assured me that everything will be done to speed up amalgamations and that there will not be any delays.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply to my supplementary question.  Is the Minister aware that an application from a major Civil Service union to merge with a smaller Civil Service union is being processed at a very slow rate?  Will he accept, on the basis of the time taken to handle the paper work related to that small number of unions that the time limit of 1990 for the new IPTU union will not be met by the Registrar's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with the unfortunate delays in mind that in relation to the SIPTU amalgamation it was decided to employ an experienced official to help the Registrar deal with that application. It is fundamental to national policy that we should have amalgamations of our unions.  I will bring to the attention of the Registrar the point made by the Deputy about the Civil Service unions.  The Deputy can be assured that the Registrar is well disposed to speeding up the amalgamations through his office.  However, he must deal with those applications in accordance with the criteria laid down by law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a statement made <Col N="951" /> by the former chairman of ICI (details supplied), that in the next ten years more than half of Europe's factories would be closed and half its companies would disappear or be absorbed by mergers; and whether this has any implications for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to in the Deputy's question. In the statement the former ICI chairman said that in his view at least half of European companies would disappear but that this did not mean that all of the factories would disappear; rather a process of consolidation would take place.</P>
      <P>This is a view of the effects of market integration which is supported by the analysis in the Cecchini report.  That analysis states that the removal of existing barriers to trade within the Community will facilitate the reaping of economies of scale, improved efficiency in enterprises and a rationalisation of industrial structures resulting from more competitive markets.</P>
      <P>This view would also seem to have gained support amongst industrial leaders given the recent extent of mergers and acquisitions at both national and international level throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>This view is not, however, unquestioned.  The Deputy may have seen reports in recent days of another study published in the UK which disputes that Europe needs big companies to compete effectively.  This study claims that there is much evidence that companies' efficiency decreases with size and that, in most countries, production scales were large enough to allow efficient operation.</P>
      <P>It is the case that Irish owned industry is relatively small in European terms. There are two ways of dealing with this: encouraging companies to move to larger scale, and assisting them to develop those attributes which help to offset small scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A move towards larger sized firms, based on expansions or amalgamations, will allow firms to take advantage of economies of scale in production, distribution, marketing and product <Col N="952" /> development.  Many of Ireland's top industries are already in the vanguard of this movement.  The Government will support Irish industry in meeting the challenges. The State promotional agencies have been directed to encourage and assist Irish businesses to follow up on merger and acquisition opportunities where these can lead to optimum scale activities and thus maximise employment opportunities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Relatively small scale need not be a problem if the industry concerned is capable of differentiating its products or its markets from those of larger scale competitors. The increasing emphasis in industrial policy in strengthening the marketing and innovative inputs of industry is of particular relevance in this context. Thus, firms which develop niche markets on the basis of quality of product and performance need not be at a disadvantage. There can be considerable scope for international partnerships for industry, both large and small, to gain access to distribution and market outlets and to technology and product developments. The State agencies can provide a wide range of contacts and services in the building of such partnerships.</P>
    <P>The primary thrust of the Government's EUROPEN Campaign has been to make Irish industry aware of the threats and opportunities which the completion of the single market will bring and to stress the need for all companies to take positive steps now to prepare for the changes.  As I have already stated, the Government will support any measures which will maximise the employment opportunities in Ireland.</P>

Competition already exists in the market for the supply of telecommunications terminal equipment in as much as suppliers of such equipment are licensed to compete with Telecom Éireann and their subsidiary, Telecom Éireann Information Services Ltd., for the supply, installation and maintenance of all terminal equipment except for telephone hand sets.

That is why they have initiated a programme of bills identifying individual calls.  There is a pilot scheme in Limerick at the moment and it is intended to extend this across the board so as to solve the problem to which the Deputy refers.  In relation to competition, Telecom Éireann are doing an excellent job and I intend to encourage them to broaden <Col N="959" /> their scope rather than to cut back on their monopoly.</P>

      <P>In response to the public demand for bills identifying individual calls, Telecom Éireann are investing approximately £20 million in installing a complete billing system which will allow the subscriber to identify individual calls. In relation to the question of competition, Telecom Éireann have the rights up to the door of the premises but inside the premises in many cases they are facing competition and are responding to it through their Telecom information services.  I would encourage that.  It is the right way forward.  Telecom Éireann, though not perfect, are doing an excellent job and should be encouraged.</P>

Is the Minister aware that in places like Bonn, the handset has a meter which clocks up the units of call and the user can calculate the size of the bill?  Would the Minister not agree that something as simple as that could be introduced if Telecom Éireann got off their backsides and had to compete so that they would have to introduce simple systems with which the consumer could identify?</P>

      <P>I take it that it is the Minister's intention to issue licences under the MMDS system.  Is he aware of what are now likely to be very high costs to those people who will benefit from that system compared with the cost of cable and the likelihood that many people in rural areas will not be able to avail of the service other than RTE 1 and 2 channels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that people in rural Ireland will have the same facilities as those fortunate enough to live in cabled areas.  There should not be discrimination between rural and urban areas.  The position in relation to cost is that it will be roughly the same as the average of the cabled system&mdash; approximately £100 for connection and approximately £100 annually for the licence fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear that the prices appear to have dropped.  Does the Minister not accept that the rural community already have in existence a system comparable to the cable one; that serious questions arise with regard to the MMDS system, an unproven system in the context of the format in which it is to be used in this country, indeed that serious health questions arise with regard to it?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that serious operational questions arise? Why is the Minister not considering any alternative system when the voice of consumers &mdash; about whom he appears to be so concerned &mdash; says that they do not want the MMDS system?  Why is the Minister saying continuously that the <Col N="962" /> opposite view is held when clearly it is not?  What are the Minister's proposals with regard to satellite television bearing in mind the position of most people in rural areas who will consider purchasing a satellite dish which will cost them less than the MMDS system and afford them access to 30-odd channels rather than the few that will be available under the MMDS system?  Has the Minister considered that aspect of the matter?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he accepts the accuracy of figures produced by the Small Firms Association, that telephone and telephone rental costs are, respectively, 23 per cent and 35 per cent higher in Ireland than on average in the nine original EC member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the report referred to by the Deputy.  As I have said in this House many times before, a straight comparison of tariffs among different countries is not meaningful because of the variety and complexity of pricing structures and for other reasons.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some charges for telephone services in Ireland are above the EC average and it was principally this fact that prompted reductions of 20 per cent, 25 per cent and, in some cases, 30 per cent in international call charges from October 1988.  I am keeping the possibility of further reductions by Telecom Éireann in telephone charges under review but this possibility will, of course, depend on the company's financial position from year to year.</P>
      <P>I accept that charges for domestic trunk calls are among the highest in Europe.  However, a reduction in this area could be contemplated only in the context of a re-balancing of domestic telephone charges and this possibility is under consideration by Telecom Éireann at present.  While the report correctly points out that local calls can vary in duration and distort comparison, it fails however, to take into account that rental charges in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy and Germany also vary according to the number of customers available at the local call rate or the geographical location of the customer.  Direct comparisons are not, therefore, possible.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister has used a delicate phrase that politicians should remember, &ldquo;rebalancing domestic telephone charges.&rdquo; It is the nicest way I have heard of saying that one's telephone bill is going to be increased.  Could the Minister explain how domestic telephone charges are unbalanced at the moment?  Who is getting more benefit than they should and who is getting too little?  How does the Minister and Telecom Éireann propose to rebalance them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom Éireann are looking at rebalancing of pricing which effectively means reducing long distance charges and increasing local charges. There is no getting away from that.  Without local call timing this would not be possible and this cannot be introduced until customer confidence in the billing system has improved.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that it is a mess at the moment.  The whole area is being looked at by Telecom Éireann and the aim is to reduce costs as far as possible for the general public.  The internal trunk system is very expensive and this is affecting business.  We want to see these costs brought down as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>During 1988 An Post made major changes in the systems of mail handling in order to alter out of date practices. These changes were introduced side by side with a productivity scheme which resulted in pay increases for mail staff.</P>
      <P>In implementing the new systems certain problems arose which resulted in a downturn in the speed of mail deliveries. These were exacerbated in late September-October when the end of the UK postal strike resulted in the receipt of 8,000,000 items of a mail backlog which delayed the processing of normal mails. Again in early January of this year there was a major problem in the mail which was due to serious absenteeism in the post Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated to An Post that I am very concerned at the deterioration in the quality of service.  An Post share my concern in this area and are taking steps to improve the situation.  The company monitor the delivery standards by means of internal checking procedures and independent surveys.  Recently An Post launched a restructured survey system <Col N="970" /> and a market research agency are carrying out quarterly surveys, the results of which are being published.  The first survey, carried out in November 1988, showed that overall, An Post achieved a next day delivery rate of 82 per cent for letter mail.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor An Post regard this level of performance as satisfactory.  An Post expect to improve their performance significantly in the current year.</P>
    <P>The results of the surveys are being furnished to me and I will continue to keep the situation under close review.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the kernel of the problem is that because there are no competitive market forces operating within that area it is impossible for them to get their house in order?

In the long term that agreement will lead to the benefit of An Post and this can only lead to the benefit of the community as a whole.  In many areas An Post are doing an excellent job. There is a hiccup at the moment.  It is just a question of sorting it out in An Post with management and union co-operation, and they are working on it.</P>

      <P>An intensive awareness and information campaign on the implications of &ldquo;1992&rdquo; for the business sector was undertaken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Industry and Commerce between September and the end of November last. This was part of the Government campaign launched by the Taoiseach on 4 July last.</P>
      <P>At present the European Bureau is in the process of commissioning a survey on the impact on the business sector of the first phase of the information and awareness campaign undertaken last year.  This will help identify the areas in industry where a good understanding of the implications of &ldquo;1992&rdquo; has been achieved and of the preparations which should be made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will provide a strong base for planning the next phase of the Government information and awareness campaign and <Col N="972" /> in the case of industry identify those sectors and types of firms which are either well advanced or poorly prepared in planning for &ldquo;1992&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During 1989 I and my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Industry and Commerce will be further developing the awareness and information campaign launched during 1988.  We will do this through participation in, and issuing papers at, a number of conferences for the business sector in which the implications of &ldquo;1992&rdquo; for industry will be thoroughly discussed; continuing to disseminate a comprehensive information pack on the implications of &ldquo;1992&rdquo; for the business sector; supporting the undertaking of analyses of the implications of &ldquo;1992&rdquo; for specific industrial sectors through the European Bureau, NESC and the industrial promotion agencies and ensuring the widest possible dissemination of the findings of these analyses; working with, and helping to co-ordinate the activities of, the State industrial promotion agencies each of which through their direct contact with industrial firms will be further developing their information and advisory services on &ldquo;1992&rdquo; and linking closely with the representative bodies such as CII, FUE, the Chambers of Commerce and ICTU who will also be developing their information and awareness campaigns on &ldquo;1992&rdquo; during 1989 so that duplication is avoided and the entire information campaign is made more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  What sectors have already been identified as under-prepared for 1992?  Would the Minister not agree that there is need for more working groups rather than just the issuing of papers from the Government explaining 1992?  Would he agree that the sectors he has identified need to be brought together in meetings with his own office for face to face discussions rather than just having a faceless issuing of information with regard to 1992?</P>

We want co-ordination between CII, Government agencies, Government itself and the individual sectors, and we will be going through it sector by sector.  It is not a question of identifying just one at this stage.  We will be going through it sector by sector.</P>

That type of problem surfaced in the discussions. It is now time to go back on a sector by sector basis and that is what will be done.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the further increases in the price of alcohol imposed by publicans, he intends to reintroduce price controls on alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware detailed price control procedures have been allowed to lapse since early 1986.  The purpose of this was to encourage competition and to allow market forces and consumer reaction to dictate prices.  I do not propose to reintroduce price control in respect of alcoholic drink, as this would be contrary to the policy of encouraging competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> In July 1988 an order was made to prevent an attempt by Dublin publicans to increases prices.  In revoking that order on 3 November, the then Minister made it clear that he would act again in a similar fashion should there be any renewed attempt at concerted action by the trade. The Deputy can be assured that that is also my position.  I note that the publicans in Dublin, at least, intend to absorb the recent excise increases and I welcome this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a huge variation at present in the price of drinks, that it can vary from £1.35 in some cases to £1.80 in the Dublin area?  Surely this is an indication of a high level of profiteering.  The Minister said in his reply that an order was made in July 1988 to prevent publicans increasing prices.  Would the Minister not agree that this has great implications for the tourism industry as most tourists are shocked by the level of prices in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that these price variations exist should enable people who want a drink to choose which establishment they want to give their business to.  This variation can only be a healthy move.  It also reflects the different standards of the premises in the country at large.  Various publicans charge different prices because they have a different quality of surroundings and it is for the customer to make his judgment as to which pub or hotel he wants to support.  If he does that on price alone, that is a matter for him but I do not favour price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is not collusion.  If I get any evidence of collusion in relation to increasing prices, the Deputy can be assured that I will use the machinery available to me under the prices control legislation, as was done by my predecessor in relation to the increase imposed last summer.  I am not aware of collusion.  On the contrary, I am aware that the trade is trying to have as varied a pricing structure as possible, as can be seen from the point made by Deputy Sherlock who said there are variations. If there was collusion these variations would not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to believe that there is not collusion when in many areas of the country prices in all the pubs in a particular town seem to increase as if by magic on the same day.  I do not see how that can be done other than by some form of communication.  If the Minister was provided with evidence that there was collusion or unreasonable pricing, would he be prepared to consider, in substitution for the use of his powers under the pricing legislation, the selective issuance of additional licences in particular geographic areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The issuing of licences <Col N="976" /> is not my responsibility, but if the Deputy has examples of towns where this has happened in the recent past &mdash; since the order was lifted in November &mdash; I would be keen to get the information.  I can assure him I will then take the necessary action.  I have already had meetings with the associations involved, with the country and the city publicans, in relation to this question.  If the Deputy or anybody else gives me the information &mdash; I have already said this publicly and I will say it again in the Dáil &mdash; in relation to price fixing in towns or regions, I will take immediate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister in any of his discussions questioned why there is such a disparity in the price of, say, non-alcoholic lagers which sell at approximately £2.60 a pint as opposed to normal alcoholic lagers which sell at £1.60 a pint?  Would he agree that this is not in the interests of health and safety and that it is a total abuse by the trade at a time when we are encouraging people not to drink and drive?  This is totally contrary to what we are trying to achieve.  There is something seriously wrong with these prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the price of alcohol imposed by publicans and not price control on alcohol.  I agree with the Deputy that the price of non-alcoholic drinks, of mixers and minerals generally, seems to be out of line with the price of alcoholic drinks.  This is something that we keep constantly under observation.</P>

This has been accepted by Government and we are working on it in both the Department of Justice and in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>The new law will, <i>inter alia,</i> incorporate the substantive patent law provisions of the convention and, on that basis, will be in line with the laws in the other European States which have ratified it.

They do not include investment in non-grant aided manufacturing activities during that period nor investment by industry in non-fixed asset activities, for example, working capital and training.

      <P>Does this include the industrial expansion announced in Cork last November by the Minister's predecessor? When somebody saw this announcement in the paper they went down to look for one of these new jobs, they were told that not alone were the company not expanding but that they had laid off people the previous Friday.  Is the Minister aware that these kinds of jobs are known in Cork as &ldquo;Albert Reynolds jobs&rdquo;, here today and gone yesterday?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, will I am sure be delighted, as a Cork man who has tried, though unsuccessfully, to bring jobs to Cork during his time as a Minister in Government, with the success this Government are having in the Cork region.  He will be delighted with the success in attracting substantial projects to the region.  I recently had the pleasure of being present when it was announced that SCI Systems would locate in Fermoy.</P>

      <P>We recognise the spoof. <Col N="987" /> Do those projects include the factory announced by the Taoiseach on that same night when he said there would be 1,000 jobs in a Taiwanese clothing factory, 50 of which would be created before the end of December 1988?  Were those 50 jobs created?</P>

      <P>As I have said, the arrangements are finalised for 12 medium to large size overseas industrial projects creating 1,500 jobs since the Taoiseach was there.  The Taiwanese project is still being followed up but there was a downturn in the international demand for their particular product.  That downturn was not evident when they indicated they were coming to Ireland.  Negotiations are proceeding with the IDA and that company and these are at an advanced stage.</P>

A particular concern with projects in the Cork area seems to be the problem of third party objections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment of this debate, I was stressing the fact that the budget has been described in various quarters, both inside and outside the House, as being cautious and steady. Before the budget I had made a speech where I said that I hoped the Minister would tread very slowly.  When I was interviewed, the interviewer said that as I was not known as a cautious person, why was I now advocating caution? However, the reality is that a lot of the talk in the past few months has been irresponsible.  It has been irresponsible in a sense that one would be forgiven for imagining that the problems that had beset the economy for a long number of years were now completely overturned and that everything was on a steady course.  Everything is on a steady course but we are a long way from the end of the tunnel.  It is not that we have begun <Col N="1024" /> to see the light at the end of the tunnel but that we have only begun to see the tunnel.</P>
      <P>The simple and stark facts are as follows: at the end of 1988 the Irish debt ratio to gross national product stood at 133 per cent of GNP.  The same ratio is projected to the end of 1989.  If the Government had not taken the corrective action they have taken in the past two years, I do not know what the figure would be.  However, I am already on record as having stated many years ago that if we had kept proceeding at the pace at which this economy was going, we would be totally non-viable.  If we had continued with that particular debt-GNP ratio, our standing in the international community would fall and we would not be able to provide a level of public services in this country at all.</P>
      <P>I consider the ratio of 133 per cent to be still too high.  They had a major debate in the United States preceeding the last presidential election &mdash; though they seem to have a peculiar way of having elections, they talk about everything except the real facts of the economy &mdash; about the debt-GNP ratio.  There is a serious crisis in the American economy because it is projected that their ratio is 55 per cent.  Our rate is 133 per cent.  To put that in context, it takes over £2 billion per year to service our current level of debt. The situation has been like that for a number of years.  If that figure did not have to be repaid on debts incurred in the past, it would mean that we would be well able to fund a very adequate health service as the total health bill is approximately £1,200 million.  We would have had current budget surpluses over the past number of years.  It would be impossible for any Government to right in a couple of years the wrongs of the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One good thing that has happened in the past few years is that reality has dawned on all, particularly the Members of this House.  It was acknowledged that we had to do something about where we were going, and we did it.  This is the first Government in the past 20 years who have actually done anything about the <Col N="1025" /> problem.  If talk could have solved this problem, it would have been solved many years ago.  There was a lot of talk about this by successive Governments and they all had their aspirations but nobody did anything about it until now.  Whether we win the next election or not, this Government will be remembered as the first Government to stop the rot.  I have already paid tribute to the responsible attitude taken by the other parties in the House, particularly Fine Gael, which may not have paid off politically as of yet for the current Leader of the party but which in the long term will pay off because in the long term, the Irish people give credit where credit is due.  This Government will get credit for arresting the decline which has been going on since 1972 at least.</P>
    <P>If we are to learn anything at all, we should realise why we got into this mess. It was because we were not prepared, as a nation, to pay as we went along.  In the 1973-1977 period there were good reasons for having current budget deficits. Perhaps I am the only person in the House who remembers the original principle of what that was about but the theory behind it was that when the economy was in decline, or due to some outside influence there was a crisis, we would not balance the current budget every year.  We would pump more money into the economy to stimulate demand.  Up to 1972 it was the set economic theory that you balanced your budget.  However, it was never intended that a current budget deficit would become a regular feature of any economy.  The principle was that it was only a short term expedient to pump up demand in times of crisis and then to return a balance.  It has become a fact of life in this country that we have a current budget deficit.  This Government have not balanced their budget yet but at least the budget has not spiralled in the past two years.</P>
    <P>It is not that the level of public services we provide is excessive but that we were not prepared to pay the cost of those services or to have a level of services the cost of which we could afford.  All the services that we have are necessary and <Col N="1026" /> very desirable.  However, if you have not the money to buy a new television set or washing machine you do without.  The State did not adopt that household principle, which is the fundamental reason for our having got into such a mess over the past couple of years.  All the public services are necessary and very desirable but we could not afford that level.  I wish to see this Government continuing on their present course, so that eventually there will be no current deficit at all.  That will take further drastic action, but I think we are on course to do that.  There was a good reason for trying out having a current budget deficit, but it continued apace and became a standard feature of economic life.  We must reverse that thinking.</P>
    <P>There were many irresponsible comments made during the last three or four months of last year by politicians and others.  The new &ldquo;in&rdquo; expression was &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo;.  Other parties, particularly the Progressive Democrats, spoke much about tax reform in the last couple of months but all they meant fundamentally was tax reduction.  That was grossly irresponsible. We cannot yet start thinking about things like that, about reducing the top rate of 58 per cent to 40 per cent and the standard rate down to 25 per cent or whatever.  We have been down that road before.  One can make a mistake once, which is hard luck, but to repeat the mistake would be grossly irresponsible and criminally negligent.  The Irish people, and particularly certain sectors of them such as the poor and underprivileged have suffered hardship as a result of some measures taken in the past couple of years.  It was not the poor and underprivileged who caused the present crisis.  Now that we are coming to a semblance of reality and are half way down the road to solving the problem, would it not be justice, if there were any surplus funds, to direct those funds to the poor and underprivileged?  Surely it would be morally reprehensible to give tax cuts to the taxpayers in the highest bands in the land &mdash; although we would all love the highest tax band to be 50 per cent or 40 per cent &mdash; after all this hardship suffered by those in the lower income brackets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> We tried the economic theory in 1977 of giving tax cuts.  We abolished car tax and we gave other reliefs at that time. That policy had a short term impetus on employment but in the long term, although it did create jobs, it did not create them in Ireland.  They were created in Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere. We ended with a massive debt and increasing costs of public services and we are now trying to get out of that dilemma. There was talk over recent months about heading along that road again but the evidence is there that current budget deficits do not work in Ireland.  In an economy such as that of the United States it can work because of the huge population. It does not work in Ireland because of the Irish propensity to import. If you flood the economy with extra money you will not create more jobs here and will end up having always to have a current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>I am a reasonably fair minded person and I wish to congratulate the Minister on this budget but on another budget at another time I would equally criticise the Minister of the day, if I saw fit to do so, regardless of whether he was a member of my party or of any other. The Minister and the Government were particularly brave to resist the temptation, which must have been great, of further tax cuts.  If Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats are talking to the people about reducing taxes that is very attractive, particularly electorally attractive. I have had enough experience from 12 years as a Member of Parliament to know that if things are electorally attractive, no matter how hard people try to keep the line, it will be broken by the other party.  There has to be a response. The middle class and upper classes vote in elections but the poor do not vote in such great numbers.  That still does not lessen the validity of their case.  All the tax cuts given in 1977 did not do the poor any good.  They do not have cars and did not have cars then, either.  Tax cuts are no good to them because they do not have jobs.  The temptation must have been immense for the Government to go off <Col N="1028" /> on a spree again and end up in the same net.</P>
    <P>As I have been saying for many years, Irish politicians are slower than the public.  The Irish people know reality and respect it.  They know if a Government are doing a good job or otherwise.  I have talked about parties throwing money at the electorate.  If I walk along a corridor and find a fiver lying on the floor and there is nobody around, the temptation is to put it in my pocket.  I might take the fiver, but I would know that it did not fall from heaven.  The electorate will take all the goodies that politicians throw them at election time, but they know that the day of reckoning must come.  Opinion polls have proved that where measures have been harsh and much criticised people admire the Government for doing the right thing.  That should be a lesson for all future Governments.</P>
    <P>To come back to tax reform, that is not what has been spoken about in the past, but tax reduction.  Tax reform is very difficult to bring about.  It is like being against sin but just not now, Lord.  Let us take the example of the children's allowance.  The Minister in his budget speech said that the Government were thinking, perhaps next year, of restricting children's allowance in some form for the higher income groups in our society. What happened overnight?  There was the greatest hullabaloo about it.  I do not like anyone to impugn my motives, so I will not impugn anyone's motives.  There must be only a very small minority of Deputies who would not agree that the Minister was right.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred this morning to what Deputy Desmond said many years ago about the immense pressure from political parties when any topic of this type is mentioned.  It is absolutely ridiculous that the wives of people in the higher echelons of income earners receive children's allowance.  I do not care whether that vexes or pleases the ladies in my constituency.  It is the plain truth.  There are many ways of tackling it.  Perhaps the husband might be taxed and a corresponding tax relief might be <Col N="1029" /> given at lower income levels.  Other Government Ministers have talked about monstrous thresholds for the cut off point.  The Minister's idea is a good one and the principle is certainly right.  All Deputies, with the exception of one or two, must agree, although they may not be prepared to admit it.</P>
    <P>I should not like members of the Government to raise the threshold any higher because if they keep going as they are only Michael Smurfitt and Tony Ryan and a few others will not be eligible for children's allowance.  The threshold should be set at a realistic level.  The figure of £30,000 has been mentioned but I believe it should be far lower.  Perhaps the Minister will consider taxing the husband and consider introducing a tax free allowance for low income earners. Taxing children's allowance or stopping the payment of it to certain people is not a radical step.  Any really radical proposal would cause a great hullabaloo on all sides of the House and pressure groups would be formed to resist it.  Despite all the talk about tax reform, it would take a very brave Government and a brave Minister for Finance to do anything about it.  The political pressure would be intense.</P>
    <P>I welcome the social welfare provisions, which represent an attempt to target the real poor in society.  One problem is that the differential between income from work and income from social welfare is so small.  It is not that social welfare rates are too high.  An example will make the point.  A person could earn a gross income of £200 per week and have a take home pay of £140. The cost to the employer is 12½ per cent of the gross salary, giving a figure of £224. Taxation is taken by the Government to pay for the problems we created in the past.  We must conquer those problems by reducing the national debt to a realistic level.  This Government have adopted the right approach.  There is no option but to tackle the debt problem.</P>
    <P>There are two forms of unemployment. In some parts of rural Ireland there are small employers who cannot get people to work for them unless they agree <Col N="1030" /> not to stop PAYE and PRSI.  These people want to collect the dole at the same time and want the employer to give them money into their hand.  The Department of Social Welfare should expend more resources investigating this practice. Large numbers of people are abusing the system because the differential to which I have referred is so small.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the capital budget.  It has traditionally been believed that £1 million invested in the capital budget will yield a certain number of jobs, but the ratios used in the sixties and seventies are out of date.  The ratio now is a lot less due to technology and lower costs.  People ask why we are not experiencing an increase in jobs since the economy is performing so well and exports are so high.  The same thing happened during the recession in the seventies. Firms who have let people go find when the economy picks up that they can get greater productivity from a lesser number of employees.  There is a considerable time lag before they begin recruiting because they are reluctant to take on extra staff.  This year will see an increase in employment and the Minister's figures may be somewhat conservative with regard to the number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>The large export figures given by many companies are really fictitious.  They are arrived at by what is known as transfer pricing.  There are double taxation agreements with several governments.  Export figures may not correspond with the real level of exports.  The American revenue authorities are trying to take action against some companies.  There is very little the Irish Revenue Commissioners can do about it because they want to increase profits here.  Transfer pricing accounts for part of our export figures and such figures do not represent real export growth.</P>
    <P>Regarding farmer taxation, I must declare a professional interest in that I practise as a chartered accountant with a large number of farming clients.  Anything I say will be seen in that light and it will be said that I am protecting my own interests in that few people will talk themselves out of a job.  In principle, <Col N="1031" /> the Government are correct in what they have said.  The campaign being conducted by the ICMSA is totally irresponsible.  We should learn from experience.  The farmers went to court regarding the payment of rates and the Government had to scrap that system.</P>
    <P>There was such a campaign about sales tax in the late seventies that we had to get rid of it.  We got rid of the notional system.  We had land tax and they wanted to get rid of that.  During my early years in the Dáil in 1978-79 there were major meetings in the party rooms about sales tax.  I and other Deputies played a big part in persuading the then Minister, the late George Colley, to modify the proposals. We eventually did away with it.  I was very outspoken on that issue.  What did it achieve?  It brought 750,000 PAYE workers into the streets and it created an urban-rural divide.</P>
    <P>The urban rural divide was created in regard to tax but the IFA have now put forward realistic proposals to the Government for keeping the accounts system with certain modifications.  The problem is that successive Governments treated farmers as a separate species and said that they could not keep accounts. Many of my clients are farmers and none of them ever had difficulty in keeping records in case they wanted to apply for a grant.  They now know how to live within the system.  The ICSMA represent milk farmers who have done extra-ordinarily well in the past couple of years. Last year the yields were expected to be £42 million but I said they would be considerably greater in 1989 because farm accounts were a year behind.</P>
    <P>Land tax is not income tax.  It would be a great system if an accountant could be taxed on the number of square feet in his office or the carpenter on the number of tools in his box.  If I owed £10,000 in tax, Deputy Nealon owed £5,000 and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, owed £2,000 it would be a grand system if, instead of paying the £10,000 we could divide the full amount by three leaving me to pay £5,500.  However, we must be realistic and have a fair system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> I am not standing up for direct taxation but, if it is to be changed, it should be changed for everyone.  If it is bad for one it should be bad for all.  It would not be morally justifiable to put farmers into a separate category.  The ICMSA are sharpening the urban-rural divide.  Let us give the present system a chance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax amnesty and the Revenue Commissioners have been congratulated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this regard. However, I should like to congratulate the self-employed who paid their taxes. A lot of people went to a considerable amount of trouble and into debt to get their tax affairs up to date.  The compliant taxpayer has paid up but thousands of people are still outside the system and have not paid.  The Revenue Commissioners should devote more of their resources to going after those people.</P>
    <P>The self-assessment system is a great idea and is working quite well but I would have preferred if it did not start until September or October 1989 to give the Revenue Commissioners more power to organise their affairs in such a way that the system would be more streamlined.  I will refer to this again in the debate on the Finance Bill.  However, the self-assessment system will not work effectively unless there is a single basis of assessment.  A person who has a shop or a small business may want to pay his taxes on time but if his wife has a job he has to wait until he gets her P60 after 5 April of the relevant year before he can fully assess what he owes.  That will slow down the system.  The Minister said that a working party will be set up to examine the whole matter, which is very welcome. It would help the system if, before next year, the Revenue Commissioners and the experts in the Department of Finance can arrive at a proper system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decrease in the standard rate of 35 per cent and in the top rate of 58 per cent.  I am glad that the Government did not lower the top rate to 50 per cent because that would have been very unjust.</P>
    <P>The only areas in which we can have tax reform are property and capital taxation. That brings us to the question of <Col N="1033" /> local authorities and local property taxation. I am on record as saying that we might as well do away with local authorities, as we should have done in 1977. There was nothing wrong in abolishing rates at that time but it was criminally irresponible not to replace them with something else.  Since then every Government have funked the issue.  I was glad to see in the magazine <i>Aspect</i> that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, is set to tackle the issue.  He might as well be straight with the people and tell them that if they want proper local authorities and funding there must be property taxation.  I wish the Minister the best of luck getting such legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government must take their courage in their hands and do something about the problem.  I wish the Minister well in his appointment.  The Government have done an excellent job and most people recognise that.  If I did not think they were doing things properly, I would have no hesitation in criticising them.  I wish them continued success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a budget of missed opportunities.  For the first time in perhaps 15 to 20 years the Minister for Finance found himself in a relatively good and favourable budgetary situation.  This is because Fianna Fáil in Government took on the policies of Fine Gael, jettisoned their own election policies and pursued ours without attribution or praise.  Never mind, they worked because they were the correct policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true that the Minister found himself in this good budgetary situation because the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Dukes, turned his back on sterile Fianna Fáil type opposition and gave the Government his broad support in the national interest.  With everything going for him the Minister failed miserably to bring in an imaginative innovative budget.  In particular, he failed to put anything worth while in place to tackle our major problems of unemployment, emigration and poverty.  He came to the budget with the yearly average of 243,000 <Col N="1034" /> people unemployed and an unquantified figure as far as emigration is concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the methods of calculating emigration &mdash; a crude way but probably the only one we have &mdash; is to check the inflow of people at sea ports and airports against the outflow.  Based on this method of calculation the figure for 1987 was 30,000, which many people accept as the average for emigration.  According to figures given in this House a short while ago, the figure for 1988 was 73,000.  I wonder if this means the true emigration figure is 73,000.  If so, it is a staggering figure. Aware of the number of departures from Counties Sligo and Leitrim I believe that the actual figure for 1988 is somewhere approaching 70,000.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the level of emigration is worse when broken down by district electoral area.  In the fifties the worst affected area was from Kilkelly in County Mayo, through the area around Knock Airport, Charlestown, my native place of Aclare, Tubbercurry, Ballymote and into County Leitrim across the mountains.  Deputies may be interested to know that the breakdown by district electoral area was done by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  It showed that this area lost more of its population during that period than any other part of the country.  I fear the same is happening again.</P>
    <P>Recently at two branch meetings we went through the draft electoral register drawn up in November last, and found that 70 people, young people mostly and some not so young, had left and are now in Britain or America.  There may be a political plus there for the Government in so far as those people who have been forced to leave the country, most of whom are highly educated, might not totally agree that the Government are pursuing the right policies at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about sections of our policies and about what the Government have left out.  I will elaborate later on on how the Government <Col N="1035" /> have failed to tackle unemployment and emigration.  There is nothing in this budget to make one believe things will be better in a year's time.  The Minister was too diffuse.  He tried to travel a little down the road with everyone and ended up going nowhere, satisfying no one fully.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the budget was skilfully packaged, garnished if you like and the presentation was excellent, it is now emerging that what we had on budget day was a very big illusion.  An example of this was the announcement in the Budget Statement, to the applause of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, of a three year programme costing £150 million, to improve county and regional roads.  As far as the Fianna Fáil backbenchers were concerned, this was great stuff.  Finally we would see the elimination of Deputy Pádraig Flynn's potholes around the country.  The Minister gave a great performance on precisely the same lines the next morning on Radio Éireann, but on closer analysis we find this was no big deal.  For the first year of the plan, £47 million will be made available but when we examine the figures we see that that figure included £37 million already allocated to the local authorities in the Estimates. In the Principal Features of the Budget it was quite clear that only an extra £10 million was being made available to 27 county councils, and perhaps to other local authorities also.  We could easily use all this money and still not fill all the potholes in Counties Sligo and Leitrim.  The budget was very big on presentation but short on substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also looked in vain for funding to build local authority houses.  This is becoming a serious issue at this stage. Effectively, the Minister for the Environment has managed to do what no cement strike ever did &mdash; he has brought the entire local authority house building programme to a standstill.  As I ascertained from a reply to a question I put to the Minister in this House last year, only two housing schemes of more than five houses were started in the country &mdash; one in Ardee consisting of 15 houses, and one for itinerants in Dublin consisting of ten <Col N="1036" /> houses.  All other schemes commenced were of less than five houses or the isolated SI cottages.  Unfortunately, because of this, house waiting lists which had virtually been wiped out during the term of office of the Coalition Government are once more beginning to lengthen.</P>
    <P>When I first became a Dáil Deputy in 1981 a substantial percentage of the cases I dealt with in my clinic related to housing problems particularly in the Sligo Corporation area and to a lesser extent in the Sligo County Council area but thanks to the good work done by the Coalition Government and previous Governments, we had effectively solved this problem. Towards the end of the term of office of the Coalition Government very few of the cases I dealt with in my clinic related to housing problems.  In the Sligo County Council area this problem had been eliminated altogether and in the Sligo Corporation area the problem was not too bad.  Now the waiting list in the Sligo Corporation area has increased to 300, but despite this for the past two years sanction for a housing scheme at Magheraboy, County Sligo, has been refused by the Government.  Even if sanction for this scheme was granted in the morning, the waiting list in the Sligo Corporation area, a relatively small borough, would increase to about 500 before the first of those houses was ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with some of the issues which specifically affect County Sligo and the north-west area.  The leader of my party, Deputy Dukes and my party's spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan, have dealt with the broad canvas but it is important that people be made aware of what is happening in the areas where the budget has failed.  One area which has not been tackled in the budget is the dental service, particularly as it affects adult medical card holders.  Even the Minister for Health, who has made his reputation by cuts and closures, has expressed concern about the non-existence or the collapse of the dental service. Fair play, he set up a special committee under his Minister of State to look into this.  We could tell him without having to set up any special committees what is <Col N="1037" /> happening in the North-Western Health Board area, which is not as badly hit as other areas, because it has been brilliantly administered and therefore was better able to buffet the cuts better than some of the other health board areas, and it had not built up big debts in the past.</P>
    <P>Let me give one very simple example. Five hundred people in the North Western Health Board area had their teeth extracted on the promise that they would get dentures.  Suddenly, the free denture scheme was cut out.  They have been told there is no scheme in place and the health board do not know when it will be replaced.  Many people were of the opinion, particularly those employed in the dental service in the Department of Health, that £2 million would be provided in the budget for health boards to tackle problems like this.  At present the only service available for adult medical card-holders is that they can have a tooth pulled but only if they are in extreme pain and hopping off the chair, but nothing more.</P>
    <P>The Government have diverted whatever meagre funds the health boards had &mdash; and this is possibly a good idea &mdash; towards child care and to looking after school children.  Even in respect of this group, there is a waiting list of over 5,000. As I said, this health board area is particularly efficiently run, and I am sure the problem is worse in other health board areas.  There was an expectation that this budget would make money available for this purpose.  It is only fair to say that the Minister for Health has recognised this problem.  Why this expectation was not realised I do not know.  I believe it came as quite a shock within the Department when this money was not available.  I hope some way can be found to make that money available, perhaps by some savings elsewhere.  The service has virtually collapsed.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Education is here.  I am sure she was also a little disappointed.  In answer to a question from me she explained that there is a shortfall of £5 million or £6 million so far as the school bus service is concerned. According to her answer to me, she had <Col N="1038" /> no plans for either increasing the charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or cutting out any of the services.  I am sure she will explain afterwards where the extra money is to come from.  It was not in the budget.  I thought it might be there.  The Minister may have thought so, too.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The farmers are very disappointed with the budget and with what was on offer.  They had a promise of a restoration of the flat rate VAT refund up to 2.4 per cent, but the Minister failed to deliver.  As in the rest of the budget he went a little bit along the way and brought it up to 2 per cent but the end result I suppose was consistent.  The Government reneged on another promise and £40 million was lost so far as the farmers were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a number of anomalies that I thought might be tackled in the budget. For instance, there are 32,000 farmers aged between 56 and 66 who are still obliged to pay PRSI this year and in the following years &mdash; this year at 4 per cent &mdash; for no benefits at all and for no returns. I thought the Minister on this occasion might have wisely considered the possibility of giving a <i>pro rata</i> pension and <i>pro rata</i> benefits for the people who perhaps will have been in the scheme for nine years and still get no benefit, or that he might have considered allowing farmers to buy themselves into the scheme otherwise. A substantial amount of money is involved for anyone paying tax.  It is £208 PRSI for farmers and for those outside the tax regime earning more than £2,500 it is £104.  I am also worried to discover that those people who are paying in and who will not qualify for a contributory pension will not get their money back if at the end of the day they get a non-contributory pension.  It is the first example we have of people contributing very <Col N="1039" /> substantially to a non-contributory pension. That anomaly must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Farmers are often accused of seeking preferential treatment so far as tax is concerned.  Deputy McCreevy has outlined what the situation was in the past and some of the difficulties that arose from it in regard to country and urban divide.  Now a farmer and his wife on the same level of income as a PAYE worker and his wife have a smaller allowance, to the extent of £2,172.  This is made up of the additional £800 PAYE and the extra PRSI.  I have not read out the table for the new levels of taxation, but at the present levels at the lower band of 35 per cent it will cost the couple £743, at the 48 per cent band £1,060 and at the 58 per cent band £1,260.  The farmers have a legitimate grievance in that case.</P>
    <P>A contribution of £20,000 is made to Teagasc for research into the area of twinning.  That means £20 is the allocation to farmers looking after 1,000 cows.  That is a derisory grant to give even in a research project just starting off. The Minister might have done something overall for Teagasc which is headed by Joe Rea.  We had built up an excellent advisory service through the Agricultural Institute and ACOT but it is in chaos at the moment and breaking apart.  An extra £3 million or £4 million later on would make a major difference in that regard.  I understand most senior people are taking redundancy and the difficulty is that those left behind lack direction to a certain extent and Teagasc are being denuded of some of their best activists.  Our advisory service people, some of them taking redundancy, are being sold abroad all over the world because of the reputation they have built up here.</P>
    <P>The west is totally bereft of any branch of agricultural research.  Ballinamore, where they were doing work unique in the world on that drumlin land, is closed down as far as research is concerned.  It is known now as a transmission farm, whatever that means.  The real strong arm of research has gone from Belclare and Creagh also and the result is that the <Col N="1040" /> entire west where such excellent research work was being done particularly on drainage, and on sheep in Mayo, is desolate. Drainage is terribly important in the west and it is for young farmers the only way they can improve their land and increase productivity.  It is a very severe blow for them that the only research station specifically applying to their type of problems and doing work which has been acclaimed all over the world &mdash; and regrettably used in other parts like Fermanagh and Tyrone much more extensively than it is used down South &mdash; is no more.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to refer in passing to something that is not specifically a budget matter.  All the setbacks of the lack of any action in the budget were small compared with what I would regard as the betrayal of the farmers by the Minister on the beef intervention issue in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The climate of opinion was right in this budget and the budgetary position was right for taking significant action to tackle poverty and the poverty trap.  Again we look in vain for any good, planned programme in this direction.  Of course the Minister did a number of things which are welcome but, typical of all other acts in the context of this budget, they lacked any decisive thrust.  There was no radical approach when a decisive thrust and radical approach were called for.  You do not remove someone from below the poverty line by giving that person £1.50 or £1.70. The Minister's major failure was in producing a recognisable programme to tackle unemployment.  Last year 20,000 jobs were created; on the other hand we lost 23,000 through redundancy and closures, a net loss of 3,000.  We also had emigration reaching perhaps 60,000 or 70,000.  There is really nothing in this budget to suggest things will be any better this time next year.  The Minister had an opportunity to write himself into history. He should have outlined some general thinking towards a guaranteed basic income.  He failed to deliver or even to address himself to that possibility.  He did not make even a gesture there.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his younger days, ran a <Col N="1041" /> celebrated ballroom called &ldquo;Dreamland&rdquo; of which I was a sometime patron.  He has come a long way since then but he is still stuck in the land of illusions if he thinks that the budget he has produced is the response needed today, with the wind in his back, to tackle the major problems of poverty, unemployment and emigration.  I would describe it as a great opportunity lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  When Fianna Fáil assumed office in 1987 we were faced with a drastic economic and financial crisis.  The current budget deficit for 1986 stood at an all-time high of 8.5 per cent and the EBR was high at £2,145 million, representing 13 per cent of GNP.  The nation was faced with serious problems and found itself in a veritable disastrous situation with unemployment rising and, most of all, morale very low and people discouraged.  The economy was set on a downward spiral and it seemed that it would be like that for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On taking office Fianna Fáil set themselves the task of restoring confidence in their ability to manage the economy. Immediate priorities and targets were to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio by reducing the annual EBR to between 5 and 7 per cent and to create an environment which would encourage investment geared to productive economic growth and job creation.  We adopted those policies and implemented them in 1987 and 1988 with great success.  It has been recognised by all parties and commentators that the economy has been given a new sense of direction. Exchequer borrowing as a percentage of GNP is targeted to be 5.3 per cent in 1989, the lowest in many years.  Overdraft <Col N="1042" /> rates have fallen since March 1987 by 6 per cent approximately, inflation, now at 2 per cent approximately, is the lowest for 20 years.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Irish economy is illustrated by the fact that in 1988, despite successive rises in British interest rates resulting eventually in a 5 per cent gap between the UK and this country, our interest rates had remained steady.</P>
    <P>In March 1987, and again in January 1988, it was stated by many economic forecasters that future prospects were bleak, that Government targets would not be met and that there could be zero or negative economic growth.  It is now clearly evident to all and sundry that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, prepared by the social partners and the strategies designed to implement it have enabled Government financial and economic targets to be met and, as the Taoiseach said this morning, to be ahead of target in some respects.</P>
    <P>In 1987, and again in 1988, our competitiveness in the international market places showed great improvement.  Our exports rose in 1987 and we expect them to reach an all-time high in 1989.  Indeed, for the first time in more than 20 years we are likely to have a trade surplus with the UK.  Outside the UK, Germany remains our biggest trading partner accounting for some 11 per cent of our exports while exports to France will exceed £1 billion for the first time.  In order to maintain and improve our competitiveness we must still adhere strictly to the financial and economic policies laid down by the Government.  We must continue to reduce our dependency on borrowing, otherwise we will be living in a land of illusion.  Currently the national debt is £24.5 billion approximately and it costs £2.14 billion annually to service it. More than £2 billion, or more than 10 per cent of GNP, will go to creditors to service the national debt.  My Department, or any Department, could do a lot with that money.  It is still necessary to control and reduce Exchequer spending and borrowing, and to reduce the public sector pay bill despite the progress we have already made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> We must ensure that our limited resources are used in the most effective way to continue to generate economic growth and development.  By so doing we can increase employment opportunities. The recent labour force survey showed that total employment between April 1987 and April 1988 increased by 6,000 a modest figure but an increase, and the target for 1988 in job creation in manufacturing and international services has been met.  Further improvement in this area will occur as a result of measures taken in this budget.  The measures announced will continue and intensify job creation in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and build on the progress made during the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is now in a relatively sound position to adapt and prepare for the opportunities that the Single European Market will offer.  The initiatives which the Government are taking &mdash; some of which have been outlined by the Minister for Finance in his budget address &mdash; will encourage the private sector to increase the volume and value of their exports and will encourage further investment and job creation.  The Government intend to utilise the full amount of the EC Structural Funds available to Ireland to prepare for 1992 and beyond.  It will encourage the private sector to participate in developing necessary infrastructural projects which will attract EC funds and generate employment.</P>
    <P>The net budget allocation for the four Education votes is £1,172.174 million. This is an increase of £3.039 million on the net allocation made for 1989 in the abridged Estimates volume published in October 1988 and corresponds to an increase of 5.2 per cent on the provisional 1988 outturn of £1,114.406 million.</P>
    <P>As already stated by the Minister for Finance, the Government are making an additional £1.5 million available to provide an increase of over 10 per cent in the capitation grant payable towards the running costs of national schools.  This will allow the rate per pupil to be increased from £24 to £26.50.  I am also providing an allocation of £0.5 million for <Col N="1044" /> two special initiatives in the post-primary sector in the areas of modern languages and in-service teacher training.</P>
    <P>For some time Deputies, leaders of industry, parents and I have expressed concern about the general position in regard to the teaching of modern languages in our second level schools.  While French is widely available and taken by many pupils, only a small number of schools offer German or another modern language such as Spanish or Italian.  The position of modern European languages in the school curriculum, in particular German, Spanish and Italian must be strengthened if the opportunities which are opening up with the completion of the internal European market in 1992 are to be maximised for Ireland's benefit. The allocation which I intend announcing shortly will go a long way to match the European funds expected for this programme. To encourage schools to offer and pupils to participate in approved language programmes in German, Spanish or Italian my Department will sanction in certain circumstances the necessary part-time teaching hours to cater for the subject.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment I have announced a new junior certificate to replace the Group and Intermediate Certificates and approved the introduction of new syllabuses in (i) Gaeilge, (ii) English, (iii) Art, Craft and Design, (iv) Business Studies, (v) Geography, (vi) History and (vii) Science into the junior cycle programme in second level schools with effect from September 1989.  I am also making provision for the introduction of a pilot project in technology in a selected number of schools.</P>
    <P>In order that schools and pupils will be able to derive the maximum benefits from these major curricular initiatives, I have arranged for the implementation of a comprehensive in-service teacher training programme.  As part of this programme some 15,000 teachers will be attending one-day in-service courses during February and March.  These courses for post-primary teachers are <Col N="1045" /> being organised on a regional basis and the scale of the operation is unprecedented. Management of schools, teacher and parent interests have welcomed this initiative which is being organised by my Department in association with the NCCA.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our education system, which has served this country well throughout the past decades, continues to meet the needs of our young people and to prepare them to live full and complete lives in a world subject to rapid technological, economic and social changes.</P>
    <P>While education must have its own aims, objectives and concerns and must be true to its commitment to the full personal development of the individual, it must be influenced by the external economic forces and its programmes must be relevant to the needs of society. Indeed, the successful integration of its societal concerns with its concern for the needs of the individual is at the core of a good system of education.  In practice, a school must foster the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential to active participation by each individual in society, but also it must have the motivations, aspirations and concerns of individuals in a central place in its curriculum.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in a world which is marked by unprecedented change, and by not a little uncertainty, a system of education must be able to provide a sense of continuity with the past and seek to uphold all that is worthwhile and of value within the culture of which it is a part.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the great progress being made in the reform of both the primary curriculum by the Primary Curriculum Review Body and the post-primary curriculum by the NCCA.  Their efforts will result in time in curricula that will be broad and well balanced and designed to meet the needs of all our children and will prepare them to attain personal fulfilment in tomorrow's world.</P>
    <P>The overall provision for remedial education in post-primary schools has been maintained and, with regard to areas of disadvantage, special attention is paid to the needs of pupils in such areas.  There <Col N="1046" /> has been no reduction in the number of additional posts for remedial education in the post-primary sector and the in-service training for teachers working in this area continues to be provided and supports them in their important work.</P>
    <P>In the related area of provision for the mildly mentally handicapped my aim is to ensure continuity of provision between post-primary and primary schools.  We have 30 centres now where there is provision for the mildly mentally handicapped at post-primary level.  This is of particular help in disadvantaged areas where such young people could be especially vulnerable.  I plan to continue to improve this provision.  These and various other improvements which I am introducing are part of the Government's continuing efforts to pay special attention to the needs of those who do not appear to benefit fully from our system of education, excellent though it may be in so many respects.  The entire well-being of our community is enhanced by a caring and effective improvement in the quality and level of educational provision for those who need it most.</P>
    <P>A provision of £661,000 has been allocated for computerisation in 1989 which includes provision for the acquisition of hardware and software for the development of a computerised examination system in Athlone.  The computerisation project will be phased over the period 1989-1991 with the first phase of the project being completed for the June 1989 examinations.  The completion of this phase will enable the computerised production of provisional statements of results, candidates' certificates, computer readable data for external agencies, and examination statistics.</P>
    <P>In the last two decades there has been quite a phenomenal growth in the number of young people receiving full-time education.  In 1967-68 there were approximately 700,000 persons receiving full-time education whereas 20 years later in 1987-88 the number had increased to approximately 975,000 &mdash; corresponding to an increase of some 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Growth in the post-primary sector has been very impressive.  In 1967-68 there <Col N="1047" /> were some 170,000 pupils enrolled at post-primary schools whereas in 1987-88 there were 340,000 pupils, approximately corresponding to a 100 per cent increase. The increase in the third level sector has been more rapid and striking.  The enrolment figure in this sector increased from 21,700 students approximately in full-time education to some 59,000 students, which corresponds to an increase in excess of 170 per cent.</P>
    <P>I apologise if some people find figures and statistics boring, but it is salutary to note the huge demands that have been made on the country and on the people through the taxation system.  All Governments have responded enthusiastically to the willingness of the people to pay tax especially for education.  The proof of it is in the increasing numbers of students. It is salutary to reflect back on it now because we are at a transition period in enrolment patterns.</P>
    <P>Up to 1967-68 outside of Dublin there was very little available in the third level non-university sector.  The full-time enrolment in 1967-68 in the vocational third level sector was only 969 students, whereas the current enrolment is over 23,000.</P>
    <P>The expansions in the post-primary and third level education sectors were due to the policies of successive Fianna Fáil and other Governments &mdash; policies such as the introduction of the free post-primary scheme, the provision of school transport services and the establishment of a network of regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>We have all believed in the effectiveness of education as an instrument of social and economic progress.  Increased participation in post-compulsory schooling is the most effective way for the disadvantaged and underprivileged groups to improve their economic prospects.</P>
    <P>The enrolment data which I have given above are positive and unambiguous indicators that the education system has developed and expanded significantly during the last two decades.  It has resulted in much increased costs to the Exchequer.  In 1967-68 the expenditure <Col N="1048" /> by the Exchequer on education was only 4 per cent approximately of GNP.  Twenty years later some 6 per cent of GNP is allocated for expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>Demographic projections indicate that there will be significant changes in enrolment patterns in the education system in the years ahead.  Enrolments at primary level will fall by over 120,000 pupils to below 450,000 by the end of this century. Enrolments at second level are expected to drop by some 36,000 pupils.  However, the demand for third level places will continue to rise, albeit at a more modest pace and the enrolment of full-time students is expected to be over 64,000 by the year 2,000.</P>
    <P>The third level education sector has experienced significant changes in recent years.  Outputs have increased and there has been substantial gains in productivity. Following on a Government decision, my Department established a committee in February 1988 to examine third level courses in VEC colleges to examine the objectives, nature and duration of courses, to examine the cost effectiveness of provision and to indicate the savings that could be made and/or the additional students that could be accommodated.  I look forward to receiving the report from this committee within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The work of the Interdepartmental Committee on Third Level Education in examining the provision of third-level places and the rationalisation of third level departments is still proceeding.  I hope to have their report by the end of March.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Government's decision announced earlier this month, to grant independent university status to the National Institutes for Higher Education at Dublin and Limerick, I propose to bring forward the necessary amending legislation at the earliest possible time. At the same time I hope to bring forward legislation dealing with the granting of more autonomy to the regional technical colleges and the emergence of more VEC committees.</P>
    <P>The NIHEs have played their part in producing well qualified personnel at <Col N="1049" /> graduate and post-graduate level in a range of disciplines that are particularly suited to the emerging needs of our country. They have introduced a new dimension in third level education by innovative and creative methods and have contributed in no small way through their postgraduate programmes and through the quality of their graduates, to economic development.  They have both been directly and indirectly responsible for a diverse range of new enterprises which has been attracted to this country or has been created by their graduates.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the very generous endorsement by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education of the granting of university status to the NIHEs.  The spokesperson has very willingly expressed co-operation in the House in the swift passage of the legislation when it is introduced.</P>
    <P>There is now a network of third level institutions, some of which have extension centres, which provide a comprehensive range of quality programmes. Due to the extent of the State's investment in physical facilities in this sector there is now a high regard at home and abroad for the quality and nature of programmes provided in these institutions and for the calibre, expertise and skills of their graduates.  Foreign investment capital so essential for our economic development is attracted to this country because of the basic skills and flexibility of the young graduates of the institutions.</P>
    <P>The VEC colleges and their staffs have been very successful in developing courses and programmes in engineering, science, business studies and other specialisms which are geared specifically to our country's regional and national needs.  By so doing they have succeeded in giving third level education to an increasing number of our young people. In fact the number of full time students in the colleges has grown from just over 19,000 in 1986 to over 23,000 in the current session representing an increase of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>My Department, in association with EOLAS, have recently created posts of <Col N="1050" /> industrial liaison officer in the regional technical colleges in Athlone, Carlow, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
    <P>My Department are also co-operating with County Donegal, County Louth and the Town of Sligo VECs in the establishment of business incubator units at their regional technical colleges in Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  The units are being built by the IDA with funds received from the International Fund for Ireland.  Approval has been given for the establishment of incubator units at Tralee RTC.  These units are being funded by the IDA, Tralee Chamber of Commerce and local industrialists.  They will enable the testing and development of new business ideas and stimulate employment.  In addition, they will promote greater links between local industries and the educational system.  Other proposals and initiatives in this area are being considered by my Department, EOLAS and other agencies, including a proposal for a Polymer Technology Unit for the Athlone Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>A number of new challenges and opportunities must be faced by our third level institutions over the next few years. As we approach 1992 real challenges and great opportunities exist in the field of education.  In order to ensure that the education system will be equipped and prepared to make a full contribution towards the country's economic development I have submitted comprehensive proposals, within the framework of the national plan being prepared for submission to the Commission of the European Communities, for support from the reformed Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In the changing climate where higher education institutions are becoming more outward looking and responsive to social and economic demands current funding arrangements and financial controls may be perceived by some as being over restrictive.  If they are to expand their activities and generate additional income new funding arrangements to permit them to benefit from their initiatives may be appropriate.  Assuming a suitable mechanism can be devised and agreed <Col N="1051" /> this could include greater freedom to the institutions in managing their activities and resources, subject, of course, to the necessary policy safeguards.</P>
    <P>In addition, another significant change that could occur would be for institutions to become more involved in international education and consultancies.</P>
    <P>In 1967-68 girls comprised 51 per cent of all pupils enrolled in post-primary education and 20 years later the sex composition at post-primary remains virtually unchanged.  However there has been a marked change in the third level sector in the same period.  The proportion of young women in universities increased from 31.1 per cent to 48.9 per cent and in the total third level sector from 31.1 per cent to 45.7 per cent.  There are also more young women than young men who, on completion of post-primary education, commence training outside of my Department's higher education system, for example, training as nurses or for clerical occupations.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless despite the general high level of education of young women and the existence of legislation establishing the right of equal opportunities for both men and women not many major changes have occurred in their career choices.</P>
    <P>In post-compulsory secondary education and especially in higher education the choice of subjects is still largely influenced by stereotyped attitudes.  Arts and education tend to have high percentages of female students whereas engineering, agricultural science and technology programmes are male dominated.</P>
    <P>Women are also very much under represented on the staffs of third level education institutions.  A study by a committee established by the HEA on women academics in Ireland which was published in June 1987 showed that only 14.5 per cent of the academic staff in Irish universities were women and that the majority of these were in junior grades.</P>
    <P>The committee indicated that there was no evidence of discriminatory rules and procedures and considered that significant factors were the lower number of <Col N="1052" /> women than men who register for post-graduate degrees and who go abroad for further study.  The tendencies for women to be less well qualified than men and to produce fewer publications were also considered relevant factors.</P>
    <P>What happens in higher education tends to be a reflection of what occurs in society.  The narrow range of career choices and occupations for women have an impact on their earnings potential. The average weekly wage for adult males in manufacturing industries is over 65 per cent higher than that of adult females. This differential is not due to direct wage discrimination but arises from structural causes.  Many male workers tend to be in technologically skilled occupations with promotional opportunities.</P>
    <P>Gender equality is one of the central objectives of this Government.  My Department are active in developing and implementing strategies to ensure that equal opportunities for girls and boys exist at all levels of the education system and to foster and encourage them to pursue non-traditional career options.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to gender equality continue to be treated at in-service teacher training programmes.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Primary Curriculum Review Body have been requested to ensure that sexism and sex-stereotyping are eliminated from school curricula.</P>
    <P>Following the course set by my predecessor, at primary level I have retained the working party on sexism in teaching materials.  The working party includes representatives from management and teacher interests and the Department of Education.  They will make recommendations on the elimination of sexism in textbooks and other teaching materials on a phased basis, taking due account of the need for restraint in public expenditure, and will monitor progress made in this area.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level I am concerned that, although there are more girls than boys, fewer of them study physics or chemistry in senior cycle and hence find it more difficult to enter highly skilled technical occupations.  A pilot scheme <Col N="1053" /> was started in the school year 1985-86 in one post-primary school &mdash; a salutary proposal &mdash; with the objective of encouraging more girls to study physics.  I have extended the project now to ten schools and to include chemistry.  The total enrolment of girls in these schools is currently 4,800 approximately and there are now 285 girls studying physics or chemistry as a result of this project.  I am hopeful that that project will be diversified and be more extensively used.  I know that Deputy Barnes will be interested to hear that there has been a very good evaluation study undertaken recently by two experts on how this project worked.  The ripple effect it had on schools was amazing, when other young women saw their counterparts taking up those subjects and there was the effect the visiting teacher had on the participants.  It is certainly a worthwhile project which I intend to have continued.  While it might appear to be a small achievement it all fits into the overall pattern of how young women perceive their role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, as every piece fits in.  The EC has recognised the value of this project and will make funds available to meet some of its costs in 1989.  I intend to extend it further in the year 1989-90.</P>
      <P>An action research project was begun by my Department in 1987-88 as part of an EC gender equality initiative.  It is designed to foster and encourage girls in post-primary schools to participate in school activities related to new technologies. I have arranged for this project to operate again in the school year 1988-89 and co-financing will be available from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say, in deference to Deputy Barnes who is chairperson of the Committee on Women's Rights, that when I was on that committee some years ago there was an important study undertaken into education which was debated in the Seanad.  As I understand the position, the Committee on Women's Rights are now <Col N="1054" /> examining what has occurred since the publication of that first report.  I am very interested in that endeavour and my Department will co-operate fully in that work.  I would hope, either at that committee or in a debate in the House, to have an opportunity of participating in the evaluation process, as we in the Department and the committee found it, and in whatever are considered by the committee to constitute forward steps in the education field.  I commend the work of the Committee on Women's Rights.  It is my regret that, when I assumed office, my participation in that work had to cease.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the network of regional third-level educational institutions, all of which can respond in an effective way to regional and national needs and demands.  Apart from the gender equality initiative to which I have referred there is always a demand for general equity and participation in the education system in line with the commitments of the Government outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>In line with those commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and specific grants made available by this Government I might mention the Youthreach scheme, a joint project sponsored by myself and the Minister for Labour which was begun yesterday in two regions, Cork and Waterford and which we hope will help disadvantaged young people who, for one reason or another, find the formal education structure not suitable to their needs.  The cost of the scheme in 1989 is £11.2 million.</P>
    <P>I have run out of time but let me just say that the fiscal, economic and social measures which the Government initiated in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be continued and developed in 1989 as will the measures that I have undertaken and which the brief time allotted to me here today allowed me to dwell upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased and interested to hear of the progress report particularly with regard to equality in education.  I commend the Minister on <Col N="1055" /> her energy and commitment in that area. I also welcome very much the Minister's offer to have a debate in the Chamber about this area because the Women's Rights Committee would like to have a debate activated on all areas of progress in all Departments.  It is disappointing that only the Minister's Department have moved more progressively and more affirmatively than some of the other Departments, but it is important that some of the other Minister's should be here to respond also.  We look forward to inviting the Minister to the launch of the update of our educational report from the previous committee.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on a few other areas of the Minister's address.  I take the point the Minister makes with regard to the large number of pupils from the lower socio-economic groups who drop out of compulsory schooling without gaining any formal qualifications.  A huge investment must be made in that area to provide resources and there must be the political and social will to do that.  It is with some disappointment I note that 16 and 17 year olds outside formal education have not been incorporated into the social welfare system which would give them a base.  I would encourage the Minister to include young people who drop out to be part of alternative education and training that means more to them financially, socially and psychologically when they reach the stage of being in a position to earn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have said this already, but it bears repetition; this year offers us a unique opportunity to do something original, creative and imaginative.  It is necessary to change the structures in a fundamental way as we go forward into an incredibly developing and changing society.  This will take initiative and creativity. Bandaging the wounds resulting from an older social system will not bring about the desirable healthy state we need to be in when we are on the threshold of being integrated into a harmonised Europe.  This has immense challenges for us but it also has huge risks.  It is startling that throughout the whole budget there <Col N="1056" /> is no mention of that nor is there any preparation in regard to excise duties and VAT that we need to look at if we are to cope with 1992 without tremendous trauma and shock and, in fact, loss.  I hope that the next budget will cover what was omitted in this one.  We are running out of time.  It is important for us to remember that we have only three budgets before we have to take our part in a very tough arena.  As committed Europeans we look forward to that but it will take a tremendous amount of preparation and the proper use of the funding and resources we will get from Europe.  That whole dimension was missed in the budget.  I hope it was not neglected.  I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider is that the whole ethic of work as we know it is now at an end.  The changes we must bring about in our system with regard to formal and informal work must be tackled. Again there is no reference to that in the budget.  If we were to begin to build on a foundation that would integrate formal and informal work it would remove the stigma of unemployment and give value to a lot of work that goes on in the community and in the home at the moment which is not financially rewarded but which is important and will take on more importance as the years go by.  This was not even hinted at.  The first basic step is to introduce a basic income.  It is with great disappointment I note that the necessary reforms in taxation and social welfare which would lead towards that integration have not been implemented. Until we have a basic income for everybody above the age of 18 there is no way we will get rid of the wasteful bureaucracy, the immense administration costs, and above all else, the stigmatising of certain kinds of work and jobs and the demarcation lines that we draw.  If we had introduced a basic income we would certainly have avoided the controversy, the anger and frustration of women here, particularly women in the home, at the proposal to remove the only payment, the only acknowledgment given to a mother in the home for child rearing and all the other tasks in the home, without <Col N="1057" /> the introduction of a basic income, without any legislation to ensure that a woman in the home had an automatic and legal right to the household income earned by the other spouse.  It shows no awareness of the huge leap we have to take to prepare ourselves not just for Europe in 1992 but for the year 2000 and all that will bring upon us.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the total lack of recognition and acknowledgment of the position of women in Irish society as we have ghettoised them in the home and outside the job markets or kept them on low pay in employment.  I was struck once again, as I always am when I hear the figure, by the fact that the Minister for Education was able to tell us that the average weekly wage for adult males in manufacturing industries is over 65 per cent higher than that of adult females, and that was 11 to 12 years after we introduced legislation on equal pay. What was lacking in this budget more than anything else was political will, political creativity and, above all, political leadership.  That is what will be needed if we are to have an energetic and equitable society and if we are to remove poverty and inequalities.  It demands leadership backed up with creative and imaginative ideas.</P>
    <P>The Government received submissions from interest groups and a great deal of research proved we had an immense job to tackle.  That could have been done in this budget because the economy is now more favourable than it has been for years and there is consensus and agreed support from this side of the House.  That fact should be recognised.  This side of the House expected that out of that consensus, which at times took some effort on our part, would come a better society, and the removal of some of the poverty traps and the inequalities which affect one-third of our population.  It is with no joy and no party political bias but with sincere disappointment that I say that no real fundamental attempt has been made in this budget to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>Naturally our economy is made up of interlocking and interdependent factors. We must recognise that we face two very <Col N="1058" /> big challenges.  The first is job creation &mdash; which will have very serious implications if we do not do something about it soon &mdash; and the second is that we should have a more equitable tax system where everybody pays their fair share.  There has been no reform in taxation except for a slight alteration in the tax bands.  I welcome the self-assessment for the self-employed. It has been said for many years that there is no money in the country, that there is a very narrow tax base and that there is no room for redistribution or for widening the tax base.  A very heavy burden was placed on the PAYE workers who had to carry the rest of the country.  What happened when we introduced the tax amnesty?  We found that those statements were mythical and that we were part of a selfish society. Until they were offered a bribe to come into the tax net, some people refused to do so.  More than £500 million additional revenue was collected in a country where it was said there was no wealth and not much tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy McCreevy and other Members who stated that we should compliment the decent, honest people who paid tax all along because they felt it was the socially just thing to do, or because it was demanded of them before they ever received the money into their hands. Let us hope they will never have to carry the huge disproportionate burden of taxation they had to carry up to now.  There should be a more equitable system and those who have now come into the tax net should be made to pay a relevant amount in proportion to their wealth.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about basic income and a self-assessment system for years.  This has been discussed at European level and it has been accepted that that is the only way we will have an equitable tax system.  I would like to believe that in the next 12 months before the next budget, much work will be done in that area.  I note that the Minister said that a move to a single year basis of assessment would have implications for taxpayers and their agents and that discussions would be held with interested <Col N="1059" /> groups to explore the possibilities for further development of the self-assessment system.  I would like to think that those discussions would take place before the next budget.</P>
    <P>Taxation is tied up with our ability to create and sustain jobs and to keep our young people working in this country. Until we have an equitable tax system for our young single people in particular &mdash; they are the group who gained least from the minor tax reforms introduced this year &mdash; we will not be able to keep them here.  I have listened to the Minister for Education talking about the demographic changes that have been made and the numbers of people seeking third level education.  The Minister is quite right in recognising and acknowledging that social acceptance that our children should be well educated and the sacrifices parents make to ensure that they are skilled, trained and well educated.  The horror is that, as of now, all our third level students are going to other countries.  I am concerned not so much about the number of young people who have to go abroad for jobs &mdash; some of whom go not because of lack of jobs but because of lack of acknowledgment, lack of value and in particular lack of reward &mdash; but that if our young people do not come back within a certain number of years they will decide to base themselves abroad.  As a result this society will suffer, not just financially but in terms of energy, radicalism and the kind of fervour and independence that young, single people can bring to a country, and without which a society becomes sterile, established and conservative.  This is the last country that deserves that kind of haemorrhage.  We have seen the social implications of the emigration of the fifties.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest job creation areas &mdash; and the Government are quite right to pay attention to it &mdash; is tourism.  The Minister spoke about setting up a tourism data base.  Once again I would ask that every effort be made to target marketing. I am struck again and again &mdash; as I am sure are other Members of this House <Col N="1060" /> who have visited the United States &mdash; by the fact that 40 million Americans are willing to proudly say they are of Irish heritage.  A great number of them, because of their skills, intelligence and hard work, have been very successful.  I do not believe we have ever targeted that market base as we should.  I would urge the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and all the Ministers involved, to insist that all our agencies target the right markets and people who would have an objective in coming here and who would continue to do so.  We have not even begun to scratch the surface of the American market.</P>
    <P>Regarding the environment, I welcome the fact that lead-free petrol did not suffer the price increase of 5p.  It is an initiative whereby the Government can encourage people to protect the environment.  I would like to think there would be more initiatives of this kind for the removal of pollution from the environment.</P>
    <P>In the family area I welcome the fact that the monthly rate of child benefit of £21.75 which is currently payable in respect of the sixth and subsequent children will, from next October, be payable in respect of the fifth and subsequent children.  I do not say this as somebody who believes we should have very large, unplanned families.  Families with that number of children and especially from the fifth child onwards should get special support.  Especially welcome is the initiative and, indeed, it is a long overdue right, that widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children should get the same allowances as widows and deserted wives for bringing up their children.  My only regret is that it is not being introduced until October because some fathers and husbands are now in a very difficult position.  What is more important is that we will encourage more fathers to become full-time parents.</P>
    <P>The weekly child dependant allowances payable in respect of 18 year olds in full-time education will now be payable up to the age of 19.  Having made the break we will have to build on it because people know full-time education does not <Col N="1061" /> end even at 19.  In Germany child allowances are paid up to the age of 27 as long as it can be proved that full-time education is still going on.  That gives one an understanding of the investment there is in other countries in families, in their welfare and in the development of children.</P>
    <P>There has been ignorance about the opposition of women to the threat of having child benefit removed.  For instance, some editorials said that we were attempting to get the State to pay for wives in the home whose husbands defaulted.  We are talking about a children's allowance for the rearing of children and their development within the home.  This benefit is provided at an extraordinary rate in other countries because they found to their cost that by penalising parents for having children, especially mothers, the birth rate dropped to the extent that they are now in grave economic and social danger of not being able to continue their generations. They are now beginning to give incredible financial allowances to parents to encourage them to have larger families.  Because many married women in this country do not work outside the home and because the role of mother and housewife has been imposed so severely and restrictively on them makes it all the more unacceptable and unjustified that we should even have attempted to introduce this.  Having and rearing children is a social function for the whole of society. It is one for which someone should not be penalised but should be rewarded, acknowledged and valued.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have fallen far short of that, as we still have no legal protection for the family home and its contents for women who give up their economic independence and stay in the home.  The very last acknowledgment of independent means, small as it was, is actually being threatened.  Women from all over Ireland have told me that regardless of the income level of their husband, the household budget they get still depends on his generosity and fairness.  The fact that she is living in an affluent area and that her <Col N="1062" /> husband has a high income is no indication that there is a fair distribution of it in the home.  The Government, having learned from this suggestion, should introduce legislation that would legally ensure the proportion of the household budget going to the wife.  Then perhaps some of the male interviewers, the male commentators and the male economists would begin to realise what the women &mdash; and in particular women politicians &mdash; were getting at.  We know from women's expertise the reality of their lives.  I know the Government will be wise enough not to continue down this road until they introduce legislation for a fairer distribution of the household income to the wife and her children.</P>
    <P>The Rape Crisis Centre in Dublin has received £100,000 in this budget which saves them from being liquidated.  I regret what they had to go through in order to obtain this money.  I would remind the House and the public at large that over £90,000 of that £100,000 has to go to Revenue and, therefore, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre have not a secure financial base for 1989.  Before the Minister for Finance frames the Finance Bill I would like to draw his attention and that of the House to the fact that rape crisis centres in large urban areas such as Limerick, Galway and Cork, which are overcrowded and have tremendous needs, as well as smaller rape crisis centres in Navan, Bray and other areas, have been set up on voluntary contributions from women and the community at large.</P>
    <P>I want to serve notice on the Minister for Finance and all Governments that social services of the most demanding professional and urgent kind, such as those provided in rape crisis centres in sex abuse counselling and in women's aid centres cannot be expected to continue on a charitable level, not knowing how they will survive from one month to another, particularly when the people they are counselling and supporting are among the most vulnerable, insecure and damaged in our society.  The political will and attitude towards funding of these organisations has got to change.  We must have core State funding included in their <Col N="1063" /> own subhead in budget after budget.  I would like to think that this is the last budget when we will have this kind of late handout without any reference to the other rape crisis centres and aids throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make some further suggestions.  I started by talking about the enormous importance of Europe, our harmonisation and the challenges and risks we will take as we approach 1992 and 1993.  This Government should realise that the Structural Funds allocated to us must be spent in the most imaginative way in building up secure barriers and bases to allow us to compete in Europe.  Above all those funds must be used in areas where they will give the greatest number of jobs and the most security to the community.  The Structural Funds and the programmes to earn those funds must be drawn up with extensive consultative discussions involving the whole community and particularly the communities they will affect most.</P>
    <P>A reform which is long overdue is that in regard to local authorities, who are teetering on the brink of despair because they have no power.  I would like to think that in reforming our budget expenditure and taxation and in extending the tax base, as we believe it needs to be extended, we would focus on returning budgetary power and autonomy to the regions, to the reformed local authorities, so that the community would have the power restored to them and local representatives would be seen to have the power to work on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, did a tremendous job in framing the budget in the short period he was in the Department of Finance before budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the lead-up to the budget suggestions and ideas were put forward by the Opposition parties, interest groups outside the House and political commentators.  They were all of one mind that something should and would have to <Col N="1064" /> be done about poverty, taxation and job creation proposals.  I am happy to see that the Minister for Finance has set out to tackle those problems.  He has introduced a budget that will give substantial increases to the long term unemployed; there has been major reform of the taxation system and there has been a number of significant job creation proposals.</P>
    <P>In the short period that this Government have been in office, they have succeeded in putting the country on the high road to economic recovery.  Business confidence has been restored.  Interest rates have fallen by up to 6 percentage points. Industrial output and export growth are continuing to be very strong.  The balance of payments remains in surplus and inflation is running at the lowest level for 25 years.  Borrowings have also been reduced substantially.  I am sure that the consensus in this House helped to achieve this but it took great political courage to follow the tough line that has been followed for the past two years to try to restore economic reality in the country.  For too long we had a type of &ldquo;shopping bag politics&rdquo; from different political parties.  That continued for over ten years and landed the country in a mess which was practically impossible to get out of.  However, the Government are on the right road and are doing an excellent job to create a better country for our young people's future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the social welfare measures announced in the budget.  They show that the Government are determined to improve the position of the less well off in our society.  This is the second year in succession that the Government have more than maintained the position of those on social welfare.  Low income families and the long term unemployed will receive substantial increases in income this year.  The personal rate for the long term unemployed is being increased by 12 per cent.  If we add that to the 11 per cent increase of last year, it brings the total increase in little over a year to almost 25 per cent.  In the same period a husband on long term unemployment payments with a dependent wife and five children will receive an extra £26.80 per <Col N="1065" /> week bringing the total, including child benefit, to £145.90.  This year, the Minister has again targeted the low income groups for special attention in the area of taxation.  The introduction of taxation exemption will be of major benefit to the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognise the special difficulties of widowers and deserted husbands on low incomes, and have introduced a special allowance scheme.  The main elements of the social welfare scheme are as follows: a general increase of 3 per cent in social welfare payments &mdash; that is well ahead of inflation which is running at just over 2 per cent and a special increase of £5 per week in the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance bringing the figure from £42 to £47 per week.  This is very welcome because unemployed single people living alone find it very difficult to survive on the small income they had been in receipt of.  They were living way below the rate of subsistence, in poverty. The decision taken by the Minister in both last year's and this year's budget, to increase substantially the payments to those people must be welcomed by all sides of the House.  There is a special increase of £3 per week in the personal rate of allowance for short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget I thought the Minister made a mistake in not introducing a special allowance for widowers and single people trying to rear families.  It is a major departure that this year the Minister introduced such a scheme.  In some cases, such families of three, four or five children were living on a pittance because all they could claim was unemployment assistance.  They were certainly being discriminated against.  I welcome the Minister's decision to make provision for them this year.  This will go some way towards alleviating the kind of poverty and hardship they have experienced over the years.</P>
    <P>The extension of the free fuel scheme to people who are living with others is also very welcome.  Politicians on all sides of the House had been critical of this <Col N="1066" /> scheme.  For example, if an old person was living with some one who was on the dole, they would not be eligible to claim free fuel.  I must pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare for extending the free fuel scheme during the past two years to people in rural areas.  For many years the scheme applied only to people living in urban areas.  The extension of the scheme to other situations, for instance, where a person on social welfare is living with an elderly person, is welcome too.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister examining the possibility of re-introducing a double payment in September or late August.  At that time families incur heavy expenditure when children are returning to school.  There is a lot of expense by way of school uniforms and books.  This puts a major burden on the lower income groups and people on social welfare.  Such a scheme was in operation a number of years ago but it was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The long delay in processing social welfare claims for unemployment assistance is a matter of grave concern.  Every week we have people coming to us and saying that they have claimed unemployment assistance but that they have been waiting 14 or 15 weeks for payments.  I cannot see why it takes so long to make a decision. When we contact the Department of Social Welfare we are told that the application is with the local welfare office but when we go to them we find that they have sent it back to the Department of Social Welfare.  There seems to be to-ing and fro-ing for weeks.  Last year I asked the Minister to take a specific interest in this problem and this year I again asked the Minister for Social Welfare to examine the system to see where it can be speeded up.  When families are waiting for anything up to 15 weeks for social welfare payments, it can only cause hardship and severe poverty.  The Minister should see if serious decisions could be made to minimise the delays down the line.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions that have been made for 18 year olds in full time education.  During the debate on the Estimates, I raised this issue and said it was <Col N="1067" /> totally unfair that families on unemployment assistance would lose the allowance for a child dependant when he reached 18 years.  I am happy that the Minister has decided to extend the scheme.  This will involve a great many children, because most of those who go on to do their leaving certificate or intermediate certificate have usually finished by the time they reach 19 years of age. This will be of major benefit to those families.  There is no doubt that it was causing hardship in trying to look after a son or daughter when there was no income for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to examine the free electricity scheme and have the benefit carried from one billing period to another.  Some old age pensioners, for fear of running out of free units and not being able to pay if they got a big bill, were inclined not to turn on the heating in winter time.  This will be of major benefit to all those in receipt of free electricity.  The Minister for Social Welfare is to be complimented in encouraging the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance to have this inclusion.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement has been mentioned in this House on numerous occasions.  It is true to say that a large number of families do not appear to be availing of this FIS scheme, as it is called. Perhaps they are not aware of it, or feel that they are not entitled to it.  I know from experience meeting people at my clinics and from talking to people that a vast number of people have not claimed this supplement.  There should be a major promotion of this scheme, whether by television, radio or any other means, to encourage people to avail of it.  I am glad that the Minister is carrying out improvements to the scheme for 1989 which will cost £1 million extra.  I am sure he will ensure that those entitled to the scheme will be contacted and their entitlement made known.</P>
    <P>Child benefit has been mentioned.  This has proved to be the major issue.  It shows that this is a very good budget when the only issue that could be picked on is one <Col N="1068" /> that is not included.  Children's allowances, as it is known to most mothers, will always be an emotive and controversial issue.  Politicians will make it emotive and controversial to try to win votes and gain benefits for their political parties or themselves. This has caused a major stir in the newspapers and among commentators around the country.  This is not the first time I have said that there is a genuine need for change in the area of payments of child benefit.  Perhaps a sliding scale of allowances per child based on the income into a house might be possible.  It certainly would be more fair.  I take myself as an example.  We get something in the region of £22,000 or £23,000 per year.  I have four children but I receive the same child benefit as the person on £110 a week unemployment assistance who has four children.  That is an area that should be looked at.  There should be change.  That type of system is unfair and is mitigating against the poorer sections in our community. Over the next six or eight months or before the next budget, there should be open and frank discussion on this whole area from all sides of the House.  I am sure the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet would be prepared to listen to suggestions and ideas and come up with a fairer system which would be based on the amount of income going into the House rather than as at present, right across the board.</P>
    <P>Generally, the social welfare areas in this budget have been well protected. The Minister for Social Welfare has done a good job over the past two years in ensuring that those on social welfare and in receipt of lower income benefits have been protected.  Fianna Fáil Governments have always proved to be caring and I hope that this one will continue where possible to increase the allowances and benefits for those less well off in our society.  The 25 per cent increase for the long term unemployed over the past two years has proved this Government's commitment to these people and I am sure they will continue that commitment in next year's budget and in future Governments in which my party have a say.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The taxation changes are certainly welcome. Many said that the rate of taxation, whether 35 per cent, 48 per cent or 58 per cent, could not be reduced, that the climate was not right and that if any rate of taxation was to be reduced it would be the 58 per cent band.  I welcome the Minister's decision to reduce the 35 per cent band to 32 per cent.  That area covers practically every taxpayer because a certain section of tax is payable at 35 per cent.  Most important, it covers the area of the low paid workers.  For too long the PAYE sector have carried the burden of taxation.  They have been treated unfairly over very many years.  I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet on a change of direction.  Some people may say that it is a small matter but to reduce taxation after 20 years can only be a psychological boost to the PAYE worker.  It proves this Government's commitment to the PAYE sector and to getting the level of taxation down so as to give an incentive to people to work, and an incentive to employers to employ more people.  I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce changes in the taxation system to help those on lower incomes.  He has decided to increase the general exemption limits from £5,500 to £6,000 for married persons and from £2,750 to £3,000 for single persons.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the difficulties faced by lower income families, the Government decided in a major innovation to introduce a special addition of £200 per child into exemption limits.  This will apply to the small farmer, small shopkeeper or PAYE worker.  It is a major move in the right direction, giving an allowance for the child.  It is not right across the board for every child in the country, but it is a start.  It is only fair that families, particularly those on low incomes who have a number of children, would get tax allowance relief for them. This will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on these families and towards restoring the reward for work among parents of such families.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also increased the age exemption limits by £300 for a married couple and £150 for single persons.  The <Col N="1070" /> overall effect of these increases in general, of the age exemption limits and the introduction of the exemption element for children will be to exempt 24,000 taxpayers with 46,000 children from paying tax.  If anyone had said two years ago that any Government would have been capable of doing this, he would have been laughed at.  It shows the sound economic policy that this Government have followed over the past two years is now beginning to show rewards for the people.</P>
    <P>The tax amnesty was mentioned earlier and its introduction was a major move by this Government.  The people responded magnificantly in paying their taxes.  They may have cheated over the years, but at least they responded to the promptings and the initiative of the Government. The amount of money collected as a result has gone a long way towards helping to pay for increases for the less well off.  I hope that those who came into the tax net as a result of the amnesty will continue to pay their taxes and give their fair share towards the general upkeep of the country.  For too long the PAYE sector had carried the burden.  We have the self-employed, farmers, business people all beginning to pay a share of tax. In 1988 the farming sector paid double the amount that had paid in 1987.  If this welcome move continues, it can only help to secure more tax payments from other than the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Another area of major concern is jobs. During the past five or six years we have heard much talk about young people emigrating and what should be done to create jobs.  This budget is designed to create jobs.  During the past year there has been a significant increase in the number of jobs available.  Because of the sound economic policies being pursued by the Government, low interest rates and the improved economic climate, business people and industrialists are beginning to show an interest in creating jobs.  Various initiatives in the area of tourism, forestry, fisheries and the <Col N="1071" /> development of natural resources generally have led to the creation of a significant number of new jobs.  A total of 20,000 extra jobs was created in 1988 and the target for 1989 is an additional 13,000. We can generate an even greater number of jobs if we can persuade business people to co-operate with the Government and show a commitment to what the Government are doing.  I welcome the decision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet industrialists and to encourage them to create more jobs.  I believe there will be a response.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the IDA. Their commitment to County Wexford in the past six or seven years has been an absolute disgrace.  Deputies from all sides have met Pádraic White of the IDA, both in this House and in the plush surroundings of the IDA headquarters.  On the first occasion he agreed that Wexford was a black spot; on the second occasion he agreed that Wexford was a blacker spot; on the last occasion we met him he agreed that Wexford was the blackest spot in the country.  Despite this, we have received no commitment and there is no concern for the unemployed of County Wexford.  The buck stops with Mr. White.</P>

Although 20,000 jobs were created in 1988, only 35 of those were in County Wexford.  That is not a fair distribution.  The county manager has been doing everything possible to improve our infrastructure.  Despite the recognition by the IDA that we have the highest unemployment rate in the country, there is no commitment to job creation in our area.  I ask the new Minister for Industry and Commerce to <Col N="1072" /> redress the situation so that at least we will get a fair share of what is available.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for the Environment on the tenant purchase scheme which has given an opportunity to tenants of local authority houses to purchase their homes at a very much reduced rate.  The take up in Wexford is almost 50 per cent.  This welcome scheme ensures that people can own their own homes and it saves the local authorities vast amounts of money on maintenance and repairs.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about potholes and the general state of county and regional roads.  I welcome the decision to increase substantially the amounts of money available for these roads.  A total of £150 million is being provided for this work over a three-year period and this money should go a long way towards alleviating the major problems we have experienced in recent years.  It indicates the Government's commitment to rural people, who are entitled to the top class roads to be found in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home improvement grants were quite correctly withdrawn two years ago because they were paid to every person regardless of income.  Lots of rich people in my county put in aluminium windows and built unnecessary extensions.  When we came into Government £300 million was due to be paid out in home improvement grants and the Minister took the correct decision to abolish them.  I am sure most of those works have now been completed and I would ask the Minister to consider the reintroduction of these grants on a selective basis for water and sewerage works and possibly for roofing. Old people and the less well off would not be in a position to pay the full amount but possibly could undertake these works <Col N="1073" /> if they received a grant.  This would have the benefit of protecting our housing stock for the future.</P>
    <P>There should also be selective building of local authority houses.  There are many vacant houses in Dublin, Cork and other major cities but there is still a demand in rural areas for small numbers of local authority houses.  This Government have a commitment to the construction industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance should consider the selective building of local authority houses where needed.  The provision of £150 million for county and regional roads and £47 million for national primary roads shows that the Government have a commitment to the construction industry.  These provisions have been welcomed by the CIF.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to consider the reintroduction of home improvement grants and the selective building of local authority houses in areas where they are needed.</P>
      <P>The budget contains an allocation of £14.7 million for the development of tourism.  We have put forward proposals for the development of a marina in Wexford town.  I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that some of the moneys available in the budget will be transferred to Wexford and made available to local authorities there for the building of a marina which will go hand in hand with the development of a new heritage park which cost over £1 million.  I hope when the money is being allocated the Minister will consider Wexford in relation to the development of a marina.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that this Government are an historic one in many respects.  They are a minority administration and have been in office for two years.  For the first time since the foundation of the State we have witnessed the beginning of the breakdown of the traditional Civil War political posturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> We have seen an Opposition party undertake support for a Government no matter what is really happening in Government as long as there is the appearance that policies of fiscal rectitude are being followed. Since the Progressive Democrats were founded, they have been advocating a commonsense approach to a reduction of Government expenditure and an increase in employment.  Other parties have been shamed into supporting these policies even though they lambasted them before the last election.  A radical change has come over the political spectrum which will inexorably continue. There is no going back now to Tweedledum and Tweedledee politics with Labour as piggy in the middle.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are here to stay and will continue to present radical alternatives to the people for Government. The hype that has surrounded the actions of the Government is no more than that, hype.  There have been Ministers brazen enough to announce so-called bonanzas of jobs but, when looked at in detail, they turn out to be a couple of thousand jobs in perhaps as many as 28 locations around the country over as many as five years.  What kind of bonanza is that?  What does the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, consider makes up a jobs bonanza?</P>
    <P>The hype to which I referred also includes Government self-congratulatory speeches and press releases on export figures, for example, which on examination merely throw into stark relief the weakened state of industry, low levels of imports of raw materials for manufacturing industry and low consumer spending which means that the surplus of export figures over imports are artifically at an all time high.  This is not to deny that major strides have been made by Irish industry, especially in the marketing area, which pays off in increased exports. However, the scale of this improvement is nowhere near the level needed if we are to withstand the shock waves of 1992.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing industry is only beginning to wake up to the challenge facing them when we enter a unified market.  The same applies to the services <Col N="1075" /> industry and I lay a lot of blame at the feet of the Government who, since last July when they launched the European campaign, have simply gone to ground. There are reported to be seminars around the country but there are precious few of them and they are not impinging on the real consciousness of business.  There are only three more years &mdash; three more budgets &mdash; until we are a unified market in Europe.  That is a daunting prospect because there is such inactivity on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The hype has been continued into the method of presentation of this budget. We are asked to believe that with unemployment figures of 16.5 per cent of the labour force according to an OECD study, the second highest rate of unemployment in 24 OECD countries, with emigration running at a minimum of 40,000 last year, with whole communities threatened by extinction by the emigration of all their youth, we have pulled out of our problems and that Fianna Fáil have led us out of them.</P>
    <P>The hype has further extended to the state of the national debt problem.  We have also been led to believe that because the current budget deficit has been substantially reduced somehow the debt is under control.  The fact is we still owe £24 billion and the debt is still growing. We will not get it under control until we increase employment substantially and reduce dependence on State services. We can now see that Fianna Fáil's policy cupboard is laid bare.  They are seen to operate on a day to day basis &mdash; a reactionary basis &mdash; and they obviously have not considered the long term strategies open to them or what their next move should be.  They took on board the headlines of the Progressive Democrats' policies since their foundation but they did not know how to read the small print. They do not know the rationale behind it and, therefore, do not know where to go now.  This budget is an example of exactly where that can lead, to inactivity in the face of the real difficulties and the real economy.</P>
    <P>This Opposition party would look in a <Col N="1076" /> more positive way at the Government's policies if there was some attempt at visible planning in any area.  To the country's great misfortune planning is seen by the Fianna Fáil Party as a dirty word. This budget presented the Government with the chance &mdash; an unusual chance in the last couple of years &mdash; to capitalise on the improvement in public finances and to capitalise on a certain consensus on the reform of taxation.  There seems to be a unique degree of agreement that Corporate Ireland should contribute more to the taxation pool than heretofore. Even Corporate Ireland sees there is a price to pay if the economic motor is to be fired as quickly as possible. Many of the people involved and highly placed in industry acknowledge that there is room and scope to widen the tax base to include further taxation on Corporate Ireland.  The Government have lost that opportunity and consensus which would allow them to look at real taxation reform.</P>
    <P>The budget was presented by the Minister for Finance as a first step in the reform of the tax system.  Does the Minister have any real idea of the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; as applied to Ireland?  Is he aware that the gap between the cost of employing somebody and that person's take home pay is the largest in any of the OECD countries?  Does he not understand that shifting the burden of taxation away from work is an integral part of economic recovery?  It is essential to do so if employers are to be encouraged to employ more workers and if workers are to be encouraged first to stay in Ireland, secondly, to be more productive and, thirdly, to take more responsibility in their place of work.  For every extra £1 a worker gets in take home pay, his employer must find £3.30.  There is no greater discouragement to job creation.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done in this budget is to rob Peter to pay Peter in tax terms, and I say that quite deliberately. He has reduced some rates and widened some bands, but has clawed a geat deal of this back from the same sector which bears the brunt of taxation, the PAYE <Col N="1077" /> sector.  Why is the Minister so reluctant to widen the tax base and relieve the PAYE worker of this crippling and discouraging burden?  We in the Progressive Democrats have published a very comprehensive plan on reforming the taxation system.  We have suggested it can be done over a five year period.  It has been exhaustively costed.  It has been presented in an effort to encourage enterprise and work.  That is the purpose of it. We believe it is crucial to the encouragement of enterprise in work and economic development that the taxation system be reformed, not simply changed, not adding to one hand what you take away from the other hand when they are both hands of the same body, but rather widening the tax base to enable the burden to be more fairly shared.</P>
    <P>It is very noteworthy that over the past few years the ratio of taxation on companies and property reduced drastically while taxation on income has increased dramatically.  That tells its own story.  As I said, we have published a very comprehensive document on this.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in this document which will find favour with other parties.  I have to ask the question: what other party, either in Government or in Opposition, have taken on this work which is so essential to the restructuring of the taxation system?  The answer is none.  We invite the Government and other parties to look at our plan and to support our moves to gradually reduce the standard taxation rate to 25p in the pound with a higher rate of 40p and to abolish employee's PRSI which is a direct tax on work.</P>
    <P>It has become somewhat trite in recent months to speak about a standard taxation rate of 25p in the pound, but I would remind the House that when this party suggested it about two and a half years ago, we were derided and looked at as if we were fools.  It has now come to pass that it is seen to be an essential part of taxation reform, that there be a realistic standard rate of taxation which encourages people to go out to work hard, not to mention that our neighbours, Great Britain are debating in Cabinet whether they should reduce the standard <Col N="1078" /> taxation rate still further from 25p in the pound.  They are discussing whether it should be reduced to either 22p in the pound or 23p in the pound or stay at 25p. That is remarkable, especially when we consider the present position in Ireland. Only 60 miles up the road our neighbours live in an economy which offers this kind of incentive to work.</P>
    <P>The Government had a real opportunity in this budget to help the less well paid in society by starting that process of tax reform with the abolition of PRSI on the first £2,000 to £3,000 of income.  This would have given a real boost to the lower paid who in social equity terms deserve immediate and urgent attention.  This course has not been taken.  Instead the Minister chose to give tax relief right across the board, without targeting those in real need.  This is reproachable. The Minister has taken the soft option. He has not put any principle forward, he has not given a lead or shown the House or the public at large that he believes there are inequities in the taxation system that work against the lower paid, as do the system of allowances.  There has been no indication from the Minister or the Government that they are thinking of moving away from the allowance system towards a system of tax credits which was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  There has been no indication either that the Government feel it is right and just to target any surplus funds on those greatest in need.</P>
    <P>This budget has given a person on the low income of £3,000 a year total relief of £10.92 in that tax year &mdash; I think that is disgraceful &mdash; and at the same time the Minister has given to the person earning £30,000 per annum tax relief of £648.  The figures speak for themselves. The record of Fianna Fáil on tax reform has been to blow a lot of hot air about their good intentions, as the Taoiseach did the day before the budget, and then fail to deliver in this their third budget.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn my attention to another aspect of the real economy, as opposed to the figures economy to which we have been treated during the past 12 <Col N="1079" /> to 18 months, which seems to be accepted as a fact of life, and that is unemployment and its half brother, emigration.  The paucity of Government thinking on these subjects is disgraceful.  This year's budget presented by the Minister for Finance has done nothing of a radical nature to try to solve these two problems.  The hype which preceded the budget, for example, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> review of job creation, attempted to persuade us that job targets were being met, thousands of jobs were being created and that all was well on the employment front.  Yet we still have 236,000 on the live register; we have thousands more leaving Ireland every month, not to mention approximately another 50,000 on work and training schemes.</P>
    <P>The media image of Government success in the job creation arena simply falls apart when we look at the position around the country.  Parents look around their homes and see empty places at the table; they receive letters and phone calls from abroad on a regular basis.  Each Member of this House has experience of this, I am certain, be it within their immediate family or more distant.  I have experienced this.  I do not believe the people outside this House are turning a blind eye to what is really happening or believe what is presented by the media and the Government press agents when the evidence before their eyes is quite different.</P>
    <P>There is despair among parents whose children in their late teens and early twenties have left this country because they know it will be another ten to 15 years at the present rate of recovery &mdash; if that is what we can call it &mdash; before there will be any chance for their children to think of returning.  Being realistic, what kind of chance will there be at that stage? What will we be able to offer to entice home these young people who, at that stage may be married with young children and have settled down in those countries? Huge numbers of communities around the country have no young people left and those numbers are growing every <Col N="1080" /> day.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance in this Government has not addressed himself in a more radical way to the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.  This House is waiting for a radical approach to that problem.  It would applaud a radical approach.  It would say that at least something was being done.  The consensus I referred to earlier in my speech extends to expecting a Government to take advantage of it so that the jobs may be created and as fast a recovery as possible be effected.  What a golden opportunity was lost in this budget to completely restructure the job creation agencies.  We at present have working for the State the IDA, CTT, SFADCo, and a number of other organisations including semi-State companies, all vying for funds, attention and kudos in the same area.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why we maintain this number of agencies or why there is not a real move to rationalise.  Even though many of these have been slimmed down recently, there is still a very serious overlapping of functions and regions covered.  Consider the areas covered, for instance, by SFADCo.  I have a great admiration for some of the work that agency have done, the jobs they have created and the sense of purpose and cohesion they have created in the area with which they deal.  Look at their region, then look at other agencies in the State and see how their regional structure overlaps.  It appears SFADCo have been given total responsibility for job creation in their area, for tourism and for general development.  Where does that leave the IDA and their offices in New York?  Does it mean SFADCo must also set up an office beside them?  Where does that leave Bord Fáilte?  Are they not to direct tourists in Ireland to the Shannonside region?  It simply does not make sense. When are this Government going to pull themselves out from under the political, cute trick approach to solving problems? It seems to me this is a real example of that.  Why is there not one enterprise <Col N="1081" /> agency &mdash; I use that term &ldquo;enterprise agency&rdquo; with some deliberation because it seems that is what we need to foster &mdash; not just in existing companies that operate but in our young people coming up who will be expected to be the backbone of economic wealth in the next 20 or 30 years.  This enterprise agency should incorporate all job creation, all exporting and any other allied job creation agency work.  There should be a uniform regional division of the country.  There should simply be no overlapping.  This overlapping leads to rivalry between agencies. Consider the ridiculous position in the not too distant past where in a regional town in Ireland &mdash; I am not talking about New York, Brussels or anywhere like that &mdash; there were two separate and distinct offices for the IDA and CTT and it was simply impossible to get the personnel from each office together for a meeting because they both saw they were operating in the same area and were simply not willing to give way to each other on that.  Where lies the good of the country in an attitude like that?  Why is the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance not initiating a real change in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the spectacle of the IDA in the person of their managing director &mdash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may pick me up on this but it is not going to be a personal attack &mdash; at a recent gathering of industrialists making the claim for the IDA that that organisation is the job creation agency in this country.  That is quite startling because it ignores the crucial role marketing and exporting have in creating jobs.  What are we to do with the industrial base we have as it is?  Are we simply to ignore that?  Are we to put all our job creation eggs in one basket, that is new jobs coming with new industries requiring large set up costs and great capital investment, when we already have the bones of great numbers of jobs?  We have had industry pulling back over the last number of years, slimming down, getting ready to take off when the world recession ends.  The world recession has ended but this Government and the previous one have ignored the possibilities of <Col N="1082" /> building on the industrial, manufacturing and services structures we have.  It is quite strange that the IDA should see themselves as so separate and elitist, that they are the job creation agency.  All I can say is it is not in the best interests of the country.  It is about time that approach to job creation came to an end.  What are CTT doing except promoting the exports from existing companies in order that these companies can increase their employment and expand, be it here or abroad?  It seems we are ignoring a great percentage of the jobs that can be created if we think in a compartmentalised way such as is evidenced by that remark from the Managing Director of the IDA.</P>
    <P>There is a real future for the existing companies working in Ireland whether they be indigenous or multinationals. I see a great future also in small companies, but I am not relying on simply the growth of the numbers of small companies to provide us with the numbers of jobs we need.  It is unrealistic to expect that.  We have to have some large industries. If you count the small industries as those who employ under 50 or under ten, the number of those companies required to make up 236,000 jobs is a heck of a lot.  It just will not happen that way.  I am not burying my head in the sand.  We simply have to have job creation on a bigger scale than perhaps many companies in Ireland can provide but a very large proportion of the jobs that will be provided can come from existing companies operating.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the appalling lack of direction on harmonisation leading to 1992; &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; is a mild word in this context.  A figure that emerged yesterday in a question addressed by Deputy Michael McDowell to the Minister for Finance shows £550 million is required to harmonise Irish and UK rates of VAT.  That does not take into account European rates.  Where are this Government going on it?  When will we see a plan coming from them?  We have only three more budgets to 1992.  What is Corporate Ireland?  What are the people in industry in Ireland to think they are to do?  How are they to plan for it if the <Col N="1083" /> Government are not giving a lead?  I have referred to last July's launch of EURO-PEN and then a big blank after that.  It is irresponsible in the extreme and we face a re-run of 1973 when we joined the EC and thought it was going to be a bonanza but we had not prepared for it.  We did not allow for the fact that many sectors of industry would be wiped out.  The same scenario faces us now.  The internal market represents a huge opportunity for us but the benefits will not fall into our laps.  We must prepare.  The Government have fallen down drastically on that issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Structural Funds I am extremely worried about the way the national plan is being handled.  I want to know where it is and what it is.  In my view it represents a most undemocratic process.  At Question Time yesterday the Minister of State who has responsibility for European affairs told us that county managers were reporting back to local public representatives.  That is not happening. Nobody knows what is going on, not even the people working on the support groups.  They do not know what is being planned or what to expect next. All they know is that there is no real substance in the announcements being made about the national plan, about roads and bridges.  The plan is not coming together.</P>
    <P>We do not know to what extent the private sector will be involved in the plan. We are aware that in the budget a certain amount of money was earmarked for roads and I should like to know how it is that Governments can earmark that money when they have not completed negotiations with the EC.  The Government may hide behind the lack of negotiations on VAT restructuring so that they need not do anything about the plan but what I should like to know is why in his budget speech the Minister put so much emphasis on the capital development available through EC Structural Funds when, on the other hand, he told us he could not do anything in regard to VAT harmonisation because negotiations had not been complete.  The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it.</P>

      <P>The Government have, in this year's budget, moved further along the road towards our national objectives of greater social equity, fairer taxes and more jobs.  I am glad to say that the hard decisions we have taken since taking office are now beginning to pay off and it gives me pleasure to be able to say that this has not been at the expense of the poorer people in our society.</P>
      <P>The economic environment fostered by our policies has put hope back into our people.  Inflation has fallen to its lowest figure for many years; so also have interest rates and employment is once more increasing.  In 1988 our exports growth was again very strong.  All of this reflects greater competitiveness and confidence within Irish industry.</P>
      <P>The outlook for this year is for stronger economic growth and a further improvement in employment prospects.  Nobody is saying that this is the end of the road, that almost overnight we have solved all the problems we inherited.  We recognise that there are 236,000 people unemployed and because of that there is a need for the Government, and Irish society, to address that problem.  However, problems are not solved by generalities or a maze of contradictions such as the suggestion that there should be a massive reduction in taxation and a transfer of that load to an unknown and unidentified area of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley asked how the Minister for Finance can be satisfied that Structural Funds will be available for road works and I should like to tell her that there is no comparison between the aid that will be available under the Structural Funds in 1989 and the arguments in regard to the harmonisation of VAT. One cannot argue on the one hand that we are not planning and on the other hand suggest that we should delay the implementation of Structural Funds in vital infrastructural areas which will in <Col N="1085" /> turn lead to the development of industry and tourism in many centres.</P>
      <P>In framing the budget, the Government were particularly conscious of the need to continue to make progress in improving the circumstances of the poorer sections of our community.  From the general reaction to the budget, it is fair to say that we are succeeding. Indeed, prior to the budget, there was an expectation by the public at large and in the media that the Government should focus the budget towards the least well-off in our society.  The Government have always given priority to alleviating poverty and indeed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> they undertook, within the resources available, to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits and provide additional increases for those in receipt of the lowest payments. The Government went beyond the programme's commitment on social welfare benefits last year and likewise this year.</P>
      <P>In this budget the real value of weekly welfare payments generally were yet again preserved by a general increase of 3 per cent.  On top of this were special increases for the long term unemployed of about 9 per cent.  This measure, taken together with the special tax measures for low incomes, indicates the commitment of the Government towards tackling the difficulties of families living long term on low incomes either on social welfare or in low paid jobs.  A number of other measures detailed in the Minister for Finance's budget speech will also contribute to alleviating the problem presented by poverty.</P>
      <P>The problems of tackling poverty and reducing unemployment are closely connected. The best solution to poverty is good sustained employment.  In 1988, 20,000 jobs were created in manufacturing and international services.  Jobs are being created not only in the industrial area but also in tourism, horticulture, forestry and marine activities. Such job creation is making a significant contribution to reducing the extent of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> I should like to emphasise that independent commentators have accepted the validity of the Government's statement that 20,000 jobs were created in 1988.  It appears that there is a sustained effort by certain people to try to prove that that is not the case.  Those figures have been accepted by the ICTU and independent commentators.  I accept that there were substantial redundancies but last year was the first year in five years that there was an increase in employment. I am not saying that the increase was sufficient but we remember that for many years the opposite was the case. The fact that we have turned the corner should give us confidence to build on our achievements and make further improvements. We are as impatient as anybody and we will not play second fiddle to anybody in our determination to create more jobs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that social welfare expenditure represents approximately 30 per cent of current Government expenditure.  The reality we are facing is that the progress we can make depends on the resources which are available and this in turn is constrained by the State of the public finances.  Progress on one is dependent on progress on the other.  It would be foolish in the extreme to think that an economy which suffered up to recently from high budget deficits, high inflation and had a balance of payments difficulty could resolve those problems within a short space of time.  Only national economic recovery can increase the resources to effectively deal with poverty. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> from which there will not be deviation is the key to achieving this goal.</P>
    <P>One of the most radical themes of the Minister's Budget Statement last Wednesday concerned the proposed changes in the financial procedures governing the State's administrative running costs.  In the two years since this Government took office, major progress has been made in redressing the imbalances in the public finances through control and reduction of public expenditure. Indeed, it is this very ability of the Government to exercise control over <Col N="1087" /> spending that has restored confidence and growth in the economy.  I would remind Deputy Colley that on a few occasions our strenuous efforts to curtail public expenditure was not helped in those lobbies by the Deputy or her colleagues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are still, however, huge constraints on the public purse and because that is a situation which is likely to prevail for the foreseeable future, it is right and prudent that we should begin to think of how we might better organise and manage the resources involved in the administration of the State's affairs.  Here I agree with Deputy Colley.  As part of our programme we invite suggestions and will consider any sensible proposals to ensure that we do not have duplication or a waste of those resources in overlapping and unnecessary competition in the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>The case for pursuing and achieving a more efficient and effective public service is most compelling.  As part of this objective my colleague, the Minister for Finance, outlined proposals for fixing administrative budgets on a three-year cycle.  The central philosophy underlying such an approach is to give the management in the various Departments greater budgetary responsibility and flexibility, within an overall administrative budget, set them free of excessive controls and, perhaps most important of all, encourage them to use their initiative and skills in securing savings in the day-to-day running of their offices, and provide opportunities for the promotion of developmental employment oriented activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no escaping the fact that the public service will, in terms of the resources made available to it, have to manage with less than it has in the past. There is a lot of talent at all levels within the public service but, unfortunately, existing structures and procedures have not allowed that talent to <Col N="1088" /> develop to anything near the maximum extent possible.  The Government recognise this deficiency and intend to correct it.  I am convinced that better organisation and better management will result and, moreover, it will give the taxpayers better value for their money.</P>
    <P>This budget sets out to stimulate economic development and job creation through structural improvement utilising the additional resources now available from the EC and the improvement in our economic environment and better public finances.  Energy and Forestry will play a significant role in this development.</P>
    <P>Energy is a fundamental requirement for all our business and leisure activities. It is therefore essential that we have a regular supply of energy at as low a price as possible.</P>
    <P>In the energy area, we suffer a number of disadvantages compared with our European neighbours.  These are due to our small size and island location remote from the main centres of the Community. For example, we are the only member state with stand-alone gas and electricity grids.  Our small and dispersed population structure and lower level of economic activity is an additional burden.</P>
    <P>In recognition of these problems, I am anxious to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the increased EC Structural Funds to make improvements in the structure and competitiveness of our energy supply industries.  Energy will, therefore, be a key sector for the use of Structural Funds in our development plan.</P>
    <P>The energy programme which is being prepared will involve the following main features: In order to strengthen energy supplies and reduce costs, we intend to intensify market penetration of natural gas with a view to creating a long-term viable industry before our present source of supply of gas is exhausted; secondly, the electricity grid must be strengthened and extended to cater for increased demands arising out of economic development and industrialisation with particular attention being paid to removing deficiencies in rural and western <Col N="1089" /> areas; a major upgrading and modernisation of the single oil refinery in Ireland is also proposed in order to bring its costs into line with prevailing market levels; our indigenous energy resources will, of course, also be supported.  We are pursuing an active hydrocarbon exploration programme targeted at finding new supplies of natural gas and oil.  This area of activity is not, however, expected to be eligible for EC aid; the peat industry is essential for our energy supply and security, and the peat industry is the major source of employment and economic activity in central and western Ireland. The viability of the industry is under threat from low energy prices.  A major modernisation programme involving new technology, labour force rationalisation and new product development is underway and is a classic case of industrial restructuring and rural development; finally we intend to pursue integration with European energy networks.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Common Market requires that Ireland's energy consumers should have access to the European energy markets on the same terms as competing enterprises.  This will require electricity, as a first priority, and later gas interconnectors with Europe. Our programme will put forward projects in both these areas.  This development should get a particularly favourable response from the Commission as a practical example of European integration.</P>
    <P>The position as regards Whitegate-Whiddy is again making headline news. I want to reiterate that the Government are open to proposals which would achieve the reactivation of the oil storage facility at Whiddy Island and the continuation of refining at Whitegate which will require a substantial level of investment to achieve upgrading and modernisation. There have been a number of recent comments concerning reports that the Government are negotiating with the Nigerian Government concerning both facilities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects to this issue which need to be clarified to avoid any misunderstandings.  The first point is that the recent contacts with Nigerian <Col N="1090" /> officials and others have not taken the form of negotiations but were merely discussions about how Irish facilities could be used to the benefit of both ourselves and interested parties.  Secondly, it is not true to say that other producers are excluded from putting forward proposals. There have been a number of approaches from other quarters, but these have not resulted in anything to date beyond broad expressions of interest.  However, I want to make it clear, that proposals from any producer or company will receive the fullest consideration.</P>
    <P>The action of the Minister for Finance in excluding unleaded petrol from the excise duty increase is timely.  This enables unleaded petrol to be sold at a favourable price compared with leaded petrol.  I hope that motorists will take advantage of this fact and, where practical, switch to unleaded petrol.  At this stage, a sizeable number of outlets have unleaded petrol available and I expect that this network will expand over the coming months.  This is more good news for the environment.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the revision of licensing terms announced by my predecessor in September 1988, the prevailing low level of oil price continues to represent a major disincentive to oil and gas exploration. During 1988 we had three wells drilled in our waters.  Given the importance which we attach to work in the under-explored Porcupine Basin area, the fact that two of these wells were located in the Porcupine was a most welcome development.  The past year also saw the conclusion of an agreement between the Government and Marathon which, amongst other things, will provide for the drilling of up to ten exploration wells in the period up to and including 1991.  In exploration terms alone, this is a most significant development which will enable us to assess, and hopefully realise our potential for further hydrocarbons production off the south coast.</P>
    <P>The first Marathon exploration well will shortly be getting under way and I am sure that all in this House will share my hope that the company's exploration efforts will yield positive results.  I must <Col N="1091" /> also mention that BP are currently making the necessary arrangements for the drilling, in the first quarter of this year, of an exploration well in Block 49/9, in which there was a previous oil discovery. Although the Marathon drilling programme constitutes a firm basis for our overall exploration efforts over the next few years I would certainly not be happy to leave it at that.  Our efforts to encourage other companies to engage in exploration activities in our waters will continue, and I am confident that the 1988 level of exploration activity will be at least maintained over the coming twelve months.</P>
    <P>On the minerals exploration front, a high level of minerals prospecting activity is being maintained throughout the country. There are at present about 740 prospecting licences held by some 55 companies whose exploration programmes are mainly focused on gold and base metals.  Much of the exploration activity is being undertaken by Irish companies as distinct from the situation which prevailed a few years ago when exploration in Ireland was being conducted predominantly by multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Hopes for new mine development centre on the Ballingarry and Leinster coalfields and the talc magnesite deposits at Westport, County Mayo.  I am in touch with a number of interests about these coal and tale deposits and I hope to get new development under way later this year.  The Galmoy lead-zinc find, a gypsum find at Glangevlin, County Cavan and a number of significant gold discoveries in the west continue to be investigated.</P>

      <P>I wish to reiterate that the Progressive Democrats believe that the appropriate means of safe-guarding those with long-term illness is by extension of the existing long-term illness scheme to cover drugs needed by persons suffering from chronic asthma, heart conditions, cancer, kidney transplants and similar diseases not already covered.  A lot of money can be saved by doing this on a wholesale cost plus prescription fee basis rather than on the present full retail price basis which is very expensive.  The Progressive Democrats also believe that the VHI, which is actually insolvent, is a cornerstone of our health system, that they must be saved and returned to solvency.  Many of their practices and procedures must be changed and their cover must be financially sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI drugs refund scheme has been of value to many people with long-term illnesses such as those to which I have referred.  But, in the last analysis, a <Col N="1093" /> drugs refund scheme is not the proper business of a health insurer.  Providing help for persons with serious chronic illness, requiring drug treatment, is the business of the State on a non-insurance basis.  Every objective expert would accept that contention.  Insurance is a system designed to cover contingent liabilities of a significant nature that might or might not occur.  It is not designed to cover certainties or liabilities that are inevitable and predictable.</P>
    <P>The system of health insurance is valuable and ought not be used to provide for essentially uninsurable risks such as the normal annual consumption by families of drugs arising from short-term illnesses. Such outgoings are just as inappropriate in the case of health insurance as are the day-to-day expenses of servicing and repairing small defects in cars to an insurer offering comprehensive motor insurance.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves two basic questions: first, do we want to rescue the Voluntary Health Insurance Board or do we want to let the company collapse for short-term political advantage?  Second, are we honest enough to accept that a company like the VHI cannot afford to offer a service such as the drugs refund scheme?</P>
    <P>On 16 January 1989 the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on health, Deputy Mary Harney, made it quite clear that in our opinion the drugs refund scheme, as currently operated could not be retained and that its restriction to certain long-term illnesses would be necessary. On 18 January 1989 Deputy Yates circulated his motion to the Members of this House.  We received it the following day and Deputy Harney assures me that that was in fact the first day on which she saw that motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the following day Deputy Harney, in a detailed and considered response, pointed out that the <Col N="1094" /> drugs refund scheme could not be retained in its present form and that the appropriate steps for Government were to extend the scope of the long-term illness drugs scheme to conditions including chronic heart conditions, chronic asthma, cancer and other serious life-threatening, long-term conditions.</P>
      <P>In view of the allegations that have been made today I should read the statement which Deputy Harney issued on Thurday, 19 January 1989, when she received the motion, because it is perfectly clear that she never promised, on behalf of this party, any support for his motion.  In fact the statement makes very clear the difficulty that she and we had with it.  Her statement read as follows:</P>
      <P>I believe there is a practical and fair solution to the controversy engendered by the proposed abolition of the VHI drugs refund scheme.</P>
      <P>The removal of this scheme primarily affects certain categories of people in need of on-going, expensive drugs treatment for conditions like heart disease, asthma and cancer.</P>
      <P>But the scheme has also been used by people to claim refunds for less vital pharmaceutical purchases, like aspirin and cough mixtures, and this is too extravagant an option given the parlous condition in which the VHI insurance company now operates.</P>
      <P>The practical and humanitarian solution to the present controversy therefore is for the Government to re-classify conditions like cancer, heart illness and various forms of asthma as long-term illness, and to include them in that category for 100 p.c. drugs coverage as operates for various other long-term illnesses.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats will support such a practical and reasonable resolution of the present problem resulting from the total abolition of the VHI drugs refund scheme, but we do not favour its complete restoration.</P>
      <P>Therefore to say that we favoured a motion which calls for its complete restoration has to be patently untrue.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to give up their political pretences and do the right thing by admitting that the motion before us this evening is simply not on.  The Government amendment seeks to ignore their responsibility in this matter which is considerable.  However, I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health last evening that he is now reviewing the operation of the community drugs scheme to ascertain how the available funding can best be deployed towards the areas of real need.  That is what is needed. At least now let us hope that the VHI &mdash; who have been unable to avoid huge losses in the last two years &mdash; henceforth will be allowed freedom from interference to enable them prepare for competition for the first time.  If they fail to survive on a commerical basis the Exchequer will have to subsidise the company at huge cost.  I shudder at that prospect because it would be the first time that would have happened in the 32-year history of the board which, up to very recently, had served this country extremely well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most remarkable <Col N="1097" /> feature of this debate has been the attempt to suggest that the present Government are in some way responsible for the VHI's difficulties.  If one looks at the causes of these difficulties, it is plain to see that they arose before we came to office.  Indeed, some of the difficulties are due to decisions of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The impression has been given that VHI have gone from being a pillar of financial strength to their present position in the last two years.  The basis of this claim is the fact that VHI's reserves were at their highest level at the end of the financial year in February 1987. However, Deputies must understand that the reserves figures do not necessarily give an accurate picture of the underlying strength or weakness of an insurance company at that point in time.</P>
      <P>The refusal of the previous Government in 1986 to allow VHI a premium increase had very little impact on the board in the 1986-87 financial year.  I would like to remind Deputies that that was the year prior to a general election and, for political reasons, the previous Government were not prepared to grasp the nettle and grant the increase which was sought by the board of the VHI. Premium increases only apply to individual members when their policies come up for renewal.  If an increase had been given, it would have worked its way through the membership during 1987, and it would thus have had most of its impact on the 1987-88 financial year.</P>
      <P>As we now know, of course, the Coalition Government decided that they would not allow any increase, on the basis that VHI's reserves could absorb any cost increases.  Of course, that chicken soon came home to roost, and we were left to deal with the consequences of the inactivity of the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1986 also, the new, high technology hospitals came on stream.  The VHI's plans to provide cover for them were approved by the then Government &mdash; indeed, the Government were heavily involved in drawing them up.  Deputy Barry Desmond would be able to confirm <Col N="1098" /> the pressures he may have been under from Cabinet colleagues.  We now know that the plans were not adequate to meet the costs involved.  Membership of these plans grew slowly during the 1986-87 financial year, and it was the following year before the problems began to emerge.  Again, it was left to the incoming Government to deal with them.</P>
    <P>It has also been claimed that VHI's expenditure on public hospital charges since we came to office is responsible for the present problem.  Again, the facts do not bear this out.  In 1987-88, 19 per cent of VHI's total claims expenditure went to public hospitals.  This is a lower share than at any time in the past five years.</P>
    <P>Public hospital charges for private and semi-private accommodation did indeed rise sharply when the previous Government were in office &mdash; they were 150 per cent higher when they left office than when they came in.  In our two years in office, they have only risen by 3.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are many factors to blame for VHI's problems.  It would be fair to say that every area of their claims expenditure has risen rapidly in the past few years, including payments to private hospitals; payments to public hospitals; payments to consultants; and refunds to members for drugs and other expenses.</P>
    <P>A proper analysis of the figures, as has been done by the experts which we sent into the VHI, shows that all of these factors were emerging in 1986, even though they had not begun to be fully reflected in the VHI's financial results for that year.  The suggestion that this Government were inactive in dealing with these problems is particularly galling, for two reasons: first, it comes from the party who helped to cause the problems; and second, the record shows it to be untrue.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Government took office, the Minister for Health investigated the financial position at VHI and had discussions with the VHI board on the best approach to remedy it.  As a result, a premium increase of 8 per cent was authorised, which took effect towards the end of 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The Minister kept in close touch with the VHI board, and continued to monitor their financial situation.  It became clear that costs were still out of control and that the premium increase alone was not going to be sufficient to put things right. The Minister discussed the problem again with the Board and, with their agreement, appointed expert consultants to look in detail at every aspect of the operation. When the consultants reported on the immediate recovery measures which would be necessary, the Minister lost no time in approving them and they are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government have therefore been prompt and decisive in dealing with the VHI problems which they inherited on coming into office.  However, they have also been careful to take the time necessary to get detailed and expert analysis of the board's position to make sure that the right decisions were taken.  It is a pity that the previous Government did not do likewise before rushing into some of the decisions which they took in 1986; the VHI's position might now be a very different one.</P>
    <P>Before moving away from VHI's financial position, it is important that I should refute one statement made by Deputy O'Malley.  VHI is not, and has never been insolvent.  There is absolutely no comparison between their position and that of the other insurance companies whose problems have been before this House in recent years.  The reserves have fallen because costs were allowed to get out of line with premium income.  Costs have now been capped, and premiums adjusted in an equitable manner.  VHI's reserve will now rise again and will return to an acceptable level within two years.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the EC minimum solvency margin to which Deputy O'Malley referred does not in fact apply to VHI, although the VHI board have adopted a policy of seeking to maintain reserves at or above that level.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific decision to withdraw the VHI drugs refund.  As Deputy O'Malley has acknowledged in his contribution, it would be quite wrong <Col N="1100" /> to restore that particular benefit.  We all accept that those who need expensive drugs on a long-term basis must be helped, and the Minister has made it clear that he is looking at the existing schemes in order to target the available funding towards the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Medical card holders comprise 1.3 million of the population or 37 per cent; VHI members comprise 1.1 million or 31 per cent and about 30 per cent of the population are neither VHI members nor medical card holders.  Very many of these would be in the income groups just above the medical card guidelines for whom VHI membership may not be a realistic option.  These groups would gain nothing from a restoration of the VHI drugs benefit.</P>
    <P>It has also been pointed out that it makes no sense to have claims for refunds for parts of the very same item of expenditure processed by two different agencies &mdash; the health boards, under their drug refund scheme, and the VHI.  I am rather surprised that Deputy Yates would go along with the expensive and bureaucratic approach.</P>
    <P>The most telling evidence against the VHI drugs benefit, however, comes from the experts who have considered it in detail.  They found that costs under this benefit were running out of control.  For many members, it had turned their VHI cover into a &ldquo;maintenance contract&rdquo; rather than insurance, since they were buying cover against a certainty, not a risk.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Yates seemed to take exception to the point being made by the Minister last night, it is nonetheless a fact that an individual could join VHI, knowing that he would be claiming more each year under this benefit than the cost of his premium.  The reason for this is very simple.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that one cannot be covered by VHI for hospital treatment, in the first few years of membership, if the treatment is related to a condition which existed before joining.  It is obviously necessary to have such an exclusion to deter people from putting off joining until they know that they will have to <Col N="1101" /> make a claim.  However, it is impossible to operate any exclusion of this nature in the drugs refund scheme.  The scheme refunds expenditure on the basis of pharmacists' receipts.  It would be administratively impossible to operate it on the basis of identifying the reasons that any specific drugs were needed.</P>
    <P>Consequently, anyone who had not been contributing to VHI, but who discovered that he would in future need expensive drugs on a regular basis, could join and immediately be guaranteed an annual refund of considerably more than his premium.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again the point made by the Minister last night that the VHI drugs benefit was withdrawn because of its own inherent problems, and not because of any of the other cost factors affecting VHI.  To illustrate this point, I would like to remind the House of the other measures which have been taken to deal with the various causes of VHI's problems.</P>
    <P>Hospital costs, particularly in the private sector, had risen rapidly due to increased facilities, more intensive usage and higher costs.  Cash limits have now been applied to each hospital to prevent any further rise in costs for the next 18 months.  Consumers will not be affected by this measure as hospitals will have to provide the same volume and cash mix as last year.</P>
    <P>There had also been substantial increases in consultant costs.  In certain specialties, this was because the automation of diagnostic tests had led to a greatly increased volume, with a much lower time input per test on the part of the consultant.  Payments to consultants had not been reduced to reflect this.  The VHI are now in the process of reaching agreement with the specialties concerned on a revised fees structure.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, it has been possible to put VHI back on a sound financial footing while requiring a premium increase of only 3 per cent from the majority of members.  Where premiums were out of line with the level of cover provided, the appropriate increases have been applied &mdash; 10 per cent on Plan C, <Col N="1102" /> 16 per cent on Plan D and 25 per cent on Plan E.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also understand that the measures which have been implemented were the immediate steps necessary to preserve the viability of VHI.  The consultants have made a number of recommendations in relation to VHI's plans and methods of operation. All of these are included in the corporate plan which has been submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, Deputies have put forward a number of suggestions, such as fixed prices for specific treatments, regardless of which hospital is involved; the possibility of some financial incentives to members to take a greater interest in preventive care and so on.  I can assure Deputies that the consultants have looked at all of the possibilities, and their report to the Minister is an extensive one.  It will be considered carefully over the next few months, and the points made by Deputies will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>In relation to the longer term role of the VHI, I would like to refer at this stage to the question of community rating. One of the most positive things which has emerged from this debate has been the general support in the House for the continuation of this principle.  We could not tolerate a situation in which the old, or those with chronic illness, would be penalised by higher premiums, or perhaps could not obtain insurance cover at all.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, some interests have called for open competition in health insurance in Ireland, and I am aware that a group of hospital consultants have launched a campaign to achieve this.  I do not understand the motivation behind this campaign.  I do not believe that hospital consultants, in general, would be happy with a situation in which those in most need of health insurance might be unable to afford it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that the principle of community rating must remain, and I am heartened that he will have the support of the House in this. Although Deputy Yates was forthright in <Col N="1103" /> his support for community rating, he then went on to make a rather strange proposal. He suggested that VHI should try to increase their membership among lower age groups by offering them lower premiums and a no-claims bonus.  He felt that this would bring in extra revenue which could be used to restore the VHI drugs benefit.  The Deputy is either in favour of community rating or in favour of lower premiums for the young &mdash; he cannot have it both ways.  His proposal, if implemented, would be the first step in dismantling community rating, and would make it very difficult to sustain the principle much longer.</P>
    <P>In any case, there is an obvious flaw in the proposal.  It would not be feasible to offer lower premiums to new members without offering them also to the younger members already enrolled in VHI.  As a result, VHI would lose revenue from its existing members.  There is no reason to believe that it would be possible for VHI to recruit sufficient additional members to make up this loss, particularly given the fact that over half of those without full eligibility for health services are already enrolled in VHI.  Deputy Yates has an enthusiasm for coming up with instant solutions to complex problems.  This enthusiasm is sometimes refreshing, but I hope the House will agree that, when the best international expertise has been engaged to look at these problems, it might perhaps be better to take some account of their advice also.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the statutory drugs schemes.  It is clear that those with exceptional, ongoing drugs costs must be helped and spared any hardship.  It has also been made abundantly clear that the VHI drugs refund was not the way to do this.  The Minister has stated that he is looking at the existing arrangements, under the long-term illness scheme and the health boards' drugs refund scheme, which together cost £21 million a year, to ensure that they operate equitably and efficiently in dealing with those who most need help.</P>
    <P>The approach suggested in the Progressive Democrats' amendment may not <Col N="1104" /> be the best way of doing this.  Many people, suffering from conditions other than those which the amendment mentions, may have exceptional drug costs because of factors specific to their individual cases.  The needs of certain other people may not be as great, although they would come under one of the headings in question.  It is important to ensure that the arrangements are equitable towards all those with very high, ongoing costs, regardless of the specific conditions, which give rise to them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to Deputy Yates' statement that a number of health boards are charging £5 per month for processing claims under the drugs refund scheme.  One board introduced such a charge and I understand that other boards may have been considering doing so.  However, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has given firm instructions within the last few weeks to each health board that such charges are not to be made.  I reiterate that instruction to ensure that this does not continue.  This issue gives us an opportunity to consider in great detail the overall position in relation to the services of the drug refund scheme.  The proposals coming forward from the Minister will certainly satisfy the majority of the public who are affected.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask Deputies to accept the realities spelled out in our amendment to the Fine Gael motion. A potential crisis in the VHI has been averted by the actions of the Minister. The strategy which is now being followed is based on the best advice available and it would be both irresponsible and unjustifiable to interfere with it.  I do not wish to go back on the position regarding the inactivity of the previous Government of which the Cathaoirleach was a backbench member.  Basically the position arose as a result of the major private hospitals coming on stream, with the approval of Deputy Barry Desmond and the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>The Coalition also abolished rural dispensing by general practitioners. We restored it.  In rural areas it is vitally important that the GP would be in a position to dispense drugs.  Our record in providing a service to the less well off in society is evident.  Now, the Fine Gael Party have been totally misled and are misleading the public by putting forward this motion for their own party political reasons.  All I can say is that the balloon which is upside down on their posters has certainly burst here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House will support our amendment and will ensure the survival of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  If Deputy Yates' proposal went through, it would seriously put at risk the future survival of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I have no doubt that the majority in this House will support our amendment and vote accordingly and that our mature approach to this issue will receive the backing of this House.  If the Minister did not take this action, if he did not give the increase which was appropriate in 1987, and if he did not approve the increases which we all have to bear, in particular the major increases <Col N="1108" /> going through at present which are essential, the VHI would not survive.  I want to make it clear that the majority of people will not be affected by the changes until August this year when the renewal of their premiums come through.  They will still be eligible for the refund up to that point.  The Minister will be announcing in detail other developments in relation to the refund scheme in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Unlike the Government, as evidenced by the speech of the Minister of State, the Labour Party take this debate seriously.  We regard this as a matter of great importance.  This debate gives us an opportunity yet again to address the multitude of problems which beset our health services since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office two years ago.</P>
      <P>I listened last night and again this evening with growing anger to some of the comments made.  The Progressive Democrats speaker, Deputy O'Malley, left us all wondering what exactly their position on this issue was, so much so that after he had concluded I asked him what he would do when it came to a vote.  Indeed, the Fine Gael spokesman asked the same question because it was anything but clear from the &ldquo;on this hand&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo; contribution he made.  He has clarified the matter tonight.  It is quite clear that he has no intention of safeguarding the scheme so many hundreds of families are dependent upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Fine Gael gave a reasoned analysis of the present position of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme and they cited Government mishandling and mismanagement of the health services as a contributory factor to the crisis that exists there.  The Fine Gael spokesperson did not mention that his party are guilty of complicity, with the Progressive Democrats, in the mishandling of the health services of this Administration, supporting as his party do the Estimates that have caused such havoc in the last two <Col N="1109" /> years.  We cannot look simply at the narrow issue of one of the proposals of the rescue package put forward to the Minister for Health to rescue the VHI. We must take into account the overall general situation.  The Minister of State raised my anger.</P>

      <P>I am the spokes person for the Labour Party.  Is the Minister of State a Minister for anything except chairing committees?  The Minister of State, who chairs 21 committees at the latest count, came in to entertain us tonight with a comic history of Ireland.  The health services of this country are marginally more important and deserve a little more attention than the Minister of State gave to them.  To rewrite history and to cite the responsibility of a former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, is nothing short of laughable.  He was the Minister who preserved the health services; he did not have people lying on trolleys in hospitals throughout the length and breadth of the country, he did not close 4,000 beds.  He preserved the percentage of gross national product expended on the health services for the four years he was there, despite weekly attacks from the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health &mdash; then the Opposition spokesman on health &mdash; led an attack on health expenditure every week.  He orchestrated every health board to demand more resources and fought a campaign in February 1987 festooning the country with posters that said: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.&rdquo;  It was a sick joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil talked about Fine Gael's proposals for a prescription charge. Within weeks of coming to office, they brought in a £10 charge for anybody who visited an outpatients department in a hospital, and charged £10 a night for anybody who was admitted to hospital.  That was their response.  It can hardly have <Col N="1110" /> come as a surprise that the two years the present Minister had held office has seen the reserves of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board drop from £29.5 million to £4 million nor can it come as a surprise that up to £20 million a year is now paid by the VHI to two institutions in Dublin. This is of little surprise when this Minister has closed 4,000 public beds and ensured that anyone who wishes to have elective surgery has a choice between private medicine or being on an endless public waiting list.  Obviously, that choice is open only to the one-third of the population who can afford VHI membership. If you are not among that one-third you take your chances and the devil take the hindmost.  If you live long enough you may be admitted to have the medical procedures that you require carried out in a public hospital.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has taken office, private medicine has mushroomed.  He has done more for private medicine in two years than even the most Thatcherite privatiser could have hoped for.  You cannot build up a huge private medical capacity, starve the public health service of money and expect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You cannot build up a private medical empire and expect that there will be no cost at the end of it. Unfortunately, the bill has now fallen due and it is to be borne by the general VHI subscribers in the form of increased <Col N="1111" /> premia and reduced services, as evidenced in this proposal, one of the many to bring the financial affairs of the VHI into some semblance of order.</P>
      <P>When we examine the VHI, it is not as Deputy O'Malley suggested last night, just another insurance company.  The Deputy suggested that this is the third time in recent years that the matter of the collapse of an insurance company has been before the House.  The VHI is not a general insurance company like the PMPA or the ICI.  In fact, it has a very narrow remit to cover maintenance in hospital, consultant fees and hospital charges.  It does not, for example, cover GP's fees and has no interaction with the general practitioners.  It does not cover most dental procedures or preventive medicine.  Also, I would not agree with Deputy O'Malley's firm assertion that the VHI is insolvent.  That is not a fair description of the difficulties it now faces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that the VHI has a significant investment portfolio but it also has a very significant and unsustainable operating loss, which we have a responsibility to address, and nobody is denying that fact.  As I have said, the VHI has an investment portfolio of some £73 million which produces an annual income of approximately £7 million plus. It also has significant property assets.  The situation is, therefore, serious but not terminal and we should not allow <Col N="1112" /> the notion to go abroad that the VHI is finished.  What therefore must we do?</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister informed the House that the operation of the VHI is under review.  This Minister is very fond of reviews, committees, commissions and investigations of which, as I have said previously, there are 21 working at present.  The poor Minister of State must be worn out chairing them all.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have for some time been reviewing the operation and rationale of all the community drugs schemes, including the drugs refind scheme and the long term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>These are the main issues which I am considering to see how the available funding can best be deployed and targeted towards the areas of real need.  I will be announcing my proposals in due course.</P>
      <P>Some 15 months ago the Labour Party discovered that the Minister had decided to drastically reduce the moneys available to the community drugs schemes. We discovered that because the Minister had written to each of the health boards telling them that.  I raised this matter some 15 months ago and the Minister said, as I am tired hearing, that I was alarmist, that there were no such proposals. Thankfully the Labour Party were able to organise resistence on the part of the caring agencies and to use their political strength to ensure that when the budget was presented this time last year, that money had been restored.  However, it is interesting that in the Dáil debates at that time, the Minister indicated that he was reviewing the community drugs schemes.  What has happened during the past 15 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said there is to be a full review but he has not quantified when the review body will report.  What has the Minister been doing in the meantime?  That sop, the promise of another review or perhaps it is the same review that is ongoing is apparently enough to satisfy the Progressive Democrats, but it does not satisfy me.  The Minister has a responsibility to put proposals to this House and not constantly come in here whenever there is a crisis or difficulty and promise yet another review, yet another committee, yet another working group.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the VHI need a major shake up.  I find it incredible that it is only now that the board are getting around to establishing a medical audit unit.  Medical procedures must have an agreed cost; there must be a mechanism whereby there is an agreed cost for a hip replacement operation, a heart operation or whatever surgical procedure is required. Surely that can be agreed within the medical profession.  We cannot have a situation where the same procedure can cost three times as much depending on the geographical location, where the operation is performed.  That is unacceptable. Surely the VHI had a responsibility to sort out that problem at the very beginning.  It is incredible that this issue is only being addressed now.</P>
      <P>It is also surprising that there are 386 people employed in administering the VHI, when there are only 334 people employed to administer the Department of Health and to oversee the entire health budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a good Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That level of administration has to be justified.  It is unacceptable to me that the VHI have allowed a situation to develop where ordinary subscribers, one-third of the population, who pay VHI contributions, are expected <Col N="1114" /> to subsidise the extensive wine lists provided in some of our luxury hospitals.</P>
      <P>A practice has been brought to my attention which also causes me some concern. Today I have asked the Secretary of the Department of Health to investigate this matter and I now ask the Minister for Health to comment on it.  I refer to the fact that the VHI offers to some staff members loans and mortgages at highly subsidised interest rates, at a rate currently of 4 per cent.  I am aware that many financial institutions offer perks to their employees.  Indeed the ESB offer subsidised electricity to their employees, Bord na Móna provide subsidised turf for theirs but surely there should be some connection with the type of work done. For an institution like the VHI who operate, as I have described, in the very narrow confines of medical insurance, to offer subsidised mortgages surely raises some questions.  I can see little justification for a mortgage provision for employees of a health insurance company. I ask the Minister to address that matter and to give his views on it.  All these issues will no doubt be addressed by the Minister in the immediate future. However, the issue put to the House tonight in the Fine Gael motion is simply whether we want the VHI drugs refund scheme, a vital part of the budgets of hundreds of families on long term illnesses, to be maintained or abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have put down an amendment which seeks to broaden the terms of the motion, to address the real problems facing the VHI and the whole of the health services, that is, the starving of the health services of resources and of cash.  Fianna Fáil, supported by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, steadily have reduced the percentage of gross national product expended on health from 7 per cent, which Deputy Desmond maintained throughout the four years in which he held office as Minister for Health, to 6.2 per cent of GNP for this year.  That is the kernel of the crisis which besets the VHI and the entire health services. The crisis is fundamentally a problem of resources.  That simple and <Col N="1115" /> inescapable fact cannot be fudged by tinkering with the health system.  I address myself in particular to the parties in Opposition.  If they are genuine in trying to get a health system that is open and available to all, the area of overall funding is the fundamental core.  To pretend to care by picking at the peripheral issues without addressing that core issue is to try to delude the public.</P>
    <P>Last October I gave a comprehensive run-down of the results of this Government's cuts.  I cited the hospitals that were closed, the beds that were closed, the staff who were disemployed and all the agencies that were reduced in function. The only item I have to add to that list is that the crisis continues.  Further squeezes are being now put on health boards in every part of the country.  The crisis surfaces in various ways as health boards try to grapple with the problem of lack of money.  You have today's issue in the south-east, for example, the centralisation of the food preparation in each county, which is creating great difficulties in many areas and will cause significant job losses.  Day by day the implications of these cuts are becoming all too visible to anybody who has any care at all about health and the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party position remains completely unaltered and 7 per cent must be the target if we are to have an adequate health system.  Within that target there can be some prospect of providing a service for all the people who are in need.  For the Labour Party the only acceptable criterion is that care must be provided for those who need it and not only for those who can afford it.  I appeal, even at this late stage, in particular to the Progressive Democrats who seem to have the opportunity to save this amendment or vote it down, to join the other Opposition parties in voting down the Government amendment.  I appeal to all in Opposition in this House to join with the Labour Party, to stand back and decide that as a civilised country we must finance, resource and allow a health system to develop for all the people of this nation. <Col N="1116" /> The only amendment on the Order Paper tonight which seeks to do that, to address the core issue, is in the name of Labour Party Deputies.  I sincerely believe that the time for shadow boxing and rhetoric is over.  We must now begin to think of all those people, elderly and young, who seek to have their illnesses addressed by a caring and compassionate Government and a caring and compassionate health service.  We owe it to all of these to provide the resources to do that.  It is not too late to step back from the path of Thatcherite savagery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>My townsman and I will, no doubt, peel off our coats outside the House afterwards.  I understand that the truth can be provocative for Deputy Howlin.  I understand that the truth can sometimes pain Deputy Howlin.  He was not a party to the administrative errors which led to the present demise of the VHI and he cares, if we believe what he says.  I can understand that the debacle left by the predecessor of the present Minister in office pains him.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the two hi-tech hospitals, which all of us here who have tried to analyse the difficulties of the VHI agree were instrumental in causing them, came on stream while Deputy Desmond was in office.  Schemes D and E came on stream, too, while Deputy Desmond was in office.  Those are the facts and they are irrefutable.  Deputy Desmond was in office when cost escalation started to become a problem for the VHI and it is a historical fact that, while the Coalition were in office in 1986, the board of the VHI approached the Department of Health requesting an increase of the order of 8 per cent in premia.  This were refused by the Minister.  In a characteristic act of Coalition cowardice, they ran away from the problem.  That is the basis of the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that I am amazed at the heights of hypocrisy to which Deputy Howlin clambers on each and every occasion on which he rises majestically to his feet in this House.  He spoke of the VHI's bureaucracy as being too great.  If that is the case now, that was also the <Col N="1118" /> case in 1986.  His party and the party who were in an odd sort of partnership with his party at that time in Government did nothing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <P>Those are the facts. Deputy Howlin spoke also about the perks available to the employees of State-sponsored bodies.  He suggested that they be cut.  Perhaps that is so.  Many of us have views on those perks.  All the perks that we mentioned were in place in 1986 when Labour were in office and they did nothing about them.</P>
      <P>The only solutions Deputy Howlin put forward to this House tonight to the problem which faces VHI were characteristically fatuous.  He wants to sack more of the VHI staff and renege on agreements negotiated in free collective bargaining between the board and management of the VHI and the trade union movement.  I hope his brothers in the trade union movement will pay close attention to and note carefully what he said and his response in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose those solutions.  Those are Deputy Howlin's propositions, not mine.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office, they were presented with an extremely serious financial position in the VHI and that is an irrefutable fact.  We may wish to avoid that fact.  Our friends on the opposite benches occasionally are very good at avoiding facts, but that is a fact. It was made clear by the Minister tonight that the VHI's accounts for the year which ended just before the change of Government gave no real indication of the underlying problems in the organisation. It was made clear, too, that had the increases which were sought in 1986 been allowed, they would have carried through the accounts in 1986, 1987 and 1988 and the VHI would not face the crisis they are facing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> The Minister for Health must be complimented on his approach to the problem he inherited.  He acted not only quickly but decisively.  He has also taken great care to ensure that the problems of the VHI are properly investigated in depth. He was castigated for this by Deputy Howlin.</P>

      <P>What would Deputy Howlin have, a shallow investigation of these problems?  It took years for the VHI to get into these difficulties and they cannot be overcome by the fatuous solutions suggested by Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>These are the chief points when considering the Fine Gael motion and the Minister's amendment to it. The measures in the VHI recovery plan are unpalatable but they are based on expert actuarial assessment of every aspect of VHI schemes.  For each problem that has been identified an appropriate solution has been recommended and is in process of being implemented.  These are the facts and we cannot avoid them.  We cannot live in a world of fantasy and walk away from reality.  The drugs refund scheme presented particular problems for the VHI.  We did not have to wait until today to learn that this was the case.  The problem has been well illustrated for the House and was acknowledged last night by Deputy O'Malley, who also suggested that there was no alternative to withdrawing this benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will deny that for many people the cost of drugs and medicines which may be needed on a continual basis is a very significant burden; in some cases it is an unbearable burden.  We are all aware of such cases.  The Minister has acknowledged that the available schemes, even including the VHI scheme, have many deficiencies.  He is not the only person to have looked at this matter and acknowledged that these deficiencies overlap and that there is a degree of unnecessary bureaucracy.  The emphasis now will be on ensuring that <Col N="1120" /> the available resources are distributed more equitably and more efficiently amongst those in greatest need.  Surely that is a course of action which should recommend itself to any caring or thinking person.  There will also be general agreement with the Minister's view that some way must be found to avoid people having to pay for their drugs in full, especially in cases where this can amount to many hundreds of pounds per month, as in the case of those needing treatment for kidney problems.  It is wrong that such people should have to wait many months to have the outlay refunded.</P>
    <P>The programme of cost containment which the VHI have now begun is the first stage in a longer-term strategy.  We do not know what the future will bring in terms of competition in health insurance but it is important that the VHI should be in a strong position to meet any challenge which may emerge.  Unless we are to oversee the final destruction and demise of the VHI, which for all its warts has served the nation well, we have no option but to take the route proposed by the Minister and contained in the recovery programme.  Until recently there was little perception by the VHI or by those providing services to it of the need for cost consciousness.  The Minister has spoken at length on this matter.  The same was true in general of the public health service, and the Minister's record in ensuring cost consciousness is to be commended, not condemned.  The challenge for public and private health services alike is to ensure maximum efficiency so that the limited resources available can be used to the greatest benefit of the consumer.  The Minister has detailed recommendations from the consultants for the future strategy of the VHI.  He will have related advice to take into account from the commission on health funding. At least the available options have been carefully assessed.  We were not in that position heretofore.  Under the previous Government, decisions with major implications for the VHI were avoided and ducked.  That is not the present position.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Howlin has returned to the House.  I have put some of the facts <Col N="1121" /> on the record.  The Deputy was characteristically flamboyant in his condemnation of the Minister for Health.  He forgot that the same Minister has opened the new hospital at Beaumont and has ensured that we have new facilities in Mullingar, Cavan and Castlebar.  The Minister has also been pushing for additional building for hospitals in Wexford, at Ardkeen and in Sligo.  Deputy Howlin failed to mention that the Minister has provided for new equipment and facilities at St. James's Hospital.  He omitted to take into his consciousness the fact that the health services, like any other public service, have ultimately to be paid for.  Every time Deputy Howlin speaks on this issue he avoids that fact. Fatuous solutions such as the ones he suggested tonight &mdash; chop a few jobs in the VHI, cut the odd perk here and there &mdash; would have at best a marginal impact. Fatuous suggestions do not solve difficult problems.  Pray God Deputy Howlin will never hold the health portfolio.  If that day ever arrives there will be no health service the next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to all the contributors to this important debate.  It is evident that there is consensus on many matters relating to the VHI.  The primary purpose of this motion was to secure some relief for some of the 68,000 people who submit out-patient claims to the VHI.  I wish to express my gratitude to Opposition Deputies and parties who have indicated that they would be prepared to support our motion, having dealt with their own preferred amendments, even though they would not agree with all aspects of Fine Gael health policy.  They see this motion as an opportunity to give some relief to those patients unfortunate enough to be afflicted with a long-term illness.  I should like to place on record my gratitude to the Independent Deputies, The Workers' Party and the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plight of these patients has now been left to the tender mercies of this Minister for Health.  In recent days the Minister has shown concern about all the problems we and others have raised, yet <Col N="1122" /> again his response is another review.  This time he is reviewing the drugs scheme. In the few months that I have been Fine Gael spokesman on Health we have seen several issues arise.  There has been a review of health funding and a review of a multiplicity of areas of administration, involving everything from drugs formulations to computerisation.  We have seen major issues referred for review.  We have no effective dental service for adults who are medical card holders &mdash; 1.9 million people.  The Minister of State has produced an excellent report on the dental service, stating that health boards are failing in their statutory duty to provide a service.  The report has not been acted upon.  There was an anticipation among many people in the health services that something would be provided in the budget but there was nothing.  We have had a review but no action.  There is a demographic pattern which suggests that between now and the turn of the century there will be a 7 per cent increase in the population aged over 70.  We need to plan now for that eventuality.  We set up a review and we had a very comprehensive report on care for the elderly.  The review was chaired by Joe Robins and the fine report contained carefully costed recommendations for district nursing panels and so on.  There was no response.</P>
    <P>I have become a bit cynical about these reviews.  A review represents a kick to touch rather than a prelude to action.  I was rather puzzled as to why this was and I was beginning to think that maybe the Minister for Health did not attend Cabinet meetings any more.  Maybe the health portfolio was not being put across especially when we saw that other Departments could get more money. Special measures were introduced to deal with anomalies in the budget for social welfare and yesterday we were told that £15 million had been allocated to renovate local authority houses.  There will be more money in the capital programme for the Department of the Environment. The Government backed off from a major confrontation with the teachers' union in relation to a circular but every <Col N="1123" /> time health is mentioned a hard line is adopted and there is no surrender.</P>
    <P>The reality of the health services under the Government was clearly laid down by the Taoiseach last Sunday.  He was asked if the Minister for Health would provide a safety net for people seriously affected by the drugs refund decision and according to <i>The Irish Times</i> he said: &ldquo;No, the Minister will not do that.  The Estimates are separate and there is no question of adding services.&rdquo;  That at least has the merit of being straight and lays on the line the lack of priority the Government give to health.  Even if more resources are available health will not feature as part of a rising tide.</P>
    <P>The Government tragically have shown a heartless and callous disregard for the poorer sections of our community who are weakened by disability and terminal and long term illnesses dealt with in this motion.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the Government's amendment.  On first reading one would say that Amendment a1 is not unreasonable, that the VHI are a semi-State body and should have their own independence.  However, the VHI were formed in 1957 and have not been independent since then.  On page 1 of <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday, the Taoiseach is reported as saying that the VHI are independent but on page 10 of the same paper the Secretary of the Department of Health, Mr. Liam Flanagan, at a conference organised by the Irish Hospitals Consultants' Association is reported as saying that derogation would be sought because the VHI were an essential arm of public service policy.  I rang the VHI to find out the role of successive Governments in their relationship with the VHI. I have a very strong suspicion that the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, and every Minister for Health since have taken a very active interest and role in the VHI.  I have a deep suspicion &mdash; I will put it no stronger &mdash; that a number of different proposals were put forward by the VHI, the Government and the Department of Health and that these were carefully studied.  The 1967 <Col N="1124" /> Act clearly sets out the role of the Minister, the Government and the VHI. Section 4 (1) clearly states that the board will produce policies at the behest of the Minister as the Minister may from to time specify.  Any other plans they wish to bring forward can only go ahead with the specific consent of the Minister for Health.  The VHI are an essential part of public health policy and that cannot be ignored when the going gets tough.  If a new benefits scheme was being announced there would be a rush of Ministers to tell us what a good thing it was and how it reflected Government policies. When it is bad news it is a different story.  With respect, the Minister's amendment does not stand up to scrutiny. He tried to mislead the public by maintaining he had no alternative but to accept the VHI's recovery programme as submitted under the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The word does not cause any difficulty for me because there is a pretence that the Government are powerless in this situation.  Under the Act successive Ministers for Health have seen it as their role to treat the VHI as an integral part of public health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the role of the Progressive Democrats in this debate. They have disgraced themselves over the last two days.  They have shamefully turned their backs on the sick and compounded their confusion of yesterday, their cowardice of last night, by not telling the truth today.  I should like to deal with that at some length and quite specifically.  I was astonished by their amendment which I received at lunchtime yesterday.  It reflects a lack of study of the problem.  I have been very concerned for some time about the plight of asthma sufferers and I specifically studied the cost of extending asthma to the long term illness scheme.  I have had two meetings with the asthma society to see if I could pressurise the Minister for Health <Col N="1125" /> into doing something.  The cost of doing so would be £10 million per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <P>We must also add the cost of heart disease and cancer and other unspecified long term illnesses.  The minimum cost would be £30 million.  The total cost in 1987 of the State drugs refund scheme was a little over £10 million.  That is not the scheme one would logically pick because it is so expensive that the Minister for Health and anyone with experience will tell you that most CEOs of health boards in dealing with people with a long term illness card prefer to give them a medical card instead because it is cheaper to give them free GP and free GMS drugs cover.  Why?  Because of the crazy system in relation to drugs.  If a person gets drugs on a medical card the chemist will get £1.24 whether the drug costs £100 or £1.  Under the long term illness scheme, there is a 50 per cent mark up to the pharmacist.</P>

The reality of putting every long term illness into the scheme is completely unviable.  This amendment was concocted at lunchtime yesterday in confusion and panic &mdash; and all of that from a party who lectured us on public expenditure. Last night Deputy O'Malley was even-handed in his approach.  Today the truth was dispensed with very economically. I clearly heard Deputy Mary Harney say in response to Myles Dungan in an interview on the &ldquo;Today at Five&rdquo; programme when he asked would she support the Fine Gael motion, most probably, yes.  To paraphrase her, she said she would support moves to prevent hardship being inflicted on those people.  She made it quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have in front of me a press release from the Fine Gael Party dated 11 January which states that the Fine Gael front bench decided on that date to table the following motion for the first Private Members' time when the Dáil resumed:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to ensure that the VHI Recovery Programme is altered so as to rescind the decision to abolish the Drugs Refund Scheme by availing of alternative policy options which would remove cross subsidisation of plans and allow a more acturial approach to Health Insurance.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I put the mirror to his face and show him what the reality is.  My real disappointment lies with the Government.  The purpose behind putting down this motion was not to score political points but rather to get some justice for those who had been in receipt of funds from the scheme since 1967 and who are not responsible for the present financial problems of the VHI.  If one looks at the accounts of the VHI for 1985 and for the year 1987-88, when all the trouble started, one will see that the operation of the drugs refund scheme did not contribute to the present financial problems.</P>
      <P>Let us take a look at the position of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Under the heading &ldquo;Caring for Basic Values&rdquo; on pages 51 and 52 of the party's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> they made a commitment, leaving aside the fact that the Taoiseach instructed that posters stating that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped should be put up in every part of this country, to take immediate steps to streamline the administration of the health services, to reduce costs and provide more effective care.  They also said they would search out ways to improve the system for individuals and that an example was the problem of sufferers from long term illnesses using the drugs refund scheme who were expected to make large outlays on drugs each month.  They stated that most of this money was eventually refunded by the State, but having to provide money for several months was often difficult for limited eligiblity patients.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond always made it clear that when those luxury hospitals came on stream, the Mater and Blackrock private clinics, as a point of principle they would have to be self-financing. To try to ensure this he introduced plans D and E.  He effectively controlled the level of expenditure of the Blackrock Private Clinic by limiting them to full cover on only 50 beds out of a total of 100 beds.  What happened within two weeks of the Minister for Health coming into office?  He opened the sluice gates and allowed full cover on the additional 50 beds.  In effect, cost control immediately went out the window.  Then we come to the Mater Private Clinic and here I will not refer to the friendly relations between members of the Government and members of the Mater.  It is a fine hospital with many dedicated staff.  When it was known that there was not enough money to cater for those seeking treatment under plans B and C, the Government sanctioned a substantial premium increase.  At the behest of this Government the VHI may even argue for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> We need no lectures on the degree to which Deputy Desmond was responsible from the Government especially when we see the favourable treatment they gave to those luxury hi-tech private hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Government are quite happy to stand over the present position in which people who are chronically ill have to pay up to £7 per week for drugs.  Last night Deputy O'Malley claimed that this did not amount to much of a hardship because when we deduct £170 from the cost of the drugs most people have to pay only about £4 per week.  With respect, such is his ignorance that he is not aware that figure of £170 includes total out-patient expenditure which means that each time a person pays £10 or more to a doctor that £10 can be taken into account as part of the excess policy.  The recovery programme is to come into effect today.  The Government have had almost two years to do something about this problem.  It is bad enough having problems but leaving them unrectified leads to accumulated losses.  It is inexplicable that the Minister took so long to deal with this problem and there is a direct relationship between that delay and the severity of the package.  As a result 40,000 families who are a soft target are now to be deprived of that refund.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity in this House tonight, limited though it is &mdash; as Deputy Howlin said, it deals with only one small area of the health services &mdash; to demand that something useful should be done.  I have been very flexible throughout this <Col N="1132" /> debate.  I pointed out that there are three State drugs refund schemes and if the Minister came forward with a subsidy scheme which reduced the threshold from £28 to £10 we would wholeheartedly support him.  We did not say it should be confined to the VHI.  What we are trying to do is to relieve the hardship on those families.  The Minister indicated that he might meet us but the cold hand of the Taoiseach came back at the week-end and there was no prospect of any assistance. In the same way for a waiting list of 50,000 &mdash; we are talking of the poorest people &mdash; the dental service was abolished effectively.</P>
    <P>The choice facing us tonight is a simple one for the Progressive Democrats.  It is whether the Opposition, a majority in this Dáil, are going to combine to ensure some relief and some hope for those families to put pressure on the Government to do something for them.  Are they to languish between amendments?  Are they to be lost in the finer print?  Are we to see a reneging on earlier commitments? We would not have put down this motion unless we had a full expectation that the statements of all Opposition parties meant something when the recovery programme was first announced.</P>
    <P>Every political party said they were opposed to the abolition of the drugs refund scheme.  I appeal to all Opposition Deputies to unite, in the first instance oppose the Government's amendment and then support the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' Business I had just completed my remarks on the mineral exploration front.  I shall now deal with the ESB.  At the time of the completion of the Report of the Inquiry into Electricity Prices in May 1985 industrial electricity prices in Ireland were somewhere in the region of 20-30 per cent higher than the EC average.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years since the publication of that report there has been a series of significant reductions in electricity prices to all sectors.  The impact of these reductions is such that electricity prices to Irish industry are now in line with the EC average and domestic prices lie below the EC average.  The intention is to at least hold electricity prices at their present level until 1992.</P>
      <P>With the approach of 1992 the importance of improving the competitiveness of Irish industry cannot be emphasised strongly enough.  The effect of electricity costs on this competitiveness is something which my Department are keenly aware of.  Every effort is being made to help Irish industry through holding electricity prices at their present level or indeed reducing them even further if possible.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recently enacted Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1988, the ESB are now allowed to set up subsidiary companies. This affords the ESB considerable opportunities in the ancillary aspects of their operations in which they have built up a wide degree of experience over the years. Already, I have given my approval to the setting up of a number of companies.  The incorporation of these companies forms a major part of the board's contribution to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I am confident that they will meet the ambitious targets they have set themselves.</P>
      <P>Bord na Mona's contribution to the national economic development of this country has been significant for more than four decades.  However, in recent years major problems confroned the company.  The board realises that in order to address their financial losses they must make the maximum return from the exploitation of their existing peat resources at an economic cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The Turf Development Bill, 1988, which I introduced recently in this House will, as Deputies are aware, allow Bord na Mona greater flexibility in their operations thus restoring their core business to a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>Last year the House will recall my predecessor commissioned consultants to undertake a study into all of Bord na Mona's operations.  The onus will be on the consultants to address the latest peat development technology here and outside the State and to recommend the necessary changes that are required in order to restore the company to viability. Until this report is received and examined in my Department no break-up of the company will be contemplated.</P>
    <P>The availability of natural gas has significantly improved Ireland's balance of payments.  It is estimated that natural gas has resulted in cumulative savings of £1.6 billion on fuel imports since 1980.  Natural gas now accounts for about 15 per cent of Ireland's primary energy requirements. Irish gas prices to industry are among the lowest in Europe and have significantly aided the competitiveness of that sector.</P>
    <P>Kinsale Head is at present our sole supply of natural gas.  This will begin to taper off towards the end of the century. Therefore, it is vital that every effort be made to seek and find additional deposits of natural gas to improve our security of supply.  The Marathon exploration programme &mdash; which, as I said earlier, will be getting underway shortly &mdash; is a major development in this regard.</P>
    <P>The matter of interconnection of gas and electricity with the UK or mainland Europe, in the long term, has been examined. It was found that a gas industry based on imported gas could be viable given certain favourable conditions, namely price, sales margins and volumes. But clearly, further indigenous supplies would be the best solution.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Coillte Teoranta reflects the great importance which the Government attached to forestry in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  That programme specified a firm action plan for forestry development which is being <Col N="1140" /> successfully implemented.  The <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i> was also very much concerned to achieve an upturn in the level of employment in the forestry sector.</P>
    <P>The volume of timber now coming on stream and the increased planting rates generated by recent initiatives have provided a springboard for new employment in forestry.  A great deal of this employment is, of course, in the private sector and in the establishment of new contracting firms engaged in planting, harvesting and, indeed, all aspects of forestry.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the potential for future employment is great.  It is worth noting that forestry in particular is one area which literally plants the seeds of employment for the next generation.  The record planting levels of today will provide many jobs over the next 40 years and beyond in forestry and in downstream industries.</P>
    <P>Coillte Teoranta are designed to meet the challenges of the future and to capitalise on the investment made by successive Governments since the establishment of the State.  Coillte Teoranta have commenced operations with a vast asset resource in the shape of the forest estate transferred to it from the Forest Service.  It will have both the freedom to commercially exploit this and a production schedule which practically guarantees a cash break-even point within the next decade.  However that is the very least that will be expected of them.  Indeed I will be setting them challenging targets and monitoring their progress closely.  Coillte Teoranta will be expected to operate on the same lines, to the same criteria as a private company, and much will be achieved in the review of the structure of the present organisation, and a general reorientation of attitudes and procedures towards cost effective management and greater efficiency in operations.  Their operation will be a challenge from the beginning, but one which I know is being tackled with enthusiasm by all concerned, and one with which I look forward to being involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> Apart from the establishment of Coillte Teoranta, there have been other significant developments in forestry since this Government took office, all of which justify our emphasis on this sector as a key national development activity and an idea where further jobs can be created. In 1988, the records for both State and private planting were broken, with 10,000 and 5,000 hectares planted respectively.  Production from State forests continued to increase, and the highest ever volume of timber, at just under 1.5 million cubic metres, was sold in 1988.  The production from State forests can sustain indigenous wood industries with potential and capacity for growth in jobs, import substitution and exports.  The top grade sawmills are all achieving record throughputs and increased business confidence is already translating into increased investment and employment.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing awareness of and confidence in the qualities of Irish timber and the huge import substitution potential of the Irish market.  We currently import £30 million per annum of sawn timber, but the increasing amounts of mature timber scheduled to come onstream from now on will provide plenty of opportunity to capitalise on this lucrative market.  It goes without saying that the production of quality timber is a major requirement, and to encourage this all structural timbers &mdash; both Irish and imported &mdash; now have to meet the requirements set down in the EOLAS Standard Recommendation SR11/88 from 1 January 1989.  This initiative will of course also help in our drive to gain access to markets in the UK and mainland Europe, where common timber standards are being considered in the context of the completion of the single European market.</P>
    <P>The essential element of timber marketing strategies is to ensure that the future development of the Irish timber sector is focused on the needs of the Irish and the international marketplace.  By concentrating on market driven development, by using all the resources of the <Col N="1142" /> State, including the IDA and their company development programme, EOLAS and their technology programme, Coillte Teoranta and their planting, silvicultural and marketing programmes, the industry as a whole can more easily prepare themselves for the challenges and opportunities of 1992.</P>
    <P>The expansion of private forestry is a further support to the timber industry and in this regard is a key element of our forestry programme.  The various grant schemes available to support the private forestry sector were improved and expanded in 1988.  The accelerated forestry programme will require substantial investment and an increase in EC funding is being sought, as forestry meets all the current major objectives of the EC in the areas of regional and national development. Up to now, EC aid for Irish forestry has been confined in the main to private forestry, but significant improvements have been achieved as a result of representations to the EC Commission, and negotiations in the context of the reform of the Structural Funds.  The forestry action programme recently published by the EC is a major initiative which provides Community funding for both public and private forestry.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to forestry in 1989 maintaining the impetus of 1988 on all fronts, and in particular to the new ingredient which will be added by Coillte Teoranta.  The faith in the potential of forestry which supported the long-term investment required in the last 50 years is now bearing fruit and I believe we can look forward to a satisfying development of this priceless national asset both for ourselves and for future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief intervention on the budget and on the general performance of the Government. First, as it is my first time hearing Deputy Smith as Minister, I would like to wish him well in what is a fairly interesting scene.  The last time I met him was at Killa at the drying up of a lake and on that occasion he said he was not the man with the money.  Now he is the man with the money, so let us hope he will come <Col N="1143" /> back and restore that amenity which we do not have too much of; it is one of two lakes in the area.  That is beside the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be glad to know we are making some progress there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. In relation to agriculture I have to blame Teagasc nearly as much as anybody else. It is very dangerous to talk about percentages and averages.  One could have one's nose in the furnace and one's feet in ice and so achieve an average body temperature, but that would not be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>While the dairymen are certainly doing very well, and we do not begrudge them, the grim fact is that there are others who are going through a pretty thin time.  They are still borrowing very heavily.</P>
      <P>The tillage people in particular are having a very tough time.  In all the EC negotiations we seem to have got the worst of both worlds.  We have quotas in dairying where we would probably fare well in regard to prices.  On the other hand, there are prices, and we would be better off being subject to quotas.  We probably have enough grain acreage but we could not compete with the French in price.  I am very much afraid that the super powers in Europe who are very substantial grain growers will try to persuade us to grow grain at £50 a tonne, and that is not on.</P>
      <P>My suggestion is that as far as possible we should try to redress that.  We are an island nation and we would be expected, in time of emergency, to be self-sufficient. We have people who cannot get milk quotas and the beef scene is so marginal that they would not even venture into it &mdash; and would not be financed to get into it anyway; we have substantial areas that are eminently suitable for grain, but unfortunately the margins are getting slimmer and slimmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some horror that I notice we are now starting to chip away at our sugar beet acreage.  We over-produced a few times and sooner or later we will arrive <Col N="1144" /> at a stage where it will not be worth talking about quotas.  We need to keep making those points in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The whole theory behind this much talked about regional plan is that the super powers say they will grant aid countries so that they will be in a position to help themselves; but I am very much afraid that that is just paying lip service. They might try to withhold grant aid from us if they thought we were not going down a particular road.  They are quite ruthless when it comes to what I would consider a worthwhile concession to Ireland, that is, allowing us to work out our own tillage programme.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the over-supply of food and agricultural produce.  We are an agricultural nation and will never be anything else.  We depend, by and large, on agri-exports of one sort or another. This whole surplus problem is a scandal and I often wonder why our MEPs do not make more of an issue of it.  There are whole continents starving and we have to wait until it becomes a crisis before we move in to help.  We hear stories from the various agencies that they do not have enough money to buy food.  If the main participants in the EC withheld only 25 per cent of the money spent on armaments in any one year we could probably feed the bulk of the hungry nations in the third world.  That is a frightening statistic if it is correct, and I am told it is.  We would then be allowed to produce a lot more food which we could send to these continents.  It is all very well talking about teaching people to fish so that they can fend for themselves but that is a long way off for most of these countries.</P>
    <P>The advisory services are vital at present.  A top class advisory service is needed in new areas such as flax, horticulture, onion growing and other worthy projects.  It is a pity the advisory services are being decimated at present. I am glad the Government have woken up at last and are beginning to cop on. Talk of voluntary redundancies and so on sounds very smooth but it all adds up to a decimated service.  I always remember Joe Rea when he was head of the IFA <Col N="1145" /> promising to lead everyone into the promised land but the only one who got there was himself.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about Teagasc.  It is a great organisation and I fully agree with the amalgamation although I could quibble about the name.  I have visited various stations, sheep breeding stations and so on, in the west where money was well spent.  Some of the projects announced in the budget regarding embryo transplants and so on were being undertaken by An Foras Talúntais.  That work was ongoing in Moorepark and also in the horse industry.  Money should be put back into Teagasc.  There were many good ideas in the budget but the one thing we are forgetting is that we still need a lot of guidance.  Experiments need to be carried out but farmers cannot afford to experiment or to mess around with a particular variety of wheat or particular breeds of stock.  That has to be done at a different level.</P>
    <P>I am also peeved about the disadvantaged areas.  The files for those areas have been lying on the Minister's desk for a couple of years and the Minister has yet to tell us that he has made the next move.  I would like to hear from him or from any Minister that something is being done in this regard.  I am glad of the Minister's affirmative response pleases me.  This is one area where a small amount of money would do a lot of good. For some extraordinary reason vast areas of the country were omitted.  Mountainous areas in the Cork region, extending practically into Limerick, should have been included.  Much preliminary work has been done, a small amount of which I was involved in.  We had arrived at a stage where we were ready to present our case in Brussels and I am glad to hear now that we are moving into that arena.</P>
    <P>In regard to horticulture, which is of particular interest to me, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Kirk, on doing a good job in a difficult scene.  I would have to warn him about An Bord Glas.  I am not sure that that board is properly set up as yet.  The Minister gave an undertaking that the board would be structured properly and that has yet to be done.  There <Col N="1146" /> are very strong vested interests in private companies on this board.  It is my view that members of the board are not working in the best interests of horticulture. It is time the Minister should take my advice seriously in regard to the construction of the board.</P>
    <P>As everybody in the House will know the EC is in favour of producer groups. If we are to get any grant aid in the future we must set up producer groups and I am in favour of that.  I know equally well that it is almost impossible to persuade farmers to join producer groups.  If they have a good year they do not want to know about producer groups and if they have a bad year they all rush to the Minister to know what he is going to do about it.  The answer is producer groups.  Basically they are an escape for the Minister because he can tell the farmers to set up producer groups and then he will appoint people to help them to sell their goods.</P>
    <P>As regards horticulture Colm Warren and the IFA have done tremendous work.  They are making great progress and I would like to see that continued.  I am afraid that An Bord Glas who promised so much are, if anything, hindering the progress of our producer groups. There are many other new ventures in agriculture such as flax growing on which a small experiment is taking place at present.  That programme will have to go on for another two years.  It is taking place in conjunction with a Northern Ireland flax processing firm in Sion Mills. That can only prosper and succeed if it gets support, which I do not think it is getting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has just spoken on forestry. We are making progress in this area but we could make much more progress if a few matters were put right.  I have always said that private and co-operative planting has a lot to offer.  The terrible expression &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; is used in this regard.  If the EC are anxious that bad land be set aside, if the aim is to have less grassland, certain areas in the country could be legitimately planted if &mdash; and it is a big if &mdash; the land could be retained in the ownership of the people who already have it and if a decent income could be <Col N="1147" /> paid to these people while the forests are maturing.  In other words, they would be paid to look after their own 70 or 80 acres of forest and when it came to cutting the trees the State, a finance company or a co-op, would be involved.  That is being done on a large scale at present.  Credit must be given to people such as those in the south-west Cork cattle breeding station who have already planted several thousands of acres along those lines.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk in the last week or so about industry and jobs. Certainly there is a crisis as far as jobs are concerned.  Nobody can see the problems better than I can.  I tried many remedies when I was Minister, some of which succeeded and some of which did not.  People should not criticise the IDA or anybody else.  It is very hard to create even one job, because for every job we try to create we will lose another due to technology.</P>
    <P>I can quote one instance not very far from where I live where an industry expanded creating 30 jobs but in another industry about five miles down the road a machine was purchased which resulted in the laying off of 30 people because the machine was able to do the job of 30 people.  That is a pity because the amount being paid to the people involved would not even pay the interest on the cost of the machine.  That machine was used in the food industry and if there was any change in people's tastes that machine would be useless whereas the talents and skills of the 30 people could be changed to cater for that.</P>
    <P>When it comes to industry I believe small is beautiful.  Deputy Colley said this evening it would take a lot to create the jobs that are needed in small industries. It should not be very difficult.  Our major co-operatives which are coming together should break into small groupings and get into the manufacture of cheese or a whole range of horticultural products.  A rabbit industry has been set up in my own constituency, a project which I helped to start.  I do not see any magical solution. Most of the big industries coming into Ireland have a lot of equipment and very few people.  They do not measure up to <Col N="1148" /> job targets.  I am glad the IDA are switching their emphasis at present to grant-aiding jobs rather than equipment and factory costs.  That is very important.  At present a meeting of the captains of industry is taking place &mdash; there are a few that I would not put in even as subs &mdash; but by and large those meetings are useful.  The comment I did not fancy was that they felt that after all the grants they got they were not able to create jobs. They said something to the effect that it was a happy coincidence we have a few jobs.  They have a big responsibility to create jobs and to maintain them at a fairly high level.  After all they have got a large amount of State money, taxpayers' money, and concessions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on both sides of the House, devoted a fair portion of their time to environment matters and to housing schemes.  It is a pity that the Government got rid of the reconstruction grants. They were the best grants ever introduced. If they were still in existence not half the amount of money would be needed for the infill of houses.  More work was done in the villages and towns through the reconstruction grants than by any other means.  Paying somebody £5,000 to get out of a local authority house and allowing good quality local authority houses to be purchased for £8,000 or £9,000 was a great idea.  These are schemes which the Government should consider and perhaps re-introduce. There is no doubt that there is a shortage of houses.  All of us are inundated with people calling to us seeking better houses or seeking to have their existing houses repaired but we have nothing to offer in that regard.</P>
    <P>Enough has been said about roads but I would like to say that in our area they are bad.  It was just as well we did not have too many tourists last year because we would have been embarrassed by the State of our roads.  We had umbelliferae, hedge parsleys and so on.  They were like the cedars of Lebanon meeting in the middle of the roads.  Our cars were not designed to cut hedges, much as that is what seems to be expected of them.  I <Col N="1149" /> would hope that this year we will have proper hedge cutting and at the very minimum the filling of potholes to make the country what it used to be, a place to be proud of it, and so that when tourists come we can take them around and show them the highways and byways.</P>
    <P>There is the sensitive problem in my area of pharmaceutical pollution.  Some of the local authorities are the worst pollutors of all.  Until such time as we take the whole area of treatment plants seriously we have to talk out of the one side of our mouth on pollution.  Human effluent is going into estuaries.  I am glad that the Minister responsible for fisheries is present.  Urban and city effluent is doing infinitely more harm than any pharmaceutical industry.  This is causing very serious pollution in Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>Everywhere around the coast you will see increasing evidence of damage to fish stocks and so on.  There are about 50 pharmaceutical chemical industries in this country.  Independently set standards would stop all the talk about the damage they may or may not do.  We need also independent monitoring and totally independent people in charge.  I would put a special group of graduates on the job and give them the brief to nail down a particular industry if it was causing a problem.  I would insist that every pharmaceutical industry would have a fund set aside, to pay without quibble, so that unfortunate farmers, or anybody else would not be dragged through the courts because they would not be able to fight their case due to insufficient funds.  On the basis that an independent monitor found that crops or stocks were damaged, the responsible party would have to pay up.  As well as that the industry itself would be brought before the courts and would have to pay a hefty fine.  If they insisted on their misdemeanour the State would have the right to turn the key on it because nobody wants that pollution.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about one point made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce about connecting to the European grid so far as the ESB are concerned.  I hope he is not thinking about connecting <Col N="1150" /> us into Sellafield or one of the other clapped out nuclear plants around Europe because I feel very strongly on that issue. When I was on the other side of the House I took a barrage of criticism from this side of the House and rightly so.  The present Taoiseach questioned me about becquerel levels.  Quite honestly I did not know but I gave him the official reply that 300 becquerels were safe.  That was the official reply but the question is, are they safe?  We are in real danger in the northern hemisphere.  The entire southern hemisphere tomorrow morning becquerels as they do not have any nuclear plants.  If I was selling food in the southern hemisphere to morrow morning I would make that point.  I do not think we should have hand, act or part in these power plants, whether in terms of taking electricity or of any other involvement.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that a sovereign super power like Russia would be allowed to operate a clapped out nuclear plant, the fallout from which destroyed our sheep flocks in Wicklow and along the east coast, not to mention the damage it wrought in other parts of the world.  For example, along the whole of the Finnish-Norwegian seaboard, most of those involved in the production of deer meat are out of business because that was their livelihood.</P>
    <P>Our strongest line into Europe is that we have clean food.  I am delighted that both the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, are sticking strictly to the idea of no hormones.  That might be all right in cattle but if the German housewife says she want meat without added hormones and if she is prepared to pay £6 per lb for it, we must give it to her.  We should not apologise to Americans or to anybody else because meat is something we can produce better than anybody else.  That is where our future and out market lies and we should defend and guard it in so far as we can.</P>
    <P>In relation to difficulties with the planning laws, we blame the planning officers but these people are merely working under the planning laws and these laws <Col N="1151" /> badly need a shake up.  We hear a great deal about ribbon planning.  It is almost impossible to get a house built now because of all the difficulties that are put in the way.  You are told, for instance, that you are upsetting the skyline &mdash; what nonsense &mdash; or that there is a problem of a proliferation of septic tanks and so on. We could have a proliferation of many other problems if people are lumped together as in the case of Ballymun and many other such places.  I would much prefer to see people living in the place of their choice and being given an opportunity to go out into suburbs, into the rural areas where sites are cheap, where farmers are delighted to sell.  If you had 20 acres of furzeland it is grand to get rid of it, to get money for it and keep the bank manager quiet.  We are prevented from doing that because of planning laws. It is high time we had a second look at those laws and to think in terms of, perhaps, communal septic tanks.  There are various items that could be looked at but for God's sake let us ease up so far as building houses is concerned and then jobs will be created.  A lot more houses could be built then than are being built today.</P>
    <P>Regarding health I am worried about one or two items.  There is a certain type of old folk I am very concerned about and they are the people who are being put out of welfare homes, where those places are being closed.  Those concerned are being sent home to empty, cold houses.  They are told they can go to private nursing homes or hospitals.  They cannot afford to do so.  Most private establishments charge in the region of £150 per week, but these people have only £80 to £90 per week.  The Minister for Health should show some concern for those people and try to ensure that we are not making their lives miserable during their last days and that they have some comfort such as they were used to in the welfare homes.  I ask the Minister to look specifically at this issue.</P>
    <P>We have just had a debate on the VHI. I do not believe there should be a cut off point for PRSI.  Whatever a man's <Col N="1152" /> income is, he should pay PRSI on it and qualify for full medical treatment.  I will explain why I think this should be so. I know somebody who joined the VHI recently because his income had gone over the £16,000 limit due to working overtime.  One of his children had a problem and the VHI told him that, because the child had the problem before the family joined the VHI, the child was not covered.  The husband had dermatitis before he joined and again he was told that as he had dermatitis before he joined, this condition also was not covered.  What good is the VHI to that family?  I would like to see a single system in which everybody paid irrespective of income and was covered for every illness. After all, £16,000 might be worth only £14,000 the following year.  Many people on an income of £16,000 are not very well off.</P>
    <P>Another total waste of funds is what I call the disability benefit scandal.  A patient goes to his doctor and is examined, is then referred to a specialist who further examines him and agrees that the patient is unfit for work.  However, that patient has then to go before a departmental medical referee, and the departmental doctor may tell him that he is fit for work. This to-ing and fro-ing goes on and that system is a little bit unfair.  Basically it is just tying the matter up in knots.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment very briefly on fisheries.  The rod licence issue will have to be sorted out.  We have created a problem where none existed.  The matter will have to be sorted out, and sorted out very quickly.  As somebody who lives beside the sea I have a personal view on monofilament nets.  Monofilament nets will have to be taken seriously.  They are being used.  To say that a fisherman can use any other sort of a net except a monofilament net is like telling a farmer to go out ploughing with horses.  Ways and means can be found to regulate the amount of fish caught and we are doing this in the case of herring.  This issue must be taken seriously.  A helicopter should be put on a protection vessel and left there, because that is the place for it.  The fishermen would be on our side if the <Col N="1153" /> helicopter were put to effective use.  The helicopter is made for the job of keeping our waters safe from intrusion.</P>
    <P>I hope that my speech was constructive. My main point is that there is not a better way, as the only way is the hard way.  We have a long way to go before we can be complacent.  This Parliament was set up so that everybody could work together for the betterment of the country.  That has been my view always and I would like to think that in my lifetime we will see this country begin to prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his first budget.  I believe that his contribution and that of the Government to the preparation of the budget will go down in the records of the country as one of the most imaginative contributions we have ever seen for many a year.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister have been criticised on the basis that not enough was done in this field or that but I think it was a case of going out to play a match with one hand tied behind their back.  This was due to the fact that we have a national debt which built up over the years and which has been strangling Governments down through the years.  It had to be tackled.  When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1987 the first real attempts to tackle the financial problems started.  In doing this, the Government took many harsh decisions.  The Opposition were wise enough to realise that those decisions had to be taken if &ldquo;Ireland Limited&rdquo; was to remain a sovereign State.  We succeeded in that and I believe we are continuing to succeed.  People are prepared to accept that the Government have to take harsh decisions every day. Nobody in politics likes to be other than popular but we have now reached a stage where Governments are not going to be popular in the years ahead.  We have seen Governments fail to tackle the problems down through the years and now this Government have set about tackling the problems.</P>
      <P>We have problems with unemployment, inflation and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> Indeed, we can look back and say we have wasted many of the resources we have had down through the years.  Our greatest resources was probably our youth.  We had many well educated young people coming onstream and seeking employment who were unable to find a future here.  They were forced to emigrate. Indeed the Taoiseach, like every Member of this House, admits that emigration and unemployment are probably the two greatest scourges of the eighties. However, if we had not tackled the problem, I believe the country would have been facing more serious difficulties by the nineties.</P>
    <P>We are facing towards 1992.  This will have a major bearing on the single market which is of great importance to us.  It is important that we face that with confidence, determination and with a united front.  There is no use in Members coming into the House to criticise Government decisions on seeking moneys from Europe.  The Government have done well.  Indeed, when we look back and see the actions the Government have taken in the past two budgets, we see that we are moving towards the type of economy that will be in a position to provide for our young people.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the Exchequer borrowing requirements.  In 1982 we borrowed £1,945 million or 15.6 per cent of GNP, while in 1989 we will borrow £1,057 million or 5.3 per cent of GNP.  When you compare these figures you see that the problem is now being tackled.  In 1986, the last year of the Coalition Government, £2,145 million or 12.9 per cent of GNP was borrowed.  We have a duty as elected politicians to see to it that the country is put back on its feet, that problems are tackled and that our finances are put in order.  The Government are to be complimented on the action they have taken in the past two years in dealing with the problem.  When you consider that today Ireland has the lowest inflation rate of any member state in the EC, it makes you wonder what would have happened if the problems had not been tackled.  Look at the actions taken by the previous Minister for Finance, Mr. <Col N="1155" /> Ray MacSharry, my former constituency colleague.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in his appointment as European Commissioner with responsibility for agriculture.  He knows the problems and I have no doubt that he will use his energies and ability at European level to see that Ireland gets a fair and equitable share of the European cake.</P>
    <P>Our current budget deficit is unacceptable. In the coming years the Government will have to continue to cut the deficit if we are to remain competitive. If we are to retain an economic base for industry we will have to tackle the problems and continue to put in the boot, irrespective of whom it may hurt. It is hurting everybody from the poor to the wealthiest in the country.  When we look at salaries and then at taxation levels, we see that taxation is penal.  At least people are now prepared to give this a try and they are prepared to give the Government an opportunity to put the State finances right.  They are prepared to pay their taxes at present but they will not continue to pay them indefinitely.  If the medicine does not work, I believe we are heading towards anarchy.</P>
    <P>We have the lowest interest rates for many years, approximately 5 to 6 per cent lower than those of our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  Anybody who would have said that was possible four or five years ago would have been thought mad. That has happened because Government have been effective.  They are setting about doing the job.  The savings of people with regard to mortgages, and industrial savings on interest alone, lead us to believe that a new confidence in the Irish economy is being born.  In 1988 our exports were the highest in the history of the State.  We had the highest surplus of exports over imports ever.  They have been increasing for the past two years, but can increase further in the years ahead.  The growth rates are more than expected.  A growth rate of 3 per cent is being forecast for this year.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach said that the Government had four priorities in <Col N="1156" /> framing the budget.  The first was to continue the strict control on Government spending and borrowing.  Everybody in this House is agreed that these had to be controlled.  If you allow a car out on the road without brakes, it will eventually crash into a wall and this country had reached that stage.  Politicians have a duty to attack poverty, because there is real poverty in this country whether people want to admit it or not.</P>
    <P>This budget was an attempt to alleviate the poverty that we as public representatives see every day of the week. All of us have people coming into our political clinics who are hardship cases. We have a duty, where possible, to try to eliminate the poverty traps.  People may say that we have not done enough, and we have had correspondence in our post in the past week from various lobby groups telling us this, but I ask those lobby groups where the resources are to come from to do any more.  We cannot increase taxation because the country is already taxed out of existence.  The Government have done quite well in this regard.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of personal taxation, which aggrieves everybody. When you realise the rates of tax in other countries which to us look unbelievable, you wonder why ours cannot be like them.  The fact is that we have had to pay so much in repayments on Government borrowings down the years that, until such time as we are able to repay our foreign debts, we will not be in a position to do anything about taxation in general and personal taxation in particular.  We hear people saying that company taxation is too high and is preventing us from attracting foreign industry.  I do not believe that this is so.  The 10 per cent tax rate is probably a little lower than it should be, but personal taxation is much higher than we can afford and much higher than it should be.  It must be tackled in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Government over the past two years have been of enormous proportions.  They have made enormous strides in improving the state of the country. With the great growth that has <Col N="1157" /> occurred in industrial exports, we are now heading towards the position of being able to provide further work at home for many of those who have emigrated. Those people did not emigrate by choice.  They were forced to emigrate because there was nothing at home for them.  We have a duty to try to bring about circumstances which will make it possible for them to return and make a living here.</P>
    <P>We are bound to take action with regard to taxation.  The action taken by the Minister for Finance in the budget is the first move towards improving the personal taxation situation.  It has been said that it is not enough, but this is the first time that we have seen the rate of tax reduced and we have seen the tax bands widened and other adjustments made which will benefit the people. There is the introduction of the child allowances with regard to taxation.  The Government are committed to plug tax loopholes which have been exploited.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill we will see action taken to deal with some of the problems that have been created.  The reduction in the personal rate of tax is the first that we have had in 20 years.  It is only 2 per cent, but at least it is a move in the right direction.  Rather than allowing the taxation system to run riot, with the net result of prohibitive wage increases being sought, Government action on tax will mean that people will be prepared to accept, and will have to accept, very modest wage increases in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>If we are to compete against our European partners by 1922, we must now realise that we have to take and seek minimal increases and see to it that there is the minimum of labour disruption and strikes.  I welcome the recent action of the trade unions in coming together.  It was ridiculous that this country had over 90 unions fighting for membership and each trying to be more militant than the other to create a climate that would attract new members.  The trade unions, in their wisdom, having gone into the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> have <Col N="1158" /> decided that there is no future for militancy as far as our industry and workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we have seen a net increase in employment.  In 1988 there was a net increase of approximately 6,000 people; after a fall from 1982 to 1987 of 60,000 odd, it is welcome to see that the graph has risen.  The growth is not fast enough for anybody but if Government policy continues as it is the benefits will come in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>There are some very welcome changes in the budget with regard to the social welfare code.  Nobody here would begrudge the increases being given to the long term unemployed.  They have been given increases in the past two years of approximately 25 per cent.  This is an attempt by Government to take them out of the trap that they are in.  With the tax changes, those who are on lower incomes will benefit greatly from this budget.  I welcome the widower's and deserted husbands' allowances paid in cases where people are entitled to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome move by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government.  The increases, while only 3 per cent to old age pensioners, are above the rate of inflation.  They have also free electricity, free fuel allowance, free telephone and free television licence.  These are major benefits in kind which they appreciate and they will not <Col N="1159" /> begrudge a higher rate of increase to the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The social welfare problem is now being tackled and the action by the Government in this sphere will be long remembered.  People in other countries envy the rates we pay to our old age pensioners, which are well ahead of those paid in the United Kingdom.  We have a welfare system which is one of the best in the world.  There is a certain amount of abuse but that problem is being tackled and major benefits will accrue to those who genuinely need to be looked after. The deterrents which have been put in place will prevent spurious claims.</P>
      <P>The provision of extra money for our roads is of major importance.  The road system has been allowed to deteriorate to an unbelievable extent.  The Minister for the Environment has been called some nasty things in this House but we should consider what he inherited and what he has achieved since coming into office.  The outgoing Coalition Government provided £6.5 million for county roads in 1987.  This budget provides £47.4 million for them.  People are entitled to a reasonable road to their house, farm or local town, regardless of whether they live one mile or 25 miles from a national primary road.  This is the first attempt to bring our county roads up to standard. Probably the most important aspect of the budget for those living in rural areas is the provision of an extra £10 million on top of the Estimate provision for county and regional roads.  Some of our national primary roads would be classed as third grade roads in many other European countries.</P>

If we are to attract anybody to rural Ireland we will have to provide reasonable roads out of the cities.  I live in a county which has only 26 miles of national primary road.  Every other road is a county road. We need the extra money, as do other counties.  For many years we had an inadequate telephone service but now we have probably the best telephone system in Europe.</P>

      <P>We need by-passes around many of our towns.  One often spends half an hour trying to get through a town at certain times of the day.  There is a need to upgrade some roads, especially in my county.  I am refering particularly to the road from Dromod to Swanlinbar and Enniskillen and the road from Carrick-on-Shannon to Drumshanbo, Manorhamilton and Bundoran.  The first of these roads has never been given its rightful status as a national primary or national secondary road.  The second road to which I refer could, if developed, cut 25 or 30 miles off the journey from Dublin to Donegal.  When one considers all the vehicles which take that route per year the saving in motor fuel alone would be considerable.  We should pay a special tribute to the Minister for the Environment for his actions in regard to our roads.</P>

    <P>This budget is the first attempt to create an environment which will encourage industrial development and thereby tackle the problem of unemployment. Approximately 240,000 people are unemployed, many of them highly skilled. Some have considered the possibility of emigrating but in many cases they have been forced to stay due to family circumstances and situations beyond their <Col N="1161" /> control.  Even the Opposition are aware that it is not easy to create jobs.</P>

      <P>I thought it was.  The tourist industry is now being tackled, we have advantages in relation to tourism which have never been exploited.

      <P>I do not understand that coming from a man of Deputy Boylan's intelligence.  I presume, like all Members of the House, he read the Bill prior to it being put before the House.  There are people outside the House who are using the rod licence dispute as a way of creating political aggro and interfering with the tourist industry.  Thankfully in my county we have had no problems, although people tried to import them by coming 50 and 60 miles to put up &ldquo;no fishing&rdquo; notices.  However, the people of Leitrim dealt with this by removing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair to interfere with the livelihood of others in angling and tourism. Many of the people concerned should realise that the licence fees being sought are of a nominal nature.  If people do not want to pay it directly they should pay it through their own angling club.  Massive amounts of money are being lost in tourism revenue to people who badly need it. Small guest house owners, small publicans and businesses in the small towns <Col N="1162" /> and villages, especially in my area, are badly affected by the dispute.  These people seem to think they are on some kind of crusade and it is time they abandoned it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ellis certainly had a hard neck to mention potholes because in my county the potholes are craters.  The reason is that the Government halved the allocation of money that the outgoing Government provided two years ago.  Fianna Fáil should hang their heads at the mention of potholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a fairly negative budget the most <Col N="1163" /> surprising omission to me as a Border Deputy was the lack of mention of 1992 and its implications for everyone.  I would have thought that in 1989, the year 1992 would have been of paramount importance to the Government but it hardly merits a mention in the budget.  The whole question of equalisation and harmonisation of VAT and excise duties has been ignored.  The Government should have given very serious consideration to this matter as there must be preparation for the most important event of the century. If we do not prepare for 1992 we will be unable to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities which will present themselves.  We must be able to maximise those opportunities but, as I said, it barely rates a mention in the budget, which is very disappointing.  I will not slag the Government on the budget because it has been a fairly benevolent one, it gives a little and takes a little.</P>
    <P>There have been impassioned cries from different parts of the country in relation to social welfare and the level of poverty.  However, most of that poverty is self inflicted and emanates from unbelievable abuse of the national lottery.  A country that can spend £100 million in 11 months belies the suggestion of widespread poverty.  There will always be poor people because of an addiction to gambling or drinking, but a country that spends £1.5 million on drink per day is not poor.</P>
    <P>I wish to express concern regarding very low paid workers who, in many cases, are working for less than people in comparable circumstances receive in social welfare.  Indeed, the increase of 9 per cent to the long-term unemployed means that people in low paid work are now £3 per week worse off than those on welfare.  The level of PRSI is a disincentive to firms to create work and many people have come to me and threatened to give up their jobs and live on social welfare.  It concerns me that people are deliberately avoiding work.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the social welfare system to which I should like to refer &mdash; the plight of the widower and the <Col N="1164" /> deserted husband.  A widower with three children receives £30 per week less than a widow in a comparable situation, which is deplorable.  While the Minister had addressed this, he will keep them waiting until October for payment.  I do not follow that logic because the plight of these people should be recognised and payment made before October.</P>
    <P>This is my seventh budget contribution and I again want to call for help for the under-privileged people in the Border region who have been hung out to dry by successive Governments.  I have criticised successive Governments for their lack of attention to the underprivileged who live in the Border region.  In 1984 the European Economic and Social Council published a report which identified the Border region as being one of the most disadvantaged in Europe.  Yet no attempt has been made to address the problems in my home county or in the adjacant counties of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>For 20 years I have been witnessing the steady decline of Dundalk, the biggest town in Ireland and a town which prospered in the past.  The present unemployment rate in the town stands at 32 per cent compared with the national rate of 18 per cent.  Just how high must this percentage become before the Government decide to do something about this sad statistic?  Traditionally emigration has been highest along the western seaboard but now the pendulum has swung and emigration is highest in the counties of the north east, Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  There has been a mass exodus of young people from my own area to the cities of London, Birmingham and Manchester as there is no prospect of help or industries being directed to the town of Dundalk which has a population of 30,000 people.  It is absolutely appalling that successive Governments have failed to take any initiatives to address this problem over the past two decades. Those of us living in County Louth, the foremost Border county, believe that crimes have been committed against us and it seems that we are regarded as second class citizens.  There seems to be <Col N="1165" /> no real desire on the part of the Government to help us.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, announced to a fanfare of trumpets that 20,000 new jobs had been created last year.  He did not say, however, how many had been created in Dundalk and I can tell him that the answer is none.  He was followed closely by Mr. Pádraic White of the IDA who also announced to a fanfare of trumpets that 12,000 new jobs had been created. I would like both the Minister and Mr. White to spell out where these new jobs have been created and Mr. White to explain why visiting industrialists are not brought to the Border region but rather to the more glamorous counties of Galway, Cork and Waterford.  The town which has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles for the past 20 years has been neglected and it is a disgrace that this should be so.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer very briefly to the lack of any initiatives in the budget in regard to housing.  The Government have refused for two years to grant permission for the building of local authority housing. The proud claim of Fianna Fáil over the years has been that when they are in Government the construction industry flourishes.  However, figures recently published show that there are now 9 per cent fewer people employed in the building industry than there were last year. Many of the builders in the Border region have moved to London and last Sunday's editions of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and <i>Sunday Press</i> carried an advertisement inserted by a prominent Dundalk firm who are at present carrying out contracts on the Isle of Man.  So much for the much vaunted connection between Fianna Fáil and the building and construction industry and their claim about what they will do for it.</P>
    <P>I have called consistently for special aid for the Border region.  In particular I have been calling for the past seven years for the establishment of a special enterprise zone as part of a package to enable hard pressed businesses to survive.  I take this opportunity to appeal once again for the drawing up of a special development <Col N="1166" /> plan for the Border region.  In fact, I believe a Border Department should be established.  If special aid, and not vague promises, is not provided for this region its economy will collapse.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the failure of the Government to take any initiatives to tackle the problems in County Louth and to contrast the initial allocation of £43,000 from the national lottery with that for Tipperary of £487,000.  This exemplifies the points I have been making in regard to the failure of the Government to recognise the unique needs of the Border region.  That amount of money made available from the national lottery is chicken-feed and is an indication of the level of the contempt in which the Government hold the people of County Louth.  They also failed to recognise the need for a regional sports centre in the biggest town in Ireland which is uniquely placed, geographically, to cater for cross-Border participation in sport.  I also wish to protest at the measly allocation of £200,000 which is in stark contrast with the allocation of £1 million for the building of a swimming pool in Sligo.  Also, were the Government serious when they gave a commitment to decentralise a section of a Department to my home town?</P>
    <P>I wish to protest at the attempt being made to downgrade Louth county hospital and in particular at the proposal to close the maternity and gynaecology sections along with 30 acute beds in that hospital.  In conclusion, I wish to protest at the lack of funds made available in the budget for the Irish Olympic team.  I deplore the absence of a message of hope from the Taoiseach to the Irish Olympic team who took part in the recent Olympic Games in Seoul.  The Taoiseach was quick to get on his bicycle and go to Paris when Stephen Roche won the Tour de France; yet this team was sent away on a wing and a prayer.  But for the intervention of a Dundalk businessman who donated £30,000 many members of the Irish team would not have been able to participate in the best and biggest sporting occasion in the world.  Over the <Col N="1167" /> coming four years money should be provided for the Irish Olympic team.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a contribution to this debate which enables us to review the public finances and the progress which has been made by the Government over the past 12 months.  A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies have stated quite calmly that this is one of the finest budgets ever to be presented in this House.  I certainly would not make such a claim but members of Fianna Fáil are given to making wild statements and are not shy in heaping praise on themselves.  An opportunity has been missed to do something for the benefit of the people who were waiting eagerly for the Government to indicate in what direction we are headed.  It seems, however, that they have lost their way and have no idea of where we are headed.  They now find themselves at a crossroads.</P>
      <P>To summarise the budget, the Fianna Fáil thinking is &ldquo;What we cannot cure they must endure&rdquo;.  They have tinkered with a number of problems and the one major problem affecting the people is personal taxation.  The people were led to believe that relief was coming, and there is no better way of encouraging people &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, would agree with me &mdash; than to give them a decent reward at the end of the week for their week's work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brendan Griffin gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the sudden closure of Kiely's bottling plant and the implications for employment in Tipperary town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought and was given permission to raise on the Adjournment the impact the sudden closure of Kiely's <Col N="1168" /> bottling plant had on the economic life of Tipperary town and the urgent necessity of finding a replacement industry.  I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue.  I regret the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not in the House to hear at first hand about the plight of the people in Tipperary town in the aftermath of the sudden closure of this plant.</P>
      <P>From a meteorological point of view, the January of 1989 has been the mildest in living memory.  Unfortunately, the industrial climate of Tipperary county and town has been anything but mild. The full rigours of the recession have swooped suddenly on county and town alike as a tornado levelling and sweeping aside what was heretofore regarded as safe and stable employment.  Whenever Tipperary is mentioned a picture of the Golden Vale is conjured up, a vision of luxuriousness with luscious rich pastures, dairy herds, racing stables and a wealthy and contented people.  This is partly so for a small sector of the community but for others the reality is different.  Side by side with all this are poor, disadvantaged areas, smallholdings, unemployment and a number of towns dependent on agriculture and ancillary industries for their survival.  Tipperary is one such town and its economic life has been shattered by this latest body blow to its industrial lifeline. Less than a year and a half ago it was dealt another blow when the local 42 bed district hospital, St. Vincent's, was closed, again sacrificed on the altar of economic rectitude by the South-Eastern Health Board who in turn blamed the present Fianna Fáil Government for not providing adequate funding to keep it in operation.  Since then no alternative industry has been found to replace the 24 jobs lost by that closure.</P>
      <P>In passing, I would like to mention that Tipperary town is not alone in this regard. Carrick-on-Suir has not yet fully recovered from the closure a few years ago of their major local industry, the tannery. However, the people of Carrick-on-Suir are striving bravely to overcome this loss and, like Tipperary town, have sought in vain an alternative industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> In the past couple of days the people of Clonmel were shocked to learn of the decision by Avonmore Creameries not to proceed with the promised plant on the outskirts of Clonmel to replace Burke's bacon factory which they had acquired. It is poor consolation to the 100 or so people who have lost their jobs that this plant is now being diverted to Roscrea. It is sad to see an old, established industry of 150 years standing, an industry that was synonymous with the industrial life of Clonmel closing down.</P>
    <P>I can also mention the closure of Ballingarry anthracite mines and the desolation the loss of 150 jobs in that disadvantaged area has caused.  The scandal is that men with the skill, expertise and above all the will to work had to idle their days away while the richest seam of anthracite in these islands remained unmined and untapped.</P>
    <P>Last night we discussed in the House the threat that now hangs over the Thurles sugar factory, putting the jobs of a further 164 full-time employees and an equal number of part-time employees in jeopardy and devastating the economic life of Thurles as a consequence.</P>
    <P>This newborn 1989 has not been too kind to Tipperary and I hope that by bringing these factors to the attention of the Minister remedial action will be taken to rectify the scandalous situation before this year's demise.  Our first sympathy must go to the 40 families most affected by the closure of Kiely's bottling plant last Friday, 27 January.  As a family man I can appreciate the traumatic effect this closure must have on these families, wives and children alike.  Mortgages have to be paid, normal day to day financial commitments have to be met, future plans for the eduction of their children have to be shelved, and the hopes and aspirations of many young couples are dashed and shattered.  Speaking to some of them, I could not but be moved by their helplessness and the doom and gloom with which they view their future. Emigration is staring them in the face.  It is a step they are loath to take.  However, sympathy is not enough.  Sympathy will <Col N="1170" /> not pay the bills to meet their commitments. That is why on their behalf I am demanding tonight concrete and positive action from the Minister and from the IDA, that semi-State body under his aegis who are mandated to attract industry.  I am demanding they make Tipperary town a first priority so that an alternative replacement industry will be found immediately.</P>
    <P>In passing I would like to place on record that no blame can be attached to the Kiely family who down the years have given and are still giving, in another successful enterprise in Tipperary town, good permanent employment to the townspeople.  The bottling plant was a wholly owned subsidiary of John Daly and Company and for corporate reasons the company decided to transfer their operations to their Dublin plant where, apparently, there is spare capacity.  Again rural Ireland loses out to Dublin, but Tipperary town has a great deal yet to offer to any potential industrialists.  First and above all else it has a loyal workforce where excellent relations exist between employer and employee.  I understand that in this industry in virtually 40 years not one day was lost through industrial disputes due to that happy understanding between management and staff.  I am glad to note that this happy relationship permeates all other industries and services in Tipperary town.  Secondly, we have a young, intelligent workforce, capable and adaptable young men and women who are anxious to contribute to the economic life in Tipperary and who deem it their right to eke out a livelihood in their town.  They would prefer to settle down in Tipperary rather than emigrate and build up the economies of Great Britain, Australia, Germany or the USA. This closure has obviously dampened their aspirations.</P>
    <P>Another plus for Tipperary is that we have a 10,000 sq. ft. vacant advance factory awaiting a tenant.  I condemn out-right the inactivity of the IDA in not providing an industry for that vacant factory. Apparently, Tipperary has been shunned and neglected by the IDA.  I want a commitment from the Minister <Col N="1171" /> that that will no longer be tolerated.  We also have a green field, 38 statute acres in size, zoned for industrial purposes and we are anxiously awaiting an industry for that.  That land was acquired by the farseeing urban district council some years ago in anticipation of industrial development but, again, we have not had any action from the IDA.  In passing I should mention that the cost of development of that land bank was and is being carried by the ratepayers of Tipperary town with no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The vacant plant at Kiely's could, by arrangement and negotiations, be made available for a replacement industry and there are other buildings and sites available for any industrial purpose.  From an infrastructural point of view there is more than an adequate supply of water, sewerage and power facilities with a suitable road structure in the area.  There is also an effluent treatment plant capable of dealing with industrial discharges from a town five or six times greater than Tipperary. There are also excellent educational, social and other facilities that must make Tipperary most attractive to any potential industrialist and his family. The Canon Hayes Recreation Centre is rightly regarded as being one of the most outstanding of such complexes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With all of those advantages surely it cannot be too difficult to sell Tipperary to any future employer, but the will must be there both on the part of the Minister and on the part of the IDA.  Like many others I have been bitterly disappointed by the efforts of the IDA todate in trying to attract an industry to our town.  Could it be that, as Tipperary is on the periphery of the south eastern region, in the extreme north west of it and within three miles of the SFADCo boundary, it has been neglected by the IDA, lost sight of, discarded and marginalised?  I want that situation rectified as from tonight and I want a firm commitment from the Minister that Tipperary town will be put on the itinerary of all potential industrialists entering the south eastern region.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider transferring Tipperary town, and district, into <Col N="1172" /> the SFADCo region where the incentives are more attractive and where the officials have been eminently more successful in attracting industries?  There is a strong feeling in Tipperary that its industrial chances would be greatly enhanced if that was done but, perhaps, I should take the issue up on another occasion.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I appeal to the Minister to persuade the Government to consider Tipperary as a suitable location for participation in the decentralisation programme. I have no doubt but that there would be a great welcome for the personnel of any Department transferred to Tipperary.  They, in turn, could enjoy the peace, tranquility and quality of life that is Tipperary.  I stress to the Minister that the time for talking has long passed; action is what is needed and demanded. I call on him, on behalf of the people of Tipperary, to end the era of neglect and give Tipperary its rightful share of the national cake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always with regret that one learns of the closures of any company with its consequential loss of employment and the trauma it creates in an area particularly when it is an old established company like Kiely's Bottling Plant in Tipperary town.  The closure has been brought about by the rationalisation programme of the John Daly Group.  I appreciate the excellent case put so eloquently by Deputy Griffin tonight.  The company had for long provided a valuable source of employment in Tipperary town.  It is one of the oldest soft drink companies in the country.  I understand that the decision to close has been pending for a number of years but was delayed because of the excellence of the workforce in Tipperary town.  However, at the end of the day the Daly Group, because they had surplus capacity at another plant, took a decision in the light of commercial considerations to close Kiely's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tipperary plant has a capacity of one million cases per annum but I understand that such capacity is out of line <Col N="1173" /> with the current trends in the soft drinks industry.  Similar plants throughout Europe are being built to produce 60 million cases per annum.  That is the type of competition the group faced.  In addition the group believed that the Tipperary production could be absorbed in its modern facility in Dublin.  It was considered by the group that replacement of the Tipperary plant with a modern one could not be justified.  The loss of these jobs in Kiely's is of concern to Tipperary town and to the IDA, the authority charged with developing industries here. When I received notice of Deputy Griffin's intention to raise this matter on the Adjournment I communicated with the IDA and impressed upon them the importance of obtaining an alternative industry for the town, particularly when there is an advance factory of 10,000 square feet and a land bank there.  The IDA are promoting the town for international services-type projects and I understand that discussions have been held with companies like New York Life. It is because of the town's proximity to Shannon that it is considered a suitable location for such projects.</P>
    <P>The IDA would welcome any initiatives by local bodies who might be interested in providing suitable office space which could be rented to the latter type of company.  The IDA also have details of the Kiely Bottling Plant building which will be included in a kit given to visiting industrialists and I am sure that Tipperary will be on their itinerary.  In this regard I will bring the comments of Deputy Griffin to the attention of the IDA.</P>
    <P>In addition the IDA intend to have a small industry promotion in Tipperary town in March-April to ensure that the community are aware of the incentives available and to generate further activity in small businesses in the area.  On a more positive note I should like to mention some current developments in Tipperary town and its hinterland.  Tipperary Co-op, for example, is one of the foremost co-ops in the country in cheese making and they have developed a number of cheeses over the last few years.  They are in the <Col N="1174" /> process of developing and launching an additional cheese.  The co-op employs 130 people and it is hoped that there will be additional employment there.</P>
    <P>Then there is O'Dwyer steel of Dundrum which is continually developing new products and has been assisted by the IDA to develop a hydraulic refuse compactor for the home, but mostly export markets.  This work has just recently been completed.  Hopefully there will be additional jobs there as well.</P>
    <P>This company were originally in the structural steel business which was severely affected by the recession.  With IDA's encouragement and assistance the company are developing into new higher technology areas which have good export potential.  These are quality products which are being sold on international markets leaving the company well placed to compete after 1992.</P>
    <P>The US owned company Tambrands AG have been operating successfully in Tipperary town where they produce sanitary products.  This company employ over 200 people with possibilities for further growth.  The IDA are having discussions with them on that matter.</P>
    <P>I know that the Chair has been interested in this area for some considerable time as is Deputy Griffin.  I appreciate that Deputy Griffin is deeply concerned about the effect of this and I assure the Deputy that I will keep in contact with the IDA to ensure that they will do everything possible to replace the jobs that have been lost in Kiely's with alternative jobs in Tipperary.  Tipperary town will be on the itinerary of visiting industrialists and IDA personnel abroad will be made aware that there are factory premises and a land bank in Tipperary. There is a number of positive assets in Tipperary including the Canon Hayes sports complex.  That complex is a credit to Tipperary town and to the community who raised substantial finance for that facility.</P>
    <P>The SFADCo arrangement is outside of my brief but I will certainly bring the Deputy's point to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I assure the Deputy and the House that I <Col N="1175" /> will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the IDA are fully cognisant of the difficulty in Tipperary town and that they will do everything in their power to <Col N="1176" /> ensure that alternative jobs and industry are provided there.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 February 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main area of European funding which is of concern to my Department is the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  New arrangements have been in place since 1 January for the making of applications for ERDF support and, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, applications will now mainly be made in the form of programmes rather than individual projects. The Minister for Finance who is responsible for the administrative arrangements concerned with the ERDF in Ireland is co-ordinating arrangements in relation to these new procedures.  Programmes covering the main areas of operation under my Department likely to be eligible for ERDF support are now being finalised. These relate to the areas of industrial development marketing and science and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the speech of the Minister for Finance introducing the budget on 25 January, special reference was made to additional financial allocations in 1989 for which ERDF support is expected.  These <Col N="990" /> included £11.5 million for industrial promotion, for marketing support for industry and for technology development.  Out of this allocation, £3.5 million will be spent on a special development effort for the promotion of industry in Tallaght. The remainder of the £11.5 million will be used to improve the marketing performance of Irish firms and to upgrade the technological infrastructure required to support a faster pace of industrial development at a number of locations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the funding of Irish projects under the EC Framework Programme for Science and Technology, the total payments received by Irish interest in 1988 was £9.2 million.  Whereas my Department and EOLAS offer every assistance and encouragement to Irish researchers in submitting proposals to Brussels, the decisions on which projects are accepted or rejected are made in Brussels by the Commission, usually on the advice of a committee representative of all member states.  It is not therefore my function to recommend or reject individual projects.</P>

      <P>The primary job creation target under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is 20,000 extra jobs on average per year in the manufacturing and international services sector.  This target was achieved in 1988 and I am confident that it will be repeated in 1989 and 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives and policies which are being pursued by the Government in relation to employment creation are set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The primary objective was to restore order to the public finances and thus create a competitive environment in <Col N="991" /> which industry could invest with confidence. This has been achieved and a range of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis as set out in the programme is being progressively implemented.  For example, this week I met with the leaders of 33 of Ireland's most prestigious businesses to encourage them to undertake new initiatives to create wealth and jobs in Ireland.  I have no doubt that, with the improvement in the business environment and the restoration of confidence in the economy, significant new job opportunities will materialise.</P>

      <P>The importance of developing overseas consultancy opportunities, not only for the private sector but also for the public sector, was recognised in the Government <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  One of the significant proposals in the programme to address this was the establishment of an overseas consultancy group chaired by me.  This group is now operating and its main focus is to provide a major impetus to the development of opportunities in overseas consultancy general, embracing both private and public sector activity.  This work automatically includes consideration of the best ways in which State support for all Irish efforts to obtain international contracts should be co-ordinated and advanced.</P>
      <P>So far the group has addressed some key issues in this regard such as: the gathering of timely information on opportunities abroad; the efficient dissemination of this information to firms in the private sectors; and the co-ordination of the national effort both within the public sector and between public and private sectors.

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> sets out the strategy and initiatives that are being taken by the Government to stimulate the economy up to the end of 1990.  A detailed progress report on the job creation initiatives was published by the programme's Central Review Committee in December 1988. On Monday last, I convened a forum of 33 Irish industrialists to encourage them to undertake new initiatives to create wealth and jobs in Ireland.  I secured an undertaking from them to review their <Col N="995" /> overall activities with a view to identifying employment bearing opportunities in Ireland.  The State promotional agencies will be in touch with each company individually to see what progress can be made and are to report back to me by the end of March.</P>
      <P>A number of new initiatives which will help stimulate the economy were announced last week by the Minister for Finance.  In so far as the work of my Department is concerned an additional £11.5 million is being provided for industrial promotion and for measures to support the marketing and technological development of Irish industry.</P>
      <P>In particular I would draw attention to the £3.5 million special development programme which will be undertaken to create new job opportunities in the Tallaght area.  A new 40,000 sq. ft. special advance factory and a special enterprise centre dedicated to the textile and clothing industry will be developed as well as measures to improve the facilities available in the Whitestown Industrial Estate.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I will shortly be announcing an initiative designed to meet the target of 3,000 jobs by 1992, set in the programme, for the Irish-owned electronics industry.  This initiative will involve co-ordinated efforts by the principal State agencies to encourage and assist Irish-owned electronics companies to achieve substantial growth by exploiting opportunities in the international electronics market.  Further sectoral strategies and initiatives in other areas will be launched through the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of the fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme is that the claimant must be living alone or only with qualified dependants.  A qualified dependant for this purpose is a person in respect of whom an adult and-or child dependant allowance is payable.  No fuel allowance is payable where any person who is not a qualified dependant is residing with the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the person concerned stated on his application form that he was living alone and was awarded the fuel allowance from 17 October 1988, the start of the 1988-89 fuel season.  It was subsequently discovered that he was living with his brother who is not his <Col N="999" /> qualified dependant as he is in receipt of unemployment assistance in his own right.  Payment of the allowance was discontinued with effect from 14 December 1988.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to let the Deputy know that the living alone condition for the long term unemployed is being modified so that from the next heating season, commencing in October 1989, where two people who would qualify individually are living in the same household, a single fuel allowance will be paid.  This has been provided for in the budget and it is estimated that some 18,500 households will benefit from this extension at a cost of £2 million.</P>

The information received in the tax office was incomplete as regards the wife's employment position for 1985-86.  In consequence the inspector of taxes granted allowances in excess of the taxpayer's entitlement for that year.  Furthermore, tax for that year was deducted at the 35 per cent rate instead of the 48 per cent rate.  As a result, when the taxpayer's liability to tax for that year was reviewed, the underpayment specified in the question emerged. The inspector will communicate directly with the taxpayer in regard to the arrangements for dealing with the underpayment.</P>

      <P>In 1987 &mdash; the latest year for which complete figures are available &mdash; the total amount of industrial waste dumped in Irish waters was 638,730 tonnes.  My Department controls dumping at sea operations by means of permits under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  Dumping is only allowed where this option is considered environmentally acceptable and is the only practical solution available for dispensing of the materials involved which are non-toxic. In the case of industrial waste every application to dump at sea must give details of the consideration given to the alternative methods of disposal and each dump site is monitored to ensure that there are no harmful effects on the marine environment.</P>

      <P>Bond Bridge and Sallins Railway Bridge are located on regional roads.

The authority have applied for special road grant assistance for road realignment bridge improvements at both of these locations.  The question of special road grant funding to meet an appropriate share of costs arising on the proposed schemes in 1989 will be decided in the context of this year's road grant allocations, which will be finalised within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>An application for renewal of a work permit has been received from the employer of the person to whom the question relates and it is currently being considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>My policy in regard to the granting or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that, as far as possible, employment opportunities arising here are reserved for Irish or EC nationals. The issue of a work permit is, therefore, not considered unless an employer can show that there are no suitably qualified Irish or European Community nationals available for the position in question.</P>
      <P>This policy applies to the granting of permits for ethnic restaurants as for other sectors of the economy.  Up to now, the expansion of this sector of the catering industry has not led to significant employment opportunities for Irish or EC nationals.  This situation is not acceptable, particularly as my Department understand from the relevant professional bodies that there are no special skills involved in Chinese cuisine that an Irish apprentice chef could not readily pick up after a period of on-the-job training.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the situation I have insisted that, as a condition for the granting of work permits for ethnic restaurants, they must recruit and train apprentice chefs from the local workforce for employment.  In this connection, I have arranged for officers of my Department to contact the employer about his plans for the recruitment and training of Irish or EC workers, in accordance with the policy guidelines outlined above.  In the light of his response I shall review the application.</P>

      <P>On 9 August 1988 I let the North-Western Health Board know that I had no objection to the engagement of an architect for the project and I am currently awaiting their detailed proposals in this regard.  The board's proposals, once received, will be dealt with as expediently as possible to allow construction to begin at an early date.  I provided £75,000 out of national lottery funds for this project last year and I am keeping the question of providing further funds for the scheme under review in the context of the current difficult financial situation.</P>
