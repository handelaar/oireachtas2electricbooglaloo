      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach whether he has any plans to make an announcement of any real initiative in relation to search and rescue services rather than the two flimsy announcements made last week by the Ministers for the Marine and Defence, particularly in the light of yesterday's disaster off our coast?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking to ascertain whether the Taoiseach intends making any announcement about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Government announcement yesterday <Col N="1375" /> that it is proposed to abolish Fóir Teoranta would the Taoiseach indicate when it is proposed to introduce legislation to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there legislation promised in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is not promised.  The Deputy is probably correct in that, ultimately, legislation may be required to wind up the company, but that is fairly far down the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that matter, would the Taoiseach acknowledge that it is important that this legislation be introduced soon in view of the fact that there may be a degree of competitive unfairness in that those who received finance from Fóir Teoranta prior to 23 February, in competition with other companies, have an advantage over those now precluded from applying, in the same circumstances, for assistance from Fóir Teoranta?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must advise the House that we cannot debate this matter now.  There can be no debate now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have endeavoured to raise the following matter on a number of occasions and you correctly ruled me out of order.  With your assistance may I ask the Taoiseach if he has requested his Whip to discuss with the other Whips the question of making Government time available to discuss EC Structural Funds in this House before 31 March next?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given an indication that something of that kind is being favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach the position about patent legislation.  As he promised, I was given information as to the current position.  I was informed that the Government intend to introduce a major Bill in this area and that they do not intend to proceed with a smaller Bill to deal with the problem of a given number of companies of which the Taoiseach is well aware.  May I ask the Taoiseach for a clear assurance that this legislation will be both presented in good time to be enacted so as to cause no difficulty for this company and, given its complexity, be presented in sufficient time to allow its full debate here?  May I have a firm assurance on this matter from the Taoiseach in view of the fact that substantial numbers of jobs are involved all over the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be able to give the Deputy as much assurance as possible.  It is a very important aspect of industrial development.  It is complex and difficult.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the legislation is with the Attorney General at present and will be pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the Minister will be available to talk to him about any particular aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will always be delighted to accept such an invitation but, notwithstanding that, may I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that there is a risk that if any problems arise in regard to another matter in this legislation, that legislation may be held up?  Is he aware that, therefore, the problem of the particular companies may not be dealt with in time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give that assurance. It can be considered but my advice is that such a short Bill as the Deputy has in mind would not necessarily solve any particular problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>What kind of tourists are we talking about, or does the weekly visit to the mother-in-law for afternoon tea qualify for inclusion as a tourist statistic? Is putting up afternoon tea for the mother-in-law counted as a job in the tourist sector?  What kind of jobs is the Minister talking about?</P>

      <P>Through the Taoiseach I should like to ask the Minister for Social Welfare if the Social Welfare Bill will address the anomalies that have arisen in relation to the changes in the periods and stamps required for disqualification for different benefits in view of the hardship that is causing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My point about this matter is that that was promised in the Minister's speeches.  The changes in the requirements for benefit are causing great hardship.  My question is whether the legislation to which reference has been made will be the conventional Social Welfare Bill to implement normal changes in benefit or whether it will address the anomalies to which I have referred.</P>

Will the Taoiseach give a specific indication, in view of the Government's decision, when it is intended to introduce a Bill to repeal the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972?  I should like to ask the Chair if it is in order for the Government to suspend the operation of that Act by Government decision in view of the fact that it was a decision of the House taken in 1972 to establish that body on certain criteria.  Will the Taoiseach give a clear indication when such legislation will be before the House so that this foolish and unnecessary decision can be debated here?</P>

    <P>Now that we have reached Report Stage of this Bill I want to make clear in the first instance that what we are about here is trying to secure improvements in the Bill.  The Labour Party are not opposing the Bill; we support the Bill but we want to try to improve the base on which a judicial separation can be granted by the courts and we also, in a later amendment, want to secure the opening up of accessibility to the new remedies that will be prescribed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with amendment No. 1. The new agreement entered into by Deputy Shatter and the Minister which has resulted in the Bill coming forward in its present form has made a major difference to the grounds of application <Col N="1385" /> for a decree of judicial separation in that the original overall basis of irretrievable breakdown is now gone from the Bill and the new ground in clause 2 (1) (f) provides that the marriage must have broken down to the extent that the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not existed between the spouses for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of the application.</P>
    <P>We are aware from the debates that have taken place over the various Stages of the Bill that at all times the Minister was totally opposed to the basis of irretrievable breakdown as the grounds on which an application could be made to the court and a judicial separation granted.  The Minister gave as his reason for objecting to that that it was the ground used in English legislation as basing an application for divorce.  In that the Minister is correct.  In the English legislation the grounds for divorce are based on irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  The Minister objected to that, presumably because he did not want us to tie in here too closely with this notion of divorce.</P>
    <P>We should put it on record, in the first instance, really as an aside, that when we are talking about judicial separation remedies to deal with marriage breakdown, in the view of the Labour Party, we are dealing with second best anyway and what the situation really requires is divorce legislation.  I know we are not discussing that and that is not on offer at the moment.  Nevertheless the point does have to be made that in our view it is divorce legislation that is required.</P>
    <P>The concept of irretrievable breakdown as a basis for an application for judicial separation is radically different from the formula which now appears before the House, because the notion of irretrievable breakdown is critical to the concept of a no-fault application to the court and the court being in a position to grant a decree of judicial separation without having to get involved in the family mudslinging that might otherwise be expected when matters of this nature come before it.  Indeed, Deputy Shatter <Col N="1386" /> himself was at pains to point out, throughout the long debate, that it was very important, that the whole concept of no fault was critical and should be maintained as the basis of the Bill.</P>
    <P>How would an application to the court based on the notion of irretrievable breakdown work?  It would work in the same way as the divorce legislation in England operates on an application to the English courts based on irretrievable breakdown.  What happens in effect is that if one spouse goes into the court and tells the court that his marriage has irretrievably broken down then that is an end to the matter since that person is one of the two spouses involved, 50 per cent of the marriage.  It takes two to tango and if one says the marriage is over, then it is over.  It matters not at all that the other spouse will come in and say the marriage has not irretrievably broken down and is still going on.  That would be of no avail because the marriage is not viable and cannot go on unless both spouses agree that the marriage is there.  If one spouse says it has irretrievably broken down, under English divorce legislation that would be the end of the matter, and that would be the position here if our judicial separation were based on irretrievable breakdown, which is the more proper way to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter talked about this at the committee meeting on 20 April 1988 at column 60 when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; means that courts can grant a decree, having heard of the problems experienced within a marriage, on the basis that the marriage has broken down.  The court decree as granted would state, that a judicial separation decree is granted due to the breakdown in the marriage or due to the marriage irretrievably breaking down.  It will not state it is due to the cruelty or adultery of a particular spouse.  It will not make any allegations against a husband or a wife. </P>
    <P>He went on to say at column 61:</P>
    <P>That provision in section 2 (1) (f), <Col N="1387" /> taken with the two preceding provisions in the Bill will, I believe, result in the region of 90 per cent of husbands and wives who have to resort to court to get decrees of separation getting decrees of separation without any findings of fault, without them having to cast stones at each other.  It will enable them to separate in as civilised a way as is possible.  It will enable them to do so, in the context of what the last speaker said, without having to prove fault.  It will be great to see a no-fault concept.  It should be stated that this is why this provision was recommended by the joint committee.  It is, in fact, why it is supported by every voluntary and professional group outside the Houses working in the area of marital breakdown. </P>
    <P>That would be the position if one was going to court with a case based on irretrievable breakdown of marriage but what would the position be if the spouses come into court with a case based on the new agreement that has been entered into between Deputy Shatter and the Minister?  This clause provides that the marriage has broken down to the extent that the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances &mdash; these are the key words &mdash; a normal marital relationship has not existed between the parties for a period of at least one year.  Let us look at how the courts would face the situation that would arise under that clause.  As I see it, one spouse would come forward and say that a normal marital relationship had not existed with the other spouse for upwards of one year.  The other spouse, who is determined to be vindictive and throw mud, will say that is not so and that a normal marital relationship has existed between them.</P>
    <P>The court is then faced with an issue in that it has to decide which version is correct.  Did these spouses have a normal marital relationship or not for the past year?  To enable it to do that the court will have to examine the question first of what the marital relationship was for the <Col N="1388" /> past year.  In other words what went on between this couple and what did the wife or husband do or not do?  Every detail of that marital relationship and all the history of the marriage in the last year would be fair game for examination on evidence by the court.  Before the court can determine whether a normal marital relationship has existed it must determine what marital relationship existed.  Having done that it can then decide whether that relationship, which it has found existed, was normal.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the difficulty the court will be faced with in deciding whether the marital relationship was normal.  I do not know how the position will work out in reality.  Can it be said that there is such a thing as a normal marital relationship? Will a court be able to decide that a relationship in a particular marriage is normal or otherwise?  What would be very normal for one married couple might be completely abnormal for another married couple.  I do not think a norm in the context of a marital relationship is something that will be addressed very easily by the courts.</P>
    <P>It seems this will leave open the question of calling in expert witnesses such as psychiatrists.  If one spouse is determined to make trouble for the other in opposing the application, by saying that what went on was normal or was not normal as the case may be, resort will have to be had to psychiatrists and psychologists, in like manner as resort is had to them in nullity applications which now go before the court.  There are great costs involved in getting the opinions of psychiatrists and psychologists and bringing them to court. We hear a lot of criticisms about legal costs, solicitors' and barristers' costs, in conducting these cases but they pale into insignificance when compared with the costs charged by psychiatrists and psychologists in coming to court and giving evidence in cases of this nature.  It seems all that will be opened up by this new formula that has been agreed by Deputy Shatter and the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is also tied in with my next group of amendments dealing with the accessibility of the entire measure to people who <Col N="1389" /> do not have large amounts of money.  If they cannot afford to bring an ordinary case with a simple formula before the courts how much less so are they going to be able to afford the costs of bringing in psychologists and psychiatrists to go into the question in expert terms of whether the relationship that existed was normal?  The reality is that only the rich will be able to get the full value out of the kind of dispute and major litigation that this clause could open up.</P>
    <P>I realise the political realities as well as anybody else.  I fully realise the implications of the Tallaght strategy that is in operation here in this agreement that has been reached between the Minister and Deputy Shatter.  I realise the voting implications of what is involved.  The prospects of having this amendment accepted by the House, in terms of political reality, are non-existent.  Nonetheless these are the thoughts that have occurred to me on this new amendment.  It is regrettable that we have had to change the format of this crucial clause in the Bill to get past the difficulties raised by the Minister.  It was not for this reason that we supported the recommital of the Bill to be re-examined in committee.  I had hoped we would have been able to proceed with this section along the lines recommended by the joint committee so that the no fault basis which we all thought to be the kernel of the basis on which the application could be granted would still be available to spouses who needed to avail of it.  Regrettably the new formula opens up the whole history of the marriage and leaves open the whole fault-based kind of application which we had sought to avoid in the original formulation and bringing forward of the Bill.  Having said that, even in its amended form, the Bill will be a tremendous help if accessibility can be provided for.  I will be saying more about that on the jurisdiction aspects of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know on Report Stage we are being offered a last opportunity to consider this important Bill, the passing of which thousands of people around the country are awaiting.  We have a real <Col N="1390" /> duty to those thousands of people to ensure that the Act that comes into being is as true as possible to the wishes of this House and its Members, as expressed at the various stages of the debate.  It is also our duty to ensure that the courts' hands are not tied in the implementation of the Bill.  Section 2 (1) (f) is not what it should be in order to avoid difficulties in implementing this Bill in the court.  Before I address my own amendment I would like to say that I believe the general principle behind section 2, and particularly section 2 (1) (f), is laudable and one which I support.  It is not the same as irretrievable breakdown but it goes a long way towards encompassing a no fault, or certainly an element of no fault ground, for the decree of separtion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I see &mdash; it is something akin to what Deputy Taylor has referred to &mdash; is that I believe it is open to a court to investigate the extent to which a marriage has broken down, the type of marriage that existed before that and the type of model marriage there might be, and to compare one with the other.  Once we have started down that road, it is inevitable that the court will have to make judgments on the behaviour of one or other party and ascribe guilt.  We have at various stages in the debate on this Bill referred to the mud-slinging syndrome. We wish to get away from that and one of the underlying principles of this Bill is that we should move away from declaring that one or other party has behaved worse than the other.  My amendment, No. 2, seeks to tidy up the ground at section 2 (1) (f) for separation.  This paragraph states that if: &ldquo;the marriage has broken down to the extent that the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not existed for a period of at least one year&rdquo;, then a decree can be granted.  I must repeat what I said on Committee Stage when the Bill was re-committed, that I believe section 2 (1) (f) is cumbersome.  Paragraph (f) starts by stating: &ldquo;that the marriage has broken down&rdquo;.  Then there are a number of subclauses to the effect that the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not <Col N="1391" /> existed.  First, it is clumsy and, secondly its intent is not clear.  Is it that the court must be satisfied that a normal marital relationship, such as a model marital relationship, has not existed for a year or, is it that the court must be satisfied that the marital relationship which this couple had up to one year ago no longer existed and the court is then asked to decide that that previous relationship was the normal relationship and now it is not the normal relationship?  This paragraph is not clear in its intent.  It does not say there is a particular model type relationship which this couple is not living up to.  Neither does it say that the couple's previous relationship was a normal relationship and, therefore, that is what we will measure it against.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to ask a court to decide what a normal relationship is, in marriage, for any couple that comes before them.  That is what this Bill seeks to move away from.  In this clause we are attempting to establish a basis for a decree of separation which simply demands that one party to the marriage comes in and says: &ldquo;The marriage has broken down and it simply does not exist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I moved my previous amendment on the recommittal stage the Minister, in referring to it, said he felt it would be difficult to accept my amendment because it included the phrase: &ldquo;that the marriage did not exist&rdquo;.  I can understand the difficulties that that might present because of the presumption that there was a void, and one cannot have that in legal terms.  In redrafting that amendment I have sought to say to the Minister that I have addressed the problem he saw in my previous amendment but, nevertheless, I am keeping in principle to what the Bill demands; the ground is that marriage has broken down.  I have used a phrase that is used in section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the duty of a solicitor to give to the couple who apply for a separation the names and addresses of persons who might help in effecting a reconciliation, or names and addresses of <Col N="1392" /> persons who would mediate between the couple.  In both of those cases section 6 refers to parties who have either become estranged or are estranged.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;estranged&rdquo; is accepted.  The court works on the basis of this understanding regularly.  It does not present problems in interpretation because a marriage is still understood to exist but the couple themselves have become estranged.  It is a far tighter approach to what we are trying to achieve here.  It does not depend on uncertain and uneasy interpretations by the court of what is a normal marital relationship.  It does not depend on comparisons between a previous relationship which the couple necessarily had.  It simply asks if this couple are estranged, have they been estranged for a period of a year before the application and, as a result, is their marriage broken down?</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to produce the kind of legislation that gives effect to what is behind the section.  My amendment is closer to that than the amendment which has been agreed between the Minister and Deputy Shatter on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I would ask both to give very serious consideration to this because I foresee real difficulties in the interpretation of section 2 (1) (f) as it stands.</P>
    <P>It is within the principle that has been agreed between the Minister and the Fine Gael Party that the ground should be that the marriage has broken down and that the spouses have been estranged for a period of at least one year and, as stated in my amendment: &ldquo;it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart...and to cease to be obliged to co-habit with the respondent&rdquo;.  There is no uncertainty about that amendment. There is definitely uncertainty about the Bill as it stands, in section 2 (1) (f).  I have pointed to the difficulty the court has in defining what a normal marital relationship is and as to whether it depends on the particular spouses in front of them or all spouses in general.  The Bill, as it stands, obliges the court to investigate all the circumstances in a marriage because paragraph (f) states: &ldquo;that the marriage <Col N="1393" /> has broken down to the extent the court is satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marital relationship has not existed...&rdquo;.  At the very least that would make applications under that paragraph cumbersome.  It would oblige spouses to come in and say: &ldquo;These are all the circumstances. Our relationship does not exist&rdquo;.  As Deputy Taylor has said, the other spouse may contest that.  We are entering into a very difficult and cumbersome situation, which is unnecessary, because there are a number of other grounds on which spouses can rely.  As far as I understand it, this was intended to allow a couple to come to court without necessarily slinging mud at one another.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Special Committee, the Minister mentioned that he saw difficulties on one particular front, and I have sought to deal with that.  I would be interested to hear his reaction to it.  I feel it is a tighter and more workable interpretation of the principle behind this, and I strongly ask that both Fine Gael and the Minister consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of the Special Committee but nevertheless I have participated in a great deal of the legislation relating to this area in the normal working of the House over the years.  I must confess that I was very taken aback when I saw the product of this enforced marriage between Deputy Shatter and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  I had not envisaged that that flawed definiton would emerge.  In some respects we would be better off if section 2 (1) (f) had not been foisted on us; it will provide a unique legislative interpretation of judicial case study writing in the nineties as this comes into play. Deputy Shatter and the Minister may find themselves the subject of considerable tracts of judicial irony in court.  In the text books of the nineties, they will find themselves referred to as the Collins and Shatter precedent because I have never seen the phrase &ldquo;normal marital relationship&rdquo; in any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the divorce referendum in particular, I remember spending many weary hours in Government and at <Col N="1394" /> departmental level debating definitions of this nature.  This phrase is a legislative, consitutional nightmare.  Deputy Colley and equally Deputy Taylor have quite rightly pointed out that the prospect of trying to have a judicial interpretation of a &ldquo;normal marital relationship&rdquo;&mdash; whatever that might mean &mdash; will cause appalling confusion.  Parties to an action will face appalling problems in court and the judge will make heroic efforts trying to resolve an issue of that nature.  In the fifties it was regarded as abnormal that a wife would go out for a drink with her husband, except perhaps at Christmas time or if she was lucky, perhaps on a Saturday night.  One will find judges in this country who might regard it as being entirely abnormal for a wife to go out for a drink with a woman acquaintance four or five nights a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>However, one might regard it as normal in a marriage that a man might spend four or five nights a week out boozing with his pals and coming home at 3 o'clock in the morning. Is that abnormal?  Some judges might find that behaviour quite normal, while others might find it extraordinarily abnormal and would give a judicial interpretation accordingly.  The phrase is fraught with multiple danger.  Some judges are so abnormal they might even regard the non-presence of children in a marriage as not being a normal marriage.</P>
      <P>Another spouse might discover that his dear wife had decided to take a contraceptive pill and he would plead before the judge that this was absolutely abnormal in marriage and in certain circumstances, if I know some judges, they would regard it as entirely abnormal that she had not advised her husband that she had taken a contraceptive pill.  The case study will be infinite, and the confusion multiple if we foist this on the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I think we will have an interesting parliamentary process which will provide a good solid Ph. D. for a few American students visiting this country <Col N="1395" /> throughout the nineties into the year 2000.  With due respects to Deputy Shatter, who has endeavoured to present this in a semi heroic manner as a resolution of the problem, I am surprised that as a practising member in the courts he would endeavour to give us an interpretation of this nature.</P>
    <P>Where was the parliamentary draftsman when this was put before the Minister? I know no parliamentary draftsman who would dare touch it.  I recall a parliamentary draftsman telling me, when I in my innocence came up with phraseology of this nature, to go away and buy a ball of wool and start unravelling it, because then I might begin to appreciate the nonsense I was proposing.  When this phrase begins to be unravelled in court, its nonsense will become apparent.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think what happened was the Minister told Deputy Shatter he was sick to death of this and he would put into the Bill whatever the Deputy wanted.  Then it would be brought back to the House in the hope that it would slip through and both of them could claim credit for resolving a sorry episode.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister's defence of the situation. I find it astounding, and I expected something better and I hope we will get something better.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  First I want to talk about the enforced marriage between the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, and Deputy Shatter.  If such an enforced marriage exists, I have to take responsibility for it because at the Special Committee, having hammered out long and hard over a period of months differences in the approach to the legislation, I proposed, that Deputy Shatter and the Minister, Deputy Collins, should sit down and borrow a number of weeks from the Committee's time to see if a compromise could be found.  My recollection is that Deputy Taylor supported that approach as one that could produce results and help us put legislation quickly on the Statute Book.  When Deputy Shatter and the Minister Deputy Collins, came back to the Special Committee with amendments in their joint names in an historic, almost unprecedented approach to legislation, The Workers' Party were happy to see that compromise had been achieved.  That compromise signalled that the legislation would now progress rapidly not only in this House but in the Seanad, the Minister being happy that he had achieved a compromise and a workable piece of legislation.  I will certainly not say anything today to detract from a process I suggested initially and which I welcomed at Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole Bill is a compromise.  We in The Workers' Party would prefer to be talking about divorce legislation.  We failed to achieve that and we are now trying to meet the situation that exists in the absence of support for divorce being allowed in the Constitution initially and then in legislation.  I accept that the wording now in the Bill is a compromise on that compromise.  It was argued that the concept of irretrievable breakdown was the essential gene of the Bill and that we would work towards a no fault-non-controversial mode of judicial separation. We have a different wording now but we have to be honest about it and not suggest that irretrievable breakdown as a concept would have avoided all argument <Col N="1397" /> or all dispute in litigation of this kind.  I never made that case in Special Committee and no one, including Deputy Taylor, should make that case now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor did not accurately represent the position in Britain.  In Britain, if a person goes to court seeking divorce on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown, that is simply not the end of the matter.  Notices must be served on the other party, and it is open to the other party to say that he does not believe the marriage has irretrievably broken down and that he does not want a divorce. There can be as much litigation on the concept of irretrievable breakdown as there would be on what is a normal marriage.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day in drawing up legislation we have to resort to the ultimate decision of a judge in deciding. What is normal or abnormal, as Deputy Desmond said, will obviously and inevitably lead to a degree of judicial decision making.  That will be varied as are all judicial decisions.  If the concept of irretrievable breakdown, which I would prefer to have included, were included it too is as open to debate.  The judges can agree or disagree on what has irretrievably broken down.  Parties will be entitled to argue and litigate on it.  Our preference is for the concept of irretrievable breakdown to be included in the Bill but it is quite obvious that it canoot be included given the conservative preponderence in the House and given the very bitter and deeply felt opposition to the concept being included in the Bill. Compromise was the only way out and we have a compromise that is acceptable to the two major political parties and for that reason it will succeed.  We have to go with that concept.</P>

      <P>I understood that in the Special Committee we all agreed to that procedure.  There is a degree of opportunism in coming back in and suggesting that whilst the compromise is there, we should not stay with it and we should make the case that was very eloquently made by all Opposition contributors <Col N="1398" /> when we tried to support the concept of irretrievable breakdown.  That was almost a year ago and the opportunity has now gone.  We should now be getting this legislation on its way as quickly as possible.  Whilst The Workers' Party would prefer to include irretrievable breakdown, we accept that it is not possible at this stage, so we will not vote against Deputy Taylor's amendment, but equally we will not support it because of what has taken place in the development of this legislation to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed Deputy Taylor's amendment in Special Committee and I do so again.  It would reintroduce into the Bill the concept of irretrievable breakdown and the family circumstances provision, section 2 (1) (f) of the original Bill.  I made it clear that irretrievable breakdown was not only unsuitable but also unnecessary in separation proceedings.  I am glad that the concept is no longer in the Bill. The Bill is all the better for it.  The family circumstances provision has, in effect, been replaced by the more precise ground of breakdown in marriage, and in granting a decree on that basis the court must be satisfied in all the circumstances that a normal marriage relationship has not existed between the spouses for at least a year.  I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands provides properly and fully for all the circumstances in which a judicial separation should be obtainable.  There is no need for Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Colley's amendment, the phrase used in section 2 (1) (f) &ldquo;normal marital relationship has not existed&rdquo; will present no difficulties to the court.  That is a phrase in common use in case law in the family law area. Once the court is satisfied that in all the circumstances a normal marital relationship has not existed for at least a year, it will grant a decree.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;in all the circumstances&rdquo; constitutes an important safeguard in that it will ensure that only genuine breakdown cases will come before the courts.  It will exclude cases where, for example, one spouse <Col N="1399" /> has to work away from home for long periods.  I cannot accept Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the comments of various Deputies, I will first take Deputy Taylor's amendment.  It has always been the objective of my party to secure a provision in this Bill whereby a couple who were still living under the same roof, who were incompatible and whose marriage had broken down could secure a separation decree without having to engage in acrimony and mud-slinging before the courts.  I am satisfied that the formula which has been devised with the Minister contained in section 2 (1) (f) of the Bill which will enable a decree of separation to be granted where it is established that a marriage has broken down, will achieve that objective. I have no doubt that the Judiciary will be fully competent to deal with the concept in that subsection.  I have no doubt that with a degree of common sense attached to the application of that provision many couples who currently are living a marital nightmare in family homes where communication has broken down, where normal interaction between husband and wife has long since collapsed, but where there is no violence or adultery, will, for the first time, be able to avail of a legal remedy to effect a separation decree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Taylor in approaching this Bill in the context of this provision should have throughout the course of our deliberations shown a degree of inconsistency, that at this stage can only be described as political schizophrenia. We have heard today from him that in effect, he would like the Bill reinstated in its original form.  Deputy Taylor will have noted in quoting from the proceedings of the Committee that I had laid emphasis on the courts being able to grant a separation decree where it was established that a marriage had broken down.  The essential reference there was to the establishment of marital <Col N="1400" /> breakdown and that is what paragraph (f) would allow.  It is noteworthy that Deputy Taylor throughout our debate on the original Committee Stage constantly poured scorn on the concept of irretrievable marital breakdown as contained in the Bill when published.</P>
    <P>I will not waste the time of the House by quoting a variety of extracts from contributions Deputy Taylor made.  I will merely refer to one comment he made at column 37 of the report of the proceedings of the Special Committee on 23 March 1988.  According to Deputy Taylor, the concept of irretrievable breakdown was an artificial concept and the Bill provided for artificial definitions. Deputy Taylor was all but critical of the original provision contained in the Bill as regards irretrievable breakdown of marriage. He tells us today, of course, that what he is now proposing is that we either reinstate the Bill to where it was, or we take up his new amendment which refers to the concept of irretrievable breakdown of marriage without trying to define what irretrievable breakdown of marriage is.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it is now, established proof that a marriage has broken down will allow the courts to grant a decree. What about a couple who have not had normal communications or a relationship for a year or two and who come before a court under Deputy Taylor's proposal? The judge would say: &ldquo;I accept that you have not got on for a couple of years and your marriage has clearly broken down, but I do not believe it is irretrievable.  I believe that in a couple of years time you will both get on again and I am not going to grant a decree&rdquo;.  The amendment Deputy Taylor is now proposing is even more restrictive, or a great deal more uncertain, which is a fairer phrase to use, in the context of proposals made at various stages during the course of our deliberations as to the grounds for separation than other provisions may have been as to its judicial application.  At all stages we have been anxious to ensure that there is some guidance to the Judiciary as to how they can determine whether a decree should be granted where a marriage has collapsed.  The provision we have <Col N="1401" /> included in this Bill clearly sets out that guidance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the fact that the Labour Party had been supportive of the Bill.  Indeed, I have been very grateful throughout the deliberations in this House and the Special Committee for the support which has been given by all parties on the Opposition benches and I am pleased that the difficulties between us and the Government party have been resolved, but I would have to say that on occasions the approach of the Labour Party has been extraordinarily puzzling.  I have already referred to Deputy Taylor's approach to the concept of irretrievable breakdown of marriage on which he poured some scorn at some considerable length during the original debates on Committee Stage.  On 29 November, when a motion was tabled to recommit this Bill, Deputy Taylor had all sorts of reservations about recommittal.  I want to quote from Deputy Taylor's contribution in the Official Report of 29 November 1988 &mdash; and I want to remind the House that at an earlier stage he had thought the way irretrievable breakdown of marriage was dealt with in the Bill was not appropriate &mdash; where he said: &ldquo;... legislation is urgently needed in this area.  Every one of us knows of people who are suffering and who would find relief from the passage of this Bill with all its faults&rdquo;, in other words, with the faults contained in the Bill which we have remedied by the amendments made to the Bill and which have been agreed on all sides.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>If the decision is taken to recommit this Bill to the Special Committee it is almost inevitable that it will not see the light of day again this side of a general election.  It would take some months at least in Committee if amended there, it would have to come back to the House on Report Stage again and then go to the Seanad, and we know what might befall it there. </P>
    <P>At that stage of the debate on the motion to recommit in the context of our dealing with the problems which are dealt with in this section, of the grounds upon which <Col N="1402" /> a separation can be granted, Deputy Taylor was anxious not to recommit the Bill.  He said that the Bill would be buried for months and even if it was not and came back on Report Stage we all knew what might befall it in the Seanad.  By implication, Deputy Taylor meant that the Government in the Seanad might, no matter what the Dáil ultimately decided, dismantle the Bill in some way and reinsert all the faults it was generally acknowledged were contained in it at that stage due to the Government's amendments. Deputy Taylor went on to say:</P>
    <P>From various conversations I have heard I am satisfied that there is the beginning of a will to solve this problem and a desire to end the political footballing that has taken place over this issue in the last couple of weeks.  If all parties in the House agreed to a short moratorium there might well be a chance of reaching an agreement that would enable the passage of the Bill to be completed quickly with no major deviation from the important principle we all seek to establish....  In the course of the next week there will be a time for all parties to sit down and endeavour to reach common ground about the issues that divide us. </P>

I do not envisage troops of psychiatrists being brought into court on a separation application such as Deputy Taylor suggests. The true insight into Deputy Taylor's attitude and approach to this was evident by his offhand remark about the Tallaght strategy.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Taylor, having urged everyone not to make the Bill a political football, sought in the past couple of weeks to kick it around as if it is some sort of political football, to his benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank both Deputy Colley and Deputy McCartan for their support and their constructive contributions at all times to the debate on each and every section of the Bill as it was being teased out.  I very much understand the case that Deputy Colley is making in the context <Col N="1405" /> of her amendment.  As with any new legislation, there are always valid areas for debate and discussion as to exactly how the Judiciary will interpret a particular provision.  I am satisfied, as is the Minister, that the Judiciary would have no difficulty in applying section 2 (1) (f) to enable separation to be granted to couples who are estranged, as Deputy Colley so properly puts it, for at least one year and one or other wishes to separate and the court is satisfied that that is reasonable.  I suggest to Deputy Colley that the form of wording that she has used in the proposed amendment to paragraph (f) is to exactly the same effect as the form of wording now in the Bill.  Just as one might want to tease out the meaning of a normal marital relationship not existing, equally the courts would tease out what is meant by the concept of an estranged couple.  When are they actually estranged?  At what stage does the relationship break down to the extent that it is estranged?  I would suggest that a court being asked to do that would in effect look at whether a normal marriage relationship existed between the couple at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to that relationship rather than the model relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In that context what the court is doing is seeing whether a normal marriage relationship existed between the spouses, as the provision says, before the court.  It does not set up a role model by which husbands and wives will be judged.  I very much appreciate Deputy Colley's comments on this provision.  I suggest to her that as the Bill will now enable the court to grant a separation decree where a marriage has broken down &mdash; as her provision would also do &mdash; there is no real difference between us in the context of the various amendments that have been tabled.  It is largely a matter of semantics.  It is my belief that the provison we now have in the Bill will fully, properly and adequately deal with all situations that need to be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> I thank Deputy McCartan for his helpful remarks.  He is correct in saying that we started off by trying to provide irretrievable breakdown as the overall ground for granting a separation decree. The Fine Gael Party believed that to be the correct approach and that approach was adopted by the Oireachtas joint committee after two years of deliberation. We are also satisfied that the concept of marital breakdown as provided for in this section as it now stands will adequately meet all the situations that we were concerned to meet in the Bill as originally drafted.  I would hope that because of that it would be supported by all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and Deputy McCartan referred to the desirability or not of divorce. That is a separate issue.  This is a Bill dealing with judicial separation.  It does not and cannot deal with divorce. Divorce is a matter that the people at some stage may have to confront by way of referendum.  A referendum was held in 1986 on that issue.  This House cannot legislate in that area.</P>
    <P>I refer now to something that Deputy Taylor said on recommiting the Bill.  I would hope that the amendments that have now been made to the Bill as agreed will be seen as a package designed to ensure that this legislation is enacted as rapidly a possible, to meet the urgent need in this area to which Deputy Taylor referred.  I would point out to Deputy Taylor that we have managed to reach an accommodation which I believe deals with all the issues that required to be dealt with in a way that will vastly improve and overhaul our law and to some extent revolutionise family law.  As Deputy Taylor accepted, it will provide legislation that is necessary as we enter into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It is worth bringing to his attention that we have now reached the stage when there will be no difficulty with the Bill in the Seanad.  The fate that Deputy Taylor was concerned might befall the Bill in the Seanad will now not befall it because, as the Minister stated, it is agreed that the measure before the House, in the context of issues about which there has been <Col N="1407" /> controversy will not be in any way attacked by any of the major groupings within the Seanad.  What we now have is a Bill that the Minister and we have publicly stated will rapidly pass into law and become part of our statutory legislation before the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply briefly to some of the comments made.  Having listened carefully to what Deputy Shatter had to say I believe he has not at all addressed himself to the comments that I made regarding the section 2 (1) (f) clause which is the kernel of the agreement which he reached with the Minister. His remarks on that issue seemed largely to be confined to such statements as that he was quite satisfied with it.  He said that twice or three times.  He said that in his opinion it would fully and adequately deal with all situations that might arise under it.  That kind of statement, even backed by his undoubted knowledge of the subject, cannot be regarded as a substitute for reasoned argument as to the actual wording of the clause that we are faced with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that on the motion to recommit on behalf of the Labour Party I expressed reservations.  Those reservations were well taken and, it is fair to say, have been borne out by events. While it is true that the delays I feared have not materialised, one wonders as to the reason for that.  I think the secret emerges from one word which Deputy Shatter used in his reply, that what we are faced with here is a package.  Let us be honest about it.  A package is fine; a compromise is fine.  Undoubtedly, the Minister conceded on some of the important matters at issue in the debates between Fianna Fáil and everbody else, particularly when dealing with property rights and so forth.  He certainly did not concede on this issue.  On this issue, I am afraid, we are left in a position &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Shatter well knows this &mdash; that is in line with the Minister's wishes so far as grounds for separation are concerned, rather than the wishes originally espoused by Deputy Shatter and all the <Col N="1408" /> other parties who supported him on this Bill.</P>
    <P>He said that I described the definition of irretrievable breakdown in the course of the earlier debates as artificial.  That is true.  What he does not point out is that I was referring to the original format of his Bill which as drawn gave an artificial definition of the expression &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo;.  Deputies will recall that it provided that the sole ground for separation &mdash; this is the original Bill as initiated &mdash; was irretrievable breakdown. It then went on to give an artificial definition to that, that irretrievable breakdown would be established by proving one or more of a number of grounds.  A careful look at my amendment will show that I have gone away from that artificiality and I put in the expression &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; in its own right as a separate ground without giving it its original artificial definition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter adopted a lofty and superior position when he talked about the carping of the Labour Party.  There is more to the Oireachtas than Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I know they are both big and important parties and perhaps nobody is more aware of their importance than each of them.  However, there are others &mdash; admittedly smaller parties &mdash; who feel they have a contribution to make, a position to represent and a role to play.  In our own small way we try to make that contribution as best we can. Very often our numbers are not respected in the way they should be but we try.  A package is fine but that does not mean that we do not have a duty to highlight the downside aspects of that package. The Labour Party and I believe that section 2 is one of the downsides and nothing that has been said by the Minister or Deputy Shatter has in any way elucidated the realities of what spouses will face in seeking separation under section 2 (1) (f).  I have discussed the matter with many colleagues who practise in the family law area and they share my fear that it leaves the matter as a fault-based application.  That is why we tabled this amendment and if it is accepted it will <Col N="1409" /> constitute a substantial improvement on this aspect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Circuit Court and the District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under this Act and to make any of the orders referred to in sections 14, 15, 16 or 18 as ancillary orders, and in so doing shall be referred to as the Circuit Family Court and District Family court respectively.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act, the District Court shall not make an order&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  under section 14 (1) (a) or (b) or section 16 (g), for the payment of a periodical sum at a rate greater than £110 per week in respect of the maintenance of a spouse or £35 per week for the maintenance of each dependent child of the family,</P>
      <P>(b)  under section 14 (1) (c) or (d), for the payment of a lump sum or sums exceeding in total £8,500 for the benefit of a spouse or £2,500 for the benefit of each dependent child of the family.</P>
      <P>(c)  under section 15 (a) or (b), for the transfer or settlement of property exceeding £25,000 in value,</P>
      <P>(d)  under section 16 (a), (c), (d), or (f) or section 18 where the value of the personal property (other than chattels real) exceeds £25,000 or the rateable valuation of the lands exceeds £35.  </P>
      <P>(3)  The jurisdiction herein conferred may be exercised&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  as regards the Circuit Court, by the judge of the circuit, and</P>
      <P>(b)  as regards the District Court, by the justice of the District Court for the time being assigned to the district,</P>
      <P>where either party to the proceedings ordinarily resides or carries on a profession, business or occupation. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> (4)  The jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court to hear and determine proceedings instituted under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and Family Law Act, 1981, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Legitimacy Declaration Act (Ireland), 1868, and proceedings between spouses under the Partition Acts 1868 to 1876 shall be exercised by the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>(5)  The jurisdiction conferred on the District Court to hear and determine proceedings instituted under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the Family Law Act, 1981, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, and the Status of Children Act, 1987, shall be exercised by the District Family Court.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 and the other amendments is to give jurisdiction within certain defined limits, as in the amendments, to the District Court as well as the jurisdiction already provided for in the Bill as it is before the House in the Circuit Court.  The reason we seek to give a limited jurisdiction in certain cases to the District Court is to open up the accessibility to the new remedies now being provided for in this Bill to people who otherwise would not be able to have access to them.  Our fear is that in the absence of the giving of such a jurisdiction to the District Court this measure will turn out to be available and open only to the rich and only those who will be in a position to afford the very high and substantial legal costs that would be necessary to get into the Circuit Court. The costs of a Circuit Court action run on anything from £1,000 or £1,500 plus, covering the cost of solicitors, barristers, VAT, consultants' fees, stamps on documents and so on, and the procedure in <Col N="1414" /> the higher Circuit Court is more complex, involving more pleadings and more expense than would be the case of proceedings in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill is providing new remedies. That is an excellent measure.  That is progress.  However, I have to raise the question here, what will it benefit the overwhelming bulk of the people who need to avail of these remedies if they cannot get into court to avail of them? As I put it to the Minister when we were discussing this matter in the Special Committee, he should do a number of things. He should tell us he will give a guarantee to the House that he will provide substantial additional funds that would be necessary to the Legal Aid Board so that they could provide a legal service for people who would need to avail of the new remedies being provided in this Bill. If the Minister assures the House that he is prepared to provide those funds so that people who need to get a judicial separation under this Bill, and who have not the money to do so, will be able to get legal aid for the purpose, that would be fine.  If he gives that undertaking to the House I will withdraw these amendments. However, the Minister gave no such commitment in the Committee and I do not suppose he is going to give it here either.</P>
    <P>In a TV interview after the Committee the Minister stated that this was a separate matter and he, the Minister, in due course would try to get the additional funds needed by the Legal Aid Board.  It is not a separate matter: it is a connective matter and very much a connective matter.  We do not want to have under this Bill what applies, unfortunately, to so many other aspects of access to the law, that access to this Bill remains open to all, just like the Ritz Hotel.  In other words, those who have the £1,500 up front for the lawyers, psychiatrists and psychologists can go and get the separation and those who cannot are left outside and cannot avail of the Bill.  What are they to do?  It is no good telling a person in that position that there is an excellent new Act there with excellent new remedies for the courts, the person's <Col N="1415" /> marriage situation can now be resolved through the courts, there are marvellous provisions about arbitration and negotiation to resolve marital disputes and there are ancillary orders the courts can make and that all these new remedies are there.  What good is that to the person who has not the money to have access to them or who on going to the Legal Aid Board finds they are not in the position to provide him or her with the facilities? What do we say to that person?</P>
    <P>I instanced a case in the Committee and I will do it again here to bring the matter down to reality.  The Minister goes into his clinic in Limerick and finds a spouse there waiting to see him who says to him: &ldquo;Minister, I need a judicial separation urgently but I do not have money. What can I do?  How can I avail of this new remedy in the new Judicial Separation Bill?  Where do I go?&rdquo; I do not know what the Minister is going to give as his answer to that.  I wish he would tell us.  It is not just the Minister.  Each of us in our clinics doing our political work will be faced with that.  I am waiting to hear answers on this and the answers I am getting are that there are all sorts of new remedies, you can do this or that and the Bill provides this, that and the other, but the nub question still remains.  How do they get into court if they have not got the £1,500 for the Circuit Court and if the doors of the Legal Aid Board centres are closed to them?  What are the Legal Aid Board themselves saying on the question? The annual report of the Legal Aid Board for 1986 deals with the failure to meet demand and states at paragraph 3.1:</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret to the Board that it is obliged, once again, in an Annual Report to headline the fact that, although thousands of people have been provided with legal aid and advice services since its last Report was published, it can still go nowhere near meeting public demand for these services. </P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.2 states:</P>
    <P>The principal piece of hard evidence <Col N="1416" /> of the inadequacy of the service is the fact that several Law Centres, especially over the past 12 months, have had to close their doors to new work for months on end. </P>
    <P>The heading &ldquo;Opening of New Law Centres Shelved&ldquo; tells its own story.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8.1 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of the Board's last Report stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recently-announced intention of the Minister for Justice to reform family law is most welcome &mdash; and the Board has been glad to provide suggestions in this regard. The Board has to make the point, however, that reform of family law will, unfortunately, not be of very much benefit or relevance to a great many people unless, at the same time, a serious commitment is made to provide adequate staff and adequate funds for the expansion of the legal aid service.  Unless the necessary resources are provided, the Board will be unable to make equal and effective access to legal services available to those who need them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8.2 states:</P>
    <P>The central point &mdash; that law reform, especially family law reform, has an impact on legal aid &mdash; needs to be emphasised again.  If the reforms of family law currently before the Oireachtas are enacted, there is no doubt that many people &mdash; perhaps thousands &mdash; will seek legal aid to avail themselves of the new provisions; and there is no doubt either that, without additional resources, the Board will be unable to meet their needs.  There is already a queue for legal services; the anticipated demand likely to be produced by the proposed legislation will lengthen this queue to an extent that will make its anticipated advantages illusory for a great many people. </P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on television that he will try to obtain some additional resources for the Legal Aid Board.  I wish <Col N="1417" /> him luck and I do not doubt his <i>bona fides.</i>  What is the reality?  The provision in the 1989 Estimates for the Legal Aid Board represents a further cut in the allocation to this service, on top of the cut in 1988.  The situation is getting worse, not better.  We know the Fianna Fáil record of cutbacks in every facet of life and we know that the Minister, notwithstanding his efforts, will not get the money needed to provide a proper legal aid service.  The Legal Aid Board will not be able to meet the needs of people who cannot afford to pay to avail of the remedies in this Bill. The Minister should not tell us that the person in his advice clinic in Limerick can be sent to the Legal Aid Board.  Those doors are closed.  I am assuming there is a law centre in Limerick, although in many parts of the country there are no such centres.</P>
    <P>Let us provide a jurisdiction for the District Court so that when the Bill is passed a person who needs a separation or one of the other remedies provided for in the Bill but who has not a penny will be able to go the family law office in the District Court and obtain the help of the clerks, who give such magnificent help to the people who seek their assistance.  I pay tribute to those District Court clerks who voluntarily fill in forms and summonses for people making barring, maintenance or custody applications.  There is no charge for this service and it is possible to get a case into the District Court without any legal cost.</P>
    <P>People in the Legal Aid Board tell me that sometimes those who seek their help cannot even afford the £15 subscription charge, never mind the £1,500 costs of a Circuit Court action.  Solicitors will practise on their own without barristers in the District Court, which is the court in which they normally practise.  For a small or modest fee there should be no difficulty in getting a solicitor to conduct a separation case and obtain some of the ancillary orders available under the Bill.  If the solicitor's modest fee cannot be provided for, it can be arranged through the District Court clerks for no fee at all.</P>
    <P>The point is sometimes made that it would be inappropriate for the District <Col N="1418" /> Court to have this jurisdiction and that district justices might not be able to cope with this legislation.  Some district justices do strange things on occasion.  Some Circuit Court and High Court judges also do some strange things on occasion.  It is by no means unusual to have the Circuit Court overruled by the High Court and the High Court overruled by the Supreme Court.  Whether it is ideal or not, what we are proposing will provide a remedy to people which they otherwise will not have.  The district justices who work in the family law courts have great experience, from my personal knowledge of such cases.  They already deal with a wide range of family law matters, including barring applications, maintenance and custody applications.  They are no strangers to the area of family law.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all parties come to me privately and say there is a great deal of merit in the proposition to give the District Court this jurisdiction, but they are obliged to obey the Whips.  Some Deputies have said that they privately support the idea but that for political reasons they cannot vote in favour of it. I welcome the fact that another legal remedy will be brought to the Statute Book but I cannot understand why we cannot provide that it is open for all, not just to the select wealthy few who will be able to avail of it.  The irony of it is that those select, wealthy few hardly need the provision at all.  What are those who can afford to pay doing?  We know what they are doing.  Most of them are not bothering with judicial separation at all.  They are getting divorces in the United Kingdom through divorce lawyers over there, using the irretrievable breakdown procedures with no problem at all.  Those who have the money get their divorces in England. That is the reality.  Those people who will need to avail of the new remedies here are those people who cannot afford them. Unless we provide the District Court jurisdiction for them they will not be able to avail of these new remedies.  That is the harsh reality here.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his efforts to get more money for the Legal Aid Board. I wish him luck but I know full well, and <Col N="1419" /> I think he knows himself, that in the present economic climate, bearing in mind the policies of this Government, it is just not on; it is just not going to be.</P>
    <P>I want to know what I am to tell the unfortunate woman whose marriage has broken down, who is experiencing desperate conditions, in my clinic.  What is the Minister to tell such a person in his clinic in Limerick?  I do not know that the answer is but it is indefensible.  In the absence of a commitment on the part of the Minister to give us the money for the Legal Aid Board, he should at least open up the jurisdiction to the District Court so that the remedies will be open to all our people not just the select few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still opposed to this amendment for the several reasons I explained in the course of our deliberations in Special Committee.  While I have sympathy with its purpose, unfortunately there are difficulties which do not appear capable of resolution.  While perhaps a case could be made, because of the extensive family law jurisdiction the District Court already possesses, that the granting of a decree should be dealt with by that court, few cases will be as simple or straightforward as that.  Very often the main reason for coming to court will be the resolution of disputes about other matters, including property matters. I do not think the District Court should have jurisdiction over the division of property, including the division of the family home.  At present the District Court has no jurisdiction in equitable matters of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, under the provisions of section 17, as they stand now, the court is empowered &mdash; on granting a decree of judicial separation &mdash; to consider whether it should make an order extinguishing the succession rights of either spouse.  The High Court and the Circuit Court, but not the District Court, at present have jurisdiction in relation to matters under <Col N="1420" /> the Succession Act, 1965.  I do not think it would be appropriate to depart from that principle under the provisions of this Bill.  In addition, the present monetary jurisdiction of the District Court does not exceed £2,500.  I would be opposed to any increase in that limit other than by way of a general review of the jurisdiction of the District Court which would involve inevitably a review of the Circuit Court's jurisdiction also.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment arises from the belief that the Legal Aid Board, who administer the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, will not be in a position to deal with the demand for the remedies provided in the Bill.  Indeed the board themselves in their 1986 report said that without additional resources they would be unable to meet this demand and predicted that the queue for legal services would lengthen.  The board are already dealing with a large increase in the number of people requiring services in connection with judicial separation in the Circuit Court.  That is evident from the board's reports of 1985 and 1986.  I have no doubt that that position has obtained right through to this year.  Of course, that demand will increase further as a result of the provisions of the Bill.  However, to some extent, this is likely to involve a switch in the already existing demand for remedies in the District Court &mdash; proceedings for barring orders, maintenance and custody in excess, which constitute the highest proportion of legal aid cases &mdash; to demand for judicial separation and ancillary remedies in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I am not endeavouring to contend that there will be no overall impact on the demand for services under the civil legal aid scheme but this aspect needs to be put in context.  It would be wrong to assume that legal services under the scheme will not be available to people who wish to avail of the provisions of this Bill and who are eligible for services under the scheme.  If the pressure for sevices increases it is likely that further delays will arise at some law centres in taking on new clients.  It may be that some judicial separation cases will not fall within the category of emergency cases; <Col N="1421" /> some delay should be tolerated in such cases.  It is well to bear in mind that, even in the case of private solicitor's services, clients may have to wait for appointments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the difficulties encountered by the Legal Aid Board in coping with demand for their services, I should say that those difficulties are related to the availability of resources and the related question of the present restrictions on public expenditure and staffing. I have already informed the House that I am keeping the position about the provision of legal services under the scheme under review and that if anything can be done within the constraints of present Government policy, it will be done.</P>
    <P>The effect of the remedies provided in the Bill, in putting extra pressure on the board, will be closely monitored.  If the circumstances warrant remedial action I will be the first to make the case for extra resources for the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue of fundamental importance in respect of which I support the Labour Party amendment. Indeed I have consistently done so throughout our deliberation on this Bill. By way of clarifying the position I should say that this amendment was not locked in the major inter-party strife that marked our deliberations on the previous one.  This is not one on which I feel I should hold fire, this being the last stage of our deliberations in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On every occasion on which we have debated the provisions of this Bill I made the fundamental case that I believe the district courts are the most important courts administering law in this country, being the most easily accessible and most democratic.  I repeat that view again today.  Indeed that view has been taken on board by many Members in response to points made by Deputy Taylor and me, as an indication of the taking of a position on some ideological grounds.  I fail to understand that interpretation. However, if my description of the district courts as the most democratic is taken to express an ideological view, then so be it.  I believe it is the fundamental principle <Col N="1422" /> or base from which we should embark on any discussion in regard to these legal remedies.  I contend they are the most democratic courts in so far as they are the most widely located and accessible, sitting most frequently, for the longest number of hours of all of our courts.  They are staffed and operated by people who are closer to the community, understanding better their concerns.</P>
    <P>The point has been made frequently that district justices tend to do funny things more often.  That is not the case. That reflects their closeness to the community, as does the fact that their courts are so widely attended and reported in any given area, drawing more attention to them.  For example, reports of proceedings in the High Court are rarefied, often couched in terms of the delivery of an important judgment on an issue, but what one reads or hears from the media in terms of proceedings in the District Court is the cut and thrust of daily life.  I cannot think of a better forum to which people in any given district should resort to air their problems and grievances with regard to their marriages, seeking a fair judicial determination coloured by the experience of everyday life on the Bench.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the present condition of the buildings and facilities of the District Court are suited to the remedies being sought in this amendment.  Many of our district courts have been neglected by respective local authorities or Ministers for successive decades and are in an appalling condition.  If there were to be commitment to the fundamental principle I have outlined, an acceptance of the ideas contained in this Bill, then much work would have to be done on them. As I pointed out in the course of our deliberations in Special Committee, a lot of work has been undertaken by some local authorities in some areas, Dublin in particular, for example, in the metropolitan areas, in East Essex Street, and at the family district courts on the Quays that have modern facilities capable of dealing adequately with anything that might arise as a result of the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> The practitioners in Dún Laoghaire brought me to County Wicklow to show me what can be done if a local authority is prepared to commit money to the development of proper District Court facilities.  I am referring in particular to the court facilities in Bray, County Wicklow. The practitioners in Dún Laoghaire have been complaining for years about the appalling conditions under which District Justice Wine has to operate and they tried to illustrate their case by getting people to contrast the facilities there with those in Bray.</P>
    <P>Kilmainham District Court is a disgrace to the concept of justice or its proper administration and for years the district justice &mdash; District Justice Hussey on occasions &mdash; had to withdraw from court because it was physically impossible to operate there.  Many rural courthouses are completely out of date and no longer suit the purpose of the modern administration of justice.  If we are to take on board the concept of the amendment, which I believe we should, local authorities, who have responsibility in this area, will have to invest money in the development of courthouses.  If we do not accept the amendment we must bear in mind that there is an urgent need to deal with the conditions in many of our courthouses. Their dilapidated conditions impact on the quality of the job done on the day.  The conditions certainly impact on the level of regard that people obliged to attend those courts have for what takes place there.</P>
    <P>My argument is that facilities not existing is not a reason why the principle as first laid down should be done away with.  I am referring to the development of the District Court and investment in it as the most important court in the land.  We should increase and embellish its jurisdiction to enable it to deal more and more with the administration of justice on a daily and weekly basis.  If the amendment is taken on board there will be a need to ensure that district justices are paid a proper wage.  I do not believe that their present salary is adequate for the job they are expected <Col N="1424" /> to do and it will be far from adequate if we ask them to take on the responsibility of implementing the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Legal education is a key to the success of such legislation.  People have suggested that district justices, and judges, are incapable of administering the law properly and one of the reasons put forward is that we do not have any system of education for such people before they take up the job and, once they take on the job, there is no system of further education on the law and social issues.  If there was a change in that procedure, we would be eliminating many of the reservations people have about giving the District Court jurisdiction to deal with the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the District Court exercises considerable jurisdiction in the area of marital breakdown and family law affairs.  It deals with the safety of children, custody and the placing of children in a safe location where marriages are in trouble.  It can deal with barring orders and can, in fact, judicially separate couples by barring one person from the home.  It can deal with maintenance orders.  In my view 100 per cent of those referred to in the amendment &mdash; when we are talking about property, we are referring to the issue of maintenance &mdash; will not have property or houses to dispose of.  The only right of property any of them enjoy is the right of residence in a local authority house.  It can be argued that because the District Court can bar people from a home for up to two years, 12 months, renewable for 12 months, we are not extending greatly the jurisdiction of that court in the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a worry about the District Court not carrying equitable jurisdiction and that it might not be appropriate for the court to have the right to decide on personal property up to a value of £25,000 or real property in settlement up to £25,000 as suggested by Deputy Taylor. I would not have any difficulty if those provisions were omitted from the Deputy's amendment because without them he will be achieving what he is setting out to achieve, particularly for <Col N="1425" /> those he is concerned about, namely, those who do not have property or wealth.  We can achieve what Deputy Taylor wants and meet the worries of the Minister by compromising and giving the District Court jurisdiction to make declarations of judicial separation but restricting the cases to those where issues of substantial property or personal wealth are not involved.  Issues of wealth and property by one means or another can be dealt with by the Circuit Court.  Deputy Taylor is seeking to cater for 250,000 people whose spouses are unemployed. He is concerned about the one third of the population who live on or below the poverty line, people who will not be asking a court in granting judicial separation to deal with the disposition of the family home because that property will belong to a loan company or, more than likely, to the local authority.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Taylor has pointed out, the key to all this is the poor legal aid service that we have.  Lawyers working the law centres are anxious to keep jurisdiction for these matters to the Circuit Court but for the wrong reasons.  They are grossly overworked and the centres are poorly staffed.  However, there is an arrangement under the current legal aid rules which facilitates the solicitor in the law centre retaining the services of a barrister for the Circuit Court.  The Legal Aid Board, and their rules, do not facilitate the retention of a barrister for practice in the District Court.  Consequently, a family law matter to be dealt with in the District Court requires the attendance of a solicitor from the law centre.  A family law matter to be dealt with at the Circuit Court is invariably dealt with by a barrister, almost exclusively, and requires the minimum of attention by the solicitor. It may not be the best professional arrangement but it is what happens in Dublin.  I cannot speak for the rural areas but it is the way law centres in Dublin operate.</P>
    <P>The solicitors who work in the Dublin law centres are worried that if jurisdiction in these matters is given to the District Court they will not be able to handle the increased work load and responsibility. <Col N="1426" /> That is why they are arguing that we should leave matters with the Circuit Court.  They are wrong about that although they may be right for their own practical working reasons because they work under unbelievable conditions of pressure.  At the drop of a hat law centres close their doors to new business for indefinite periods, up to three and four months on occasion.  They do so because they cannot take on any new business due to the work load they must carry.  They do not want that position exacerbated.  It is their view that if the jurisdiction is left with the Circuit Court and they are able to draw on the help of barristers they will be able to deal with other work that arises at the law centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider changing the regulations governing the Legal Aid Board to allow for the retention of barristers for work in the District Court. If that was done family law cases, and other cases, could be dealt with by barristers in the District Court.  There is no doubt that there are many barristers in the Law Library who are willing and able to do this work.  They should be involved in work in the District Court but the legal aid rules do not allow it.  If that was changed we would have the family lawyers' groups and associations supporting Deputy Taylor's amendment and going along with the suggestion that the District Court is as good a place as any other to deal with these or related matters.  In discussing this amendment today we at least got the opportunity of scotching some of the misconceptions bandied about in regard to the quality of justice delivered in our District Courts.  They are dedicated people doing a very good job and no argument should be made here that they are not capable of dealing with, or competent to deal with the issues that may arise.  If there are reservations about the equitable area of jurisdiction then let us take out those two sections of Deputy Taylor's amendment and get on with the job of dealing with a major problem for those who, without money, will not, in the foreseeable future, be able to avail <Col N="1427" /> of the procedures and recommendations contained in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This ground was well trodden on Committee Stage and on the last occasion when it was before the House generally.  Deputy Taylor's argument is something of a side issue.  The central issue is access in relation to this legislation.  He has confused the issue of finance and extending the jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the competence of the District Court in this area must be put under scrutiney.  It was never envisaged that the family law area would be reduced to District Court level.  In that regard we have to look at the recommendations of the joint committee, a couple of years ago, to set up a family tribunal separate from the present court structure and empowered to deal with all matters pertaining to family law, from the barring order to the extension of judicial separation. It must be our aim to establish such a tribunal.  Because it is unattainable at present through lack of funding we should not discard that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor's point is not so much about access to the District Court as about access to the court system by people whose marriages are in difficulty and who need a court proclamation or declaration as to the status of the marriage. The answer lies in funding the Legal Aid Board to allow such access. The Minister has spoken on a number of occasions about this issue.  The dire situation of the Legal Aid Board, so eloquently portrayed by Deputy Taylor, must be borne in mind.  I do not think the answer is to open up the District Court for such very important matters.  There may be parallels, but they are in no way absolute.  I know the District Court is empowered to deal with maintenance matters, barring orders and custody cases; but we are dealing here with the finality of separation, so there must be a question mark over the competence of the District Court to deal with such a matter. The District Court is the court of petty sessions, the court of first recourse, the <Col N="1428" /> minor court.  Deputy McCartan spoke about the democratic nature of the District Court but we should also acknowledge the varying degrees of minority cases that are heard on a day-to-day basis there.  We must look at the manner in which family law matters are being heard in our District Court.  Over the past ten years there have been lengthy lists of family law matters to be dealt with in our District Courts.  It is a fair assumption that many of our district justices, competent as they might be in other matters, do not like dealing with family law matters and are not trained in matters pertaining to family law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say the same about the High Court and the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters are appearing in the District Court on a day-to-day basis.  One has only to look at the way District Court matters are adjourned at District Court level, at the way family law matters are listed for hearing at 2.30 p.m. to be completed by 3 o'clock or at 10.30 in the morning to be completed before 11 o'clock so that the normal District Court sitting can get under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the issues that are involved and which we have not thrashed out in deciding whether or not to take Deputy Taylor's amendment on board.  We cannot have such matters heard at District Court level.  In any event, the manner in which District Court decisions are treated by the vast majority of people is such that they carefully look for an avenue of appeal.  That would happen time and time again were Deputy Taylor's amendment to be taken on board and that would leave us in a far more difficult position in regard to funding. What would be the point of allowing access to the District Court if it is just going to be a rubber stamp for an appeal to a higher court at a later stage?  The resources in the District Court are such that they do not allow for an amendment of the magnitude of Deputy Taylor's amendment.  One must look at the District Court buildings up and down the <Col N="1429" /> country and in Dublin areas.  District Court sittings start early in the morning and in many instances run right through to 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening.  This just goes to show now busy these courts are without extending their jurisdiction.  If this amendment were to be accepted we would be talking about revolutionary changes in District Court structure.  At present the District Court is the nearest thing we have to a small claims court.  I see no reason for overhauling it to allow for increased jurisdiction.  Were the amendment to be taken on board we would be talking about increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court beyond the £2,500 which a civil litigant can enter for at present.  I feel there is no need for that, even aside from this legislation. Granting greater powers to the District Court is something that I feel it unnecessary at present.</P>
    <P>The nub of the argument is the question of funding.  There would appear to be a difference of opinion between Deputies Taylor and McCartan as to the role of the barrister.  Deputy Taylor stated that by allowing access to the District Court the family law litigant could avoid the extra burden of barristers' expenses. Deputy McCartan, while agreeing with the thrust of Deputy Taylor's amendment, felt that at least the Legal Aid Board should allow the barrister into the District Court.  What would be the saving to the litigant by a barrister travelling from the Law Library down the country to a District Court hearing instead of to a Circuit Court hearing?  We would not, in any way, be reducing expenses, as Deputy Taylor envisages, if we allow barristers in; there is no way we can restrict a barrister.  If a litigant wants to avail of the services of a barrister so be it.</P>
    <P>If these matters were to be held in the District Court it would be open to a barrister to travel to the District Court. Obviously if one side were to retain the services of a barrister the other side would in many ways find something of an imbalance in their case were they not to do so.  On many occasions there may be cases in which the litigant decides not to retain the services of a barrister.  Again <Col N="1430" /> perhaps we should look at the possibility of opening up the Circuit Court to members of the legal profession other than barristers.  If one agrees with Deputy Taylor on the question of the enormous expense of fighting a case in the Circuit Court there are alternatives other than access to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be taken into account but which I will not dwell on, relates to our court buildings.  There is a lack of consultation rooms and any sort of facilities that would give rise to comfortable surroundings in court buildings. There should be a basic requirement that people going to court have private chambers in which to consult with the witnesses and with their legal advisers, rather than have lengthy queues of people in corridors as is the case at present.  The District Court structure in terms of the physical buildings is not such as to cater for an expansion of family law lists.  In many cases the courts are hardly able to cater for the family law lists because of the lack of physical facilities. There is the scandalous situation of family law cases being called in open court where people have to parade through a backroom in many rural district courthouses and have their cases heard in intolerable conditions.  That point has to be addressed before this amendment can be taken on board.  Again the reality is that the resources are not readily available to local authorities to undertake a radical reform of the court structure which would provide that courts could take on board an expanded role.</P>
    <P>My overall view is that, as I have said initially, the District Court, being the court of minor jurisdiction and of petty sessions, is not the ideal-court in which to decide on such fundamental matters as the dissolution of a marriage.  The answer to Deputy Taylor's concern about access, and I share this concern, is increased funding to the Legal Aid Board and an increase in civil legal aid centres around the country.  In many cases people have to travel almost 70 miles to the nearest legal aid centre only to be told that they have to come back in six weeks time with detailed information.  These are <Col N="1431" /> the issues that must be addressed rather than allowing these matters into the District Court.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter I would like to refer to, and perhaps Deputy Taylor might explain it &mdash; I think he overlooked it in his opening comment &mdash; that is his final amendment which states &ldquo;Rules of court providing for the robes of judges and counsel and for modes of address&rdquo;. Perhaps he might comment on what he means by modes of address in the district family law court.  I do not suppose he has any other labels for the district justice or the sitting magistrate.  Perhaps he might explain what he means in that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy for what Deputy Taylor is trying to achieve here.  I have no doubt but that his motivation is quite genuine. Initially perhaps I would have taken his side but on closer examination of the position I would have to say that the power to grant a decree of judicial separation in the District Court might not be the right way to approach the matter. The gravest danger is that it would introduce into the legal system a two tier system of dispensing justice, a system whereby the District Court and the Circuit Court would both be empowered to make decisions on the same issue.  This in turn would perhaps lead to an inequitable situation whereby, because a person was of a certain social class he or she would go to the Circuit Court and if the person was in a different social class he or she would go to the District Court.  That would lead to a considerable amount of confusion.  It would perhaps be seen to be unequal and it might, in the final analysis, lead to the suspicion that there was no uniformity in dispensing justice in this area.  That is one of the reasons I would be very loath to grant the powers to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has also been made that the District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction and is intended to be so.  One could make the argument not just in <Col N="1432" /> relation to judicial separation but to several other areas of law in this country that people are deprived, because of their incomes or their possessions, from going to court at all.  This applies not just to judicial separation proceedings but also to many other areas of law.  That is an unfortunate situation.  One of the major reasons for it has been the fact that we have been unable, over the years, because of a lack of resources, to adequately fund the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>The question which arises in relation to people on low incomes is what precisely the District Court would be concerned with in terms of their property and possessions.  I think it is fair to say that in virtually every case with which a court would deal, the question of the family home would arise, regardless of the income of the people involved in the case.  The question then arises as to whether power should be given to the District Court to make an order in relation to the family home.  We know the District Court, for example, does not have the power to award in excess of £2,500 in an accident case, a trespass case or whatever.  Is it logical then to allow this court of summary jurisdiction to make an order in relation to the family home when it is clear that the average price of a family home in this country is far in excess of £2,500?  That poses difficulties and is something one would have to be concerned with because of the nature of the District Court and the District Court system.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor that there are difficulties of access in relation to low income couples but the present legislation gives far greater access than has been the case in relation to divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> in that at least now the Circuit Court will be in a position to deal with these applications whereas prior to this in cases of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> one had to apply to the High Court.  It is fair to say that unless one was fortunate enough to get legal aid one could not make any application whatsoever.  To this extent the drafters of the Bill are to be congratulated in opening up the access <Col N="1433" /> to a greater extent than was the case previously.</P>
    <P>I accept that access to the courts, because of the inadequate position with regard to the Legal Aid Board, is still inhibited to a certain extent.  I would argue that solicitors throughout the country should examine the possibility of appearing in court in situations where people cannot afford to employ counsel.  I recall, in the south-western Circuit Court two years ago, a solicitor apologising to Judge John Gleeson that he was unable to obtain counsel on the day.  The judge rightly said to him he had absolutely nothing to apologise for, that he had every right to represent a client in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It would be incumbent on the Law Society to advise their members that in order to enable this Bill to reach everybody that they would, where people cannot afford to employ counsel, appear themselves in court.  There is no law and no rule against that.  It is something which should be looked into.  The nub of the problem, unquestionably, is the position regarding the financing of the Legal Aid Board.  If the Legal Aid Board were better financed the question of access would not have arisen in the context of this amendment because I think Deputy Taylor would accept that the Circuit Court is the correct court for the granting of a judicial decree of separation and, moreover, one would always be dealing with property where there was a dispute between the parties.  The most important property to most people is the family home.  It would be undesirable for a court of summary jurisdiction to make a decision of such momentous proportions, that is, the disposition or otherwise of the family home.  That is one of my major objections.  Regardless of the fact that people with property, possessions and higher incomes would go to the Circuit Court to deal with the property, etc. and the District Court would deal with those who could not afford to go to the Circuit Court, the problem still arises of the disposition of the family home.  I do not think a court of summary jurisdiction is the correct court for dealing with that <Col N="1434" /> problem whilst having the greatest sympathy for the views of Deputy Taylor and the motives behind them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague Deputy Taylor and, indeed, Deputy McCartan, for pressing and supporting this amendment.  With due respects to our colleague who has just spoken, it is not a matter of sympathy, it is a matter of class structures, it is a matter of money and it is a matter of professional cornering of the market on a fundamental aspect of human life. Whether we like it or not that is what is at issue.</P>
      <P>I get very angry when women, who come to my public information clinic in Dún Laoghaire, have paid £500 of £600 in cash to a solicitor before they move anywhere, whether to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court.  They pay the money up front and by the time they get into the Circuit Court for a separation they have paid £2,000 into the law firm.  We all know what we are talking about.  We all know the prohibitive cost facing ordinary women and men of middle and low incomes of going ahead with separations. This House is copperfastening the lucrative, professional and legal market of separation and of family disputes right down the line.  That is the fundamental issue involved.</P>
      <P>I am nauseated that people in this House should say that district justices do not like those cases, that they are not trained in such cases and yet the Deputies who have vehemently opposed this proposal by the Labour Party in Committee are the same Deputies who, in the mid-seventies, had no hesitation in saying that these same district justices could deal with fundamental issues of barring orders, custody of children and the day-to-day family income of an individual family in disputation.  That is hypocritical to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall &mdash; and I participated as Chairman &mdash; lengthy meetings of a special committee in the seventies when we put through fundamental legislation in this House.  There was not a whimper from <Col N="1435" /> any political party when we considered the question of custody of children.  Is there anything more fundamental than the custody of a child?  Yet, when it is the family property that is involved, the home, the bricks and mortar of the family, the whole system of separation must be retained for the Circuit Court. Is there anything more hypocritical than that?  Is there anything more hypocritical than a woman who engages a solicitor, or gets some free legal aid from a court clerk and goes before a district justice, even in a kip of a building, without a waiting room or toilet facilities, and says to the judge: &ldquo;I have no income.  I am starving.  I cannot go to a shop to buy a loaf of bread.  I must have a maintenance order&rdquo;, being told, in our magnanimity as legislators and with our professional sympathy, that it will be resolved in the District Court?  That is all human life preserved for this yobbo of a district justice who has no training, who is unsympathetic, who is badly paid and who, of course, does not like to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of barring orders.  I know of nothing more fundamental in human life than that one spouse should seek to have another spouse removed from the dwelling, removed from the family home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the prospect of going back for another year &mdash; is there anything more fundamental than that? Even to be removed from one's family bed, one's family home, one's livingroom, one's kitchen, one's involvement with one's spouse for a mere week I find traumatic.  For a mere month I would find it extraordinary and for two <Col N="1436" /> years I would find it something of monumental importance to my life.  Of course, in our magnanimity we say that solicitors can deal with such family disputatious trivia except separation.  This wonderful word &ldquo;separation&rdquo; and the finality of separation must go up the line.  It is because firms of solicitors and the barristers have cornered the market.  You will not get a separation nowadays in the Circuit Court unless you have £2,000 in your pocket and are willing to put the money up front. We know that the cost of going to court nowadays is horrendous.  I had to face this at the last general election when I had to seek an injunction.  I suddenly discovered the cost involved.  There was the prospect of losing my family home if I had lost the case for an interim injunction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In simple terms the Bill provides that the children who are protected in the District Court and whom we deem, if I may borrow a phrase, to be the children of the petty sessions court, be dealt with at District Court level.  The protected income of the spouse, the fundamental maintenance of the spouse is deemed to be a matter for the small claims court. The barring of spouses is considered to be of minor jurisdiction and we let the district justice handle it but everything else must go up the line.  Deputy Taylor has put forward in simple terms the concept of a district family court.  This is fundamental to the legislation.  Indeed, with due respect to Deputy Shatter and his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, we are now questioning the competence of district court justices.  Frankly, I would prefer to be analysing what is meant by the characteristics of a normal marriage &mdash; because that is now built into the Bill &mdash; or dealing with the question of what are abnormal characteristics since this is also built into this very flawed Bill.  As we all know we should have divorce legislation instead of this kind of legislation which is the classical Irish solution for a fundamental Irish problem.  We now have a problem deciding on the competence of the District Court.  I must take great issue with Deputy Flanagan when he said it was never envisaged to enlarge the <Col N="1437" /> competence of district courts.  It was envisaged and we did so in the mid-seventies when we brought in fundamental legislation on barring, custody and maintenance for familial problems.  Therefore I do not accept the arguments put forward either by the Minister or by the Deputies here today that we have to retain an exceptional competence for the Circuit Court in this area because it will mean one judicial system of adjudication for the rich and another one for the poor. That is why we will vote here today in favour of Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>
    <P>I recall vividly, and it is now ten years ago, when Mrs. Josie Airey brought the claim that her right of access to the courts for a judicial separation was being effectively denied by the State's failure to provide an accessible legal procedure.  In 1979 she screwed it out of the Government and it was conceded before the European Court of Human Rights that the Government would and should introduce legal aid in family law matters.  With the succession of cuts we have eroded that right.  It is pathetic to see our legal aid and advice centres around the country, because women with serious marital problems have to wait two or three months for consultation because of the cutbacks in local services.  Indeed the four centres which were opened in 1984 as a result of provisions for legal aid from the Funds of Suitors are now threatened with closure because the funding is virtually exhausted.  To quote back to the lawyers, justice delayed is fundamentally justice denied.</P>
    <P>Solicitors, I understand, are now entitled to advertise.  Under the new rules, a solicitor can say: &ldquo;here is my card, I will see you in my office but bring £500 with you; we will have a 20 minute consultation and remember that we will have to engage a barrister all the way up to the Circuit Court and that will cost a minimum of £1,000 up front.  This type of case demands hard work; it may go on and on or it may be adjourned and that would require another £1,000.&rdquo;  On average, therefore, it will cost £2,500 before the family can go ahead.  Even in my <Col N="1438" /> constituency, which is the wealthiest constituency in Ireland, I have women coming to me who will not get free legal aid, who have reached the pitch where they have no income, but who must seek a separation.  We are saying to these people: &ldquo;sorry, but the barristers must look after you and it will cost £2,500 to get your separation&rdquo;.  I can give examples by chapter and verse.  The legal profession in this country have a lot to answer for in that regard, but more particularly we have a far greater responsibility to discharge, because we are denying these very women the opportunity of going to the District Court which is removed from the mystique which surrounds the disputes on legal separations.  A great mystique has built up around the procedures for people seeking human redress.  There is a body of case law available to any decent district justice or lawyer and it should not be beyond the bounds to have these matters dealt with expeditiously, competently and reasonably cheap without cheeseparing or without people not being paid their due fees.  Whether it be the medical or legal professions I believe people should be paid fairly for doing their work but I do not believe in paying above the odds for what should not have to happen but which is currently being built up by some situations which we are all only too familiar with.</P>
    <P>I see no justification for this fundamental change in the Bill not being conceded by the House, because this House saw fit already, to allow the District Court to look after children, to look after the basic maintenance of spouses and to deal with the major decision of barring somebody from a house.  If we gave that jurisdiction to the District Court in 1975-76 why in God's name can we not give it the finality of a separation?  I reject the slur that some district justices are not capable of doing this work.  They are perfectly capable of doing it and I do not see any exalted role for Circuit Court judges as they have not special training. Indeed if you want to go down through the same kind of argument, there is eminently good reason that there should be a district family court system and if we <Col N="1439" /> require special training or special accommodation facilities that can be provided in a totally effective way.</P>
    <P>Again, I commend Deputy Taylor on his amendment.  He has thought it through during the past 12 months.  He is a member of the legal profession and he has spoken to many solicitors and barristers about the matter.  I am not a member of the legal profession but I have spoken to many members of it and they agree fundamentally with this amendment. It is not sympathy that the spouses need today, but action.  The Bill without this provision is just a class-ridden money structured pleading which is not worth the paper it is written on as far as hundreds of families are concerned because they have not got the money to go to the Circuit Court.  We cannot see how their plight will be remedied in that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <P>I will be extremely brief. I have made my case against these amendments twice already on Committee Stage.  Nothing that I have heard has changed my mind.  It suits some Deputies to see this set of amendments in class ridden terms.  Unfortunately it is not as simple as that and the solution which has been presented here by Deputy Taylor and the Labour Party is no solution to the problem.  The problem is accessibility, to enable anybody who needs this remedy to avail of it.  This is not the way to go about it.  It would be fundamentally wrong to put this type of case into the District Court.  I will make no further remarks.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond's interest in this matter seems to have diminished on the conclusion of his speech as he has now left the House.  I regret that the Labour Party are now trying to make some false political capital out of this Bill. They are trying to use it as a political football.  They are deliberately misleading people who have been awaiting the enactment of this Bill to afford them real assistance with their family problems, by suggesting to them that when <Col N="1440" /> the Bill is enacted it will not be of help to them.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Deputy Taylor, whose language was a great deal more moderate than Deputy Desmond's, although he is going about it in the wrong way, he has a genuine concern about this.  Deputy Desmond got lost in the middle of his own rhetoric and at the end of the day one was confused, considering the extent of Deputy Desmond's concern and the elaborate illustrative nature of his rhetoric, as to why when he was in Government for four years, he did not do something about these issues.  We had a Labour Attorney General for three and a half years in the last Government Administration and he did not bring forward any legislation which he could have done proposing that the District Court should have jurisdiction to grant separation decrees on the basis of any new legislation, or even on the basis of the old legislation.  Clearly when the former Attorney General was in a position to make a recommendation to the Government that the District Court should have jurisdiction to grant separation decrees, from a position of strength in three and a half years in Government, he did not do so as he was obviously of the view that it was not appropriate that the District Court should have such jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that when Deputy Taylor brought a Bill before this House, which I and some of my colleagues in Fine Gael supported, to bring about a referendum on divorce in March or April 1986, before the Government Bill on this issue was brought forward, Deputy Taylor recommended that if and when divorce decrees were granted they were to be a High Court measure.  There was no suggestion that the District Court would have jurisdiction.  Nobody suggested that Deputy Taylor was proposing divorce for the rich with the intent of depriving the not so well off and those on social welfare benefits of the right to seek a divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a most dishonest political charge to make that this Bill is designed to help the rich and to leave the poor without a <Col N="1441" /> legal remedy.  It is a charge that is politically inspired to seek some false political benefit for the Labour Party.  The reason the Labour Party get so little support from the electorate is that when they engage in this sort of elaborate misleading, most people do not believe them.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill and the Circuit Court's jurisdiction, this Bill when drafted was designed to make separation and family law court proceedings a great deal simpler and less expensive.  The Bill contains provisions which will enable the courts when asked to determine whether a separation decree should be granted and to make all comprehensive court orders necessary to resolve any family controversy between a husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Under the current law multiple sets of court proceedings can be required. Indeed, husbands and wives can sometimes find themselves trooping through two or three different courts to deal with different aspects of their family problems. This Bill was designed to cut out that type of thing.  This Bill by providing a less formal procedure before the Circuit Court and by allowing for simplified forms of documentation, will easily allow any solicitor who has the competence to do so, to represent a husband or wife in family law court proceedings without the assistance of counsel.  Unfortunately, few solicitors currently avail of that right, although there is no reason why that should not happen.</P>
    <P>Couples who do not wish to obtain legal advice for one reason or another can in this less formal court bring their own applications without legal help.  They will be as well able to do that in this Circuit Court structure as they could in any District Court structure.  Those who wish to be legally represented but do not have means are the real issue.  This is an issue which the Labour Party have distorted in the context of this Bill, only since we were successful in resolving the other issues, because it would be less difficult for the Labour Party to acknowledge that this measure would actually help people, not only those who support their party but other parties and people who are not interested in politics at all <Col N="1442" /> but who have family problems.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to resources but that problem applies whether separation or family law proceedings are dealt with in the District Court, the Circuit Court or the High Court.  The report of the Legal Aid Board from which Deputy Taylor quotes, and to which the Minister Deputy Collins correctly referred, points out &mdash; and this is a point to which Deputy Taylor has failed repeatedly to respond because he knows it is a valid point &mdash; not that the Legal Aid Board has called on this legislation to extend to the District Court granting separation decrees but that due to the number of marriages breaking down and to the extent of the demand for services and since this Bill has come before this House, due to the likely increased demand, they need more resources to meet that demand.  There is nowhere in any report from the Legal Aid Board, in any of the years during which they published reports, a statement saying that in their view it would make the law more accessible if the District Court granted decrees of separation.  This was not said by the Legal Aid Board prior to the publication of this Bill or since. Those resources will be required whether family law or marital breakdown cases are being dealt with at District Court or Circuit Court level.  It is a question of resources, of providing proper funding for the Legal Aid Board. That cannot be done by way of a Private Members Bill.</P>
    <P>One of my regrets is that the Labour Party's Attorney General in the last Government did not bring before this House a statutory measure for what is currently a non-statutory civil legal aid system.  If it was a matter of such concern to Deputy Taylor and his colleagues one would have expected that sort of legislation to have been brought forward.  If that were done it might have made it easier for Deputies in the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats' Party and in The Workers' Party, to require Government to produce the necessary resources to ensure that the system works properly.  It is a question of <Col N="1443" /> resources.  The Minister has quite correctly acknowledged that when this Bill becomes law there will be greater demands on the Legal Aid Board and on the law centres.  When I introduced this Bill, during the Second Stage reading I made the point that we would be looking to Government to provide those necessary additional resources so that those couples who wished to avail of the remedies provided for in this Bill and who could not afford legal fees could have the necessary legal assistance.  It is quite politcally misleading and dishonest to suggest that the problem relates to the jurisdiction and to the type of court, but that it does not relate to resources.  The problem relates to resources for the Legal Aid Board.  It is not a question that if the District Court were given jurisdiction there would be no problem in this area but if the Circuit Court are there will be a problem.</P>
    <P>The reason this Bill establishes the Circuit Family Court is that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, which was supported by Deputy Taylor's colleagues &mdash; Deputy Eileen Desmond and Senator Mary Robinson who was then a member of the Labour Party &mdash; recommended that there should be one court which would have a comprehensive family law jurisdiction, which would deal with all aspects of marital breakdown and separations, and, which, desirably, should be a family tribunal. They made the point at page 111 in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, and I quote &ldquo;Until now family cases have been relegated to an inferior position in a legal process totally unsuited to their resolution.  In the future they must be treated as a special area which requires a fundamentally, different approach and structure for their determination.&rdquo; What Deputy Taylor is proposing in this amendment is to forever more keep separation and family law cases relegated to an inferior position in a legal process unsuited to their resolution.</P>
    <P>We could not, in the context of a Private Members' Bill, establish a totally new court such as a family tribunal which <Col N="1444" /> was separate from the existing court structure because one cannot in a Private Members' Bill provide for additional expenditure on the Exchequer.  What we did was to go to the very borders of reforming the Circuit Court to deal with family matters in a way which would radically change the approach which is currently adopted, which would guarantee that judicial separation proceedings would be dealt with by way of a fundamentally different approach and that there would be an appropriate court structure to deal with it.</P>
    <P>By establishing the Circuit Family Court, which will have primary jurisdiction to determine all separation cases across the eight circuits within this country, through the use of the Circuit Court structure we will ensure a degree of uniformity of approach on the part of the Judiciary within that structure.  Because the Circuit Court sits in local areas, to use Deputy McCartan's colourful phrase, a democratic court system &mdash; I assume &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; in this sense meaning an accessible court &mdash; will be accessible to everyone but it will be an accessibility to a limited number of judges who will develop a degree of expertise applying the provisions of this Bill, as many Circuit Court Judges have since 1981 in dealing generally with family law matters, so that there will be a uniform approach, that both the rich and poor will be treated in the same way by our judicial system and that we will not provide one set of courts for the poor and a different set for the rich with different principles being applied by the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that Deputy Taylor, both in the Special Committee and in this House, did not address a number of issues I raised about this amendment which is in identical terms to the amendment he brought forward in the past.  I pointed out that this amendment gives rise to all sorts of problems.  Rather than assisting people who are in difficult financial circumstances to get just treatment with their family problems through our courts this amendment, as tabled, would provide a mechanism whereby &mdash; if one assumes that it is a wife who is normally <Col N="1445" /> dependent &mdash; a recalcitrant husband who wishes to evade his responsibilities could, by seeking a District Court separation decree, seek to obtain a separation decree in a court whose jurisdiction would be so limited as to enable that husband to evade his true financial responsibilities to his wife.  Deputy Taylor has not addressed that issue despite my raising it a couple of weeks ago on Committee Stage.  He has not seen fit to see if he could even amend the provisions he has tabled to get around that problem.</P>
    <P>In applying the barring order provisions in the District Court, I made the point &mdash; and Deputy Desmond seems to be somewhat confused about this &mdash; that if one gets a separation decree because of violence or some other serious misconduct in a matrimonial home, a wife will most times seek to have her husband barred from the home or a husband who is being battered will seek to have his wife barred.  As the Bill is framed currently if a wife seeks a barring order it can be a barring which will remain in force for all time but under Deputy Taylor's amendment a battered wife would have to come to court every 12 months.  That would be some separation decree when a wife would have to come back to court every 12 months to refight the matrimonial battle.  That would be some way for a couple to put a broken marriage behind them and to get away from the antagonism, upset and distress of a broken marriage but to suggest that it is a useful remedy to provide the District Court with a jurisdiction which would require a wife to come back every 12 months is a problem which affects both the rich and the poor.</P>
    <P>A battered wife living in local authority rented accommodation will as much seek a barring order to have her husband permanently barred from the family home as will a more wealthy wife living in a detached house in the middle of Foxrock who is being battered.  Wives do not want to come back to court every 12 months. Deputy Taylor in portraying this amendment as being of help to people in poor circumstances, has not even worked out <Col N="1446" /> provisions to ensure that if the remedies were made available in the District Court they would be adequate to provide protection and allow couples whose marriages had collapsed to put the distress of a broken marriage behind them.  This is a recipe for an ongoing matrimonial annual legal battle between husbands and wives for ever following the grant of a separation decree.</P>
    <P>I fully support what Deputy Taylor says in the context of demanding that adequate resources be provided for the Legal Aid Board to establish solicitors in law centres who will be able to deal with the demand, but in the context of proposing that the District Court has a jurisdiction under this Bill, he is wrong in suggesting that this proposal will resolve the difficulties of lack of resources.  The amendment is so poorly and badly drafted that it could undermine the foundations of the Bill and the protections designed to provide help for both the rich and poor, husbands and wives, and all those who are the casualties of broken marriages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitious in responding to this debate.  I want to thank Deputies who have contributed, some in a constructive manner and others not quite so constructively. Deputy Shatter in particular in his usual fashion has sought to cast a mist over the reality and the nub of the problem which this amendment seeks to address.  This is not unusual for him.  He threw in phrases like &ldquo;false political capital&rdquo;, &ldquo;what the last Government did not do&rdquo; and &ldquo;what the labour Party Attorney General did not do&rdquo; but he did not mention what Peter Sutherland, the Fine Gael Attorney General, did or did not do. Neither he nor the other Deputies who have addressed this amendment have answered the basic problem I posed: what do we say to a woman who needs a judicial separation but who does not have £1,500 for the fees?  Nobody answered that question.  They dealt with the resources, District Court buildings being bad, and some district justices not wanting to hear family law cases.  There is <Col N="1447" /> some degree of merit in all of those points, but it comes back to the same basic question: what do we say to the woman in a clinic who needs a separation but who does not have £1,500?</P>
      <P>It is no good saying that somebody will do &ldquo;trickery&rdquo; in the District Court and that if the jurisdiction is not there, the District Justice will deal with the matter or refer it to the appropriate jurisdiction. I am not talking about these technical points; I am talking about the major access point to the remedies of the Bill. Let us be honest about this.  I am accused of political dishonesty here, but I throw that back in Deputy Shatter's face by asking where is his honesty?  Where does he tell that woman to go?  That is the nub of the matter.  The answers bandied about here were for more funding, more resources and more money for the legal Aid Board.  Of course, it could be or might be the answer, but it is not the answer because there is no more money being given to the Legal Aid Board.  The reality is that less money is being given to the Legal Aid Board and that the needs of that board, when this measure is passed, will substantially increase.  What do we say to the spouse who needs the separation?  Neither the Minister nor anybody else answers that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue summed up the matter when he said that persons of one social class will go to the Circuit Court while persons of a lower social class will go to the District Court.  Deputy O'Donoghue is not present but I say to the House that if we do not accept this amendment people of one social class will go the Circuit Court and those of a lower social class will not go to any court because they will not have access to any court.  Do not tell me that the answer is resources, funding to the Legal Aid Board.  That is just not on and we know it.  If we want to do something to help those people, we must think about what we can do.  There is only one thing I can think of and that is to open up the cheaper and more accessible remedies to the forum of the District Court.  If anybody <Col N="1448" /> else has any other idea for helping them, let them say so.  Nobody has suggested any other way of doing it.  There is no other way of doing it.</P>
    <P>This talk of a Tallaght strategy sickens me now.  If there is one irony about the so-called Tallaght strategy, it is that if there is one town in the whole of Ireland for which the Tallaght strategy is a disaster, it is Tallaght.  People there, many of them tragically, have to deal with broken marriages and do need judicial separation.  If we allow this measure to go through, it is curtains for them.  The Bill will be there, but they will not be able to use it.  I know that the Legal Aid Board did not concern themselves with, or were not advocating the giving of a District Court jurisdiction; that is not their function.  How could they do that? They did draw attention to the fact that they had not the resources to provide the legal aid needed for judicial separations. That was as much as they could do.</P>
    <P>On page 111 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee report to which Deputy Shatter referred us, there are other parts that he did not refer to.  I refer the House to the portion dealing with costs.  The report says:</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the costs of resolving marital disputes through the legal process constitute a major burden on persons obliged to have recourse to the system.  The Committee has been informed that the legal costs involved in taking an average family case through the various steps to a one-day full hearing in either the Circuit or the High Court could be in the region of £1,000 to £2,500. </P>
    <P>I might say, as an aside, that the costs have gone up much since then.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>This level of legal costs is a major disincentive and in many cases effectively prevents people obtaining the remedy they require. </P>
    <P>There is nothing anybody here has said, Deputy Shatter and the Minister included, that gives an answer to that <Col N="1449" /> problem, which is a very real one. Whether the barring order is for one year and renewed for another year or whether one has to come for the order or not, at least one can get into a court and have one's remedy.</P>
    <P>Again at paragraph 9.1.9 it is stated:</P>
    <P>No matter how much legal costs are reduced people will still exist who cannot afford to pay from their own resources for legal help.  Access to justice must be available to all irrespective of their means </P>
    <P>In regard to the Government Law Centres system, it stated:</P>
    <P>The experience of its operation since its establishment suggests that the present structure is grossly inadequate, in that it certainly does not assure equality of treatment for all. </P>
    <P>There is one nub point contained there, that the costs by reason of this Bill, notwithstanding the simplifications, are not going to go down.  Some member made the point to the committee that the people there will not be wearing wigs and gowns.  Perhaps not, but they will not reduce their fees on that account.</P>
    <P>There is an intense legal lobby going on in connection with this amendment. Those lawyers who make a great deal of money out of this kind of measure do not want a District Court jurisdiction because it will affect their pockets and because the fees they get will be very considerably less.  That is why many do not want the amendment; it is not for any genuine reason they do not want it.  The Labour Party have a genuine reason here.  We applaud Deputy Shatter for providing the remedies but the remedies are not good unless accessibility to them is opened up to the people who need to avail of them. There is no other way of doing it and that is the reality.  I invited the Minister to say that he will sort out the position of the Legal Aid Board and give them funds.  If <Col N="1450" /> he had said that, that would be fine, but he gave no indication of that.  We know that he will not do it.  I invite the House to do the one remaining thing that it can do, to open up District Court jurisdiction that ordinary people can go to in the same way as they do now, with the District Court clerks helping them out at no cost at all.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are some district justices who do not like doing family law. What a ridiculous point to make.  Of course, there are Circuit Court judges and also High Court judges who do not like doing family law cases.  So what? There are plenty of solicitors who do not like practicising in family law courts and some do not practice there, but those who do practice there do very well.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Tallaght strategy is a disaster for the people of Tallaght and the sooner we and the people recognise that fact, the better.  What are we doing here now?  We are having one jurisdiction. An extremely wealthy family in Deputy Shatter's or Deputy Desmond's constituency, with assets of £150,000 to £300,000, cars and bank accounts and all the rest, who need a separation will go to the Circuit Court with no problem at all. They could go to the High Court or the Supreme Court, or anywhere they liked because they could afford to do that. They can afford the fancy fees of the fancy lawyers who practice there.  Those who live in Tallaght, venue of the so-called Tallaght strategy, who live in a corporation or county council house and who have no money at all, who could not even afford the £15 subscription to the Legal Aid Board, if they could get the board to take their case, will get no good out of this Bill unless we open up its remedies to them.  That is why the Labour Party brought forward this amendment and that is why I am asking for it to be put to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On Fifth Stage, I would like to make a very brief contribution. This is an historic occasion in that this is the first time in over 30 years that a Private Members' Bill has passed through our legislative process and the first time since the foundation of the State that we have passed legislation to provide a modern legal framework for separation laws.  I hope this sets a precedent in so far as the passing of Private Members' Bills in the future is concerned.  It should not be an unusual occasion in a parliamentary democracy for a Member of Parliament outside of the Government to steer legislation through the Oireachtas. I hope we have all learned some lessons from the passage of this Bill and that we have learned that the Opposition benches can on occasion bring forward constructive legislative measures which can be of help in resolving problems being faced within our country.  I hope Governments of all political persuasions, be it this Government or future Governments, will accept that measures of a legislative nature can be brought forward and agreed to with Opposition parties without there being any loss of face on the side of the Government and can result in praise for the Government for co-operating with the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has had a somewhat stormy passage.  At the outset there was a great deal of co-operation.  Then we went through a difficult period but to use the language of marital difficulties we &ldquo;reconciled our problems&rdquo;.  I hope this measure will be of great help and assistance to the many hundreds, possibly thousands, <Col N="1454" /> of couples whose marriages have collapsed. This Bill will provide a modern, humane framework of legislation.  It recognises the role that wives play in the home and provides for the obtaining of a separation decree without exacerbating animosity between the spouses.  It provides additional protection for the welfare of children, for a modernised and simplified court structure and the establishment of a circuit family court.</P>
    <P>We have taken a great step forward in the area of social legislation.  I would like to thank the Members of the House on the Opposition benches for their support and assistance without which this Bill could not become law.  I would also like to thank the Government for their support and help in resolving the difficulties which emerged between the Opposition parties and Fianna Fáil in respect of this measure, and for agreeing to the taking of the Bill in Government time today in order that we could complete its passage.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through the Seanad and rapidly become law.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, that the Bill as it now stands speaks for itself.  He is satisfied that it will give the best possible protection and financial security to spouses and dependent children.  The background to the differences concerning the original Bill are now well known.  When the Bill was before the full House on earlier Stages it must indeed have appeared that the differences were so great as not to be capable of resolution.  We have come a long way since then.  The changes which were subsequently put before the Special Committee on recommittal where on an agreed basis and covered every point of difference.  The efforts of Deputy Shatter and others in working out an agreement with the Minister are to be commended. We now confidently look forward to the early enactment of a worthwhile Bill which will add greatly to the reform of the family law area.</P>

Nonetheless, it marks a great improvement in family law and will be a valuable addition to the remedies for families whose marriages have broken down.</P>
      <P>I agree that the facilities for Private Members' Bills in this House should be expanded.  This was discussed in a Dáil committee some years back and thought was given to the question of having the House sit on Fridays to take Private Members' Bills.  Perhaps the Taoiseach and the Government would look again at Bills of a non-controversial nature which could be of immense benefit to the people.</P>

      <P>Both the Minister and I are in regular contact with the Irish Tourist Industry <Col N="1456" /> Confederation who have expressed the view that the tourism targets set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are realistic and achievable.  Furthermore, the chairman of the confederation has consistently maintained that the sector is on course for achievement of these targets.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Official Report of 16 December 1988, columns 2137 and 2138, volume 385, for the Minister's comments to the House on this same subject on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The ITIC, as the Minister of State knows, represent all sectors of the industry and in November last were claiming that the tourism targets which had been set by this Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> were not being achieved.  They accepted that the targets had been established and they were very challenging targets, but in November they stated that the 1988 targets would not be achieved.  Could the Minister of State give us some statistical information here today to convince us that the targets set out in that programme are being achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address in particular the point raised in Deputy O'Malley's question and letters, correspondence and so forth from the chairman of ITIC.  As reported at column 2138, volume 385 of the Official Report, which I mentioned in my reply, the Minister referred to the address of 5 December 1988 in which the chairman indicated that everyone in the industry believed these objectives could be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has been making the point he made previously, that the chairman in correspondence to him is saying something other than that.  My information is that in a letter to my colleague, the Minister, dated 22 February 1988, the chairman obviously claims that he made no mention in his letter in November to Deputy O'Malley of any concern about growth rates not being achieved.  He insists that his letter to the Deputy outlines ITIC's views on the need for investment in the product, additional funds for <Col N="1457" /> tourism promotion and aspects of the physical environment that need to be addressed.  He states further in his recent letter, which I have here, that he has consistently maintained that we are on target, and at any public engagements and private meetings which he attended, including meetings with Opposition TDs, he has indicated and I quote: &ldquo;we are satisfied with the targets and we are on course in 1988.&rdquo;  That should help the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In the interests of saving time the best thing for me to do would be allow the Minister to have a copy of the November letter in which the ITIC stated that the target set out in the programme would not be achieved.  Is the Minister consulting with the ITIC in terms of addressing the need they have expressed for combining the resources of the Government, Bord Fáilte and other State agencies and private enterprise in order to bring forward a strategic plan that will address the whole issue of attaining targets?  The ITIC claim that plan is still required and has not been forwarded to them or worked out with them by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the method used in calculating the tourist statistics as used by his Department and Bord Fáilte; the agency or agencies involved in the compilation of the figures; the manner in which a particular visitor to the country is classified as a tourist or otherwise; and if he has satisfied himself with the accuracy of the tourist figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office are the agency responsible for the compilation and publication of statistics on tourism and travel.  I understand that these statistics, in so far as they relate to overseas visitor numbers to Ireland, are arrived at by means of two all-year round surveys &mdash; country of residence survey and passenger card inquiry survey &mdash; conducted by the CSO at major airports and sea ports.  The results of these two surveys are subsequently subjected to minor adjustments by Bord Fáilte to take account of overseas visitors who come to this country via Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In classifying visitors as tourists Bord Fáilte use the internationally accepted World Tourism Organisation definition of a tourist, that is visitors staying for any reason at least 24 hours, but not more than one year, in the country visited.</P>
      <P>As by far the major element of total tourist traffic and revenue is generated on air and sea routes into Ireland, the CSO and Bord Fáilte are satisfied that their survey methods and resultant statistics provide an accurate measure of overseas tourist numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of market research, Bord Fáilte supplement CSO statistics with their own sophisticated survey on the performance of detailed segments of the market to which promotional activities are directed.  While this survey is undertaken in conjunction with the air <Col N="1459" /> and sea carriers and contains much sensitive commercial information, increasing use is made of more computer-based analyses in examining the effectiveness of marketing strategies.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this year's budget of £0.25 million being made available to enable Bord Fáilte to develop a data base on tourists coming to Ireland, including details of all types of holiday taken.  The intention is to boost tourist numbers by increasing the number of return visits.  Tourism businesses will be able to use this data base to target their marketing thus making their promotion effort more effective.</P>
    <P>The board are also currently developing a major, new, computerised tourist information and reservation system which will provide further data for market analyses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that tourism statistics are now becoming a joke since, as a result of emigration, many visits are made by people coming to see friends or attend funerals?  Following an exposé in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> it is estimated that the number of tourists from Britain last year was 112,000, while the statistical information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that 1.5 million people came here on holiday last year.  Does the Minister not agree that it is necessary to have better statistics in order to judge the performance of Bord Fáilte?  We have the necessary technology and we must be able to assess Bord Failte's success in attracting pure tourists rather than visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there continues to be questioning as to the numbers coming in through the ports.  People are asking what constitutes a tourist or a visitor and are trying to draw a distinction between them.  Very often figures are used to say that our predictions are not being achieved because people are coming for reasons other than tourism. Is it not wonderful that people can come in such numbers because of the access transport which is available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies opposite are prepared to define a tourist. The World Tourism Organisation's definition of a tourist, which is used by Bord Fáilte, is mentioned in the reply.  In compiling the number of overseas visitors, the CSO ask respondents to indicate the main purpose of their visit, i.e., business, tourism, VFR or other reasons. These are the categories on the passenger inquiry card.  In 1987 CSO figures for overseas visitors for all markets were 2.037 million, under the following headings: business, 17 per cent; tourism, 35 per cent; VFR, 41 per cent; others, 7 per cent.  The Department and Bord Fáilte have been in consultation with the CSO, particularly during the past 18 months, regarding all statistics relating to tourism numbers, revenue and employees.  Bord Fáilte are satisfied with the accuracy of the overall figure for visitor numbers. However, they are worried about the market breakdown of this figure and feel that estimates for continental Europe, for example, are probably too low.  The question in the CSO survey should relate to holidaymakers, not tourists.  This is particularly the case in relation to the UK market.  Most respondents give visiting friends or relatives, rather than tourism, as their primary purpose in travelling.  In reality many of them have come here to holiday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the 1.5 million so-called tourists who came here from Britain last year it is now accepted by all involved in tourism that only 120,000 were tourists in the true meaning, using tourist facilities and hotels?  Would be accept that the claim of a boom in tourism has been shown <Col N="1461" /> to be a total sham and, indeed, slightly fraudulent?  Would he withdraw that type of figure in order to establish a proper concept and plan properly for tourism? Regarding the definition of a tourist, would the Minister claim that a young emigrant from an area near Knock airport, coming back five times in a year for overnight stays to help his parish win a championship competition, should be classified as five tourists in the statistics?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1463" /> for Tourism and Transport the alternative arrangements he is making for effective forecasting for the Celtic Sea in the event of the downgrading of Roche's Point weather station, County Cork, as proposed in the Meteorological Service review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's efforts to reduce public expenditure, a general review of the Meteorological Service was carried out by senior officers of the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Finance to identify, <i>inter alia,</i> the scope for reducing costs and increasing revenues.  Representatives of the Meteorological Service participated in the review.  Arising from the review, which was wide ranging and took full account of the needs of the service in the modern environment, the review group made comprehensive recommendations for maintaining the general level and standard of the Meteorological Service operations, but at substantially reduced costs.  The recommendations focused on the scope for improved structures, greater use of automation and general rationalisation with a view to achieving a more efficient and cost effective service.</P>
      <P>As part of this rationalisation process the group recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> the closure of the weather observation station at Roche's Point in County Coark. This station has no formal role in the dissemination of meteorological information. Furthermore, it is planned to install an automatic observing system at Roche's Point.  Accordingly routine climatological information will continue to be available to those who require it.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there will be no diminution in the quality of forecasts for the Celtic Sea as a result of the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>The five staff members at Roche's Point will be redeployed elsewhere in the Meteorological Service to fill existing vacancies.  The once-off cost of the staff move will be about £30,000.</P>

      <P>I am most disappointed at the Minister's reply.  I do not accept that there will be technological advantages because, basically, he will be making a saving.  As somebody with some knowledge of the harbour area I can say it will not be an advantage.  The Minister must be aware that all the European meteorological services are reverting to manual operations if for no other reason than that they comprise part of the world meteorological organisations.  That arrangement is reciprocal.  Indeed, we saw what happened yesterday when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come to that in a moment, a Cheann Comhairle.  I do not normally cause you any problems in the House.  I want to make the point that, in the case of the disaster yesterday, that sort of automated station would have been of damn little use in providing day-to-day forecasts for people at sea.

Can the accurate forecasting that has prevailed during the lifetime of that station be maintained if it is now to be closed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of Connaught Airport Development Company Limited, the Ministers for Finance and for Tourism and Transport have the right to nominate a total of three directors to the board of the company.  It would not be appropriate to speculate on any changes in their nominees to the board of the airport company which the Ministers might decide to make in the future, in the exercise of their rights in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also confirm that the establishment of a trust in favour of the people of the west, and of County Mayo in particular, for the ownership and control of the airport is at an advanced stage.  It is <Col N="1468" /> expected that the trust will be in place in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that ownership of Horan International Airport, with more than £10 million Government money, is now vested in the directors who each have a £1 share in the airport?  Irrespective of the merits of the board of directors would the Minister not agree that it is a shame that the trust has not already been put in place?  Can he give the House an explanation for the delay occasioned over the past three or four years in implementing the terms of the deed of trust originally drawn up, supported by the late Monsignor Horan and the former and present Archbishops? Can he explain why the terms of the trust are not operational other than in the fact that it would appear to be the wish of the Government to maintain the airport within the control of the present board of directors?</P>

      <P>This Government will continue to assist in ensuring its continued success.  As the Deputy is probably aware, a deed of trust has been agreed in principle with the company whose purpose will be to ensure that the airport is developed for the benefit of the west and of County Mayo in particular.  Counsel appointed by the Attorney General's office have raised a number of technical queries on the draft deed of trust which are being considered by the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are acutely aware of the strategic importance for the Irish economy of fast reliable and competitive freight links with continental Europe.  The cost disadvantages for the national economy and Irish industry of <Col N="1471" /> Ireland's peripheral location are set to become even more acute with the completion of the Internal Market in 1992. The Government regard this as a major priority area requiring attention in the context of 1992.</P>
      <P>The Government are at present engaged in the preparation of a regional development plan for Ireland for the period 1989-1993 which will be implemented in conjunction with EC Structural Funds.  The main thrust of the proposals and measures which will be brought forward in the transport sector will be aimed at relieving and eliminating the disadvantages of Ireland's peripherality <i>vis-à-vis</i> our EC partners.

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the plans his Department have for the establishment of a permanent ferry service on the Cork-Swansea route, having regard to the necessity of such a service for the proper growth and development of the tourism industry in this region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should in the first instance make it clear that it is not a function of my Department to provide ferry services between Ireland and other countries. That is a matter which is entirely for the commercial discretion of ferry operators. Within the constraints of that policy and also of the EC competition rules the Government, on an exceptional basis and because of the value of the Cork-Swansea service to the tourism industry of the <Col N="1473" /> south-west region, indicated their willingness to make available to that service from the Exchequer a grant of £500,000, together with a loan of up to £500,000 to be repaid in September 1989.  I do not accept that there was any delay in the announcement of Exchequer assistance.</P>
    <P>In view of the value of the Swansea-Cork service to tourism interests in the south-west region, I, like other Members, was most disappointed at the announcement earlier this week that Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited are unable to operate a service this year because of their inability to secure a vessel.  I am most anxious that all possible options for the operation of a service this year would continue to be explored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have scuttled the Cork-Swansea ferry service principally by dragging out the financial negotiations until mid-January at which late stage it was impossible to get a ship and, secondly, by offering short term loan facilities rather than grant aid. Will the Minister of State say what realistic steps are being taken by the Government to provide an alternative ferry service this year to serve the Cork-Kerry region and replace a ferry which last year carried 32,000 cars and 125,000 foot passengers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to the questions raised by the Deputy.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the practical contribution made by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe, Bat O'Keeffe, Ned O'Keeffe, Paddy Sheehan and one or two others.  They gave practical assistance when it was needed.  It is tragic that the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company are now in the position in which they find themselves.  The company have been negotiating for a larger ship since last autumn.  Those of us who attended the press conference given by the company on Monday last heard that the funding arrangements and their timing did not have a bearing on the company being unable to provide any ship to run a service this year.  That debate was carried on by the company in the knowledge that their <Col N="1474" /> two-year lease and contract were due to expire at the end of 1988.  Earlier in the year a £5 million grant was given and the local people raised money, acknowledging the importance of this ferry link. The Government responded positively with a further loan of £500,000 to be repaid in September.  All options will be explored in an effort to provide a service so necessary to the tourism industry here this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. He paid tribute to the Deputies in the House who assisted in the provision of the failed ferry service.  Let me now be of some assistance to him in the hope that we might put in the place of the failed service some kind of alternative service for the summer.  Is it the Minister's intention now to reroute the moneys that were promised by way of interest free loan to another operator who might be prepared to put a vessel on that route for the summer?  There would be time to work out some kind of strategy to put on a permanent service for the years ahead. This would enable people who are interested in promoting tourism to develop and market their region abroad rather than having the kind of convulsions we have every September because we do not know whether we are going to have a ship and therefore cannot market our region properly.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's remarks in regard to my own political and personal contribution towards the re-establishment of this ferry and the effort to keep it going, but I will not be diverted by kind words.  Does the Minister not agree that if the financial package ultimately agreed in mid-January had been made available in October or November the ferry could have had an opportunity to negotiate for an alternative ship with far greater prospect of success?  Does the Minister not accept that the loss of the ferry service involves damage to the economy of the order of £15 million to £20 million?  Will the Minister now tell us what steps he is taking to secure an alternative service this year rather than giving us the waffle about being prepared to listen to any suggestions that might now come forward?  I want to know how the Government will discharge their responsibility to my area this year.</P>

      <P>The Government and I have no difficulty about our responsibilities. I indicated what our responsibilities are.  There is no indication whatever that the company were restricted in any way from last July in their negotiations for the provision of a boat for 1989 and the years ahead.</P>

Is it not a pity that people who are asking such questions do not check out the facts in case they would do any further damage to the service?  I want to state categorically that the structure of the funding provided by the Government to this company and the timing of it did not inhibit the company in any way in their negotiations for the acquisition of a larger vessel in 1989.</P>

      <P>I wish to refute the allegation made by my namesake, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  If the management plan for 1989 had been submitted by the ferry company when the Cork and Kerry Deputies and Senators from Fianna Fáil met the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on the issue of the provision of £1 million in funding they might have been in a better position. Let me ask the Minister if it was his information that the company were negotiating for a much larger ship, thereby trying to increase the freight content of that ferry, and that it was the Government's information that such a ship was available until quite late in the day when, surprisingly, we were informed that they then had changed strategy and were looking for the return of the <i>Celtic Pride</i> on that crossing.  Finally, is the Minister aware that the city manager in Cork and members of the ferry company are quite emphatic that any delay there was in providing funding had absolutely no detrimental effect on the overall negotiations for re-lease of a ferry from Cork-Swansea in 1989?</P>

It is <Col N="1477" /> only fair to say that the company have been working in an under-capitalised way from the beginning.  When we were providing funding we asked them to submit to the Department the financial structure of the company for 1989 and that they did.  I initiated a meeting around 11 January to confirm the financial structure of the company and I announced the granting of the loan around 20 January.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the steps which have been taken to ensure that Boeing aircraft operated by Aer Lingus are completely safe, in light of the number of recent accidents involving Boeing aircraft and the discovery of a number of faults in such planes; if any faults have been discovered in Boeing planes being operated by Aer Lingus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>All Irish registered aircraft are operated in accordance with airworthiness and operations standards prescribed by my Department.  Our requirements are fully in line with international standards as set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In adopting the general airworthiness standards set by ICAO, we follow to a large extent the requirements set both by the American Federal Aviation Agency and the British Civil Aviation Authority.  The requirements are enforced by my Department's aeronautical airworthiness division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent accidents a number of airworthiness instructions and directives were issued to operators of Boeing aircraft by both the FAA and <Col N="1480" /> the CAA.  My Department have adopted these directives and instructions and have ensured that, where relevant, they have been complied with by Aer Lingus.  To date no faults in relation to the recent directives and instructions have been found on Aer Lingus aircraft.</P>
    <P>I should mention, of course, that though Aer Lingus operate Boeing 737 aircraft, they do not operate the Boeing 737-400 type which was involved in the British Midlands crash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply I would like to ask if in such circumstances safety officers from his Department take part in the surveys or in the checking of the planes.  If not, to what extent is he kept informed by Aer Lingus in this case or by whatever airline is concerned as to what is actually taking place on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The monitoring and regulation of Irish air worthiness standards and practices is carried out by the aeronautical air worthiness division in the Air Navigation Service Office, known as ANSO.  The detailed technical requirements to ensure the air worthiness of all Irish registered aircraft are generally based on the standards and systems promulgated by the US Federal Aviation Agency and the UK Civil Aviation Authority and recommendations made by the aircraft manufacturers.  It must be emphasised, of course, that there is a continuous review and monitoring process by aircraft operators and manufacturers and other regulatory authorities in relation to air worthiness.  Where the latter process results in revisions or upgradings in relation to air worthiness standards or practices, they are implemented by the aeronautical air worthiness division, as far as Irish-registered aircraft are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he and the Department are kept informed of the various findings of air companies and other international authorities throughout the world in regard to these kinds of checks and also <Col N="1481" /> if he is being kept informed of the investigations that are taking place into the East Midlands crash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the direct answer to that question.  Maybe it is a separate question.  Even though the question relates to the safety of Boeing aircraft, all Irish carriers operate and maintain their aircraft to the highest standards. They are continuously monitored in this regard by inspectors of my Department. On the question of whether we are kept informed, I have not got that information but I presume that such very relevant information would be made available to us by people investigating the likes of those air crashes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any discussions taken place between the Department of Tourism and Transport and other countries whose planes overfly this country to ensure that, although they are not landing here, the safety checks that we require are equally as stringently observed by those countries?  When one recalls the Lockerbie crash, had that plane taken off half an hour earlier it could have been over Ireland when it crashed.  Will the Minister assure us that steps will be taken to ensure that planes overflying this country are totally safe, if that is possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <P>In view of the target <Col N="1482" /> figures, about which we had some questions earlier, would the Minister not agree that if the target for tourists is to be almost doubled by 1992 some grants will have to be given to hotel and guest-house accommodation to ensure that proper standards will be available for the huge tourist increase which the Minister has predicted will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should indicate that the last refurbishment grants for this sector of £1.9 million, under the hotel and guest-house reconstruction and development grant scheme, was introduced in 1986, for one year only, by the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as part of an overall Government package of measures to boost employment in the construction industry.  Only £100,000 was provided for the scheme in the Coalition Government's published Book of Estimates for 1987 to cover carry-over grant payments arising in 1987 in respect of commitments entered into by Bord Fáilte in 1986.  This position was maintained in the incoming Government's Estimates following the general election of February 1987.  The current Government policy has been to concentrate the small amount of funds available to tourism development, £500,000 in this year's Estimates under subhead B2, into amenity projects which have the power to attract tourists and thus increase tourist traffic to Ireland. However, there are a range of reliefs other than grants for investment in hotels and guesthouses.  I will list a few of them &mdash; the business expansion scheme, the Industrial Credit Corporation administer the global loans schemes &mdash; if the Deputy wants the details I will give them &mdash; the National Development Corporation are empowered to take equity in tourism projects, subject to specific conditions capital allowances are available and hotels are included in the definition of &ldquo;industrial buildings&rdquo; in the Tax Act, all in an endeavour to encourage investment in <Col N="1483" /> refurbishment and development of the hotel sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport whether it is his policy to encourage the development of local tourism co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are anxious to see local tourism and other interests participating in the development of tourism at local level and the regional tourism organisations, who are responsible for development at this level, actively encourage such participation.  It is vital, however, where local tourism groups or co-operatives are formed, that such bodies work closely with their regional tourism organisation, with Bord Fáilte, and SFADCo where it applies, to ensure that their strategies do not run counter to national and regional tourism policy.  Such co-operation and co-ordination of effort is essential to ensure that Irish tourism, both at local and national level, benefits fully from the activities of all tourism development groups and organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is an impression abroad that such co-operatives are resented by officialdom in Bord Fáilte and in some of the regional tourism bodies?  Does he accept that such tourism co-operatives have enormous possibilities to work hand in hand with official bodies to tap the tourism potential in their own areas?  Finally, would the Minister make sure that the approach as enunciated by him here in this House is pursued actively and <Col N="1484" /> enthusiastically by official bodies at all levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, and I am glad he agrees with me.  It is good to get that co-operation here because the co-operation and co-ordination of local bodies and of the co-operative organisations and tourism groups is very welcome.  The development of co-operatives in an unco-ordinated and disorganised fashion would be counter-productive to the overall effort and could lead to fragmentation of tourism facilities and services as well as some unnecessary duplication.  While I welcome the involvement of local groups and co-operatives, whose operations should be closely linked with the RTOs and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that we are totally <i>ad idem</i>&mdash; on the surface we are &mdash; but the Minister knows well to what I am referring.  Does he not accept that local tourism co-operatives spring up from a community spirit?  Furthermore does he accept that such bodies should not be totally controlled by officialdom but should be actively encouraged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is a tremendous amount of agreement here.  I do not want to give the impression that any co-operative or local group would be controlled by the RTO or Bord Fáilte, as the Deputy seems to suggest, but any of these groups would work, co-ordinate and co-operate with the RTOs and Bord Fáilte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I should perhaps explain that the question of the exchange of traffic rights between two countries is a matter for negotiation between representatives of the aeronautical authorities of those countries.</P>
      <P>In this context, talks took place in Washington on 24 October 1988 between representatives of my Department and representatives of the US Administration on the question of securing rights for Irish airlines to provide services to the west coast of America.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a similar question on 16 November 1988, the talks were not concluded at the Washington meeting and will be resumed in Dublin within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would indicate to the House what the American authorities are seeking in return for granting these landing rights on the west coast to Aer Lingus, and of one of the demands that will be made of Aer Lingus or, indeed, of the Government, will be that the transatlantic flights will get reciprocal rights in Ireland and that they will not have to come through Shannon Airport?  If that is one of the demands, what would the Minister's and the Government's attitude be to implementing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that in the discussions I have already adverted to, the Irish side passed very strongly for the rights to additional points in the US, in particular, Los Angeles.  The main arguments advanced by the Irish side in support of their case were, firstly, the general imbalance in the existing bilateral agreement with the US carriers enjoying very generous rights, including freedom rights at Shannon, while Irish carriers are restricted to three points in the US; secondly the need to develop new markets out of the US including the south and west and, thirdly, the fact that under the bilateral agreement US carriers have the right to operate such markets as Delta <Col N="1486" /> operating from Atlanta, while Irish carriers have no such rights.  Other comparable European countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, all enjoy more generous rights than those accorded to Ireland.  The Government's target of doubling tourism numbers over the next five years is a very relevant factor in the case being made by our Irish representatives.  During the discussions I am reliably informed &mdash; to put it in the usual way &mdash; that the US side made it clear that it would be very difficult for them to give a positive response to the Irish request for additional points in the US for two main reasons: first, the current lack of interest of US carriers in seeking additional rights in Ireland and, second, the difficulty in getting policy decisions at a time of political transition.  That was when the talks were taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister meant to indicate.  In fact I feel I may as well not have asked the supplementary question because I do not think the Minister addressed the issue of Shannon Airport.  He referred to the fact that if Aer Lingus secured landing rights from the west coast of America, this would greatly enhance tourism opportunities for this country in that it would give people on the west coast of the United States a direct link into Ireland, which would be an attraction for them. It would also open up the possibility of increasing visitor numbers from other countries, like Japan and Australia, as they would be able to link up with a service operating out of Los Angeles. In view of the importance of securing landing rights on the west coast of America, I ask the Minister if it is a condition on the American side that they over-fly Shannon Airport?  Would the Government concede that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned, negotiations are not complete and the next meeting will be held in Dublin.  I have no indication in the information I have before me of a request from the United States to over-fly Shannon Airport &mdash; the <Col N="1487" /> question the Deputy asked &mdash; but I must make the point that the negotiations and discussions have not been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this type of issue will be solved only through political pressure and by political muscle.  In view of the fact that members of the Cabinet will be in the United States over the Saint Patrick's Day period, would the Minister ensure that some of the Ministers raise this issue at the highest level in Washington, because that is the quickest way to get a satisfactory solution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

Will the Minister assure the House that the safety precautions at our airports include the capacity to detect explosives in luggage or on the person of someone seeking to board or disembark from a plane at an Irish airport?  Will the Minister indicate also that there is a procedure for accounting for baggage at Irish airports and ensuring that persons who place baggage for loading actually go on the aircraft as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In rather adverse weather conditions, I am pleased to rejoin the Minister in the debate on a further turf cutting operation in the midlands.  In my contribution last evening I dealt with the relevance of Bord na Móna and their ancillary operations to the economy of the midland region and particularly to Counties Laois and Offaly.  In my view the success of the operations and the employment generated as a result has to some extent militated against the establishment of alternative job creation enterprises in the region.  May I again say that this has badly hit Counties Laois and Offaly?  I now regard it as a weakness in regional planning that the decline in the base industry, in this case Bord na Móna, with a corresponding reduction in jobs&mdash; and let me say, a Cheann Comhairle, that this was predictable &mdash; took place against a background where no provision was made for alternative forms of employment. This has been a weakness in the overall system of administration down through the years.  It should have <Col N="1502" /> been possible to predict with a considerable degree of accuracy that the peat reserves in the midland region, in particular, would inevitably have to be phased out and that there would be a corresponding reduction in the number of people employed in the area.</P>
      <P>We have almost reached a crisis here and we have seen approximately 1,200 people being made redundant.  We are not in a position to bring on stream within any reasonable time alternative projects to absorb that level of unemployment.  If this had been done it would have eliminated the need for such a high level of redundancy in Bord na Móna and would have minimised the economic and social cost to the region, a cost which, I indicated my earlier contribution, is cushioned by redundancy payments.  In the long term in the absence of alternative enterprises this will have devastating effects on the economic and social fabric of the midland region.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the real value of organised redundancies in areas of productive employment.  Both Bord na Móna and forestry work give productive employment.  Forestry is an area where productive jobs should be created.  I have no doubt that the long-term development of forestry has now been seriously affected by an inadequate maintenance programme.  I am saying that in the presence of the new Minister for Energy, a man with considerable practical experience coming as he does, from an agricultural background and being in a position to identify productive employment as opposed to non-productive employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious imbalance between administration and the provision of forestry services on the ground.  I am not critical of the foresters who have made an excellent contribution to the development of forestry.  We need their guidance, their training and their qualifications.  It does not make any sense, however, to have a total imbalance between the numbers involved in administration and those employed as forestry workers.  From my local knowledge and experience in County Laois, I know that <Col N="1503" /> the number of people employed in forestry has been reduced to a minimum but that there has not been a reduction in the levels employed in administration.  We must increase the level of employment in forestry maintenance.  That does not necessarily mean a reduction in the level of administration.  We must increase the numbers employed in forestry to make sure that our investment is protected and we must maintain a reasonable balance between administrative and practical work.</P>
    <P>My remarks should not be interpreted as a reflection on the ability, qualifications and dedication of our foresters, but they would be the first to admit that with the limited manual staff available it is not possible to carry out an adequate maintenance programme.  It is false economy to spend money expanding the planting programme if we cannot have an adequate maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>I am referring to forestry in the context of this Bill.  I am not moving from the terms of the Bill, because part and parcel of the Bill is to make provision for certain additional inputs of forestry into the utilisation of cutaway bogs.  I consider that I am totally in order in referring to the development of forestry for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the economic and social cost as far as County Laois is concerned has been minimised by the success of the Coolnamona peat factory at Portlaoise.  I am pleased that the expansion of its marketing operations to France have safeguarded employment in that factory and bog with the possibility for further employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since his appointment as Minister, Deputy Smith has displayed a considerable interest in the development of Bord na Móna, particularly in my native county.  I am satisfied that the Minister will do everything possible to increase the employment potential of that industry. There is no doubt that it is in an area <Col N="1504" /> where additional employment is badly needed and where the number of workers in other forms of industry has been declining over the years.  I welcome the recent announcement of a £3 million industry for the town of Portlaoise.  I recognise that it is part of a realisation, perhaps late in the day, but nonetheless extremely welcome, that Laois and the midland region have been more disadvantaged than some counties west of the Shannon which have enjoyed the benefit of special development aid over the years.</P>
    <P>From my discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am satisfied that these facts are now recognised and that other towns in County Laois like Portarlington and Mountmellick will be considered.  Portarlington is of particular relevance to this Bill.  Portarlington, and the now closed ESB generating station, is one of the victims of declining Bord na Móna operations in that area.  There is a need to provide alternative employment by way of a substitute industry in Portarlington. Mountmellick is one of the unemployment black spots in County Laois.  Mountmellick is relevant in this debate because of the close proximity of that town to the vast bog area of Clonsast and the large number of people from the area who will lose their employment as a result of the phasing out of the Bord na Móna operation.  Will the Minister convey to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there is an urgent need to provide some kind of industry in the area of Mountmellick? Other small towns, such as Rathdowney, Abbeyleix, Durrow, Clonaslee and Stradbally are suffering as an indirect result of the phasing out of the Bord na Móna operations.  In the overall context of County Laois, the Government have a duty to try to come up with a positive industrial development programme.  I am satisfied that a worthwhile start has been made and I should like to express my sincere gratitude to the Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, in particular, the Minister for Finance, who initiated the programme in relation to <Col N="1505" /> the provision of industrial employment in Portlaoise, the capital of the county.</P>
    <P>One effective way of giving recognition to the problems of rural Ireland and rural counties, such as Laois, is to locate the headquarters of some regional bodies in those areas.  As a Deputy from the Laois-Offaly constituency, naturally I would encourage the Minister to look at County Laois, and particularly Portlaoise, as suitable headquarters for the new Coillte Teoranta.  Indeed, the headquarters of Teagasc should also be located in some town in rural Ireland.  While the employment content of both headquarters might not be significant, the psychological impact of recognising the problems of rural Ireland and locating these headquarters in rural towns would be considerable. I appeal to the Minister to encourage that kind of decentralisation to whatever extent he can.  So far as industries which are associated with rural communities are concerned, he should move positively in that direction by encouraging the relocation and decentralisation of the headquarters of these organisations.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the utilisation of cutaway bogs, I want to impress upon the Minister the urgency of developing an overall strategy for the entire resource, not only the existing available land but also the additional land which will come onstream over the next ten years, and in so doing to strike a reasonable balance between forestry development and other suitable projects which perhaps would give a quicker and shorter term return. In this regard, and keeping forestry in mind, he should take into consideration the other lands available to him which do not have potential for any enterprises other than forestry.  I am referring to marginal land and mountain land which has not yet been developed.  This is a considerable vast land resource and it should be tackled both by private and State enterprises.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that certain areas of national development, such as forestry, should not be the subject of erratic short-term policies related to frequent Government changes.  I ask the <Col N="1506" /> Minister to address this issue because it would be a satisfying and rewarding hallmark of his work and one from which future generations would benefit.  Previous Administrations did not have the commitment to this form of long-term development and investment, mainly, I suppose, because of scarce resources. The return would have been too slow and there was no political incentive to go down that road.  However, because this Government are approaching the overall development and administration of the country in a positive manner, I believe they can undertake this development and investment.  As I indicated already, certain areas, for example, forestry and bog develpment, should not be subjected to the changes that take place between one election and another and the policies of one Government and another.  We need to have a long-term strategy, commitment and investment if we want to make the kind of progress we need and which we should have been making over the years.</P>
    <P>If I had to single out one industry which has been the victim of that kind of uneven management over the years I would have to point to the area of forestry, which has been the subject of very erratic Government policies as Administrations changed over the years.  As I indicated earlier, this happened mainly because resources were generally limited and there was no political incentive to make long-term investments because the results and returns do not come onstream fast enough for Governments to reap the political advantages. That is a disastrous approach to overall economic management.  I am convinced that the situation in the country is improving under this Government and I ask the Minister to keep in mind my comments on drawing up an overall national development programme which would have the commitment of all political parties, a commitment with regard to financing, and which would not be subject in any way to changes from one general election and another.</P>
    <P>I realise we have to be careful and vigilant with regard to borrowing and we <Col N="1507" /> must not return to the old policy of borrowing for current consumption.  As I said earlier, if we prepare a comprehensive strategy for the development of forestry and peat, long-term borrowing at favourable terms would be justified and would be available to the Government from some of the regional funds which are available to other European Governments at present.  In deciding on the future of cutaway bogs, we should strike a reasonable balance between forestry and other enterprises.  If the Minister decided to hand over this peat resource, which is coming onstream for the purpose of afforestation, I would not be totally committed to this approach.  He should strike a balance between forestry, horticulture and tourism as there is ample scope within that overall resource to develop a fairly balanced and comprehensive development programme.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration should be given to making part of that bog resource available to people who have uneconomic holdings, many of whom are redundant Bord na Móna workers and who live in the immediate area of the cutaway bogs. I am sure the Minister is fully aware that there are small uneconomic holdings in the immediate vicinity of the cutaway peatland which is available at present and which will come onstream in the future. The owners of many of these holdings would have had their turbary rights acquired by Bord na Móna for the purpose of the development of peat promotion, but now that these resources are being depleted I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Minister to look, as part of his development programme, at the possibility of making some of that resource available to owners of uneconomic holdings whose lands adjoin this vast area of bog.  Such a decision would be of benefit in preserving the rural structure of the area and would keep farm families on the land.</P>
    <P>One aspect of farming in that area is the need to maintain an adequate drainage system.  We all know that the success of any operation, and particularly the success of the Bord na Móna operation up <Col N="1508" /> to now, has been the capacity to maintain drainage in vast peat areas.  When this resource is divided up and, as I should like, partly allocated to adjoining farmers, the Minister will have to make adequate provision for the maintenance of the drainage system because the structure of cutaway bogland is such that if drainage is not totally maintained within a very short period of time that resource will seriously deteriorate and will be of little benefit to individual farmers or the State.  I should like the Minister to keep that aspect in mind.</P>
    <P>I put forward for the Minister's consideration the possibility of development by Bord na Móna of our coal resources, with particular reference to the very valuable resources in the Leinster coalfield. The Minister has responsibility for the overall development of energy.  I am fully justified in referring to the coal resources of that coalfield in the context of this Bill. In the past, there was a very haphazard approach to this reserve, which is now of greater significance than ever before because of the emphasis on smokeless fuel.  I urge the Minister to satisfy himself, first, as to the viability of the resource and then to develop a strategy over the years to maximise its potential for future development.</P>
    <P>It would be a good idea to ask Bord na Móna to examine all aspects of the proposed development because up to now nothing significant has been done.  I acknowledge that the Minister's predecessor issued a number of prospecting licences to those who were interested in exploring the potential of the Leinster coalfield.  To date, despite what may seem to be my adverse comments, I am pleased that there is more activity in that coalfield than there has been for a long number of years.  However, the real potential has not been exploited nor, indeed, explored.  The time has come for the Minister and his Department to address this matter and produce a long-term strategy for the overall development of the Leinster coalfield.  Much of the development up to now has been fragmented and haphazard and, to some <Col N="1509" /> extent, could inhibit overall development of the coal reserves.</P>
    <P>I have two further points to make which are of relevance to this Bill.  I realise that other speakers are anxious to contribute to the debate.  I wish to bring to the Minister's attention the need for maintenance of both bog roads and forestry roads which are under the control of his Department.  As far as we in County Laois are concerned, considerable damage has been done to county roads in the Slieve Bloom and other forestry areas of our county.  Laois County Council find it almost impossible to make available the necessary funds to keep these roads in a proper state of repair.  The Minister should be in a position to make funds available to the local authority, in this case Laois County Council, to enable them to embark on a proper maintenance programme for these mountain roads, particularly those in forest areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is in County Laois &mdash; as I am sure there is in other counties &mdash; a considerable amount of private peatland which, for a number of reasons, cannot be developed and exploited to its maximum potential.  There is need for a continuation of a drainage and a development programme for private bog areas in all our counties.  Over the last two to three years in particular, many have availed of the peat resources which are in private hands and are endeavouring to provide themselves and their families with a very cheap fuel resource from these areas.  They are being inhibited by inadequate bog roads and the absence of adequate drainage, which is fundamental as far as peatland is concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism, agri-tourism seems to be the in thing at present &mdash; at least we are giving a lot of lip-service to it.  There is tremendous potential for the promotion of agri-tourism.  The Minister has at his disposal a very valuable resource in our national forests.  He should endeavour, in conjunction with the officers of his Department and the limited workforce available to the Department, to develop and open up these forests and convert them into national parks.  People enjoy taking a <Col N="1510" /> casual stroll through forest areas, particularly those who live in an urban environment. That resource has undoubtedly a great commercial value, but it has also great tourist potential.  The Minister should apply himself to that aspect in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>I express again my personal thanks to the Minister for taking such an interest, in his short term of office, in the overall development of both forests and peatlands as far as the nation is concerned, but particularly as far as the midlands are concerned.  I cannot stress enough the importance of his continuing that interest for the purpose of trying to find alternative jobs and creating job opportunities for those who become unemployed as a result of the decline of Bord na Móna's operations.  I ask him to acknowledge the potential which forestry has for job creation.  Every pound invested in forestry will give a return to the nation.  It would be nice to see that return tied into job creation programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that this Bill, so far as the midlands are concerned, is probably the most important Bill that is likely to come before the House in this session.  It can have a profound influence on the shape, size and policies of Bord na Móna for decades to come.  Deputy Hyland and I, and all those who live in the midlands, are acutely aware of how much the lives and futures of the people in that area depend on a healthy and viable Bord na Móna.  Indeed, the future viability of many towns and villages from Longford, through Westmeath, Laois, Offaly and Kildare all depend very directly on Bord na Móna being a viable and healthy institution.  Consequently, it is of critical importance to that area that Bord na Móna in the future would be both innovative and energetic.  The Bill gives the capacity to Bord na Móna to perform in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have reservations about the confines that are placed in the Bill on new powers that are given to Bord na Móna and I shall refer to these later.  Part of my confidence in Bord na Móna is based on having confidence in their workforce.  By <Col N="1511" /> and large, they are a rural work force, with all the virtues of hard work and discipline that we have come to expect from that sector of our community. Indeed, proof was given of the loyalty and dedication of that workforce during the disastrous summer of, I think, two years ago when peat production targets were falling seriously behind schedule because of an extremely wet summer.  It looked at a certain part of the year that if there was no pick-up the board would be literally heading for financial ruin.  As we recall, there was a lull in the bad weather and the workforce, possibly in a manner unprecedented in the country, rallied to their company and managed to save in a short number of weeks towards the end of the harvesting year sufficient product to save the board.  That should be noted.  It is appropriate to acknowledge that work and express our appreciation of it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that changes will affect Bord na Móna and their operations in the years to come.  The board themselves have taken steps through initiation of the enterprise corporation to recognise the need for change and to change commercial tack to take account of the commercial exigencies that face them. Obviously something as radical as what is proposed will have teething problems but I have no doubt, having regard to the expertise of the board's management and the business acuity and common sense of the workforce, that these problems will be overcome and that the direction in which the board want to go will be embarked on successfully.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to change the statutory powers of Bord na Móna in three significant ways.  It will enable the board to promote from, take part in or acquire other companies at home and abroad.  I do not say this critically, but I was a little puzzled as to how the board were recently able to acquire a company in France in advance of this Bill.  Possibly the Bill is to tighten up or make more precise powers which the board already have or to clarify their powers.  However, it appears that <Col N="1512" /> the board were able to make their investment in France in advance of the Bill and I should like this point explained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The next new power given to the board is the power to delegate some of their functions to sub-boards.  Again I am puzzled as to why it is necessary to give such power legal status by putting it in the Bill. I would have imagined that the board could always have operated through delegated bodies within their own structures. I am sure there are good legal reasons for that and I ask the Minister to indicate the legal necessity for it and the commercial advantage he sees in giving this new power in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third and most important new function given to the board is the power to engage in activities not strictly related to peat.  This is where the future of the board probably lies.  Deputy Hyland pointed out &mdash; as those of us who live in the midland are well aware &mdash; that the peat stock is diminishing and there are very large areas where it has been removed.  Consequent on these developments it is important that the board be given new areas of activity or power to enter into them.  There is a new, young and dynamic management team at the helm in Bord na Móna with the support of a board which is equally dynamic under a committed chairman.  I have great confidence in the expertise and innovative thinking of that team to advise on new activities for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in giving these new powers the Minister appears to have circumscribed them unduly by making all their exercises subject to the consent of himself and the Minister for Finance.  I can see certain bureaucratic unwillingness to hand over to a State company total autonomy, but I do not agree with that attitude because we are living in a highly competitive commercial world and if we set up a commercial State body like Bord na Móna, give them powers that point them in the direction of innovation and new enterprises, we should not circumscribe them by having to run to the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance for permission before they can <Col N="1513" /> engage in any of these things.  I have no doubt that if a good proposition comes along it will be received with pleasure and goodwill by the Minister but I know from my experience of the system of Government and the Civil Service how these things work.  Inevitably, there will be questions, t's will have to be crossed and i's will have to be dotted in a way that may have no relevance to the inherent proposition being put up but that is necessary in order to go through the procedure of bureaucracy to get to the Minister.  He and the Minister for Finance and their Departments will have to examine these projects, they will ask questions and inevitably these restrictions and circumscribing conditions will have a dampening effect on the innovation in Bord na Móna.  They will impose a psychological impediment on innovative and new thinking.  If we set up an autonomous State body, give it an autonomous role, appoint a dynamic team to run it and a good board and a committed chairman to oversee their operations, they should not be kept on a tight rein by the two Government Departments.  I can understand that there would have to be contact between the parent Department, the Department of Energy, and the board and, in the nature of things, this being a small country where people know each other, there is constant tick-tacking between State bodies and the parent Department.  However, to bring in the Department of Finance on top of that, whose psychology and ethos are restrictive on anything that will cost money, is a detrimental aspect in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to try to persuade the Department of Finance to drop out and leave control to the Department of Energy because, after all, every Government Department are ultimately subject to the controls of the Department of Finance. However, to formalise it in the Bill is a bad thing.  I make that criticism strongly and forcefully.</P>
    <P>In giving the board power to engage in other activities which are set out in section 7 &mdash; there is a significant list of expanded activities available to them in the section &mdash; I want to refer to the power given to them to develop commercially <Col N="1514" /> or otherwise any bog no longer needed by the board, in other words, cutaway bog.  That is a very important power; I suppose one would say the power was already inherent in the board's original mandate but, lest there be any doubt about it, it is set out here.  Further on in section 7 the power of the board to develop cutaway bogs is subject to the board having to give a first option on that cutaway bog to a new body to be called An Bord Coillte.  In other words this new quango will be given the power to take over all the cutaway bogs.  They literally have power to take it over for the purposes of afforestation.</P>
    <P>I share with everybody else in the House the view that it is important that there be an expanded and accelerated programme of afforestation, but I see no reason why cutaway bogs should not be available to Bord na Móna if they want to engage in afforestation as one of their new commercial activities.  I would see one great advantage in this.  Bord na Móna are a commercial company with a good track record.  They have had to operate in very difficult commercial circumstances over the years, and frequently they were not the masters of the price they could get for their products. That, of course, would put any commercial activity in a difficult position. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Bord na Móna have been a highly successful commercial operation and I think they already have the necessary management expertise, managers who would be <i>au fait</i> with modern methods of production and are highly skilled in marketing.  If they lack some technical expertise in afforestation, this is something that could easily be brought in because our graduates in forestry have the technical expertise.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see is Bord na Móna and An Bord Coillte engaging in forestry and in competition.  From time to time we hear calls for the privatisation of State companies.  This is not a call with which I am sympathetic, but the motivation behind those calls is to try to put a more competitive edge into the activities of the companies sought to be <Col N="1515" /> privatised.  I think that competitive edge can be got much more easily and much more effectively by introducing competition. In the case of Bord Telecom and other State bodies, this can be done by breaking the monopoly.</P>
    <P>One outstanding and striking example was the breaking of the monopoly of Aer Lingus which resulted in the introduction of a new beneficial régime for the consumers of that product, the passengers. If competiton were to be introduced in the area of forestry, this would be excellent and would put Bord na Móna, who I would like, having a role in this area, and An Bord Coillte on their mettle and competing with each other.  The results could only be beneficial.</P>
    <P>The range of activities that will be available to Bord na Móna on cutaway bogs will be limited.  The expectation that there is huge agricultural or horticultural potential is subject to some doubt.  For many years Bord na Móna have been experimenting in various agricultural and horticultural enterprises on cutaway bogs.  I recall that some years ago I had the opportunity to visit one of these projects. I understand that no one activity, either agricultural or horticultural, has been without, at some stage in its development, serious faults, faults which were not foreseen.</P>
    <P>Cattle grazing was attempted, but it was found after a number of years that the cattle lacked certain mineral traces. Cereal growing was also attempted and this proved to be successful for a number of years but suddenly difficulties arose and cracks began to appear in the soil. Various vegetables were also grown with success for some time, but then difficulties emerged.  Apparently these were due to the unusual sub-soil structure left following the removal of peat.  The matter is further complicated by the fact that the sub-soil conditions vary from bog to bog.  The technical problems arising from the difficult sub-soil conditions are not even consistent.  Consequently if such uncertainty exists in regard to long term production, the viability of the process has to be under a cloud from day one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> This is why I say that the range of activities in cutaway bogs will be limited. It is a great pity that Bord na Móna are not being given the power to mount their own afforestation programme on the bogs they decide are suitable.  I see no reason why a State board should be given a monopoly of forestry on State lands. To all intents and purposes, all State forestry is a monopoly because the amount of timber in private hands is infinitesimal by comparison to the amount of timber in State hands.  As we know, the monopolies which already exist have done a good job.  When first established they had to be given a monopoly in order to get them off the ground, but inevitably complacency becomes part and parcel of a monopoly and this can only be dealt with by introducing competition.</P>
    <P>Here we have Bord na Móna with a proven business record who are ready, willing and able to undertake afforestation on their own cutaway bogs.  They should be given the opportunity to do so and allowed compete with An Bord Coillte.  If this were to happen there would be a sharper régime in the forestry area with consequent commercial benefit.</P>
    <P>I make that criticism and I ask the Minister when replying to deal with the philosophical point I make about not giving An Bord Coillte a monopoly in forestry.  I do not know why we need to set up another State body.  The Forestry Department have the necessary expertise within their structures to continue to engage in afforestation in the normal way.  It is now proposed to set up a new semi-State body with all the administrative layers and capital costs that will bring with it whereas Bord na Móna already own cutaway bogs and I have no doubt they have the necessary expertise to develop them.</P>
    <P>What financial arrangement will be entered into between Bord na Móna and An Bord Coillte for taking over the cutaway bogs?  I would be very interested to know what the Minister's thinking is in regard to what is a fundamental matter proposed in section 7.  Bord na Móna, to have arrived at the stage of owning <Col N="1517" /> cutaway bogs, have invested a huge amount of money in drainage and harvesting operations over the decades.  Will Bord na Móna have to hand over these cutaway bogs for a nominal sum?  What value will be placed on them?  The growing of timber is one area for which the cutaway bogs are uniquely suitable. Because of this it obviously has a very high financial value.  I see no point in setting up An Bord Coillte with one arm of the State having to pay a big sum of money to another arm of the State when that arm could develop these resources themselves.  I see no point in handing over all the cutaway bogs to An Bord Coillte.</P>
    <P>The overseeing powers which the Minister proposes to retain might be exercised to ensure that both bodies will be able to engage in afforestation.  I would be very glad if the Minister was to indicate that that is his policy, as it is one I would certainly share and approve of.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Bill because of the new powers it gives to Bord na Móna.  I am happy in the capacity of Bord na Móna to take advantage of those new powers, to be innovative and energetic.  I hope the overseeing powers the Minister has retained and which he is putting there for the Minister for Finance will be exercised with discretion and will never inhibit in any way the commercial innovation we have to demand from Bord na Móna in future.  I am confident that that innovation will be forthcoming.  As I said when I started, the future of the entire midlands is dependent on a viable and successful Bord na Móna operation in the future.  I am confident that if they are allowed to exercise the powers they are given untrammelled we can look forward to a good performance by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in its presentation and in relation to the legal formalities it proposes.  However, there is much more to this Bill than the mere legalities which appear on the face of it. The Bill gives this House an opportunity to deal not only with the formal functions of the board but with the economic background in which the board operate, the <Col N="1518" /> marketing, management and even climatic difficulties they faced over the last decade and, of course, the opportunities which now present themselves in relation to the economic survival not only of the board and their employees but also, as previous speakers have said of the economic survival and progress of the midlands.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing a constituency with a considerable area of bog and a considerable number of people employed directly on the bog, it is incumbent on me to take great care to ensure that whatever is decided in this House and whatever policy is brought forward by the Government and the board will serve the best interests of, first, the people employed in Bord na Móna, then the board themselves and the local economies such as Lanesborough, Rochfortbridge, the Derrygreenagh area, including Milltownpass and Tyrellspass and even areas like Kinnegad and Kilbeggan and the area surrounding Coolnagun and Coole, Ballivor, which, curiously enough, has its headquarters in County Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To analyse the effects of the Bill it is worth while considering the difficulties faced by Bord na Móna generally in the past few years.  Through 1985 and 1986 the board faced the worst years weatherwise that they have experienced in our time.  That provided its own difficulties and challenges for the board.  As Chairman of Westmeath County Council I recollect in 1986 taking part in fairly frantic efforts on the part of board management, trade union management at various levels through the board's bogs and people in Government to ensure that whatever could be salvaged by way of production in 1985 and 1986 would be salvaged.  My very deep, active involvement in that area stems from that time.  I recollect that through these difficult years there was a great willingness on the part of both management and unions to come together to meet the difficulties.  Perhaps the difficulties were met a little slowly. Perhaps change did not come around as quickly as we thought it should come around, but management thinking and union thinking evident now indicate <Col N="1519" /> that people are prepared to examine methods of production and go forward for new methods of production, whether these be the kind of formal enterprise system proposed by the board or any other system which will ensure more cost effective production and more volume of production, in milled peat especially. That indicates that the goodwill has been there on all sides to reach out for solutions. As we now face the start up period for the board I know there will be continued goodwill on both sides of the industry, union and management, to ensure a very quick start off for Bord na Móna and that innovations, despite reservations on the trade union side and, indeed, sometimes on the management side, will ensure that at the end of this year we will be in a position to assess how the board are to go forward.  I hope, weather permitting, we can have a bumper year productionwise for Bord na Móna so as to establish them on a sound financial footing, far better than it has been in the past few years, with reserves of stocks to enable them to bargain better in economic terms for their future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the weather and possibly obsolescent plant and machinery and obsolescent methods of working, the board suffered in the last few years a very strong setback from falling world prices of energy.  This has left the board, especially in the production of milled peat and sod peat, having to compete against oil and coal when prices were falling quickly.  There was also a very competitive product from the private peat producing sector which some speakers have said was spurred on by the Act of 1980 introducing the grants for private bog development, but which I say would have occurred anyway because of the introduction of the new technology dramatised by the onset of the sausage machine in the late seventies and early eighties and several machines of that type which came later.  The combined effect of weather, technology and energy prices have posed extreme challenges to Bord na Móna which not many companies would have survived, moving to the stage of <Col N="1520" /> going forward and looking for avenues to expand and develop and looking to this House for more legal powers to develop their various functions.  It is a credit to the basic sound philosophy of the company that they have got through these difficulties and it is a credit to the employees that they have brought the company through these difficulties in a comparatively unscathed condition.</P>
    <P>Granted, there is a debt on the company of £170 million or thereabouts.  That is frightening.  Perhaps that amount of debt should not have been allowed accumulate. People will say that is the capitalisation of the company and it should be converted into equity.  Even if it where converted into equity, the taxpayer would have to take up that £170 million or a substantial part of it and convert it into a State loan and the interest at comparative rates would still have to be paid on that loan.  Therefore, the division of equity for Board na Móna is no panacea in their current position of a rather poor capital base and rather poor capitalisation. A solution to providing a viable future for Bord na Móna and their employees will be to move forward in the many ways proposed by the board, whether by way of new management practices, new work practices through the enterprise systems and the HAKU system that goes with them or new work practices introduced in the direct labour force in Bord na Móna, which I know will continue in the foreseeable future. By these means production will be increased.  Once production is increased the board have the ability and willingness to go forward and ensure that that production is marketed in the most efficient, cost effective and profitable way possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the market for milled peat, the ESB remain a strong customer and milled peat being sold to the ESB must in general terms be competitive with the other competing fuels, coal and oil, in addition to water power.  Everyone who has the interest of Bord na Móna at heart will concede that the price of milled peat to the electricity industry and the horticultural industry will have to be kept at reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> I trust that production from the bog will be such as to enable the basic conditions for a reasonable price to be met and that the overheads of the board will be covered by a substantial increase in tonnage this year and in each succeeding year.  Bord na Móna cannot carry very large overheads on a small productive base.</P>
    <P>In one sod peat producing bog in County Westmeath in the past few years there have been particular difficulties arising from unfortunate management decisions, bad weather conditions and the location and physical make-up of the bog, resulting in poor production levels and a poor product which could not be marketed successfully.  I refer to Coolnagun bog in County Westmeath where in each of the past two years two cuts of sod peat turf were taken.  One cut could have been taken and saved in good condition so as to be marketed in prime order, suitable for the purchaser.  Instead, a diktat issued from top management of the company that two cuts were to be made.  This resulted in difficulty and haste in harvesting the first cut to make way for the second and even more haste and inadequacy in harvesting the second cut in the damper weather at the end of the year.  Thus, there were two harvests of damp, not properly matured turf being stockpiled.  It was very difficult for Coolnagun bog to compete with other fuels when selling this turf, especially when they were competing with other sod producing units in the private sector and other Bord na Móna bogs such as Ballivor.  The unfortunate combination of bad weather and bad management led to a situation where Coolnagun was not in a position to trade at a profit.  This led to the demoralisation of the workforce and the feeling that there was no future at Coolnagun.</P>
    <P>I recollect leading a deputation last year to the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Burke, when various proposals were made to ensure that sod peat production at Coolnagun would continue. Unfortunately, due to the onset of the redundancy package in Bord na Móna, it was not possible for these plans to <Col N="1522" /> materialise and I regret to say that the redundancy package has taken precedence over all other activities at that bog.  In the weeks to come there will be only a skeleton workforce at Coolnagun. In previous years there was an average workforce of 60 men throughout the year, with the addition of seasonal workers.  This is a tragedy for the workers involved.  They had the option of taking up alternative employment within Bord na Móna, but Coolnagun is very isolated and it would be necessary to travel perhaps 25 or 40 miles to other bogs.  Effectively, the redundancy package was the only option available to them in the light of the continuing decline of the Coolnagun sod peat operation.</P>
    <P>If different management decisions had been made it would have been possible for Coolnagun to turn away from decline some five years ago.  It would have been necessary even in those circumstances to streamline the operation and possibly to have a number of redundancies, but the bog would have survived, producing sod peat at a price competitive with that of any fuel source in north Westmeath.  However, we cannot constantly look to the past.  Those who helped to fight closure cannot give up the battle to ensure continued economic activity in the north Westmeath area arising from this bog.</P>
    <P>Last summer I met the chief executive of Bord na Móna and his management team at the Bloomfield House Hotel in Mullingar and I asked if there would be continued peat operation at Coolnagun in the foreseeable future.  Regrettably, the answer from him was that there would not be such activity within the foreseeable future, which he clarified to mean five years from last summer.  I did not accept, nor do I now accept, that this is an adequate response by a State board to the plight of this area and I wasted no time in putting on record to the board of Bord na Móna my extreme dissatisfaction. I have seen the Minister and his predecessor on several occasions to discuss the implications of this fairly disastrous prediction by the chief executive. I continue to fight and to make strong <Col N="1523" /> submissions to the management of Bord na Móna, whose prime responsibility it is to ensure that this enormous asset of 6,000 acres, mostly of virgin bog, should be exploited to the benefit not only of the local economy, which is of prime importance to me as a local Deputy, but also to the benefit of Bord na Móna and of the country.</P>
    <P>While I cannot say at this stage that my efforts and those of the Minister and the Department of Energy to make the case for further development and economic activity at Coolnagun have met with definite success, I am satisfied I have been given a very good hearing, not only by the board and intermediate management of Bord na Móna but also by the officials of the Department of Energy and by the present Minister and his predecessor.  I thank both Ministers for bearing with me on the many occasions I approached them and their officials in trying to resolve the impasse in relation to employment in the Coolnagun area arising from the demise of the sod peat cutting operation.  There have already been various efforts to get the wheels of industry going in the Coolnagun area but, unfortunately, they have not been successful.  I have information indicating that very strenuous efforts were made to encourage a group of former Coolnagun employees to take over the assets of Coolnagun and proceed as a workers' co-operative to exploit the sod peat capacity of the bog for the next few years, with the backing and encouragement of Bord na Móna.  To date it has not been possible for any local group of workers to take up that option.  I would hope they would be able to and would give them every encouragement.  The commencement of such an operation in Coolnagun is largely hampered by a very large stock of turf there yet to be sold. This means prospective participants in the co-operative might be somewhat hindered by the prospect of competing with many thousands of hectares of turf on the bog yet to be disposed of by Bord na Móna which might be in competition with any fresh production on the part of the co-operative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> I am optimistic that there will be turfcutting activity, peat processing, milling of peat and development of bog in the Coolnagun area. Furthermore, I am optimistic that the dire predictions of the chief executive of August last that there will be no activity there in five years will not prove to be the case.  I will make every effort to ensure that such predictions do not prove to have been founded.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that Bord na Móna observe their social and economic obligations to north-west Meath, which has served them so well over many years, to find suitable alternative employment for the many young people who will be seeking jobs in the area.  I remind the Minister and Bord na Móna that we are fortunate in that the region has been designated a pilot area for rural integrated development under the EC programme.  I refer, of course to the Inny basin programme to which the Department of Agriculture and Food appointed a co-ordinator in October last. This provides a framework within which Bord na Móna and the Departments of Energy and Agriculture and Food can co-operate to ensure that alternative economic opportunities will be provided in the wake of the closure of the sod peat operation in Coolnagun.  The Coolnagun operation could be salvaged without the existence of the Inny basin programme but its existence offers no excuse whatsoever unless there is substantial funding from EC sources to get the wheels moving again.</P>
    <P>The other bogs in my constituency, some of which are located in south-west Meath and the Longford side merging into other counties, are primarily milled peat bogs that will come within the ambit of the new enterprise scheme.  The new enterprise scheme, relating to 10 per cent of bog area, probably will commence this year and it will be monitored with great interest by the workers concerned.  Most Bord na Móna workers would wish the new system well but many would regard it as a threat to their way of life and working operations over many decades. Naturally, many would like a continuation <Col N="1525" /> of their present stable employment with the board.  They would not like to see a position evolve in which they would be regarded as second-class citizens, with the enterprise system taking all of the spoils of production from them, leaving them in the position of being driven subtly to accepting redundancy.  No current employee of the board would like to see that scenario develop.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with some effort on the part of all concerned, the advantages of the enterprise scheme could be integrated into the current Bord na Móna system when the results of the 1989 peat production season are to hand.  The Bord na Móna worker representatives are more than capable of devising systems whereby adequate rewards will be available for increased production within their existing employment framework.  I am confident that whatever changes need to be effected in the workforce and their operational methods will be effected in the course of the year through a combination of those participating in the enterprise scheme and those who do not opt for it.  At the end of this year I would hope to see a revolutionised system of production in Bord na Móna, one which will be responsive to opportunities presented by good weather and also to market needs, resulting in a good quality, dry product.</P>
    <P>It is crucial for their overall financial position that there be improvements in the marketing structure of Bord na Móna.  The provisions of the Bill, enabling them to establish marketing companies and relationships with companies located abroad, are much to be welcomed.  For example, the decision of the board to develop foreign markets for horticultural peat is to be commended. Possibly they are not achieving sufficient sales in such markets because of the uncompetitive price of their product.  The increased production and dilution of overheads involved in the production of horticultural peat should mean that they will be able to obtain many more markets in ensuing years.  They will also have a raw material from which to develop other more specialised and exciting products, <Col N="1526" /> such as the peat fibre used for diluting the pollutant and obnoxious aspects of certain effluents.</P>
    <P>It is only proper that the board should spend a considerable amount of money on research and development.  The resultant products and those emanating from joint ventures with other companies, whether at home or abroad, will ensure that the board will not be dependent on one market only.  It will also lead to the greater viability of the company and security for their workers.  I predict that the balance between production and marketing, in employment terms, will tilt rather more in the direction of marketing. I hope the extra jobs created in marketing will not be at headquarters in Dublin but rather will be spread throughout the peat-producing counties of Westmeath, Kildare, Offaly and Longford. In turn, I hope that the traditional complaint of many of the people employed by the board in my constituency &mdash; that all of the spoils tend to be concentrated in Dublin &mdash; will no longer be made.  In that regard I commend many of the present management on having moved their places of residence to the midland region, for varying periods, over the past couple of years.  This personal emphasis in relation to residences was a great symbolism for people employed by Bord na Móna in the midlands. The underlying policy of the company should be to ensure that as much research and development and administration work is carried out at midland locations as is possible.  The various sub-companies to be set up under the Bill should have their administrative headquarters in midland locations.</P>
    <P>The issue of cutaway bogs has been dealt with by most contributors.  I do not minimise its importance.  I am concerned to ensure that those bogs are used in a way that will create the maximum number of jobs.  While it appears that afforestation is the likely use for cutaway bogs, I hope the Bill will give flexibility to the company, and the Department of Energy, in the use of that land.  I do not want any development schemes left in a strait-jacket.  We should encourage <Col N="1527" /> research and development and the economic use of cutaway bogs.  We must consider the use we will make of cutaway bogs that is not suitable for afforestation, such as land that is flooded during certain months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a positive move by the Minister and I look forward to the Committee Stage debate when we will be examining its various technical aspects.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill forward.  I wish him well in his new role.  I have no doubt that he and his Department will encourage Bord na Móna to face up to the challenges of the nineties.  Under the Minister's guidance I have no doubt that the fortunes of Bord na Móna will be turned around and that the jobs of those working in the peat industry in the midlands will be secured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>On this, the first public opportunity I have had, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Energy.  I wish him success in the difficult task that he faces in charge of that Department.  I wish him success at the Cabinet table and I should like to extend my good wishes to his wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there are merits in the Bill.  At the outset I should like to pay tribute to Bord na Móna for their excellent work over the years.  The company have had an excellent and dedicated workforce since their foundation in 1946. I would be failing in my duty if I did not bring to the notice of the House my serious reservations about some aspects of the Bill.  It is of vital importance that the Minister maintains the basic structure of Bord na Móna.  Any break-up or diminution of Bord na Móna into a number of smaller concerns would be unwise and wrong.  It appears that it is the intention to establish a number of different companies but that will amount to establishing a hierarchical structure with directors and chief executive officers appointed and new buildings provided.  I see that as a real danger if we adopt the Bill as presented.  It is important that we <Col N="1528" /> ensure that that does not happen but the capacity for it to occur is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fully appreciated what Bord na Móna have done for the country.  A mention of the name of the company in Dublin evokes widespread criticism; people knock Bord na Móna and their employees at every opportunity but forget that the company had to face stiff competition down the years.  They have had to comply with Government policies which were subject to the same frequency of variation as the weather.  In fairness to the company, it must be stated that not alone were they asked to fight with one hand behind their backs, but on occasions were expected to fight with their two hands behind their backs and almost blindfolded.  They have had to compete against falling gas and oil prices and cope with bad weather at harvest time.</P>
    <P>When the original Bill was going through the House Bord na Móna were asked to undertake a major capital development programme.  They borrowed a vast amount of money.  In 1980 Bord na Móna had a staff of 7,100.  Now Bord na Móna's indebtedness is about £160 million and they are paying approximately £20 million each year in interest to the banks and financial institutions from which they borrowed.  In spite of the difficulties confronting Bord na Móna, they have managed to increase their sales of baled briquettes in Dublin and right across the country, and their stockpiles are being reduced.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the passing of the ESB legislation allowed the ESB to import coal, enabling them to compete with Bord na Móna through Moneypoint.  In spite of the smog we have suffered over a number of years, particularly in Dublin, we have allowed vast quantities of coal to be imported while we had our own indigenous resource which, in my view and in the view of medical experts and others, causes little or no harm to health in terms of the fumes resulting from burning it.</P>
    <P>The Government have not gone far enough to prevent the burning of coal in <Col N="1529" /> different areas in this city.  The efforts by the Government to encourage the burning of turf and smokeless coal have not been sufficient.  There should have been incentives provided to encourage people to move from burning coal to burning our own native fuels.  This would have benefited the health of the people and the economy.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have succeeded in breaking into the British market. Briquettes are now selling in shops, supermarkets and chain stores across Britain.  Moss peat, which was losing money, is now a major profit-maker for the board; last year they achieved a profit of over £3 million on the sale of moss peat.  In a joint venture with Wavin they developed a method for tackling pollution problems.  This is to be welcomed. They should be assisted in every way to research and develop these products to combat the major problem of effluent pollution.  Major initiatives are needed and I am glad to see that Bord na Móna have taken the initiative here.</P>
    <P>In Bord na Móna there is considerable expertise and initiative among the management and staff.  I will continue to support and assist such progress and development in every way possible.  In 1946 when the Turf Development Act was passed in this House the late Deputy Todd Andrews was involved and the core objective of Bord na Móna was to be the extraction of turf peat from the bogs of Ireland for domestic consumption.  Since then the sale of turf and briquettes has been of enormous benefit to the people of Ireland, but it was of particular importance to our balance of payments by reducing the importation of other fuels.</P>
    <P>Times have changed since then and Bord na Móna workers are willing to adapt and do whatever is required of them as long as it is reasonable and sensible. In the past 12 months over 1,200 Bord na Móna workers have taken voluntary redundancy or early retirement.  I do not think the people of Dublin or anywhere else appreciate the significance of that figure &mdash; that number of live people have had their employment terminated.  Of that 1,200 people, I would <Col N="1530" /> say 1,100 come from the midlands.  It is devastating to see so many people lose their jobs in a period of 12 months.  If that happened here in Dublin there would be an outcry.  The national papers would send in teams of reporters to investigate the causes and come up with remedies; there would be &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; specials and a major Government initiative to try to counteract such a huge job loss.  This is happening in the midlands and I am sad that the people in Dublin have not the same concern about what is happening in rural Ireland as they have for what is happening in our bigger cities.</P>
    <P>The workers who are still with Bord na Móna say they are fully in agreement with flexible work practices and methods so that all unnecessary demarcation would be abolished.  It is important for the Department and the management in Bord na Móna to be aware that the staff are willing to co-operate in every respect to ensure the future viability of Bord na Móna.  The unions have made this abundantly clear and I hope it is acted upon.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I had some real reservations about what is happening. There is to be a change in the method of harvesting.  There are two systems involved &mdash; the PECO and HAKU systems.  We are changing from the PECO system to the HAKU system.  In simple words, the HAKU system means all the peat will be brought into one huge pile, having been lifted by harvesters, and brought into a huge centre which will have solid foundations.  It will be stock piled near a road or a railway line.  Enterprise units will be set up and will be managed and supervised by Bord na Móna.  Apparently this work will be carried out on a trial basis at first.  If it is not a success and if everybody is not happy with it, after 12 months it will be forgotten about and Bord na Móna will revert back to the old system.  That is the procedure that has been outlined.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that there is an amount of sincerity in what people have said in this regard from time to time.  I have some of those statements and I am sure when they were made these people <Col N="1531" /> intended to fulfil their promises but, alas, the deed often differs from the word.  If the Minister, the Department of Energy and Bord na Móna want to bring in this HAKU system under the terms as outlined, I would be happy with it but I would like to see it written in legislation. The word &ldquo;realism&rdquo; that has bedevilled rural Ireland in the last two and a half years is regarded as progress but I have a lot of reservations about that.  I would like to see this system written into legislation. It should be operated for 12 months on an experimental basis and if it is not satisfactory to the people in the midlands or if the workers find it is not suitable then we should revert to the original system.</P>
    <P>The reason for my reservations is that during the last general election campaign the then Opposition made promises as to what they would do if elected to Government but they did not keep those promises. Speeches were made from platforms &mdash; I do not know whether the Minister made such a speech in North Tipperary &mdash; to the effect that forestry would be developed and Bord na Móna would have the responsibility of doing so.  That undertaking was given at the time. People in Offaly, Laois, Longford, Westmeath and right across the midlands listened to these promises.  Perhaps that promise was not made in North Tipperary but others were made there.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from the Taoiseach's presidential address at the 1985 Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, in which he stated:</P>
    <P>We believe the stage has now been reached where the full scale development of the commercial possibilities of this national asset and the achievement of the full potential of our timber industry should be entrusted to a commercially oriented organisation geared to the type of product development and marketing now required.  We are therefore seriously examining giving Bord na Móna overall responsibility also for putting forestry development on a viable long term commercial basis and attracting adequate investment as <Col N="1532" /> the best guarantee of maximum employment and a worthwhile return to the nation. </P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>Great credit is due over the years to the Department of Forestry for the planting and development of our forests so that we now have, as a nation, a very considerable asset available to us. </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in that statement, said that Bord na Móna would have responsibility for developing our timber industry and that they would be geared to product development and marketing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds, now Minister for Finance, who was then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Energy, made a statement in Tullamore which was reported in the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of 19 October 1985 as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds said that he favoured the introduction of voluntary early retirement and, if necessary, the implementation of short time working. In the long term, he said, he favoured a development of the role of Bord na Móna to include responsibility for forestry. There were other quotations on the matter.  At that time people believed that Bord na Móna would have responsibility for forestry.  They felt that Bord na Móna had the expertise and the personnel to develop the timber industry.  With cutaway bogs becoming available it was a natural follow-on that Bord na Móna would develop our forests but that did not happen.  Instead of giving the responsibility to an existing body which would be commonsense and would avoid the expense of setting up another semi-State body &mdash; and we have a lot of semi-State bodies &mdash; the Government set up An Bord Coillte. </P>
    <P>It is important that what is promised be written into legislation.  It is because of those broken promises that the workers in Bord na Móna have such serious reservations about what is now proposed.  I can understand the concern of workers about this system.  At present <Col N="1533" /> the vast majority of workers in Bord na Móna are married and have families. They live ordinary lives and work hard for their wages.  They are paid for a normal working week in which they are obliged to work particular hours.  When the weather is inclement they are sent to do other work in machine workshops such as fixing machines and so on.  If the new system is introduced the burden of seasonality will be borne by the worker.  When profits are made in a good year those profits will go to the company but when there is a bad year, the back that is weakest, that of the worker, will carry the load.  The worker will have to carry the can for whatever losses are incurred.  What I envisage is that many workers will be employed on a temporary or part-time basis.  If the weather is fine they can work 14 hours a day but if it rains and they cannot work they will not be paid one red penny.  What will happen to the wives and families of these people who will be neither working nor drawing unemployment assistance or benefit?</P>
    <P>I can give a similar example.  The Department of Social Welfare are triumphant that so many forestry workers are now being prosecuted for working and drawing the dole.  I know many forestry workers who are working under impossible and difficult conditions in a highly dangerous job.  In order to exist many of them have worked and drawn the dole at the same time.  I am not condoning that but I can understand a married man with a family and who is not able to obtain a living wage occasionally signing on as well.  That is what is happening in the forestry industry at present and it is likely to happen here if this system continues.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you are one who has always taken an active interest in the Irish language.  I am sure you will remember the old storey about the Spailpín Fánach.  It is a long time since I read it in the national school.  It was about a man who was paid for his day but who was hired and sacked at will.  I do not think that kind of thing is good enough or that it is right.  That is the concern that has been expressed to me by the workers and <Col N="1534" /> the people I meet day after day.  They are concerned that that is the kind of future they and their families are facing.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to draw to the attention of the House what will happen under the new HAKU system.  A married man, who is not signing on, will go out to work in bad weather conditions to try to fulfil his contract to Bord na Móna but if the weather is so bad that he is prevented from doing that, he subsequently will be forced to bring his wife out to help him save the peat and in many instances some of his children may be kept from school to help. I thought those days had passed in Ireland but there is a real danger, if this Bill goes through as it is, that there will be a return to such times in the nineties, on the advent of the single European market.  If that is progress it is highly questionable.</P>
    <P>I am from County Offaly, Deputy Flanagan is from County Laois and Deputy Naughten is from Roscommon. When I was growing up there was extreme poverty right across Offaly. Emigration was rife.  The level of poverty people experienced at that time is not fully appreciated.  Bord na Móna and the ESB developed and progress came slowly.  Throughout Offaly, Laois and the midlands generally there has been wonderful progress.  Because of the impetus and the initiative given by Bord na Móna whole communities progressed and our achievements in sport of every type have been obvious at national level.  Many people were involved in small farming and all this helped to develop our area.  I am speaking for the survival of County Offaly and part of County Laois.  I do so because I have seen towns like Ferbane, Cloghan, Kilcormack and Daingean and villages like Clonbullogue, Bracknagh and Walsh Isalnd where the ravages of emigration were worse than John Healy ever dreamt of when he was writing about Charlestown in County Mayo.  The flight of people from our area now has to be seen to be believed.  This will make even worse an already bad situation.  I could go along with this Bill if some safeguards <Col N="1535" /> were written in to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>In this week's edition of the <i>Midland Tribune,</i> dated 25 February 1989, there is an article under the heading, &ldquo;Group Targets Economic Survival&rdquo;.  This is a reference to a new group that have been established.  The chairman, Mr. Ken McDowell of Birr, is reported as saying that the new enterprise plan would dramatically affect the business people in towns and villages in the area and he has calculated that the cumulative cost to business in terms of unemployment and loss of revenue from Bord na Móna purchases could be £12 million per annum. Mr. McDowell went on to say that in 1987 the three works concerned, Boora, Blackwater and Derrinlough, employed 980 permanent workers with an additional 500 during the production season but that under the new proposals this number would be drastically reduced, to less than 100 permanent staff by 1992.</P>
    <P>I can understand the concern of those people and that is why it is important that the Minister for Energy recognises and appreciates just how relevant it is.  I want to have written in here exactly what is envisaged, because a contract system can present great dangers as I have outlined to the House this evening.  I want categoric assurances that the proposed HAKU system will be only 10 per cent this year, that it will be done as an experiment for this year only, that it will then be reviewed and that the remaining 90 per cent will be produced this year as heretofore.  This is both essential and important.</P>
    <P>In 1980 there were 7,100 workers employed by Bord na Móna.  That number has now been reduced to a 2,800 permanent workforce.  I am not certain as to the number of seasonal workers that will be taken on this year, perhaps it will be 1,000, thereby bringing the number employed in the season to 3,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few other items.  I wrote to the Minister for Energy, Deputy Smith, on 4 January stating that the first major problem is the capital <Col N="1536" /> structure of Bord na Móna.  I believe it is a matter of extreme urgency that this is seriously looked at and that Bord na Móna be given some remission on their capital debt, which is crippling the company. Bord na Móna have a capital debt in the region of £160 million.  The banks, when dealing with farmers, shopkeepers and industries, realised it was better to talk to people in difficulties and to restructure their loans, and if necessary to grant them a remission or write off. This ensured that agriculture and industry were kept viable.  It was a commonsense practical approach.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna pay £20 million per annum in PAYE, PRSI and income tax to the Government in addition to a further £20 million interest, a total of £40 million a year going back to the State one way or another.  They have not got one red halfpenny remission.  For Bord na Móna to remain viable and retain the jobs that currently exist, the Government sooner rather than later will have to look at their capital structure and decide on an injection of equity or granting them a remission.  If not, the existing debt could topple the whole of Bord na Móna and that is too serious to contemplate. I would ask the present Government to give this serious consideration, and see whether they can grant some type of aid or remission to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute to the work that Bord na Móna have done.  I believe that the present management are men of vision, energy and initiative, but they need help.  Pious platitudes, economic jargon and theories will be of no benefit unless they get some type of financial assistance to help them overcome the serious problems they are facing.  Bord na Móna have in fact reduced their workforce by 1,200. They have closed a machinery factory and a number of sod turf bogs.  However, in spite of that, they need assistance to get them over the difficulties they are facing at present.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the issue of cutaway bogs.  There is quite a sizeable amount of cutaway bogs right across the <Col N="1537" /> country and Bord na Móna have approximately 200,000 acres of bog overall.  I received a very detailed letter from a number of farmers in my area.  The farmers attached to the Boora farmers committee mentioned that Bord na Móna had acquired their lands compulsorily in the forties and fifties at ten shillings an acre. Whether the farmers wanted to sell or not, the land was taken from them at as little as ten shillings an acre but the price increased later.  I know of one farmer in my time who had 900 acres acquired compulsorily from him at £1 an acre. Some of those farmers should be given the opportunity of leasing the land at the same rate that Bord na Móna leased it to the forestry division of the Department of Energy.  I believe that land is being leased to the forestry division at approximately £16 per acre.  It is only right and proper that the farmers whose land was taken should be given the opportunity to lease some of this land from Bord na Móna.  I call upon Bord na Móna and the Department of Energy to ensure that farmers in the area are given the opportunity of renting those lands.</P>
    <P>Where farmers have land adjoining cutaway bogs, or where they have been employed by Bord na Móna, or are living on uneconomic holdings, it is not beyond the ability of people in this House and in the Department of Energy to devise means whereby they would be given an opportunity to purchase the land.  In many cases they have given their lives to Bord na Móna.  Their lands had been taken from them and now they have holdings adjoining the cutaway bogs.  A means should be sought to give them an opportunity of renting, leasing or buying those lands, or a certain amount of that land at least.  That is only fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of bog land right across the country available at present, but it would be very difficult to put an exact figure on it.  I think the forestry division have leased approximately 7,000 acres.  However, I imagine that there are another 10,000 acres of cutaway bog available as well.  Some of this land should be leased to local farmers <Col N="1538" /> at a rent similar to that paid by the forestry division and some should be sold to farmers in the locality.  I would not be in favour of selling the land in huge tracts because this would only invite people with big bank balances to buy.  However, if it is in small lots, the small farmer who is living with his wife and family in the area will have an opportunity to buy it. Indeed, some of the former Bord na Móna workers might choose to invest their redundancy payments in the bogs where they had been working.</P>
    <P>There are a few more issues that I wish to dwell on.  Section 9 of the Bill deals with the remuneration of officers and servants.  It is important to bear in mind that a number of people have worked in Bord na Móna all their lives and would have contributed to an employees superannuation scheme.  This scheme covered all the staff grades in Bord na Móna including, clerical staff, the accounts section, engineers, the works managers and all other permanent staff who over the years had built up Bord na Móna.  The members of the Bord na Móna general employees' superannuation scheme would have paid 6 to 8 per cent of their wages in superannuation contributions down the years.  They got a pension of one-eightieth of retirement salary for each year of service.  Up until July 1984 these pensioners got their percentage increases just like their worker colleagues but since 1984 there has been no increase in the pensions.  I cannot say exactly what loss they have incurred but I gather that members of this scheme have suffered losses in the region of 35 to 38 per cent because the pension fund could not afford it.  A number of other State pension schemes had this problem but all the companies concerned paid their retired staff and paid the increases.  Bord Na Móna are apparently the only company who have not paid the increases.</P>
    <P>The people who got into bad health working for Bord na Móna are entitled to their pensions and to the increases which were promised.  It is wrong not to pay those increases.  It is natural justice that they should be paid what they were <Col N="1539" /> promised they would be paid, having contributed to superannuation over the years.</P>
    <P>There has been a serious decline in the numbers employed by Bord na Móna across the midlands.  Employment in County Offaly has been seriously affected.  At the end of 1980, 3,383 people were employed in manufacturing industry in County Offaly and at the end of 1988 the figure had fallen to 2,915.  At the end of 1980, 2,258 people were employed by Bord na Móna in County Offaly but by the end of 1988 that figure had reduced to 1,222.  There was a loss of over 1,000 jobs in Bord na Móna alone. At the end of 1980 the ESB employed 545 people in Offaly.  The figure at the end of 1988 was 562.  All in all in an eight year period there has been a drop of over 1,400 jobs in the county, which has a population of 60,000 people.  At the moment, of that population, only 4,700 people are employed in manufacturing industry, in Bord na Móna and in the ESB.  That illustrates how serious is the situation there.  The most urgent attention should be given to the attraction of industry to County Offaly.  This whole area has been heavily dependent on Bord na Móna and the loss of those jobs has had a huge impact on the fabric of social life in the county.  The Government should ensure that County Offaly is especially designated for the attraction of new jobs.  The survival of County Offaly will depend on the provision of alternative industry at the earliest possible opportunity.  I cannot emphasise that enough.  Bord na Móna have been the main employer in the past in this area.</P>
    <P>I am sad that the IDA failed miserably to attract sufficient industries to this area while those jobs were being whittled away year after year.  Now is not the time for recrimination, however, now is the time to take action and to develop.  I want the Government to ensure that County Offaly is provided with alternative industries as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been leasing land for forestry.  The Department of Forestry have a veto over Bord na Móna in section <Col N="1540" /> 7 of this Bill.  That veto should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are required to be in regular contact with the Department of Finance and other Government Departments mentioned in section 2 (6).  That section is too restrictive.  Bord na Móna should be allowed carry out transactions independently up to a sum of, say, £5 million.  Both I and the people in the midlands recognise that change must occur.  Bord na Móna workers and staff realise that change will come but change at all times must reflect the human factors involved so that workers will have the respect and dignity to which they are entitled.  The safeguards I want included in the Bill are important for the employees of Bord na Móna, the people of the midlands and the people of the country as a whole.  A properly based company like Bord na Móna which will produce fuel will be of benefit to everybody in the long term and I have no doubt the company will be viable for the next 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In debating this legislation not alone are we talking about the future direction of Bord na Móna but we are talking also about the future viability of a form of life in the midlands.  Before I make my general comments on the legislation and Bord na Móna, I want to congratulate Deputy Aylward on his appointment as Minister of State.  This is the first opportunity I have had of publicly congratulating him.  I wish him well in this very onerous position, although I am not sure how long he will be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks about Bord na Móna and turf development one is also undoubtedly talking about the lifeblood of the midlands.  If nothing else is said on this legislation, the social and economic decline in the midlands area, particularly in Counties Laois and Offaly, over the past number of years must be highlighted at every opportunity.  This decline can be seen not only in relation to the ESB but also in relation to Bord na Móna.  There are 60,000 people in County Offaly and during the past 12 months, 1,000 workers <Col N="1541" /> have opted for the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme organised by Bord na Móna.  It is well to note that the company's initial target for voluntary redundancy was approximately 500 people but that figure doubled in 12 months.  An indication of the importance of Bord na Móna and turf development to County Offaly can be seen from the statistics which show that 30 per cent of the land in County Offaly and some 10 per cent in County Laois comprises raised bog.  That is the nub of the argument. Before the introduction of the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme almost 2,000 workers in County Offaly and I think 600 workers in County Laois were dependent on the viability of the midland peatlands for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>With regard to the voluntary redundancy scheme, I should like to put on the record my serious concern at the manner in which these people were trained and informed as to how to manage their voluntary redundancy package.  Time and time again at my constituency clinics I hear sad tales about people in County Offaly who rushed to take up the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme because of the number of noughts at the end of the projected figure.  They anticipated getting sums of money which would last them for life but less than 12 months after opting for the scheme they are left with little more than perhaps a new coloured television set, a new video recorder or a secondhand car.  I seriously question the manner in which Bord na Móna prepared these people for managing their redundancy payment.  It would appear that in many cases there was very little preparation in terms of training, advice or planning for the future.  Many of these people were placed on the scrapheap, as it were, and this will have very serious social consequences in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers who opted for the voluntary redundancy scheme, one can see that the core of the workforce &mdash; 700 general operatives, 227 skilled craftworkers, over 80 supervisors and 150 general staff-opted for the scheme.  These people now have very little alternative <Col N="1542" /> other than to sign on for unemployment assistance.  The Government will have to give a certain priority to this area in the immediate months ahead because of the peculiar difficulties there.  Some people in County Offaly have organised a voluntary task force in the light of the unemployment figure of 20 per cent in the county.  Unemployment there is higher than the national average and because of the number who took early retirement in addition to the high rate of unemployment for the past number of years it is not surprising that unemployment in the county is higher than the national average.  The reasons for this go back over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Bord an Móna and the ESB were taken for granted by Governments which believed employment in the midlands was secure as long as there were peat resources in the area and the ESB-Bord na Móna contract was not questioned from an economic point of view.  Of course, all that has changed now. However, leaving aside Bord na Móna and the ESB, there is a very poor record of industrial growth in County Offaly and the county is grossly under-developed from a tourism point of view.  The same number of jobs in the services sector were not attracted to County Offaly as to other areas and because of the reliance on Bord na Móna and the ESB to provide jobs there is now a huge crisis in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that the ESB contract with Bord an Móna is due to be reviewed and that the results of the review will be made public by the end of March.  I should like the Minister to pay very close attention to that review.  A significant number of people in the midlands depend for their livelihood on the contract between the ESB and Bord na Móna.  If the contract is not renewed on exactly the same terms as it has been up to now, the Government will have to take it upon themselves to provide an immediate alternative.  It is not good enough to say &ldquo;This matter can be looked at in the future&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will cross that bridge when we come to it&rdquo;.  I do not wish to go over ground which is not relevant to this legislation but the coal legislation which <Col N="1543" /> was passed last year has given rise to very serious concern throughout the midlands. I hope it has not in any way jeopardised the contract between the ESB and Bord na Móna with regard to the purchase of peat.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the huge debt which has been incurred by Bord na Móna.  It is very important that we look at this debt and at the financial position of the organisation.  I do not think we can talk about protecting employment in the midlands unless we also look at the future of Bord na Móna. The company have certainly served the midlands and the country very well since the forties but they have &mdash; and I believe the board realise this &mdash; reached a crossroads in relation to their finances.  A debt of £165 million is staggering and it has to be tackled.  This debt will not go away and I do not fault Bord na Móna for putting evey alternative on the table when it comes to tackling that very significant problem.  The company accumulated the debt over many years but the fact that they accumulated a debt of £30 million during the past two years underlines the extent of the crisis.  The staggering sum of £20 million interest must be paid annually.  This marvellous company which can provide jobs and act as the hub of the economy in a certain area, has to discharge such a sum to the State on an annual basis.  That is a crippling amount of interest and I am not surprised that Bord na Móna are in such financial difficulties. The bad weather of the mid-eighties brought their problem to a head. Before that they were stumbling on, trying not to accumulate such a large debt, but the very bad summers gave rise to more serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the 1946 legislation and noticing the interest payments that Bord na Móna must make to the State simply because there was no State equity and all the capital of the company was borrowed.  When one looks at the bad summers on the one hand and the element of competition introduced over the past number of years on the other, one sees that Bord na Móna have been <Col N="1544" /> put to the pin of their collar to survive. While the new régime is looking at every alternative, with their more modern, up and running approach, it behoves the Government also to take advantage of every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the National Planning Board's Report. In April 1984, they came forward with a very comprehensive report on the future of the economy.  In a section on State-sponsored commercial bodies, reference was made to the concept of a lame duck, or the viability or otherwise of a State-sponsored body.  The National Planning Board advised that:</P>
    <P>As a first step, an assessment should be made for each State-sponsored commercial body of the size of the capital liabilities that it could be expected to service, taking one year with another, if it were operated at maximum efficiency....  If the assessment shows that a public enterprise .... would be able to service only a part of its present capital liabilities, the remaining part should be written off in its balance sheet.  The servicing of that part of the capital liabilities that were written off the balance sheet would thereafter fall on the Exchequer.  This produce would merely make explicit what would happen in any case.  This would involve no change in the PSBR, but would merely make explicit the cost of debt service which is now hidden in the State-guaranteed borrowings of State-sponsored bodies. The advantage of this procedure is that the public enterprise would be left with an attainable objective, which would allow efficient operators to earn a trading profit at least sufficient to service that part of the capital liabilities for which the enterprise remained responsible. </P>
    <P>In many ways that paragraph is relevant to the present position of Bord na Móna and where exactly Bord na Móna go from here.  There is an onus on the Minister and the Government to seriously tackle the very large debt of Bord na Móna in the manner envisaged by the National <Col N="1545" /> Planning Board in 1984.  I see no other way that Bord na Móna can find themselves back on their feet at an early date without State aid.</P>
    <P>We must look at the NET precedent. There we see parallels with Bord na Móna.  With no disrespect to NET, they did far less in terms of providing employment or ensuring that the social and economic fabric of a great part of the country was maintained than did Bord na Móna since 1946.  Without Bord na Móna, Counties Offaly and Laois would not have been able to boast the growth of towns we saw in the fifties, sixties and seventies.  The people of those counties owe a tremendous debt to Bord na Móna for the manner in which they provided employment, not alone for people in the midland area, but also for the people who migrated to the midlands from the southern and western counties.  Without Bord na Móna that would not have happened. This is an indication of how the entire country has benefited from their operations.</P>
    <P>The problems of Bord na Móna need to be traced by the Government far more realistically than in this Turf Development Bill.  While I welcome it, it is a pretty weak gesture.  I hope it is only part one of legislation on the future of our peat resources and of Bord na Móna.  A stronger case must be made for more Government attention.</P>
    <P>I made reference to this on a number of occasions, but I find it strange that the Minister came forward with this Bill in October 1988 without awaiting the result of his own specially commissioned consultants' report.  Perhaps it was putting the cart before the horse.  I hope the Minister when replying will elaborate why that was done.  What exactly does he foresee happening on the publication of his report later in the year?  As previous speakers have said, we are talking about an overall economic strategy for the midland area.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Bord na Móna cannot be taken in isolation.  They must be looked at in the context of the ESB contract.  The fact that an independent report has estimated the cost of the ESB contract with <Col N="1546" /> Bord na Móna to the consumer to be something in the region of £50 million a year shows the need for immediate Government action.  If the contract is to be renewed, we have this difficulty about the £50 million added to the consumers' bill.  If the contract is not to be renewed, we are talking about the devastation of the entire midlands area.  If the benefit to Counties Laois and Offaly were the sum equal to that being paid by the consumer for a higher rate of electricity &mdash; £50 million &mdash; and if that amount were to be channelled into the economy of both counties, that would be a marvellous alternative.  It would be one way around the difficult problems, or one way of avoiding problems that sooner or later we will have to tackle.  Unless there is a realistic alternative which will not cost jobs, the ESB contract should be renewed.</P>
    <P>When one talks about turf development, one is talking about the development of towns in County Offaly and in other areas of the midlands, towns that over the years have been built around Bord na Móna, towns that are famous for nothing else.  I am talking about Ferbane, Kilcormac, Rhode, Banagher, Cloghan and Portarlington and Mountmellick in County Laois.  These are towns that have been devastated by the difficulties experienced by Bord na Móna and they will experience even more devastation unless the Government pay very close attention to the manner in which Bord na Móna attempt to revolutionise the peat producing process under the glossy guise of &ldquo;turning a genius loose&rdquo;.  I hope that if and when the genius is turned loose he or she can certainly restore &mdash; if not increase &mdash; employment in the midlands. However, from what I have heard today I have my doubts that the genius can do that.</P>
    <P>While this is not major legislation as far as Bord na Móna are concerned, nevertheless it has some very good points and must be welcomed.  The fact that it allows Bord na Móna to acquire companies should not be met with any element of surprise as newspaper reports <Col N="1547" /> commented in detail on certain acquisition proposals by Bord na Móna over the past couple of months.  Therefore, it is no surprise that this power should be given to them.</P>
    <P>It is also high time that consideration was given towards allowing Bord na Móna to engage in activity not strictly related to peat.  I mentioned the bad summers, the huge debt and competition from private enterprise.  It was clear that, because of the finite nature of peat development, a day would come when Bord na Móna would have to expand and diversify.  A number of speakers raised the question of the unnecessary web of bureaucracy that appears to be around certain sections of the Bill in so far as ministerial consent is conerned.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on this.  I notice that to engage in a number of diversifying tactics the board not alone needs the consent of the Minister for Energy but also of the Minister for Finance. Why is it necessary for a board to come cap in hand to two Ministers?  I imagine the Minister for Energy would be in a position to grant or refuse a request which the board might make from time to time.  I cannot see why the consent of two Ministers should be necessary to allow the board to engage in the marketing of products abroad as they have been engaged in marketing for some time.  It certainly should not be necessary to get the consent of two Ministers to allow Bord na Móna to represent us at an exhibition in a European capital.  The Minister may say it will merely be rubber-stamping but the more bureaucracy there is the more difficulties will arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the development of cutaway bogs.  The requirement that An Bord Coillte have a veto in that regard may seem necessary to the Minister but it is a particularly dangerous precedent to set.  The executives in Bord na Móna should not have their hands tied to such an extent that they would have no say in what is to be done with cutaway bogs other than to give them to An Bord Coillte.  That is an insult to the executives in Bord na Móna.  If the cutaway bog will <Col N="1548" /> not be used by Bord na Móna it should be put up for sale or put out to public tender and sold.  Anyone could then purchase it on the open market.  It is unnecessarily restrictive to provide such a veto.</P>
    <P>Another point of extreme importance to the midlands area is the manner in which this veto, if passed in the legislation, would prohibit local farmers and local people generally from making bona fide offers for the land.  It simply will not wash.  If Bord na Móna are to offer land to anybody it must be sold by public tender on the open market.  If local people wish to put the land to economic use they should be allowed to purchase it.  If the Minister is worried about people purchasing a cutaway bog and leaving it dormant I have no doubt that section 12 of the Land Act would cover it.  Farming organisations are perfectly right to criticise this move and I should like to quote from a document produced by the Kildare County Executive of the IFA which puts the matter in a nutshell:</P>
    <P>We suggest that farmers on the periphery who had acres of land taken over by Bord na Móna should have the opportunity of leasing this land back from the board in the vicinity of the home farm.  Bord na Móna would have the responsibility of maintaining the drains over the land and other people should have the opportunity of leasing land from the board who come under the following categories &mdash; qualified farmers in the perimeter areas who are efficiently farming and who would desire to lease the land from Bord na Móna to make a more viable holding for themselves or suitably qualified people who wish to lease the land for farming purposes. </P>
    <P>I hope there will be a rethink in this regard and if the Minister in replying to Second Stage does not indicate his intention to review this matter then we will pursue the matter by way of an amendment on Committee Stage.  The parents of smallholders in many cases had their land compulsorily acquired by Bord na Móna for a pittance.  One need not <Col N="1549" /> go back to the forties or fifties to find instances; it happened in the midlands up to the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>Where land has been acquired under a compulsory purchase order, in the interests of natural justice if the land is to be disposed of by the body who compulsorily acquired it, the person from whom it was acquired, or their successor in title, should be able to bid for it on the open market.  Agriculture in the midlands area has suffered over the past number of years to such an extent that many smallholders would be delighted to have an opportunity to bid and purchase such land.  Given the decrease in the activities of the Land Commission and the fact that Land Commission estates are not coming onstream at the same rate as before, we now have an opportunity to compensate the smallholder in the way it was intended the Land Commission would do.</P>
    <P>I believe the picture is incomplete without the report of the consultant commissioned by the Minister.  There has been much comment on what this report might contain.  The Minister has said that this report will be available at the end of March, and I hope by that time he will be in a position to comment on the speculation that Bord na Móna will be carved up.  Varying and conflicting views have been expressed by members of the Government as to what is going to happen.  I would like the Minister to make his intentions known and to indicate whether he envisages legislation being brought forward to split Bord na Móna into three different companies.  It has been widely reported that one of these companies would be a horticultural products company with the other two being a milled peat company and a solid fuel company.  There would be much merit in such a carve-up but as time goes by the less chance there is of such proposals being brought forward.</P>
    <P>Such a carve-up could not be discussed without also dealing with the very important question of decentralisation.  I have spoken on this issue on a number of occasions and I hope that in any carve-up of the company the new headquarters <Col N="1550" /> of the separate companies would be situated in midland towns.  I could never understand why the head office of Bord na Móna set up in the mid-forties is situated in Dublin.  It should be more properly situated in a midland town where the community would regard Bord na Móna as playing an active role in their daily lives.  I hope such a mistake, and I call it such, would not be repeated in any carve-up and due consideration would be given to the suggestion that the headquarters of each of the companies would be situated in a midland town.  I believe that Bord na Móna employ 1,000 administrative and clerical staff in the Dublin area and I need say nothing about the benefits which would accrue if these people were based in the midlands.</P>
    <P>The contract between the ESB and Bord na Móna is of fundamental importance in this matter.  Bord na Móna supply the ESB with 12 per cent of the raw material they need and this may lead one to believe that Bord na Móna are not particularly important to the ESB.  The ESB, who seek commercial freedom, are quite happy to pass on the extra cost to the consumer.  In any discussion on the future of Bord na Móna we would have to take into account the contract between them and the ESB.  If this contract is not renewed an onus would be placed on the Government to provide alternative funding.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on the way in which Bord na Móna have reorganised themselves.  They have adopted the &ldquo;hard sell&rdquo; approach and public relations techniques have been used to the maximum.  While I welcome the experiment in respect of 10 per cent of the land they own, I hope this will be reviewed at the end of the year and if things are not working out for the benefit of the local economy that this percentage will be reviewed.  I would not like to knock the idea as, given the difficult financial position of the company, it is necessary that every alternative be put on the table.  I hope we will not see the percentage being increased to 50 per cent next year and 100 per cent the following <Col N="1551" /> year.  It must be impressed upon the company that they should take things easy in so far as these revolutionary practices are concerned.</P>
    <P>My main concern is the protection of jobs.  If it requires a continued State involvement to maintain jobs, so be it.  It would be an absolute necessity that jobs be maintained in Bord na Móna.  There is a danger that in their haste and excitement to get this up and running they might not be prepared to consult and negotiate with the workforce.  If Bord na Móna were to attempt to railroad through any quick solution which would be to the benefit of the board but not of the workforce, this would have dire consequences for the economy of the midlands.  There is an obligation both on the trade unions and the board of the company to be as flexible as possible and it would appear that flexibility is the hallmark of the new régime in the company.</P>
    <P>Peat cannot be harvested on a 9 to 5 basis and it is time we accepted this fact. If the sun shines on a Saturday or Sunday during the summer when it is bright until 11 p.m. it is important that Bord na Móna act and do so in the best interests of the company.  If peat has to be harvested in the evening or at 5.30 a.m. or 6 a.m. then so be it.  I do not think the workforce would object to that.  We would be foolish as we approach the nineties and with the coming of the single European market if we were to suggest that peat could only be harvested between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, when more often than not it is raining.  I do not think anyone would be in favour of machines lying idle during fine weekends.</P>
    <P>There are a number of drawbacks with the HAKU enterprise scheme as envisaged by Bord na Móna which have not been referred to as much as they should. These include the probable loss of pension rights and sick benefits.  I hope there will be no weakening in the implementation of safety regulations on the work floor in order to maximise profits.  I hope the Minister will maintain a watchful eye in order to ensure that this does not happen, that the profit motive will not be <Col N="1552" /> taken too far and there is no relaxation in the implementation of safety regulations. The nub of the argument is the local economy, jobs and the future viability of Bord na Móna in the midlands.  When one looks at the manner in which Bord na Móna appear to concentrate on the profit motive one must look at the Constitution which mentions the conflict between the economics and the social aspects of a given enterprise.  I quote from Article 45.2.v: &ldquo;That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable&rdquo;.  Article 45.4.1º states: &ldquo;The State pledges itself to safeguard with special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community&rdquo;.  Those sections of the Constitution are every bit as relevant today as they were in the drafting of Bunreacht na hÉireann and they are particularly apt to a discussion on the future of turf development especially in the midlands.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the Bord na Móna are in a dire financial state and every alternative must be discussed in order to solve their problems, if the social cost is going to be too high we must have a second look at the matter.  I hope these not-often-quoted sections of the Constitution are not forgotten.  The board were founded along these principles in order to provide a lifeline for the smallholders of the midlands as well as to utilise what was then an undeveloped natural resource.  Since then we have seen the briquette and the ESB as the two major roads down which Bord na Móna went.  It is good to see now the board are expanding as we approach the end of the century.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the quotation I am about to give is from the Minister. Perhaps when replying he will tell me:</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna needs not just to restore its core business to profitability but it must diversify into new areas.  It needs to be a little less concerned with what it can produce and more concerned with what it can sell. </P>
    <P>I cannot recall where exactly I got that quotation.  If it is from the Minister it is <Col N="1553" /> a good one and we must bear it in mind as we approach the changes within Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In regard to diversification, Bord na Móna have been experimenting for many years and their research and development unit have come up with some very attractive alternatives as far as anti-pollution is concerned.  We appear to be more and more concerned as a State with anti-pollution matters.  Bord na Móna have now entered into direct negotiations with other private companies about such things as treating septic tank effluent and a research programme into the manner in which peat extracts can be used to offset very bad smells.  I hope the necessary resources will be made available to the board to allow them to diversify into areas that undoubtedly will mean profit not alone from the home market but from the export market.  If we can turn Bord na Móna successfully from energy into an anti-pollution operation over a period of years we may obviate the devastation of the midlands by, say, allowing the ESB not to renew their contract.  If we examine these alternatives we may be in a position to overcome the very serious problems we have in these areas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Bord na Móna research and development unit have come up with devices for extracting ash from fireplaces.  We all know how marvellous a fuel the peat briquette is from a cleanliness point of view as it burns to a fine dust.  The consumer can look forward to something like a vacuum cleaner pioneered by Bord na Móna that will get rid of the deposit from the briquettes. The production of that article should be a very profitable enterprise for the board. I understand too that research and development have produced a fibre additive which can be used in food for human consumption.  Perhaps we have been a little stereotyped in our views about Bord na Móna and turf development.  It seems there is more to peat production than briquettes or electricity.  I hope no resources are spared by Bord na Móna in ensuring that these projects are seen through to the last.</P>
    <P>One cannot talk about diversification <Col N="1554" /> without mentioning the use of the cutaway bogs for fruit and vegetable production. There has been underplay in this in that in the fifties and early sixties Bord na Móna researchers felt that perhaps the cutaway bogs were not suitable for vegetables and fruit.  Advances have been made in this regard in the past few years. For instance, a blueberry farm in County Laois is exporting blueberries to Britain. I am sure Bord na Móna can expand upon this aspect of horticulture.  Research and development have revealed a type of potato which is not suitable for production in stony soil and needs softer, peatier soil, and Bord na Móna land is particularly suitable for it.  That is another example of diversification as envisaged by the Bill for Bord an Móna.</P>
    <P>The midlands are not noted for tourism nor for their tourist attractions.  However, the peatlands there are unique in western Europe and perhaps there is tremendous scope there for conserving a portion of the bogs as an amenity.  If Bord na Móna own lands and are to continue in their ownership of them, they might consider conserving for amenity purposes some of the core peatland in the midlands.  The idea of cultural tourism is just developing in western Europe.  With greater freedom of movement and the European ideal of integration, there is increasing interaction between European countries.  Were we to pioneer our cultural tourism from that point of view we could open up many exciting ventures.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me refer to smog control. You need not look to me, a Cheann Comhairle, for further information on that.  Everybody in this House and outside is well aware of the serious difficulties from smog.  The answer may well lie in the humble peat briquette.  It is purely Irish.  We do not need to import any part of it.  Its smoke emission is 70 per cent less than that of either English of Polish coal and one need not buy any gadget or adapt one's fireplace or back boiler to burn the peat briquette.  With proper marketing techniques and selling there is great potential for the peat briquette, and Bord na Móna could well <Col N="1555" /> go down the road of increasing production of it.  I am glad that certain areas of Dublin have included the peat briquette among the designated fuels and I am sure we are moving in the direction of expanding rather than restricting the smokeless zone areas.  I hope Bord na Móna would take the opportunity and expand accordingly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, however weak it is.  It does little to address the very serious socio-economic problems of the midlands or the serious finaicial problems of Bord na Móna.  However, I welcome the decision to allow the board to diversify and engage in activities other than direct peat production.  I await with a certain confidence the report by the ministerial consultants, which I believe will represent more of a watershed for Bord na Móna than this Bill.  I also await with interest the result of the negotiations between the board and the ESB on the contract renewal.  That will have very serious consequences for the midlands. This legislation is just a stepping stone towards reforming Bord na Móna to ensure the economic viability of the midlands, particularly County Offaly where we have seen the loss of 1,000 jobs last year in Bord na Móna.  This is a county of 60,000 people and such a loss is equivalent to the loss of 20,000 jobs in Dublin, which would cause an outcry.  We are sitting on a social timebomb.  Many families will be devastated unless the rot stops in Bord na Móna.  There is plenty of turf to be harvested and many uses to which the cutaway bog can be put.  There is no reason why jobs should be shed in the manner which has been projected.  This legislation does not go far to allay my fears.  It represents the tip of the iceberg in regard to solving the problems of Bord na Móna.  I hope the Minister will tackle the matter in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Smith on his appointment as Minister for Energy and wish him good luck.  I welcome the minor changes introduced by this Bill but I am somewhat confused as to the reason for introducing it in the <Col N="1556" /> absence of the consultants' report. Members would have a better opportunity of discussing the Bill if they had the advantage of seeing that report.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends somewhat the powers of Bord na Móna and the Minister has pointed out some of the changes envisaged. I welcome those changes because it is important to give the board every opportunity to develop to their full potential. Since Bord na Móna were established in 1946 they have done a tremendous job in rural Ireland.  Deputies Flanagan and Enright have already referred to development in the midland counties of Laois, Roscommon, Longford and other counties.  We are all aware of the employment they gave over many years and the drainage and other improvement works carried out on farms adjoining the bogs.  We all appreciate the important contribution made by Bord na Móna to the rural areas.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna must, however, change with the times and adapt to new technology. Some three years ago in this House I was extremely critical of Bord na Móna for not being more progressive. During a discussion on the development of a briquette factory at Ballyforan I said I did not believe we would be discussing the matter if Bord na Móna had introduced new technology, new methods of production and management.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes envisaged by the board.  They have no option but to introduce new technology but this must be done in a carefully planned and co-ordinated way so as to have the minimum detrimental impact on the counties where Bord na Móna have major ongoing developments.  We must always recognise that Bord na Móna are engaged in an outdoor industry.  In three of the past four years they have encountered major weather difficulties which have put tremendous pressure on their financial structures and their potential for development and employment.  There have also been major problems with regard to the price of their commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot ignore the financial structures of the board.  I appeal to the Government and the Minister to examine <Col N="1557" /> the possibility of reducing the borrowings of Bord na Móna by way of capitalisation. It is absolutely impossible for the board to meet their repayments, particularly in view of the effect of the adverse weather conditions to which I have referred.  In the early eighties they employed up to 7,000 people but employment has now dropped to about 3,000 people.  There were 1,200 redundancies last year, many of them in my own constituency, particularly in the Tarmonbarry area and to a lesser degree in south Roscommon. Many of the people who became redundant will never work again.  That is a fact of life because there are no job opportunities available in the midland counties. Indeed it is more likely they will be working in Britain than in Roscommon or the midlands.  The fact that Bord na Móna pay upwards of £20 million in interest charges annually is something the Minister and the board must bear in mind when examining the overall financial structure of the board.  These are all issues which affect the development of the board and its production opportunities.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that Bord na Móna could contribute enormously to the reduction of smog in this city by the promotion of their peat briquettes.  There is far too much coal imported and burned in this country.  There could be much greater usage of peat briquettes through incentives and encouragement.  There is no question about the cleanliness of the fuel or the desirability of increasing its usage, which, I have no doubt, would considerably reduce the incidence of smog in this city.  Generally I should like to see the Government encourage greater usage of peat briquettes in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to the different developmental aspects in which Bord na Móna envisage engaging in future years.  One such is the further development of peat moss because we all recognise the success of its development to date.  I should like to see its production augmented because it has enormous export potential.  We must encourage Bord na Móna to continue its production, and also products for horticultural use, <Col N="1558" /> encouraging their marketing.  Bord na Móna, just as other semi-State bodies, were more concerned in the past with producing a commodity rather than marketing it.  It is important that they realise there is no point in producing a product if it cannot be marketed.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in recent months about our cutaway bogs.  I regret that the present Government have taken these bogs from Bord na Móna and handed them over to the new forestry board.  In my view that constitutes a retrograde step.  I am puzzled at this decision because it would appear from all of the Government statements prior to the last General Election they believed then that Bord na Móna were the most competent people to develop and utilise those cutaway bogs in the national interest.  I contend that Bord na Móna are the most competent people to determine when the productive life of a bog has ceased with regard to peat so that it can be converted to forestry, horticultural or agricultural production purposes.  It was a pity that the major project submitted to the Minister's predecessor for the Ballyforan area with the potential of 2,200 jobs on timber production was not implemented.  I know that Bord na Móna submitted the plans of that project to the Minister's Department in May 1987.  It is regrettable the Government did not extend the power of Bord na Móna into timber processing, allowing them to develop cutaway bogs.</P>
    <P>The point has been made also that perhaps, more correctly, those cutaway bogs should be handed back to the people who donated them to Bord an Móna for nominal sums some 30 or 40 years ago. Many of those bogs were bought for as little as ten shillings per acre.  Those in my area fetched somewhat more, in the region of £10 per acre.  Bord na Móna took over bog in my possession, moved in and ploughed it, neither paying for it nor giving me alternative bog.  They left it lying idle useless for myself and my neighbours; these formed part of the Derrinafad bogs.  Those bogs were given to Bord na Móna with a view to their creating employment in the midlands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> That happened in some regions but in others, like mine, it did not.  If those bogs are now to be transferred to the forestry authority perhaps those farmers whose bogs were taken from them should be given an opportunity of buying them back.  Many such farmers have no other means of increasing the size of their holdings and, if they could get ten acres of cutaway bog, it would be of enormous benefit to them, particularly those located adjacent to them.  I would ask the Minister to examine that possibility, if not repurchasing them then leasing them, helping them build up their holdings and providing a livelihood for their families. It must be remembered that the overall area in cutaway bogs is of the order of 3,700 hectares, a sizeable proportion of which should revert to the farming community from whom it first emanated.</P>
    <P>There are other major changes being suggested by Bord na Móna at present with regard to privatisation and a conversion of the HAKU system under which people will harvest the peat and develop the bogs with their own machinery. It is envisaged that in the coming year some 10 per cent of production will be harvested by this method.  I am not against privatisation as such but we would need to be careful about where we are going in this respect.  I should not like to see the time arrive when people would buy machinery for large amounts of money, then find they cannot put it to use during a wet summer, which would mean that, within a few fine days, they would have to work 24 hours to recoup their costs.  We cannot ignore the fact that three out of the last four summers were very bad, rendering it impossible for Bord na Móna or anybody else to harvest peat.  Privatisation in a bad summer will not render that harvesting any easier.  On the contrary, it may create problems for many families who heretofore were employees of Bord na Móna with pensions, who, if they convert to privatisation, will lose their sick benefit and pension rights.  I would appeal for caution and implore Bord na Móna and the unions to examine this aspect very carefully.  We <Col N="1560" /> are told that this will be done on a trial basis for one year.  I would not wish to see Bord na Móna employees being asked to take a substantial reduction in their income as a result of privatisation.  I appeal for caution and the adoption of a realistic approach.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that 60 per cent of the output of Bord na Móna is sold to the ESB in the form of milled peat.  That represents a huge percentage of the output of the company and one can see from that how dependent Bord na Móna are on the ESB as a customer. It is only right that the ESB should purchase as much milled peat as possible from Bord na Móna because it is a home produced product and they are getting it at first cost.  The industry gives valuable employment in the midland counties and we should insist on the ESB using the maximum amount of milled peat.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 state that if the board want to get involved in new activities they must obtain the sanction of the Ministers for Energy and Finance.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine that provision because I do not think it should be necessary to get the sanction of the two Ministers. I accept that a State body should be answerable to a Minister but I do not think the sanction of two Ministers should be required if the company intend embarking on new ventures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to extend the powers of Bord na Móna but it is a pity the Bill is being introduced before the publication of the consultants' report.  It would be remiss of me in the course of a debate on Bord na Móna if I did not refer to what has been described as the Ballyforan project.  Bord na Móna spent upwards of £14 million on drainage work, building railways, roadways and bridges on the borders of Roscommon and Galway and in 1982 laid the foundation stone for a briquette factory.  I understand the proposal was never given board approval.  The general manager started off the second election campaign of 1982 in that area by laying the foundation stone for the new factory.  In 1983 Bord na Móna informed the Government that they did not wish to proceed with the <Col N="1561" /> project because they did not think they would be able to sell the output from the new factory.  Indeed, had the project gone ahead there is no doubt but that Bord na Móna would be bankrupt today.</P>
    <P>Many promises were made during that election campaign and I should like to remind the Minister for Energy that the present EC Agriculture Commissioner, the present Minister for Finance, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Health gave a commitment in 1984 that on a change of Government the briquette factory would be built at Ballyforan.  We are as near to building a factory there today as we were then.  However, today Government members are making the case I made in 1984.  I pointed out that the reason the Ballyforan project was not going ahead was because the board of Bord na Móna did not consider it viable.  Politicians who visited the area at the time were very free with their promises but in Government they have not done anything about building a factory there.  On the contrary, their statements are similar to those I made in 1984.</P>
    <P>It is a pity those politicians gave such misleading information.  All politicians were aware in 1984 that the project was not viable but some deliberately misled and deceived the people of the area at a public meeting in Ballyforan.  It is a pity that politics should slump so low.  I have no doubt that those who attended that meeting were aware that what they were saying was not true.  I should like to ask the Minister to outline the plans for Ballyforan. The number of people working there has dropped and the milled peat from Ballyforan is transported to Lanesboro' or Shannonbridge.  The people employed there, and those who had expected to get jobs, would like a statement on the future of Ballyforan.  Is it envisaged that production will continue and that peat will be transported to Lanesboro' and Shannonbridge or is it intended to close down the factory?  Bord na Móna, and the Minister, are obliged to give answers to those questions.  When Bord na Móna commenced development <Col N="1562" /> in that district they ripped up acres of forestry, closed down a grassmeal factory which employed 40 people and closed down the forestry works which gave valuable employment but half-way through the development of the bogs they pulled out.  That was crazy.  I appeal to the Minister to outline the proposals for Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister and I hope that between now and Committee Stage he will take into consideration the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith) Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for their considered and wide-ranging contributions to the debate on this important legislation.</P>
      <P>It was clear from the debate that there is a general recognition in the House that Bord na Móna must restructure and rationalise their operations in a way that will secure a viable commercial future for the board and that a new legislative base is needed to allow the board to tackle the challenges facing them.  Having said that, quite differing views were expressed on how the necessary revitalisation can best be effected.  While it is not possible to deal with all points put forward, I will be addressing the major issues raised by Deputies.  I said at the start of this debate, which was some time ago now, that I had received proposals for amendments to the Bill from Bord na Móna and that I would be considering the board's proposals sympathetically.  I should say at this stage that, having examined those proposals and having taken note of some of the points made during the debate, I will be bringing forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  These amendments should allay specific concerns expressed by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much comment has been made on the timing of this Bill.  The important point to emphasise is that the purpose of the Bill is to give Bord na Móna flexibility in deciding on how to reorganise their activities and exploit new business opportunities. The board, in the course of their planning for future development and <Col N="1563" /> organisation, in order to return to profitability, asked that they be given certain powers.  I agreed to do so, to provide ways forward.  Under the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> State companies are being encouraged to actively pursue proposals that could generate employment.  In order to facilitate Bord na Móna to respond in a positive way and to further develop and diversify their operations in an economic way, we understand that new legislation was necessary to achieve results.  For this reason the Government undertook to bring forward such legislation at the earliest opportunity.  The provisions included in the Bill will enable the board to further develop their peat related business, to engage in other activities in which they have a particular expertise, to take part in and acquire companies to assist and further such developments, to enter into joint ventures, to develop consultancy and advisory services and to exploit cutaway bogs.  The Government are committed to the future of Bord na Móna and want the board to avail of worthwhile development opportunities.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have queried the introduction of the Bill in advance of consideration of the consultants' report on Bord na Móna's activities.  In fact, I see these two exercises as complementary. It was not necessary and, indeed, it would have lost valuable time to delay.  It would have unnecessarily added to the unease and uncertainty of the regions, and of the board's workers. There was no reason to do that.  This Bill is intended to provide a broad legislative framework under which Bord na Móna can operate in the future.  The board's remit is being significantly extended.  This will provide a basis for selecting particular structures and strategies for the future.  Since the debate started the consultants have completed their study.  I have now received a copy of their report. I will be giving detailed consideration to its findings.  The consultants' findings will then be discussed with Bord na Móna. At this stage, I can assure the House that <Col N="1564" /> there is no conflict between the consultants' findings and the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>The board have taken a number of initiatives directed at reducing costs and I have welcomed the constructive approach adopted by all parties in this effort.  However, it is only right and proper that fundamental decisions on the board's future should not be taken until after the consultants' report has been examined.</P>
    <P>During the debate Deputies alluded to a range of issues, which are being addressed by the consultancy study. These include the organisation of the board's activities, future markets for the board's products and sales of peat to the ESB.  I can assure Deputies that I fully appreciate the importance of these issues.  They will be given detailed consideration in the light of the consultants' findings.  I will say that the board have increasingly recognised the need to improve their marketing performance but I agree that considerable progress remains to be made.  The board must respond vigorously to the strong price competition from other energy fuels on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>Peat is a low sulphur dioxide product and this native fuel has a significant part to play in resolving the smog problem in urban areas.  As mentioned by Deputy Spring, Bord na Móna did undertake extensive investigation on emissions from various fuels in a number of appliances. Independent tests were also carried out to British Standard Specification at the Coal Research Establishment in the UK. This analysis pointed to the advantages of peat products, such as low smoke and low sulphur content fuels.  This was acknowledged by the Minister for the Environment when declaring Bord na Móna peat briquettes to be an &ldquo;authorised fuel&rdquo; for the purpose of the Special Control Area (Ballyfermot) Order, 1988.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring wondered about the potential for developing markets abroad. Horticultural peat products is an area where I see significant scope for expansion. The board have already secured markets in 27 countries, with the bulk being exported to the UK.  I would expect <Col N="1565" /> to see the board making further inroads into European markets with this product range.  As Deputies are aware, Bord na Móna have recently acquired the French company, Pouget Solami.  This company mixes and distributes a wide range of peat-based compost to the professional grower industry throughout France.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have said that the exercise of the powers included in the Bill are subject to too much ministerial control. Bord na Móna also asked that the level of ministerial control on their powers outside the State be relaxed.  I have looked again at the relevant provisions and I will be proposing amendments in this area.  It is proposed to remove ministerial control on the powers outside the State where these powers relate to routine, day to day activities.  Most of these powers are exercised abroad in the context of the board's marketing activity.  The approach adopted in relation to ministerial control in the Bill is, I believe, the correct and prudent one, i.e. that non-peat related activities should be subject to the approval of the Minister.  In my view, this approach strikes the best balance between commercial freedom for the board and the need to ensure that investments pay their way.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate that the objective of the Bill is to enable Bord na Móna to improve their core business and to diversify where it is profitable to do so.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to amend section 8 (a) (e) of the Bill to clarify that peat related research will not be subject to ministerial control.  As pointed out by Deputy Bruton, Bord na Móna can, under their 1946 Act, engage in peat research without ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future use of bogs which are no longer suitable for peat production, the board have responded positively to the Government's decision of July 1987, in handing over all suitable land for forestry to Coillte Teoranta.  This process is continuing and will assist in providing replacement employment as peat deposits in individual bogs are depleted.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputies that the Government decision to earmark 50 per <Col N="1566" /> cent of the cutaway for forestry was taken with employment in mind for the region and the suitability of the timber crop for this land and the prospect of economic viability.  That use and that proportion of use enjoys the support of the vast majority of experts who have considered all the features and aspects of the cutaway areas.  Bord na Móna itself was party to such studies, and, I feel certain, would not dissent.  Amenity use is seen and widely accepted as the appropriate use of a further 30 per cent of these cutaway areas. I can understand there is a wide concern that there are certain areas, 10-15 per cent or thereabouts, where greater potential use in farming and horticulture is thought possible.  I say &ldquo;thought possible&rdquo; because while in practical terms some test results on the grassland and livestock production have been excellent and have proved the farming value, the financial results would need major improvement before I would be satisfied with them.  I have little doubt that such improved financial results could be possible but clearly changes would be required.  I will consider carefully the views put to me.</P>
    <P>I have also received representations about this provision in the Bill from other groups outside this House and while I do not anticipate any great difficulties in relation to the allocation of such bogs for forestry or other uses, I propose to amend the Bill to provide that I will act as final arbiter in the event of any disagreement between Bord na Móna and Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked about the use of cutaway bogs for biomass.  A five year biomass demonstration project was undertaken in the early eighties.  A variety of three types were planted at different locations on 350 hectares of cutaway. The project was terminated in April 1984.  While I would not rule out further work in this area, I have to say that the results of the demonstration project were not encouraging.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputies that the whole aim of this Bill is progressive; it is to reorganise, to streamline, to identify the products in the core peat business which <Col N="1567" /> pay best so that these can be expanded, to improve the cost structure by every means, in particular, increased productivity, and to step up marketing so that volume and price targets can be achieved and maintained.  In addition, the Bill empowers other peat related developments and the entry to other product lines, in which the board have acquired an expertise or have a potential expertise.  I have taken up the challenge of the board and their management &mdash; they told me they can do these things &mdash; so that the entire business can progress to a strong, viable business, holding their employees and, better still, increasing jobs for the region.  I ask Deputies to contrast this with the alternative of inaction.</P>
    <P>Rival energy such as oil and coal have become and could become even more competitive.  Market share has to be fought for.  Consumer choices and preferences have to be met.  Prices must be attractive.  Financial charges, much of it trailing back into earlier development years, must be defrayed.  The heavy damage of two of the worst years of harvesting weather must be repaired.  These are the realities and the present fresh starting points.  The measures which this Bill empowers, and the management initiatives which are being planned, must be pursued.  Not to do so could have no other result than to rob the board of their self-respect and the workers of their dignity.</P>
    <P>Deputies have talked about the socio-economic objectives and warned against abandoning the social element in this.  I can give full assurance on this.  The present Government, and previous Fianna Fáil Governments, sustained and promoted the development of Irish bogs through Bord na Móna, and did so even when for considerable periods energy from peat was not, and could not have been expected to be, competitive with oil, for example.  But I am certain that there is no Deputy in the House who does not want to see economic viability pursued to the optimum.  That way both social and economic objectives stand the greatest <Col N="1568" /> chance of realisation.  It is that view which I ask you to support.  It is on this basis that I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of marine search and rescue services generally has come to our attention tragically again in the light of a disaster yesterday when the <i>Secil Angola</i> went down 200 miles off the coast of County Donegal with the loss, I understand, of 17 lives &mdash; the whole crew. That incident is the latest in a succession of incidents that have taken place off our coast.  Looking at some of the things that happened, we can see some of the directions in which we should be heading for the future.</P>
      <P>It seems the vessel sank at about 7.25 a.m. yesterday morning, over five hours after the first distress call had been sent out.  When that distress call was received and relayed by the radio centres, the Royal Air Force scrambled a reconnaissance aircraft, a Nimrod, from a base in Scotland, and two American aircraft, a c.130 aircraft and a helicopter, went from Valley in Wales to the scene.  The helicopter was operating at very long range and had to be refulled in flight from the Hercules aircraft.  The British RAF also sent two Sea King helicopters from Broadie in Wales.  They were operating at the limit of their range and had very little opportunity to stay at the scene of the incident.  I understand that those two aircraft are not equipped for refuelling in flight from the only aircraft that was available to do this.</P>
      <P>A helicopter based in Ireland on our west coast would have been at the scene of the incident some two hours earlier and those two hours could have made all the difference to the crew on that vessel. As I have said, there have been many other incidents, including some nearer to our coast than yesterday's, where valuable time was lost by the fact that the only suitable helicopters available had first to fly all the way across Ireland in order to get to the scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has not changed much. It certainly has not changed at all in the last two years as far as the response to incidents of that kind is concerned.  I will admit that the Government have not been totally inactive in this.  They have done two things.  The first is that last week, on 16 February, the Minister for <Col N="1570" /> Defence announced that he was carrying out some upgrading of equipment at Finner Camp to enable search and rescue helicopters to operate at that location. He said the new equipment to be purchased includes obstruction and approach lighting and dual distance measuring equipment.  That is welcome and was obviously needed but I would have to say &mdash; and I am not carping at this &mdash; that the Minister, in making that statement, was gilding the lily more than a little because that equipment is needed at Finner Camp anyway in order to give the Air Corps the ability to conduct operations there at what the Minister has called military high risk operation standard, visibility of 800 metres or more, cloud base 50 feet or above.  That is something that needed to be done anyway. While it is a welcome step in improving search and rescue services it was not undertaken, and it cannot be pretended that it was undertaken, primarily as a move in the direction of improving the service.</P>
    <P>On the same day, 16 February, the Minister for the Marine issued a press statement under the heading &ldquo;Department of the Marine.  Daly Announces High Powered Group to Review Air Sea Rescue Services&rdquo;.  The Minister announced that he had established a group of national and international experts to review air-sea rescue services and listed the names of the persons involved.  I am quite sure that all of those persons are expert and dedicated persons in their field.  I know a number of them and I know that is the case, but we do not need a committee.  The Minister, the Minister for Defence or the House does not need a committee to decide what needs to be done in order to revamp or upgrade our search and rescue services to meet the need that is there off our west coast.  With the greatest of respect to the people on that committee, I would have to say that in the case of most of them, their advice would be readily available to the Government anyway without going to the trouble of setting up a committee. I can see that move only as being another long-fingered exercise in relation to the <Col N="1571" /> development of search and rescue services.</P>
    <P>We need to rethink our approach.  We need to look at what the real need is, as I have said, and decide what steps we can take to meet that need.  I do not think it would be right for me to pretend that we can do it all in one go.  I do not believe that is the case and I do not intend to try to deceive anybody into believing that it is the case, but the direction we have to go in is very clear.  The need is to have a capacity on the western coast to conduct both short range and long range search and rescue operations.  We need a capacity on the west coast to conduct long range and short range operations that can actually pluck people off vessels at sea or out of the sea.</P>
    <P>That means we need a helicopter capacity that we do not now have.  We have a short range capacity although there are limitations on that.  The Dauphin helicopters are an enormous improvement on the equipment that had previously been available to the Air Corps.  They can operate at relatively short ranges over the sea.  They can operate on and off at least one of our naval vessels.  In that regard they are an improvement on what was available before but there is a limited series of duties they can undertake, even more limited by the fact that for an operation further out from the coast we need to have both the naval vessel and the helicopter in place at the same time.  It is very clear that we need a long range heavy lift capability also.  It would not take a very large vessel to exceed the capacity of the Dauphin helicopters to rescue the crew.</P>
    <P>The steps we need to take are clear. We need to do five different things.  First, we need to revamp the equipment and the operations of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre so that it can stay in constant touch with all the rescue services and so that all the units of the rescue services at the scene of an incident can communicate directly both with the MRCC and with each other.  Secondly, we need to locate the current Dauphin helicopters at a new base, at Shannon, <Col N="1572" /> with aircraft being detached on rotation to Finner in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken an examination of what that would mean.  Some time ago in my own party we carried out a small experiment.  We hired a helicopter to make a trip from Shannon to Inishmore to the Regional Hospital in Galway and back to Shannon.  Having done that I can tell the House that that operation, starting off from Shannon, saved an hour and a half compared with the time that would have been taken by a helicopter leaving from Dublin.  It saved about four hours compared with the time that would have been required for a helicopter to come from England or Wales.  That hour and a half compared with basing the aircraft in Dublin or the four hours compared with the use of aircraft based in England and Wales could be the crucial time that would allow us to save lives that would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>We need also, as an immediate step, to enter into a contractual arrangement with a private sector operator to provide a long range high capacity helicopter equipped for search and rescue missions. I am quite sure that the Minister and the Minister for Defence know pertectly well that there are many precedents for this kind of service.  I am informed that there are at least two firms that would be willing to enter into that kind of arrangement with our Government here.  That would add immeasurably to our ability to deal with incidents off our west coast.  We should then decide to monitor the operation of the search and rescue services over a period with a view to determining the permanent acquisition of long range search and rescue helicopter capacity.  I have no doubt, a Cheann Comhairle, that our Air Corps, who are doing an extremely good job with the limited equipment they have, would be capable of developing to the point where they could acquire the skills and the abilities necessary to mount that kind of operation.</P>
    <P>Finally we should put in place, in conjunction with the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and the search and rescue services, a network of on-call <Col N="1573" /> doctors around the coast, including doctors in coastal hospitals and general practitioners.  There is a gap in our services that is not very difficult to fill once we have identified the gap.  I would recommend that action to fill that gap be undertaken immediately.</P>
    <P>It has been quite some time since this debate started and not so long ago, indeed, some months ago, a group called the West Coast Search and Rescue and Action Committee produced a very comprehensive report on this subject.  To a very large extent the recommendations I have made here are based on recommendations that are made in that report. There is no mystery about what we should do and how we should do it.</P>
    <P>During Question Time in this House on 16 March 1988 &mdash; Official Report, column 366 &mdash; my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, asked the Minister for Defence if he intended to place one of the new rescue helicopters in the western area of the country.  The Minister gave what I would have to call a stonewalling answer and talked about the extra resources that would be needed to make that possible.  In my view he exaggerated the need for extra resources because I do not believe the need would be as great as the Minister for Defence suggested if we were to locate the helicopters at Shannon and make the provision which has been started on at Finner and possibly at the airport beside Galway into useable staging posts.  I recognise that some extra resources would be required.  The question that was then put to the Minister for Defence, and which I put again tonight, is simply this.  We know there is a plan to decentralise a part of the Department of Defence to Galway.  I know this Government are keen on decentralisation.  It is very good for the towns and cities to which parts of Departments are decentralised and obviously it gives a lift to the local economy in those areas but it does not add anything to the total national cake because we still have the same number of people at work.  It would seem legitimate to ask where our priorities lie in relation to the general expenditure of the Department of Defence.  It will cost <Col N="1574" /> money to decentralise some part of that Department.  I suggest, given the crying need we have for adequate search and rescue coverage on our west coast, that we should give that a higher priority than the simple transfer of civil servants from Dublin to Galway.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister for the Marine, although he may feel a little reticent in expressing a view on another Department, to reflect on that and to consider whether we would not be doing a better job for our own seafaring people, for people who use the ocean to the west and who fly over the ocean to the west, by giving a higher priority to filling in the gaps in our search and rescue services than by moving civil servants, I do not intend any disrespect to the people who are moving.  The Minister must know that if you look at any representation of where our search and rescue services are located and superimpose on that any kind of pictorial history of where the incidents happened, the place where we have a big weakness is all down the west coast.  It is there we need to put resources.</P>
    <P>My request to the Government is to rethink their position on this issue, to move away from what seems to be a very conservative reaction that takes no account of the need which exists for the service and to take on board the five suggestions I have made.  That can all be done within the compass of the resources we have at the moment.  They would be doing a worthwhile job for the people of our west coast, for the people of our islands and for people who fly over or sail on the seas to the west of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise Deputy Harte that some four minutes now remain of the time allotted to Deputy Dukes and his parliamentary colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument has been made for the need to have an air-sea rescue service on the west coast.  I do not think I should go into the detail of that again.  Recently an American lost his life because we were not able to respond fast enough to his radio call for help.  I could spend the night talking about the tragedies <Col N="1575" /> of fishermen in County Donegal. The most appalling was that of a young boy who jumped off a boat which was on a rock in an attempt to push it away.  He stood on the rock and waited for four hours to be rescued but as the tide was rising he lost his life.  That was all because we do not have proper air-sea rescue arrangements.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that I generally believe this Government do not have the money to provide the type of service we require.  It may be that the taxpayers in Ireland do not have the ability to put up that kind of money.  That may be the argument the Government will put forward but responsibility for air-sea rescue is such that it is no longer confined to the fishermen of the west coast or to the Irish aircraft or sea vessels.  It is an international responsibility and it should be Europeanised.  We are now part of the European Community and the Community should accept its responsibility and recognise that we, a small nation, need money to back up the type of services the leader of my party has outlined.</P>
      <P>There are different ways of dealing with the issue; the problems are not insurmountable. If we have a commitment, we can do it. The arguments have been put forward by groups on the west coast who are agitating for a better air-sea rescue service.  The members cross all the political divides and there is no political dimension to their campaign.  They see that this matter is crying out for attention by the Government.  Everything has been crystallised by the litany of tragedies along the coast from the south to the north &mdash; we can no longer ignore this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Government to say that they do not have the resources for an air-sea rescue is not acceptable or an excuse for not doing anything about it.  I implore the Minister to look at the matter afresh, and to consider the arguments put forward by Deputy Dukes.  There are grounds for reconsidering the Government's present position and in the interests of everybody who goes to sea in ships, or indeed in <Col N="1576" /> planes crossing the Atlantic, there is an obligation on us to do something about air-sea rescue.  If the Government do not have the money, I ask the Minister to ask the European Community to understand the very heavy responsibility on this nation for air-sea rescue off our coast because it is not just a matter of looking after our fishermen or the inhabitants of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate everything that Deputy Dukes said in the five points he put forward for the Minister to consider, the first being the revamping of the communication services of the marine rescue service in Shannon so that they could act as a co-ordinating force.  This is vitally important because in many instances there is a need for medical advice to be given from the shore and it is important that the advice be readily available to the people in difficulties at sea.  There is also a need to upgrade the VHF radio system.  There are parts of the west coast, between Ballinrobe and west Clare and along the south-east coast which do not have that system.  This should be considered in the overall revamping of the radio system.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is very important that the Minister would ensure that the trawlers are examined every year rather than when they are just first purchased to ensure that they have the proper facilities on board to make contact with the shore.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes has said, we are asking the Minister to redeploy resources that are available to Government.  The facilities and the resources are there but it is a matter of political will to do something about the matter.  If this House fails to act and people lose their lives because of some bureaucratic tangle between the Department of Defence and the Department of the Marine and the setting up of a further committee, what consolation is that to the family in County Donegal or in Counties Galway and Kerry, or indeed in Spain who lose a father or a brother? We have a responsibility to face the problem. The resources are available and it is only a matter of a Government decision to deploy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very wide issue and it is very difficult to give an adequate reply in the space of the few minutes that are available to me.  I am glad to have this opportunity to put on record the facts in relation to the overall search and rescue service.  In recent times there has been misapprehension about the service and its capacity and ability to deal effectively with the crises we have had in recent times and may have in the future.</P>
      <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordinating Centre at Shannon is responsible for the reception and dissemination of information relating to maritime distress signals operating in the sea areas covered by the centre and for the co-ordination of marine rescue measures in these areas. The centre at Shannon operates on a 24-hour basis.  I would now like to reply to the first point raised by the Leader of the Opposition and wish to state that we have already indicated our intention to revamp the equipment in the Marine Rescue Co-ordinating Centre in Shannon and that work is already under way.</P>
      <P>The system of marine search and rescue in the State involves a number of agencies, including the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the coast lifesaving service, the coast radio stations, the port authorities, the Garda Síochána and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  The Marine Rescue Co-ordinating Centre can also ask for assistance from the British Navy, the Royal Air Force and the British Coastguard Service.  In addition, shipping in the vicinity of a casualty in a position to assist can be called upon by the centre in Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has an understanding with the UK in search and rescue matters, and they provide us with search and rescue helicopters and aircraft to carry out missions over waters within our area of responsibility, that is the Shannon Flight Information region.  On the west coast, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution have four long-range lifeboat stations at Aranmore in County Donegal, Galway Bay, Valentia and in Baltimore, County Cork.  The effective range of these four stations has been doubled in recent years <Col N="1578" /> by the installation of fast modern craft. Last November the institution decided to establish a new station in Ballyglass, County Mayo, and has placed a 52 foot lifeboat there.  With this new station the entire west coast will have lifeboat coverage up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>Two inshore stations at Lough Swilly and Clifden have also been established. Fifteen coast lifesaving service stations are located on the west coast, from Waterville on the south-west to Greencastle in the north-west and all these stations have been progressively modernised in recent times.  A programme has been undertaken that will provide each station with up-to-date rescue and communications equipment and volunteers trained in their use.</P>
    <P>There are two very highly trained cliff rescue units, one based in Doolin &mdash; I am sure Deputy Taylor-Quinn is familiar with it &mdash; and the second team is currently being trained in Greencastle, County Donegal.  In fact, it was the coast lifesaving service that carried out the very successful rescue of 11 crewmen from the fishing vessel <i>Big Cat</i> which sank in Valentia on 13 January.  Let me say that even though there were helicopters standing by on that occasion they were powerless to intervene in that incident. Because of the weather conditions at the time they could not play any part other than take the people off the cliff top when they had been rescued by the local coast lifesaving service using equipment which we had bought from the UK authorities. The breeches buoy equipment was discarded in the UK in the past couple of years and we have bought it for use in the service.  Those 11 lives were saved by that equipment and without it they might well have been lost.  The helicopters were standing by at the time, in addition to the lifeboat, but they were powerless to intervene in that particular incident.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the skill and dedication of the people in the coast lifesaving service in this and in many other incidents because at times, and in that particular case, they put their personal safety at risk in very difficult and dangerous situations.  They certainly <Col N="1579" /> deserve our commendation for their courageous attempt to get the people off the boat.</P>
    <P>In the past year we have installed a new VHF maritime radio service all around the coastline with the exception of one or two blank spots, but we hope to complete it this year and we will then have modern, sophisticated VHF radio coverage service.  We spent over £700,000 in the provision of that service last year putting in a very modern, sophisticated service.  In fact, this service picked up the distress signal from the ship in difficulty during the past couple of days and it then passed that information to the British co-ordinating centre because the ship was in the area of responsibility of the British authorities.  They took the necessary action on receipt of notification from Valentia.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service and the Air Corps provide assistance when requested and three of the five Dauphin helicopters are dedicated to search and rescue operations. They now have a 24-hour capability. One of the criticisms we had in the last year was that even though the Dauphins were in the service, people had not been trained and experienced in operating them at night.  This was regarded as a handicap in the overall service.  Due to the time and effort that the Air Corps have put into night training, the Dauphins can now successfully operate on a 24 hour basis.  That was clearly demonstrated on 13 January when the four crew members of the <i>Gladonia</i> were airlifted to safety when the ship ran aground in Tramore.  It was clearly demonstrated that the Air Corps now have the capacity to deal with emergencies at night time.  Training is progressing at Shannon to develop the capabilities of the crews.  They can now operate under cloud conditions at night time off the west coast.</P>
    <P>The provision of a helicopter search and rescue service is only part of the overall service that can be provided in emergencies like this.  We are satisfied that one of the most important aspects of the search and rescue operation is the <Col N="1580" /> availability of radio communications. That is why we have spent a sum of over £700,000 on the provision of a sophisticated VHF service covering the coast, to which we have now also linked in the Shannon Marine Co-Ordinating Centre. One of the criticisms of the service was that Shannon was not linked in with it. They are now linked in.</P>

      <P>The number of days leave due to ATC staff as at the end of January amounts to 2,960 days.  I must, of course, emphasise that, despite this backlog all ATC staff have had, on average, at least three weeks leave per annum over the past few years.  Nevertheless, I regard the position in relation to annual leave for ATC staff as unsatisfactory, and negotiations are taking place with staff representatives, which I hope will resolve the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The House will, I am sure, understand that it would not be appropriate for me to go into details here while these negotiations are in progress.  I can, however, say that the resolution of the problem will involve a variety of measures including the recruitment of staff, the reorganisation of rostering arrangements, and the readjustment of annual leave regulations.  The intention is to arrive at a situation where each officer can take his proper allocation of annual leave with the current backlog being eliminated over a period of three to four years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recently approved the Minister's proposals for updating the Road Transport Act, 1932, which regulates access to the domestic bus passenger market.  The new Bill is currently being drafted, as a matter of priority, with a view to its enactment as soon as possible. While details of the changes proposed must await approval by the Government of the text of the Bill and its introduction in the Oireachtas, I can say that the Bill will provide for more flexible arrangements for the licensing of private bus operators.</P>
      <P>In so far as applications for road passenger licences are concerned, I assume that the Deputy is interested in licence applications for proposed new services. While statistics for the period prior to 1986 are not readily available, the following are the statistics for 1986, 1987 and 1988: In 1986, 48 applications were received and processed of which 58 per cent were successful.  In 1987 there were 82 applications of which 37 per cent were successful and in 1988, 43 applications were processed of which 53 per cent were successful.  A further 22 applications received during 1988 are under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 19, 26 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the rationalisation of the Meteorological Service described in my reply to Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 25 it is proposed to close the weather observation station at Renmore, Galway and to transfer the training function from Galway to the headquarters of the Meteorological Service in Dublin.  As in the case of Roches Point, the Galway station has no formal role in the dissemination of meteorological information. Furthermore, it is planned to install an automatic observing system in the Galway area and accordingly routine climatological information will continue to be available to those who require it.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there will be no diminution in the quality of the forecasts as a result of the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training school in Galway has been seriously under-utilised in recent years and I am assured that the training function can more effectively be carried out in conjunction with the Meteorological Service's research activity at its headquarters in Glasnevin.  The idea of developing a degree course in conjunction with University College, Galway, never came to fruition because of financial constraints on the university. As recruitment to the Meteorological Service is likely to be at a low level for <Col N="1493" /> the foreseeable future, the concept of developing a degree course is no longer viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the deputy has in mind charges for the supply of special forecasts and climatological information. Such charges are based on the cost of providing the information sought, i.e. staff costs with a provision for overheads or as negotiated with the user.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Meteorological Service not to apply these charges in the case of co-operating bodies, namely those who supply climatological information to the service by maintaining climatological or rainfall stations.  Many of the local authorities and State agencies fall into this category.  Moreover, much of the information supplied to local authorities has direct implications in terms of public safety (warnings of severe weather) and present policy is not to charge for the supply of such information.</P>

      <P>There are international standards, developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which specify the circumstances in which structures are required to be marked by obstruction lights with standby power supply.  These standards are applied in relation to obstructions on and in the vicinity of Irish airports.  The Dublin Corporation tower block flat complex at Ballymun does not fall within the category that requires to be so lit.  The existing lights on the roofs of the flats were installed on a voluntary precautionary basis by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the standard of reliability of the existing power supply system is adequate and that the possibility of a failure would not interfere with the safe conduct of aeronautical operations at Dublin Airport.  Should a prolonged failure of the system occur, my Department has arrangements in place for the notification of the situation to aircraft pilots and operators.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food whether the potential for a serious conflict of <Col N="1498" /> interest was brought to his attention arising out of the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 113 of 29 November 1988 and which was subsequently confirmed by the Deputy concerned in an announcement on 27 January 1989; whether he discussed this matter with the Deputy, any member of the Government or his Department's officials prior to 27 January 1989; if not, the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The written question from the Deputy on 29 November was as follows &ldquo;to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he has had any discussions or negotiations with representatives of a company (details supplied) regarding the possible take-over by that company of one of the three Siúicre Éireann Cpt sugar processing plants on condition that part of the Irish sugar quota will be made available to that company; and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My written reply was &ldquo;I have had no such discussions or negotiations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the record shows, the Deputy's question did not make any suggestion, implicit or explicit, in regard to a potential for a serious conflict of interest on the part of the Deputy named in the details supplied.  Neither was it brought to my attention in any way as suggested. My reply was a factual reply to a precise and specific question.</P>
      <P>The text of the question quoted above also demonstrates that a statement made by a Deputy in this House on 21 February purporting to quote the above question of 29 November as &ldquo;calling his attention to the named Deputy's chairmanship of Food Industries plc, and his chairmanship of the Joint Committee of State-Sponsored Bodies and asking for his views on any possible difficulties that might arise in relation to that and asking if he had any discussions with anybody arising out of that matter&rdquo; was without any foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record also indicates that a further statement from another Deputy on 21 February purporting to quote the said question as &ldquo;asked the Minister was he <Col N="1499" /> aware of the potential conflict of interest&rdquo; was also without any foundation.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts the occasion did not arise for any discussions of the kind referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a repayment of VAT of £5,226.85 was made to the company concerned in respect of the period November-December 1988 on 15 December 1988.

It was necessary to refer the claim to the Inspector of Taxes for examination. The Inspector of Taxes will complete his examination this week and a repayment cheque will issue to the company next week.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P> 1 The interest rate shown is the average over the periods for the Associated Banks' prime lending rate, the rate charged to the most creditworthy customers.</P>
    <P>2 The inflation rate shown is the average year-on-year increase in the Consumer Price Index in the quarters ended mid-August and mid-November of each year.</P>
    <P>3 A negative sign indicates a deficit. </P>
    <P>The significant improvement in inflation between the two periods reflects international price developments following on the energy price changes.  While import prices rose by over 27 per cent in the two year period 1981-82, they actually fell by 11 per cent in 1986, following the fall of 45 per cent in fuel import prices in that year.</P>
    <P>The fall in the interest rate in the period is a reflection of the drop in the domestic inflation rate and the reduction in interest rates in the main EMS countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> My responsibility in the area of employment of disabled persons relates to the implementation of a Government decision that a quota of 3 per cent of disabled persons be employed in the public sector.  The quota applies to disabled persons regardless of their type of handicap, so separate statistics are not kept of the numbers of physically handicapped employed.</P>
    <P>The embargo on the filling of vacancies has impeded progress towards achieving the 3 per cent quota.  However, as stated in my reply to a previous question on this matter on 1 December 1988, a total of 1,866 disabled persons, 1.5 per cent approximately of the workforce, were employed in Government Departments, semi-State bodies and local authorities at 31 December 1987.</P>
