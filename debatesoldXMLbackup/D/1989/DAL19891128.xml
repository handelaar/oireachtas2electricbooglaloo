      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has available to him, within his Department or under contract, an economic adviser independent of and separate from the Department of Finance; if so, if he will give the name of such an adviser; the terms of reference, if any, under which he operates; and whether he has signed the Official Secrets Act declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy on 7 November 1989, detailed proposals on the development of a network of genealogical centres are being <Col N="1794" /> prepared by the Task Force on Roots, Genealogy and Tourism.  This is a project which requires consultation with many groups and organisations both in the private and public sectors.  This is taking place and I understand the task force will make recommendations in the early months of 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on this initiative.  Would he agree that this is a matter of some urgency in view of the fact that there are a number of voluntary centres existing on a hand-to-mouth basis, including one in Trim which is mentioned in a later question? Will the Taoiseach ask the task force to complete their deliberations as quickly as possible with a view to a decision being taken before some of these centres go out of existence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of applications made to his Department for national lottery funds which have been referred to the National Heritage Council; the total value of the funds sought; the sum available from the national lottery to the council for allocation; when applicants will be informed of the decisions of the council on all applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 120 applications and inquiries for funding from the national lottery have been referred from my Department to the National Heritage Council.  In many <Col N="1795" /> cases the applicants did not request a specific amount but, where stated, the total request was for £5.8 million.  The council have recently received £1 million from the 1989 proceeds of the national lottery, having already expended or committed £1 million from the 1987-88 proceeds of the lottery.  Applications for grant assistance are considered by the council on an ongoing basis and it is not possible to give a specific decision date for any or all applications.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the applications referred by my Department to the National Heritage Council were either outline proposals or of a preliminary nature and, as such, did not provide enough information to allow them to be assessed.  The National Heritage Council has since been in contact with most of the applicants and will continue to do so as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a lot of unease among many applicants because they do not know where they stand regarding the possibility or probability of receiving some or a substantial amount of money?  Can he say when these people will be told definitely if they will get some money and, if so, what amount they are likely to receive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a varied situation. Some people have sent in applications which are of a vague character and have not submitted any additional information. As many applicants as possible will be contacted by the council to let them know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ensure that every applicant is contacted without delay and told exactly what their status is in terms of their expectations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the work to date of the EUROPEN Bureau; the programme of work and activities which it intends to undertake in 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was established in the summer of 1988 the EUROPEN Bureau has undertaken the following activities: the organisation of a major awareness campaign through TV, radio, press and poster advertising; the publication and distribution of over 175,000 information leaflets covering 14 key areas of the single market programme; the publication of an extensive market research survey gauging the awareness and level of preparation of Irish industry and related services to the internal market; the publication in <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine and <i>Irish Business</i> in co-operation with the Irish Business Bureau of a monthly news and information up-date on the single market; and the commissioning and publication, beginning this week of ten in-depth analyses of the implications of the single market for a broad range of key economic sectors of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>It was always envisaged that the initial phase of the EUROPEN campaign would be concentrated in 1988 and 1989 and that while this phase would be coordinated form the bureau set up in my Department, all Government Departments and semi-State bodies would be actively involved so as to keep Irish industry, and business generally, well informed about the implications of the single market.  I am satisfied that this involvement has been a major contributing factor to the success of the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been planned that the role of other Departments and State agencies would be progressively intensified, with the emphasis moving from awareness to preparation.  This has been happening and, in the coming year, the ten sectoral <Col N="1797" /> studies will encourage national representative bodies, industry and trade associations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individual firms to take all necessary measures, with advice and assistance from Departments and State agencies, as required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the ten areas in which the in-depth analysis is taking place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reports has already been finalised, that of the construction industry, and I would be glad to let the Deputy have a copy of it.  I will give him a list of the others.  They are food processing; metals and engineering, group one, which is office and data processing, electrical engineering and instrument engineering; metals and engineering, group 2 distribution; transportation; textiles; tourism; financial services; the construction industry; chemical and pharamaceutical and health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if he would arrange for the trade union representatives of workers involved in the ten sectors to which the analyses are taking place to be kept fully up to date with regard to the implication that 1992 might have for their members so that even if the owners of the firms involved in those sectors are not taking their responsibilities seriously, at least the workers who will be directly affected by it will be able to take whatever steps they can, based on the information that would be available?</P>

      <P>Each sector is being studied under the EUROPEN programme. As I have said, I have a copy of the first report on 1992 and the construction sector.  Perhaps if I send Deputies a copy of this report they will have a clearer idea of exactly what is in train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his first reply, indicated that he regards the campaign as a success.  Could he indicate how this success is being measured? In what way does he consider the campaign to be a success?  Could he also indicate what kind of responses industry and business are giving to the information that is being provided to them?  Are they taking serious steps to regear themselves for the open market?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is composed of those who are signatories to that programme and have made specific commitments under it.  It is not possible therefore to change the membership of the Central Review Committee during the currency of the programme.</P>
      <P>The question of including the National Youth Council of Ireland in the negotiations for a programme to follow the current programme will be considered in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach has decided to involve the ICMSA on the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery, Phase II,</i> I feel that the National Youth Council of Ireland should be given like representation.  Like the ICMSA, they were not involved in the discussions on Phase I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>Could the Taoiseach meet the National Youth Council of Ireland in the near future to discuss their social partnership status in general terms and also their membership of bodies and committees that relate to young people? Because of the disappointment experienced by the National Youth Coucil in having their representation on NESC reduced from two to one, this would in some way be a compensation to them.</P>

      <P>As I said in the House last week, I believe that, following the release of the Guildford Four, the arguments for reopening the Birmingham Six case are now so persuasive that they are impossible to withstand.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has sought a meeting with the British Home Secretary to discuss the case.  This will take place in the near future.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will bring in a Bill to amend the Interpretation Act, 1937, so that the exclusively male terms &ldquo;he&rdquo;, &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; cease to be used in legislation and are replaced by terms applicable to both sexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy is to make statutes as comprehensible to the lay person as possible, since everyone has the right to know exactly what is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, pronouns such as &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo; or &ldquo;him&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo; are used in drafting statutes and statutory instruments for the purpose of brevity, simplicity, style and readability.  In some legislation the use of one or other is necessary, such as in the Social Welfare Acts, dealing with women's allowances, and the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, where the words &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; are used.  The constant repetition of the <Col N="1802" /> noun which they replace &mdash; for example, &ldquo;the person&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Collector-General&rdquo;, &ldquo;the respondent&rdquo;&mdash; in sections which may already be long and complicated, would make the text even more difficult, especially for members of the public.</P>
    <P>I am, however, sympathetic to the Deputy's concern and I have asked the Attorney General to ensure that, where possible, words importing both genders will be used in the drafting of Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will agree that the public are sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between he and she if those terms are used interchangeably in legislation.  Would he not agree that it is anomalous that in legislation like the Employment Equality Act, the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; is used repeatedly when in reality the legislation was primarily designed to give employment equality to women?  Would he confirm that proposals were made to Government in 1986 to amend the Interpretation Act, that the work has actually been done in his Department and that it would now simply be a matter of political decision to bring such legislation before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly answer for any of those mysterious and weird things that happened in 1986.  The Deputy will be aware that this matter is governed by the Interpretation Act, 1937.  There is a clause in that Act which says that every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the feminine gender.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the ways of the parliamentary draftsmen are usually pretty obscure to the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that in the same Act, where it deals with the question of the singular and plural and says that singular shall mean plural the converse applies, but where it says &ldquo;he&rdquo; shall mean &ldquo;she&rdquo; the converse does not apply.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in this day and age this kind of antiquated, sexist terminology should be eliminated and that <Col N="1803" /> we are very much out of line with other English speaking countries which in recent years have amended similar legislation to correct this anomaly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I propose to discuss the matter with the Attorney General.  The 1937 Act has stood the test of time but maybe the time has come to look at it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the guidelines, if any, issued by him to members of the Government regarding the acceptance of gifts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers have been made aware of the long standing practice of accepting only relatively inexpensive gifts to mark occasions such as official openings.  As indicated to the House on 19 October 1988 this Administration conforms to long established international practice covering the exchange of official and personal gifts between host and guest on the occasion of official or State visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the guideline he has just read to the House is too vague, that it would be appropriate to have a monetary limit on the value of gifts which may be accepted by members of the Government from foreign Heads of State, representatives of industry or whoever and that it is important in the public interest that there should be an upper limit clearly specified and laid down?  Perhaps it could be varied from time to time but it should be clearly limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it that proposal would appear to have a lot to recommend it but on the other hand it does cause difficulties.  I know that some countries which tried to adopt that practice have had to abandon it for protocol and other reasons.  It could be considered again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that it should not cause any great difficulty because if there was any doubt about the matter there would be nothing to stop the Minister concerned passing over that gift to the Irish nation, the National Museum or some other appropriate institution?  Suspicion often arises in the public mind that unwarranted activities are going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent information on balance of payments flows published by the Central Statistics Office relates to the first quarter of 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to an increase of £254 million in the first quarter of 1988 the reserves fell by £425 million during the first quarter of 1989.  This was due mainly to a <Col N="1811" /> reduction of £448 million in official foreign borrowing, due mostly to debt repayments by the intervention agency in line with reductions in the value of its stocks, and to an estimated portfolio adjustment of £236 million following the relaxation of exchange controls with effect from 1 January last.  As both these developments were well anticipated and as the end-1988 reserves were at a comfortable level, the fall in the reserves during the first quarter of 1989 did not impact significantly on either interest rates or inflation.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have published figures for the official external reserves up to the end of the third quarter.  These show that while the reserves fell by £238 million during the second quarter, they increased by £389 million during the third quarter.  At 30 September 1989 they stood at £2,887 million.  This was a satisfactory rate of recovery.  The official external reserves peaked in June 1988 at £3.5 billion and fell back to £3.3 billion at end-September and £3.2 billion at end-December 1988 as the Exchequer repaid foreign currency debt.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank are due to publish the end-October 1989 figure for the official external reserves shortly.  The weakness of sterling has given rise to some additional demand for foreign exchange.  However, the official external reserves remain at an adequate level and the bulk of this additional demand should be reversed once sterling settles down. Additional demand for foreign exchange exerts upward pressure on interest rates and it is a matter for judgment by the Central Bank, which is primarily responsible for the level of interest rates, to decide the appropriate response.</P>
    <P>So far this year there have been three one percentage point increases in domestic interest rates, largely to maintain differentials with rates in other EMS countries.  Notwithstanding these interest rate increases the differential between key Irish and UK interest rates has improved by up to 6½ percentage points since 31 March 1987 and the corresponding differential with German <Col N="1812" /> rates has improved by 5¾ percentage points.</P>
    <P>This is a dramatic improvement in our competitive position arising directly from good economic management.  In the medium to long term both the fall in the value of sterling and the higher level of interest rates will put downward pressure on inflation.  This Government intend to continue to improve the underlying economy and this will ensure that we will be in a position to take advantage of favourable developments in the international interest rate environment.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Will the Minister agree that during the last month or two the fall in the value of sterling has given rise to an increasing and continued drain on Ireland's foreign currency reserves?  Will the Minister agree that that is likely to increase as time goes on if the position of sterling remains the same?  Is it the Minister's intention to allow free market forces to operate here, to allow this increase on interest rates to continue in the country with the consequences that will have on inflation and unemployment?</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said in relation to upward pressure for more foreign exchange in relation to the weakness of sterling is true and that is caused by exporters, and importers, buying forward to protect their position. That is a temporary phenomenon in that that money would go out anyway over a period of time rather than in the short period of one to two weeks.  The Central Bank, with prime responsibility for the protection of our currency, will make the appropriate response if an occasion arises for a response from them.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Arising out of the Minister's reply to my Question No. 17, I should like to point out that the Taoiseach yesterday expressed the view that interest rates would come down in the short term.  Does the Minister agree with that?  Could the Minister inform the House what domestic or international <Col N="1813" /> conditions would give rise to this decrease in interest rates?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy is quoting the Taoiseach correctly. What the Taoiseach said &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy is aware of it &mdash; is that there is downward pressure on interest rates in the United States.  That trend may well take place in Germany as this is possibly expected in the early part of next year and certainly towards the mid term of next year.</P>

      <P>As I have already explained in my reply, the reserves peaked in June 1988 and fell during the second half of the year when £512 million of foreign currency debt was repaid by the Exchequer.  The fall in reserves during the first quarter of this year were a portfolio of adjustment of £236 million, following the relaxation of exchange controls with effect from 1 January last and a reduction in official foreign borrowing due mainly to repayments of £300 million by the intervention agency in the reduction of the value of the stocks.  The Central Bank, which is the appropriate authority in this regard, considers the level of our reserves adequate and they represent 2.9 months of imports.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he plans to increase the tax take from the banks, in view of the huge profits being made by the main banks and the relatively small contribution they make to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Changes in taxation, <Col N="1815" /> in relation to the banks or any other group, are a budgetary matter and I do not propose to comment at this stage.</P>
      <P>As regards the tax contribution made by the banks, I should point out that under the principle of confidentiality in relation to taxation affairs it is not the practice to give information concerning payments by individual taxpayers or by small groups of taxpayers.  I would, however, draw the attention of the Deputy to the latest published accounts of the two principal banking groups. According to their published accounts, the total pre-tax profits of these two groups for the year ended 31 March 1989 were £315.2 million.  The accounts make provision for £36.6 million in total Irish corporation tax, and £44.2 million in overseas taxation.  These corporation tax provisions are not precise final payment figures, since adjustments are normally made in the course of finalising the actual tax liability with the various Revenue authorities.  However, they can be taken as giving a broad indication of the magnitudes involved.  In addition, the two groups concerned have also made provision in these accounts for payments under the bank levy of £30.3 million.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions, of which the banking sector is a major part, have contributed in recent years an estimated 20 per cent of the total yield from corporation tax.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the bank levy was specifically introduced in 1981 as a direct response to the low level of corporation tax paid by the banks.  The total levy now stands at a level of £36 million and is paid by all the licensed banks.</P>
      <P>I expect that the measures which I introduced this year in the Finance Act to curtail the growth of section 84 lending will result in increased corporation tax payments by the banks.</P>
      <P>Finally, as stated in the <i>Programme for Government,</i> it is intended to continue to widen the tax base, and this will include the obtaining of an increased tax yield from the corporate sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>Allied Irish Banks indicated on returns made up until the end of September that they were setting aside 32 per cent of declared profits while Bank of Ireland were setting aside 26 per cent of declared profits.  Can the Minister explain the discrepancy between the rates being paid by both groups?  Can he also indicate, as perhaps he has the information available, the amount of tax outstanding by both groups?  The Minister indicated in his reply that the figures in mation available, the amount of tax outstanding by both groups?  The Minister indicated in his reply that the figures in the accounts do not always represent the tax actually paid, so can he indicate what tax had been paid, what tax is still out standing, and the years for which the tax is outstanding?</P>

      <P>That is hardly a satisfactory reply.  The Minister has taken responsibility for the question I had put down which asked that he ensure that there would be a better tax take from the banks.  The Minister has to some extent dodged the question although he has indicated that a greater tax take will be taken from the corporate sector.  The banks are generally under the control of the Central Bank, which is responsible to the Government.  Surely the Minister has a responsibility to tell us the way in which the banking institutes are meeting their obligations to the citizens of the State? After all 50 per cent of the banks' profits are made in the State so the Minister has a responsibility to tell us whether they are meeting their responsibilities to the citizens of this State?</P>

      <P>It is interesting to take a look at what has happened since. We are not as vulnerable as we were in 1986 when a similar situation arose.  The present position or a slightly worsened position should not pose as large a threat to exporters as it once might have done. Quite apart from our growing export markets elsewhere the competitiveness of industry has improved overall.  In 1987 and 1988 Irish manufacturers experienced a cumulative competitive gain of <Col N="1819" /> about 25 per cent relative to their UK counterparts.  In 1989, we expect that figure to increase by about 4 per cent.  As a result of the fall in sterling, competitiveness may also be helped through lower prices for goods, particularly inputs, purchased from the UK.  The Government will continue their pursuit of sound economic policies which should be conducive to fostering an environment in which exporters can compete effectively. On one side of the coin, the exporters who import a lot of raw material from the UK will benefit and on the other side, consumers and inflation will benefit.  When we do all the calculations, we find we are in a much stronger position than we were in 1986 when a similar situation arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 28 together. Deputies will be aware of the revised proposals for approximation of VAT rates, including the proposal for a minimum standard rate of about 15 per cent, which were put forward earlier this year by the EC Commission.  More recently, the Commission has made new proposals <Col N="1820" /> for approximation of excise rates, also based on a minimum rates approach.</P>
      <P>The VAT proposals were discussed at some length at the November ECOFIN Council, but no agreement was reached on rates of tax.  It is clear that there is still a wide range of views as to whether minimum rates, or rates within specific bands, should apply.  The council will discuss the matter again at a forthcoming meeting, on 18 December.  The whole question of excise rates also remains to be settled.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, preliminary agreement was reached on a number of structural arrangements necessary for the approximation of VAT and excise duties by 1 January 1993.  Full details of the agreement are documented in EC Council document 9850/89 Presse 206 which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The main element now confirmed is that, for some period after the completion of the internal market, exports can continue to be zero-rated with tax on imports falling due on receipt by the importer.  The precise arrangements to ensure protection of the revenue and the prevention of fraud have still to be elaborated. In this regard, the Council endorsed continuation of the technical work necessary to establish satisfactory controls, while ensuring that administrative burdens and costs for businesses are alleviated.</P>
      <P>The Council agreement from the recent meeting provides for abolition of limits on travellers' allowances, but notes that the position in Denmark, Greece and Ireland &mdash; where relatively high rates of tax apply &mdash; may have to be the subject of specific arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the opportunity at this meeting to again emphasise the huge revenue losses that could arise for Ireland if, in the absence of frontier controls, we had to approximate our VAT and excise rates closely with those in the UK.  There was a positive response from the Commission and it was recognised at the meeting that we may need special measures to enable us to integrate effectively into the internal market without compromising our objectives for income tax reform and <Col N="1821" /> lower borrowing.  I will be following up on this in future meetings so as to protect our economic and financial interests.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals on harmonisation in regard to deposit interest retention tax.  Last February, proposals were put forward by the European Commission for the introduction of a minimum Community wide withholding tax on interest income; member states would have been free to impose a higher rate on their own residents.  The proposals, which Ireland broadly supported, were opposed by a number of member states and are now effectively dead.  What has been under discussion more recently, arising out of liberalisation of capital movements, is a package of proposals aimed at improving mutual assistance between member states' tax authorities. No agreement was reached at the November ECOFIN Council on these proposals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason Tax Unit 663 has not been issuing tax free allowance certificates since July 1989; and the reason two members of staff who left the unit at that time have not yet been replaced.</P>

      <P>Certain work allocations have fallen into arrears because of staff shortages in Unit 663 of the PAYE No. 6 Tax District, 85-93 Lower Mount Street.  The trade union which represents the staff involved has refused, as a matter of policy, to allow their members to do the work allocations of non-replaced members.  However, following negotiations between the Revenue Commissioners and the union involved a formula was agreed whereby the arrears would be worked from 7 November 1989.</P>
      <P>All urgent items including applications for certificates of tax free allowances for taxpayers who were being taxed on the emergency basis have now been dealt with.</P>
      <P>The two members of staff who left the unit have not been replaced because the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is affected, in common with other Government Departments, by Government policy on reducing numbers in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this problem arose out of the non-replacement of the two members of staff concerned, one of whom left in July and the other was transferred in August?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, but I am also aware that there are building workers awaiting the issue of certificates of tax free allowances since last summer.  Surely those workers are entitled to have their certificates of tax free allowances issued?

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the basis on which co-operatives are exempted from tax; if, in view of the changing nature of many co-operatives, he has any plans to review this exemption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 of the 1978 Finance Act provides for the exemption from corporation tax of certain trading profits of co-operatives if a number of conditions are fulfilled.  The basic underlying condition is that the co-operative must be a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts.  In the case of an agricultural co-operative, it must also have at least 50 members and all or a majority of these must be mainly engaged in and derive the principal part of their income from farming.  If these conditions apply, the co-operative qualifies automatically under section 18 for the exemption.  Where an agricultural co-operative does not meet either or both of these latter two conditions, the Minister for Finance is empowered, under section 18, following a recommendation from the Minister for <Col N="1825" /> Agriculture and Food, to give a certificate granting the co-operative the tax exemption.  The exempted trading profits are listed in the Second Schedule to the 1978 Finance Act and include profits arising from the sale by wholesale of certain farm produce, processed goods and farm inputs.</P>
      <P>A similar exemption applies in the case of a fishery co-operative which is similarly registered.  The fishery co-operative must have at least 20 members, of whom all or a majority are mainly engaged and derive the principal part of their income from fishing.  Where the co-operative does not meet either or both of these latter two conditions, the Minister for Finance is empowered to give a tax exemption certificate, following a recommendation from the Minister for the Marine.  The exempted trading profits include the selling by wholesale of fish and the provision of certain related services.</P>
      <P>The tax exemption for these agricultural and fishery co-operatives has been helpful in the development of the co-operative system and in the process of restructuring and modernisation which is still underway.  However, as with tax exemptions generally, the exemption for co-operatives is kept under regular review in the light of changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last statement of the Minister with regard to the great benefit to the co-ops.  They have uses in the future as well I agree but in the light of the changing circumstances and structures where co-ops are setting up subsidiaries and are getting involved in joint ventures with private companies and are being taken over by private companies, has this not altered the situation and can the Minister say if there is any monitoring of the co-ops being done in these circumstances?  I refer particularly to the Waterford Co-op which in 1987 had a profit of £6 million and paid no tax whatever although considerable changes have taken place in the manner of their marketing, structures and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that quite a <Col N="1826" /> lot of changes have taken place and that the co-operative system is undergoing a process of restructuring and modernisation. This development is generally welcomed because of the importance of the co-operative movement for the agricultural and food industries.  The tax exemption, as with all other exemptions, is kept under regular review and whatever changes are considered necessary will be made at the appropriate time in the light of all the circumstances including the economic, social and taxation factors relevant to the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister really taken into consideration the changes that have taken place?  Does he now consider that the conditions laid down in section 8 are adequate or are being maintained or have a realistic basis?  There could be 50 members among the shareholders who are mainly farmers but nevertheless the operation could be more a commercial business venture than a co-operative.  Has the Minister taken that into consideration in deciding on the tax bases of the huge profits which these are now making?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, with regard to the designation of a site (details supplied) in County Galway, if EC and State funds will be available to local interests for turbary and afforestation; if this designation reflects Government policy regarding the development of turbary in Connemara; if the designated area in question can be abandoned, reduced in size or renegotiated; and if there is a scheme in existence whereby landowners are compensated for land deemed designated under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The area for which details were supplied is an area of scientific interest because of its flora and fauna.  It is a blanket bog which is one of the eco-systems being protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  It is also a winter site for the Greenland White-fronted Goose, an Annex 1 species under EC Directive No. 79/409.  This requires that Annex 1 species shall be the subject of special conservation measures concerning their habitat.  Grants for the development of such areas would not normally be paid from EC funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area was declared an area of scientific interest in 1983 by the then Forest and Wildlife Service and there are no proposals to amend the boundaries further at this time.  The area covers 1,500 hectares.  Landowners are not precluded <Col N="1829" /> from developing such areas from their own resources by such desigations.</P>
    <P>Designation of sites of scientific interest is based on scientific criteria only which relate to the flora and fauna and general eco-system.</P>
    <P>The declaration of an area as having features of scientific interest does not involve consultation with the landowner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed with the Minister's reply which has given me additional information although it did not entirely answer the question posed.  The area in question is in the Spiddal-Inverin area and about 4,000 to 5,000 acres of bogland are included in that specified area.  About six years ago Údarás na Gaeltachta purchased 1,000 acres of bog there.  They are now precluded from developing that.  They were told by the EC, the county council and everybody else concerned that they cannot get approval for development.  The Minister said that landowners would not be precluded from developing bogland.  I know at least one landowner in the area, Mr. John Walsh of Inverin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a remarkable heritage of historical and scientific sites varied in type and widely spread over the whole country.  This heritage is of growing importance for the purposes of education and recreation not only for the <Col N="1830" /> daily lives of our people but in the development of tourism and the pursuit of historical and scientific research. However, it is being steadily eroded and whittled away by neglect, by natural forces and, of course, by human exploitation, pollution and other modern developments.  In my opinion, and I think the opinion of everybody now, this represents a serious loss to the nation since the heritage properly cared for and suitably developed will bring many and continuing benefits not only to this generation but to future generations.  If the Deputy has a problem with an individual in that area and wishes to discuss it with me I will see in what way we can facilitate him.  I am not familiar with the details of what he is complaining about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The area, as I said, was designated in 1983 and it is a well established and recognised area.  There was even pressure at the time to have the area designated and protected.  I am satisfied that the proper procedure was followed in that regard.  I believe this is a very important area which needs to be protected. If the Deputy has a particular problem and wants to talk to me about it, we will see if there is some way it can be resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present national monuments legislation is adequate for the proper protection of <Col N="1831" /> national monuments.  The National Monuments Act passed in 1930 was amended in 1954 and again in 1987.  This latter amendment is particularly important in relation to present day threats to our archaeological heritage.  Its provisions include restrictions on the use of detection devices, protection of sites of historic wrecks and greatly increased penalties for offenders.  It is evident from the findings of the archaeological survey of Ireland that destruction rates vary in different parts of the country.  However, specific figures for destruction in the last five years are not available.  Six prosecutions have taken place in the last five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed with the Minister's reply; six prosecutions in five years.  Is he not aware that even on the Clonmacnoise site alone, there has been much damage and vandalism and stones were stolen?  This is a most inadequate reply and I ask the Minister to think again on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Clonmacnoise site we have had successful prosecutions with very severe penalties imposed.  It is important to recognise that there are 90,000 sites of archaeological interest and importance and it is very difficult to keep tight control over such a wide range of sites scattered over the whole State.  The office and the archaeological personnel involved in this area are endeavouring to the very best of their ability to come to grips with these problems and we value and appreciate the huge volume of co-operation we now receive from the general public who at long last are becoming more aware of the importance of our heritage and of preservation, and we find incidents of this nature are on the downward trend rather than the other way.</P>

Can the Minister tell the House if he is aware of that, these items are being taken, exported and lost to the country's heritage forever?  Has he any proposals to deal with that?</P>

We had some very successful prosecutions in February, April, May and September of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the three questions on Ethiopia together.</P>
      <P>The Government are very concerned about the situation in northern Ethiopia where millions of people are threatened with famine.  Ethiopia has always been a country with a food deficit &mdash; due to the conflicts there it has not been possible to deliver food in sufficient quantities, following drought and harvest failure this year, which has proved more severe than anticipated earlier.</P>
      <P>The Government already allocated £50,000 to Trócaire on 7 November for food purchase for Tigre and will be allocating very shortly further funds to organisations which are capable of getting relief supplies delivered to those in need.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to do whatever it can in co-operation with its partners in the European Community to impress on the parties in conflict in Eritrea the absolute priority that should be given to the welfare of the population and the need to allow necessary relief supplies through unhindered to famine affected areas.</P>
      <P>The European Community has been to the forefront in responding to the needs of the situation: the key problem at present, however is the question of access which I hope that international pressure will be successful in resolving speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State arrange, as was done in 1984 when Ireland held the Presidency and the last devastating famine hit Ethiopia, that he or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="1835" /> Deputy Collins, on behalf of the Presidency of the EC, will travel to Ethiopia to assess the situation and arrange, as was done then through the Dublin plan, to make large quantities of food available to the people of Ethiopia?  Could he clarify whether there are stocks of surplus grain and milk powder in Ireland which could be given to the Irish agency CONCERN who are arranging for a ship to travel from Ireland to the port of Massawa in northern Eritrea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The question the Deputy raises was raised last Tuesday and again yesterday with our partners in the Community. The French Presidency is undertaking certain measures.</P>
      <P>The big problem is that it is impossible to get food into Ethiopia.  The bulk of the food at present is coming in through the Sudan and there are grave problems in actually distributing it.  Food is available but the big problem is access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's recognition that there is a serious problem I would ask him if he is aware &mdash; and I am sure he is &mdash; that our total allocation to international co-operation has decreased from £28.052 million in 1986 to around £22.829 million this year? Would the Minister not accept that we should now, on an emergency basis, seek to increase our total allocation for international co-operation and to use whatever services and whatever political strength we have in relation to our European partners to look for access, which the Minister outlined as being the problem, but to back up that request by a special emergency sum of money from this Government to avoid the deaths of millions of people in the coming months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can reassure the Deputy that his request in relation to our need to back up and to urge our Community partners to take action has already been carried out.  We have also provided extra money and the extra money is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1836" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if there are not three levels on which action should be taken.  First, at the influential level involving the meeting between President Gorbachev and President Bush which will take place in the Mediterranean shortly that they should intervene with the Ethiopian Government to allow the relief &mdash; that is part of the problem &mdash; to get to the affected areas. Second, at the European level, the European Council of Ministers should use their influence along North Africa, in the Sudan, in Ethiopia and in Kenya to ensure that the relief gets through those countries and into Ethiopia.  Third, would the Government not agree that they should provide more money than they are providing at present?  Yesterday the British Government provided £2 million. On that basis the Irish Government should provide well over £100,000; even on a meagrely <i>pro rata</i> basis that would be the sum of money that would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a position to supply more than £100,000 but as the Deputy has suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it supply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will supply that money to the relief organisations who can dispense those funds in the best possible manner and in the worst affected areas. I can also reassure him that, as I said earlier, the matter was raised last Tuesday and also yesterday in discussions in the Community in both the development council and in the general affairs council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in view of the urgency of the matter, whether he would consider, through the prestige of the upcoming Presidency of the EC and, indeed, the current position in the EC, a meeting with the Ethiopian authorities?  The logjam seems to rest with the Ethiopian authorities and the whole question of access seems to be with or without their permission.  Surely the answer to the problem is to ask the Minister to arrange with his colleagues in the <Col N="1837" /> European Community to meet with the Ethiopian authorities to remove this logjam.  Is it not a fact that the Ethiopian authorities are attacking provisions through what is left of access to these tragic groups of people?  I would ask that an emergency meeting be arranged with the Ethiopian authorities urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that a meeting took place in Addis Ababa yesterday in which a number of the various agencies in the city took part.  I want to assure the Deputy that the Government will do everything possible to co-operate with our European partners to bring about easy access.  Access is the key.  My understanding is that there is quite an amount of food available but that unfortunately the key to the problem is access.  We will do all we can to make certain that the food gets through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that we will assist our European partners.  I would ask him to give some lead and to allow the Irish people did down through the last number of years, when funds were raised for the Third World.  Surely the Minister is aware that next year we are proposing to spend 0.13 per cent of GNP on Third World aid as opposed to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I believe he would find no objection from any of the parties in this House if he were to outline a sum far greater than that mentioned and if he would bring in a Supplementary Estimate this week.  I would also urge that he take up Deputy Andrew's suggestion to have an emergency meeting either through the <Col N="1838" /> EC partners or directly with the Ethiopian Government to break the logjam and to get food to these people before January when the calamity is about to commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of giving the lead would the Minister not accept that in last famine in 1984 Ireland gave the major lead in responding to the Geldof appeal, supported by the then Government and would he do the same now?  Second, and more importantly, would he accept that the problem of access and distribution will only be resolved at political level in Ethiopia and will he not ensure that a political representative of the Community will go to Addis Ababa and meet Chairman Mengista as I did on behalf of the Community during our Presidency in 1984, so that those problems can be cleared at political level?  Would the Minister ensure that that is done now and done quickly?</P>

      <P>I should like to raise two matters on the Order of business.  The first is to ask the Taoiseach whether the House will have an opportunity to debate the community support framework which was published yesterday and, if so, when?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are only talking about the first publication of the Estimates &mdash; not the full Estimates &mdash; the debate is not a satisfactory framework within which to discuss this.  The second matter I wish to raise is one of procedure in the House.  A while ago my colleague, Deputy G. Mitchell, sought to raise on the Adjournment the matter of a fine imposed on Aer Lingus in Florida in <Col N="1932" /> relation to certain activities in which it was alleged they had been involved.  The matter was disallowed on the grounds of non-competence on the part of the Minister.  I am speaking in the parliamentary use of that phrase, Sir, although it applies elsewhere as well.  It has since emerged that the Government had been involved in a number of discussions about this matter and that the Minister had also been involved in discussions in relation to this matter.  I am given to understand, a Cheann Comhairle, that you have come to the conclusion that the defence of ministerial non-competence was not one appropriate to this case.  Will you confirm that and if it means that the Government will be under your particular scrutiny in the future in any further attempt they might make to evade their responsibilities and to avoid answering questions on matters that properly come before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe that there is a general acceptance that the law needs to be tightened with regard to the availability and possession of offensive weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the law has long been strict about the possession of guns there has up to now been little in the way of controls <Col N="1941" /> on the carrying of other offensive weapons such as knives or similar dangerous articles.  There have been a growing number of incidents in recent years in which knives have been used to cause injury and sometimes death.  It is vital, therefore, I believe, to introduce the type of control which is proposed in this Bill which will outlaw the carrying of knives in a wide range of public places and also provide for a total ban on the importation, sale etc., of such particularly vicious items as flick-knives, machetes and certain martial arts-type weapons. Neither is there adequate control on the ownership of certain weapons which have lethal potential and which have lately become popular such as the crossbow or on newly developed weapons such as the stun gun.</P>
    <P>There has been growing demands in recent years from the public at large and from public representatives, including Deputies from all sides in this House, for the introduction of legislation to deal with this problem.  This Bill is a recognition of those demands.  It also reflects the Government's deep concern that the availability of weapons which can and are being used for criminal or malicious purposes be restricted and controlled to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The public deserve to be protected against the possibility of assault with deadly weapons even if this does mean a certain limitation of freedom heretofore enjoyed or perhaps the inconvenience of having to get a firearms licence etc.  This Bill will, I believe, go a long way to making our streets and places of public entertainment and resort safer.</P>
    <P>Also, I hope that the Bill will act as a very strong deterrent to young people who, for reasons of bravado, make it a habit to carry offensive weapons.  These youngsters are their own worst enemies. They largely carry these things not because they necessarily intend to injure anybody but because they think it is a &ldquo;macho&rdquo; thing to do.  The problem is, as we all know, that whatever the intention, all too frequently somebody does get hurt or some young life is sadly and wantonly <Col N="1942" /> lost.  I want this to stop and I hope this Bill will help stop it.</P>
    <P>Just as much as it is wrong and mistaken for those young people to whom I have just referred to carry knives or whatever, I think it would be equally wrong for other people to arm themselves with so called self-defence weapons like stun guns.  Stun guns are dangerous and can be seriously misused particularly in the hands of criminals.  They would offer no real protection to the potential victim of an attack.  They would merely exacerbate the situation and lead perhaps to greater injuries or abuse being inflicted. In any event people should not be encouraged to take the law into their own hands. We do not want vigilantism or anything that smacks of it.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the main provisions of the Bill are as follows.  Stun guns and crossbows are being brought within the ambit of the Firearms Acts.  The carrying of knives, or articles which can be misused in a similar manner to knives, in places of public entertainment of resort is being made an offence.  The carrying in any public place of flick-knives and weapons made or adapted to cause injury is being made an offence as is the carrying of any article with intent to cause injury or to intimidate. To have an offensive weapon while trespassing on private property will be an offence and it will be an offence to produce any article capable of causing serious injury to intimidate in furtherance of a crime or during a fight or dispute.</P>
    <P>Also, power will be conferred on the Minister for Justice to make regulations to prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale etc. of weapons which he considers particularly dangerous or objectionable and for which there is no legitimate use or need.  What is envisaged here are weapons such as flick-knives, knuckledusters, certain martial arts weapons, etc.  The gardaí will also be given the necessary powers of arrest, search and seizure to enforce the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As sections 5, 6 and 7 were not part of the Bill as published but were introduced by way of amendment on Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann, perhaps I <Col N="1943" /> should give a few words of explanation about them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 5 is to amend the Firearms Acts to the extent necessary to enable this country to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Control and Possession of Firearms by Individuals. The aim of that Convention is to regulate and control the movement of firearms and ammunition between member states of the Council of Europe with a view to preventing illicit traffic in those items.  This is an important Convention and one which we should ratify. Apart from its practical benefits it serves to signal a concern at international level for greater control on the availability of firearms, which is something this country would strongly support.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the possession of silencers.  It proposes to limit their availability to persons who can show that they have a particular need for having them, for instance, as a veterinary surgeon or some other person concerned with the destruction of animals.  This provision has been inserted in the Bill on the advice of the Garda authorities who are particularly concerned about the potential misuse of such items.  As the law stands, they can be procured by anybody already in possession of a firearms certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a new offence of reckless discharge of a firearm which, I am advised, is needed to fill a gap in the existing law.  As I understand it, in a situation where, for example, somebody fires a gun at another person's house to frighten or intimidate or in circumstances where there could be serious risk of injury, existing statutory provisions may be difficult to apply because of a lack of provable intent to injure or endanger life. I think Deputies will agree with me that it is important to ensure that this lacuna is removed.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go further into the detailed provisions of the Bill now.  This, I think, can best be done on Committee Stage.  However, I would like to make some general comments about it.  Some of these comments were already made by my predecessor in the Seanad, but I think <Col N="1944" /> they are important to an understanding of the Bill and bear repeating.</P>
    <P>The form of the Bill is dictated by the need to provide adequate legislative controls on the possession and availability of offensive weapons on the one hand and, at the same time, to avoid any unnecessary or unreasonable interference with people's freedom to have and to use articles which, while they may be employed as offensive weapons, have legitimate sporting, recreational and other uses.  This is why the various weapons encompassed by the Bill are subject to different degrees of control.  Each of the categories of weapon dealt with in the Bill was considered separately in terms of what controls could best be applied to it.</P>
    <P>Stun guns are dangerous weapons which have lately appeared on the market in this country and whose sale has been openly promoted.  As I have said earlier, these weapons are open to serious abuse and I know of no good reason why we should allow them to be available.  The Bill, therefore, provides that stun guns will be defined as firearms for the purposes of the Firearms Acts.  This will make their importation illegal, except under licence granted by the Minister for Justice, and will make their sale, ownership, etc. unlawful without an appropriate firearm certificate issued by the Garda Síochána.  Given the nature of this weapon I do not envisage that any licences or certificates will be granted in respect of them.  The only use to which a stun gun can be put is to incapacitate another person and I can see no case for licensing a person to keep a weapon for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Crossbows are somewhat different. While these are also dangerous and lethal weapons they do have legitimate sporting and recreational uses which must be taken into account.  Therefore, a somewhat different approach must be taken to them.  As in the case of stun guns, it is provided that they be brought within the licensing system which applies to firearms. However, it is not intended to prohibit them completely but rather to confine their availability and possession <Col N="1945" /> to responsible persons who can establish a reason for having them.</P>
    <P>In the case of ordinary knives and other bladed or sharply pointed articles which have many and varied legitimate uses, control cannot be so tight.  Obviously one cannot simply outlaw the carrying of ordinary knives and tools.  What is proposed in the Bill, therefore, is to prohibit the carrying of any of these articles in places of public entertainment or resort where people normally have no legitimate reason to have them and where there is the greatest danger of their being misused.</P>
    <P>However, a much stronger approach can be and is being taken in the case of knives and other dangerous articles which do not have recognised uses and which can be clearly distinguished from those that do.  What is in mind here is such items as flick-knives, machetes and similar obnoxious knives as well as certain martial arts-type weapons.  Power is given to the Minister to totally ban the importation, sale, etc. of such articles.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I should also mention here that I intend, subject to the advice of the draftsman as to technical feasibility, to introduce a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to implement certain interim recommendations made to me by the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control which is chaired by Mr. Justice Hamilton, President of the High Court. The committee has suggested that suitable amendments to give effect to a number of their recommendations regarding the need to extend the powers of the Garda Síochána to deal with crowd situations at football matches and other events should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that my primary concern in relation to this Bill is that it should be as effective as possible in dealing with the problems it addresses.  I am, therefore, quite open to constructive comments and suggestions and if Deputies have any ideas of how it can be made more effective I would be glad to hear them and take them on board if they are workable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My major complaint is about the long delay in getting this Bill into the House for debate.  It is almost a year since it was circulated with great flourish with the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins.  Having been passed by the Seanad last May it became a casualty of the June election and five months later it is being presented for debate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The urgent need for such legislation is highlighted by the crime figures.  Last year there were 672 cases of robbery and aggravated burglary in which firearms were used.  That figure was up 16 per cent on the 1987 figure.  Reported crime involving wounding, other acts endangering life, assault and like offences totalled 1,574, which is an average of over 30 such crimes each week.  In many of these attacks knives and other offensive weapons were used.  It is not before time to call a halt to the availability of all kinds of firearms, knives and articles made or adapted for causing injury to people.  It is clearly essential to give to the Garda Síochána the necessary powers to search for and seize such weaponry.</P>
      <P>Mention of the Garda Síochána leads me to comment on the fact that many of those attacks were on members of that force.  There is a danger that our society takes too much for granted the commitment and very often the bravery and heroism of members of the Garda, mostly unarmed, in the front line of the fight against crime.  It should be remembered that in 1988 an incident of assault, wounding and other acts endangering life of like offences against members of the force occurred on average more than once every day of the year, leading to a total of 429 in all against gardaí on duty.  I have no reason to believe that the figures are any better this year.  The attack by a mob on three members of the force in Finglas earlier this month is a further indication of the extent of lawlessness in our society, particularly in the city of Dublin, and of the enormous task faced by members of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the foundation of the State the decision was taken to establish an <Col N="1947" /> unarmed uniformed Garda force and to restrict the availability of firearms under the 1925 Act.  This was particularly farseeing and courageous in the aftermath of the troubled and turbulent times leading to an immediately after independence. Yet over the years we have seen the benefit of that policy &mdash; particularly obvious when we contrast the situation here with that prevailing in countries like the United States.  There the frontier mentality which prevails to this day results in 50 million to 60 million US households &mdash; almost half the total &mdash; having at least one gun.  In 1984 and 1985, the last two years for which statistics are available, the number of people who died in the United States of injuries from firearms was over 63,000, more than all the casualties in the American involvement in Vietnam.  Even today the most powerful lobby in the US is the National Rifle Association, one of whose foremost members is President Bush who consistently defends the right of free men and women to own a gun.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, since the foundation of the State, we have followed a different path here in restricting firearms for security and sporting or recreational purposes. That policy has the overwhelming support of the Irish people, with the notable exception of the Provisional IRA and other subversives who daily continue to besmirch the name of our nation with the bomb and the bullet.  The contemptuous manner in which they reject the appeals of State and Church to lay down their arms is a parallel indication of the contempt with which they view the democratic process.  Since they ignore appeals from Pope and President, Ministers of the cloth and of the State, I hesitate to waste words on them.  I do feel however that an appeal to their small number of supporters and fellow travellers at home and abroad may be justified.  Let us in this House make it totally clear to those who lend succour and support, by word or deed, to the merchants of death in our midst that those fellow travellers are equally guilty as accessories of the awful carnage and death on our island, in the <Col N="1948" /> UK and on the Continent.  In this context let us also make it clear that there is no distinction between victims of such atrocities.  Murder is murder whether the victim is a soldier, a policeman, a housewife or a babe in arms.</P>
    <P>Of major concern also is the sub-culture which has developed in recent years, particularly in our cities, in which flick knives, knuckle dusters and like instruments are part of its day to day expression.  Daily now we read and hear of horrific stories of the activities of individuals and mobs armed with assorted weaponary of all kinds setting on innocent people and indeed also members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is probably clear from my remarks that I regard the Bill before the House as not just desirable but absolutely essential. Perhaps I should inject a personal credo of my own in relation to the virus of violence which is infecting our society. I believe that the bodily integrity of individuals is guaranteed not just under the Constitution but under natural law and that the use of firearms and offensive weapons to inflict injury or worse or to intimidate by force and fear is utterly uncivilised, is a total affront to human dignity and merits the strongest possible response under our laws.  The powers available to the Garda Síochána to prevent such occurrences are clearly insufficient and must be expanded.  If in the process ancient frontier mentality notions, as in the US, have to be directly confronted or if there are accusations of infringement of civil liberties then so be it.  The powers and responsibilities given must of course be exercised by the Garda Síochána with strict observance of the law.  That is why I take the view that whatever powers are deemed necessary must be given to the Garda Síochána while at the same time I support bodies such as the Garda Síochána Complaints Board as the insurance that these powers will not be abused.  Very simply a Garda Síochána is a guardian of the peace and must be always in the frontline in absolutely unimpeachably upholding the law. If the law is insufficient it is our job, as legislators, to strengthen it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> While we are speaking of crime it is important that we do not overlook the underlying causes.  I have no doubt that unemployment and poverty are major factors.  The old saying that the devil finds work for idle hands is probably never more true than in a society with both an appalling unemployment rate and a huge incidence of crime.  It is beyond the scope of this Bill to focus on the economic failures which have produced these results but it is important to remind ourselves of the major social and economic challenges yet to be surmounted after 70 years of independence.</P>
    <P>There is one further general comment that needs to be made in this context. The serious question has to be addressed as to whether our penal system is actually contributing to the cycle of crime and violence in our society.  There are many people who year by year are put behind bars who should never be there.  The annual custodial committal total of about 4,000 includes 1,000 people lodged in jail for non-payment of fines and another 250 incarcerated for non-payment of debt. It also includes many minor offenders principally because the range of options available to the courts is insufficient to provide adequate alternatives to custody.</P>
    <P>I believe that prisons are for hardened criminals who should be kept there for the term of their sentences and not released for extraneous reasons of overcrowding. I also believe that for minor offenders and particularly the young, prisons can be a breeding ground for crime where the apprentice offender can learn the skills necessary to graduate to a full-time career in crime.  Surely we must take on board the well researched and strongly argued recommendations for alternatives to custody, the payment of fines by instalment, the proper resourcing of the probation and welfare service and the need to expand training and treatment facilities within our prisons.  The annual cost of custodial sentences at £30,000 a year each is a strong supporting fiscal argument in favour of this approach which clearly has both social and economic merit.</P>
    <P>Very clearly there is a strong case to <Col N="1950" /> outlaw stun guns which have no legitimate use.  I understand that over 2,000 such weapons have been sold here to date.  There is evidence in other countries of their use in very serious crime including murder.  The sooner we rid the country of these unwanted imports the better.  My only point of difference with the Minister is on the definition which I think is too narrow in being confined to weapons capable of inflicting an electric shock.  That definition is in section 4 and the actual wording is: &ldquo;any type of stun gun or other weapon for the infliction in whatsoever manner of an electric shock&rdquo;. Modern technology is such that shocks can or will be capable of being administered which strictly speaking will not be considered to be &ldquo;electric&rdquo;.  There is the recent horse racing case in the UK where binoculars were fitted with a mechanism for the purpose of nobbling the horse. On the basis of the reports of the case such an instrument would be exceedingly dangerous in the hands of a criminal here. I doubt that it would be covered by this definition.  To make doubly sure, I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to cover the point.</P>
    <P>A further cause of concern which should be fully clarified by the Minister concerns imitation firearms.  These are often used in robberies.  They can hardly come within the definition of lethal weapons from which shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged.  To a large extent criminal intent is obvious only when used to intimidate for criminal purposes. I wonder if any thought has been given to whether the possession of such articles without lawful authority or a reasonable excuse might constitute an offence.  I appreciate that there are difficulties in drafting such a section in a society where the distinction between an imitation firearm and a toy gun is not terribly obvious.  This question should be raised because, as I understand it, there is clear evidence that there is much use of imitation or replica firearms in robberies.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with crossbows. They fall into a different category and have a history going back through the centuries.  From pre-historic times the <Col N="1951" /> bow, in its many forms, was used as a principal weapon of war and hunting. I gather that in continental Europe in particular the crossbow was widely used both in warfare and hunting and was much more favoured than the Robin Hood type long bow.  The bow was displaced as a weapon of war in the 15th century but in the intervening years activities with the bow evolved into the modern sport of archery.  There has been a phenomenal growth in interest in archery since the thirties to such an extent that now about 10 million people engage in the sport throughout the world, 80 per cent of whom are in the United States. Many disabled people also engage in this sport.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, crossbows have been used with criminal intent.  If I recollect rightly a Garda was shot and injured with a crossbow by a person who was resisting arrest.  These bows have been found in the possession of people of very dubious character, including people suspected of drug dealing and those having connections with subversive organisations.  Again if I recall correctly, some years ago a person in England was murdered with a crossbow.  The approach adopted in the Bill where crossbows will not be totally banned but strictly controlled and available for legitimate purposes, sporting and recreational, and no other purpose, is correct.</P>
    <P>Action was clearly necessary in regard to the use of knives and similar weapons. I fully agree that the possession of such instruments in the circumstances proposed by the Bill should constitute an offence.  Too many stabbings and deaths have been caused by people using knives and action to restrict their use and possession for lawful purposes only is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>If I have a quibble about the Bill it is that there is no definition of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo;.  This, coupled with putting the onus on the defence, contrary to the view of the Law Reform Commission whose views we cannot dismiss lightly, gives cause for pause and questioning. We are touching on very basic concepts <Col N="1952" /> here and while I understand the reasons for not including a definition of lawful authority in the Bill, we should tease out the situation fully.  Before taking the quantum leap proposed in the Bill, perhaps a statutory definition of lawful authority might be included on Committee Stage.  I have in mind people like fishermen to whom a knife is a tool of their trade.  We have to be very careful that we do not go overboard, if I may coin a phrase, and restrict the legitimate use of knives by people who use them as tools of their trade.  I want knives and similar instruments to be restricted when they are used, or likely to be used, for criminal purposes, but we should pause and consider whether there will be an over-restriction from the point of view of people who use them legitimately.</P>
    <P>Most of the other points I have to raise are more appropriate to Committee Stage.  However, the power of search without warrant provided for in section 15 may be inadequate.  The power to search is given to the Garda but there is no power to require a suspected person in such circumstances to accompany a garda to a Garda station for the purposes of being searched.  I want to paint a scenario to which some thought should be given.</P>
    <P>For instance, where there are 15,000 or 20,000 people present at a rock concert &mdash;I must confess that I have never been privileged to attend one and for all I know the numbers might be bigger&mdash;the normal Garda deployment would probably be no more than 100 and perhaps only about 25 of them would be on duty in the field where the rock concert is being held.  The rest would probably be outside looking after traffic arrangements and so on.  An incident could occur in which it may reasonably be suspected that an offensive weapon was used to inflict injury on a person.  Suspicion might fall on a particular group but there might only be a handful of gardaí availble at that time in the area of the field where the incident occurred and in such circumstances it might not be prudent or practical for the gardaí to use the power of search there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> I want to draw to the attention of the House to the fact that there is a precedent in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, where a member of the Garda Síochána may require a suspected person to accompany him to a Garda station for the purposes of being searched at that station.  It might be more appropriate to carry out such a search in a Garda station rather than in the company of 15,000 or 20,000 people who are attending a rock concert.  The Bill should be amended to include such a power and I will be tabling an amendment accordingly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the new section 5 dealing with the Council of Europe Convention which was inserted since the Bill was originally circulated.  I agree that we should adopt the Convention in full and apply both the notification and the double authorisation system provided for in it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue and I want to see it enacted without delay.  I endorse the principles established in the Bill and fully support them.  Any residual concerns in regard to loopholes or otherwise can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill. The spokesmen on justice on this side of the House are only too well aware that since this session started the Minister for Justice has been very active introducing various pieces of legislation dealing with many areas of criminal activity and how to deal with them.  This is very welcome. For example, had the Larceny Bill, the Video Recordings Bill, the Criminal Law Bill and the Prevention of Incitement to Hatred Bill &mdash; to give it its shorter title. His predecessor, Deputy Collins, in his last year in the Department of Justice has those Bills prepared and introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the efforts being made to deal with the problem of crime, particularly in the Dublin metropolitan area. The old saying about having more law than is needed appears to be correct but we have less justice.  It is not enough for us to continue to introduce new measures to deal with criminals or those likely to turn to crime, or to impose stricter fines of longer custodial sentences if, on the <Col N="1954" /> other hand, we heap all of this on the shoulders of the Garda Síochána.  It is worth recalling that in the last four or five years Garda numbers have reduced by 1,000.  The easiest thing to do is to introduce legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas but the most costly, and more important work must be carried out by the Garda Síochána.  When we are considering Estimates we are told of proposals to appoint more gardaí and of efforts to make the force more efficient. I look forward to the appointment of clerical staff to Garda stations so that uniform members can be put on the beat. I would prefer to see gardaí on the beat than doing such mundane work as compiling records or filling up forms.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand for more staff at the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions so that those who are convicted are not left in gaol for a long time while awaiting appeal.  It is wrong that people should have to wait for long periods before they are tried before a court. We have many laws that could be used in our battle against crime, but we do not have enough gardaí to deal with the offenders.  There is a need to treat our prisoners in a more enlightened fashion. Our prisons are overcrowded with people who committed petty crimes.  I understand that about 25 per cent of the prison population have been committed for the non-payment of fines.  They are not hardened criminals and I do not think they should be confined to prison.  In my view prisons are for hardened criminals who have committed grievous crimes.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the poor conditions in our overcrowded prisons.</P>
    <P>It is not right that three or four prisoners should be pushed into a cell.  We have one prison for women, Mountjoy, and as a result women who are sentenced to prison terms in any part of the country are transported to Dublin.  Family members and friends anxious to see those prisoners must pay a lot of money in travelling expenses.  If a person is from Cork, Kerry or Mayo, family and friends of that person face huge travelling costs. If the person in prison is the provider for <Col N="1955" /> the household those who remain at home will suffer a greater sentence.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the legislation it is important that we should call for improvements in the treatment of prisoners.  There is a need for greater efficiency in dealing with offenders and they should be given more humane treatment. More money should be spent providing better conditions in our prisons.</P>
    <P>Most Members have called for action against those found in possession of firearms and other offensive weapons.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad last February and because we were engaged in other activities in the meantime, its passage to this House was delayed.  We had an unusually long holiday but we are now pressing ahead and dealing with outstanding legislation.  I welcome the inclusion of stun guns and crossbows in the Bill.  I was pleased to hear the Minister says he will consider any suggestions we make in regard to the Bill.  I do not think there is a great need to spend a long time on the Second Stage debate because the important work will be done on Committee Stage.  Very few people will be disappointed at the decision to include stun guns.  I cannot see any justification for them and I do not know of any great demand for them.  They are a dangerous toy that could cause a great deal of harm. They have the effect of paralysing people for a short time.  I am disappointed that in the Seanad, or today, we have not been given any medical evidence of the psychological or physical damage stun guns can cause.  I imagine people with heart conditions could almost die from the shock of a stun gun.  It is important that we are given the medical evidence of the damage stun guns can cause.</P>
    <P>I am delighted crossbows have been included.  I was amused to hear Deputy O'Keefe giving us the history of crossbows. We are all aware that they were in common use at the time of Strongbow, Robin Hood and so on.</P>

      <P>The crossbow is a very sophisticated bow and arrow and the speed at which the bolt, which is the technical name for the arrow, can travel is unbelievable.  It can also travel for longer distances than the old-fashioned bow and arrow and is almost as accurate as a rifle.  There is no place for them in our society.  I believe that crossbows with a draw weight of 1.5 kilograms and above will be prohibited under this Bill. However, I wonder whether all types of crossbows should be covered under the Bill because in the wrong hands a crossbow is deadly dangerous.  I think we should ban all crossbows in the areas in which the Bill intends to ban them.  We are well aware that archery is an Olympic sport, but it is a dangerous sport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am reminded that shooting is also dangerous.  If crossbows were only used for sport we would not need to enact the legislation before us.  We know that guns, stun guns, crossbows or whatever are the weapons of criminals and they must be taken out of general circulation.  If used for sport, they must be used in controlled environments. The level of break-ins to premises where offensive weapons are known to be kept for sporting purposes means that the weapons fall into the wrong hands.  I agree with the provisions in the Bill.  However, I would like the Minister to explain in <Col N="1957" /> more detail the provisions on draw weights and whether all bows will be covered under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with knives and extends to knives that were not included in legislation previously.  We are all aware that the flick-knife is a most offensive weapon, which is imported into this country from America or the Continent. The banning of the importation of weapons will go a long way to preventing these knives getting into the wrong hands.  It is difficult to legislate for knives because the carving knife in everybody's home is an offensive weapon if used on a person.  It is difficult to draw the line. The modern carving knives are offensive-looking weapons and one hopes that one does not have a row at home because I would not like to push too far someone handling one of these knives.  We could find that carving knives would come within the legislation if they were used outside the household.  Section 5 (4) defines a &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  Somebody carrying knives in my county, Wicklow, is more likely to be a girl guide or a boy scout or campers going across the Wicklow Way and they would be carrying knives to prepare their food, and I am concerned that this Bill may put them in a difficult position.  I wonder if they could be excluded from the provisions of the Bill?</P>
      <P>The Swiss Army knife, which we are told is a pocket knife, has about 14 blades, and can remove stones from horses hooves etc., and I wonder if it is covered under the Bill, as it could fall within the description of a flick-knife. This is a very popular knife for the camper, the hiker and the fisherman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the possession of silencers.  I do not think that anyone needs to buy a silencer, except in exceptional cases, unless he has some criminal intent.  We have been given the example that a veterinary surgeon or someone concerned with the destruction of animals may require a silencer in built-up areas, but outside the built-up areas there should be no requirement for anybody to buy a silencer.  I welcome the fact <Col N="1958" /> that the Bill prohibits the possession or sale of silencers.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the reckless discharge of firearms.  I understood that this was dealt with in previous legislation, but if the Minister feels this should be extended, I welcome it.  Guns such as the .22 rifle may be discharged in rural areas but I understand that it is prohibited to discharge them in urban or built up areas. Certain parts of rural Ireland have been developed in recent times and in County Wicklow the scale of development of built-up areas is very obvious.  People discharge firearms when out for sport &mdash; I hasten to add that in Wicklow it is not for other activity &mdash; but because areas near Bray, Greystones and Arklow have been developed, we need to know if certain types of guns such as .22 rifles may be discharged within the confines of built-up areas, which may not be in urban areas.  The Minister should take the opportunity to explain this section in a little more detail.  A person discharging a gun may not be aware of the presence of somebody down the road or passing by in a car and could cause them injuries.</P>
    <P>The manufacture, importation and sale of offensive weapons is prohibited under section 11.  Most of the weapons covered by the Bill are imported; I do not think there is any manufacturer getting an IDA grant to set up in such a business.  It is important to cover the importation and sale of these weapons.  We know that not too far from this House, a shop is selling cudgels, machetes, flick-knives etc.  I hope that after this Bill is passed, this will cease.  We should be discouraging rather than encouraging people to get into this type of business.</P>
    <P>I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage.  As I have said, I welcome the Bill, as far as it goes.  It is useful that it be introduced and put on the stocks. These weapons are getting publicity in violent videos and films.  We are going some way to tackle the problem in the Video Recordings Bill and we are tackling the abuse of weapons in this Bill.  I welcome it in that respect.  I look forward to having the opportunity to go into much <Col N="1959" /> more detail on the various provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I remind the Minister that in introducing all these Bills it is also necessary to make sure that the Garda Síochána and our courts have the necessary equipment and sufficient personnel to enforce them.  When all of these various Bills are on the stocks we must turn to the more difficult task of providing the money and the wherewithal to ensure that those people who break the law are caught and dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say at the outset that it was sought to put the Bill in context by referring to statistics in recent Garda crime reports which indicate the extent of serious crime involving assault, wounding or aggravated burglary.  It was suggested that the incidence of such offences highlights the need for legislation of the kind before the House.  I am glad no one went any further than that.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to an expanding crime problem.  I am glad that to date we have not heard it suggested that we are a society in some way out of control or that crime is of such endemic proportions that we are facing a crisis. This has often been my experience prior to coming into the House to discuss issues of this kind.  It annoyed me intensely to have to listen to speakers seeking to make a case for further policing &mdash; which we all support &mdash; and stricter laws, arguing that we were a community out of control, perhaps arising out of the terrorism which faced us in the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important when we discuss legislation of this kind to put it in context.  I am glad that the Deputies who have spoken have not overstated or sought to exaggerate our position.  The figures indicate that there were 1,574 cases of assault involving wounding or injury.  This amounts to about 30 per week.  If one accepts the proposition that crime of this sort is primarily concentrated in urban areas, such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, this means that vast areas of our country, thankfully, are free of this type of heinous crime.  We are not a society <Col N="1960" /> out of control nor are there many crimes of assault involving serious injury.  That is not to say we should in any way be complacent or should not address the area of the law which this Bill attempts to address.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to do here is to bring outmoded law up-to-date so that our police force in policing potentially violent situations will be able to handle them more effectively.  I do not think we are addressing the problem posed by the serious armed criminal.  He or she is well catered for in the corpus of our criminal law.  The case of the person who goes out to rob with a weapon or the person who breaks into a house intent on causing injury is well covered under existing law.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to address in this Bill is the unfortunate development abroad of crowd trouble where people congregate, be it at concerts, soccer or football matches or large places of resort, such as dance halls and the like, which spills over into hooliganism.  In this context we will have to acknowledge that we, thankfully, do not suffer a problem of any great dimension in this regard.  We should note that the Irish football attender is now regarded as a model, both at home and abroad.  When we look at the difficulties being faced in Holland, where it is not unusual to find bombs being lobbed about among the civilian populace at football matches, or have regard to the unfortunate events which took place at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels not so long ago, we have to acknowledge that we have a lot to be thankful for.  Regard must be had and a compliment paid to the exemplary behaviour of Irish people, North and South, who travel abroad together to attend international football matches in which we have been so successful recently.</P>
    <P>Concerts now form an important feature of our tourism industry.  I pass my regrets to Deputy O'Keeffe.  We have learned a lot about his background.  He informed us that, unfortunately, he has not been to any pop concert of any dimension and that Robin Hood was one of his great heroes as a young man.  I sympathise with him as there is nothing more <Col N="1961" /> enjoyable than attending one of these larger events at which young people enjoy themselves.  They do not tend, and in the past have not tended, to resort to the kind of conduct which seems to mar concerts elsewhere.  One has only to think of the Altmont concert of the Rolling Stones and the horrible scenes depicted in the film of the Hell's Angels types knifing a man to death as he attempted to pull a gun and shoot at Mr. Jagger. Those kind of things do not visit us here and we must be very thankful about that.</P>
    <P>In the context of these mass meetings the issue of policing was raised.  It is an important one.  Obviously all of us would welcome a return to full strength of our police force.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he has plans afoot to do so but even with the numbers he is suggesting it will take anything between five and ten years, given the current length of training at Templemore, to get the full complement of our police force back on the street.</P>
    <P>One issue which arises here and which should be addressed is as follows.  In connection with many of these events, where vast profits are made by the promoters or organisers, no contribution is sought from the promoter or organiser towards the cost of policing.  For concerts, such as Siamsa Cois Laoí or those held at the RDS and Croke Park, large numbers of our police force have to be deployed to regulate traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, to and from the event and no contribution is sought from the promoter or organiser.  This is a major oversight on our part.  It would be a useful means of raising revenue as the holding of these events become more frequent and welcome.</P>
    <P>The question of penalty and imprisonment was referred to by previous speakers.  It is an important aspect of this legislation.  The Bill only makes reference to a penalty of a fine or imprisonment.  I accept this is the standard form used in penal legislation which comes before the House.  Provision is made in related legislation for a judge of the District Court to <Col N="1962" /> substitute a fine or a term of imprisonment with an order of community service or an order of probation.  While it may not be an issue which needs to be addressed in this Bill, nonetheless I make the point that I know of no legislation more appropriate to make provision for the use of the community service code, as a primary source of penalty.</P>
    <P>If one accepts my proposition that what we are seeking to address in this Bill are the people who resort to violence in a crowd, the most effective way to deal with these people is to put them to community service work where in time they will realise that they are members of a community and that they should care for the community in which they live.  This would be a useful and effective way to rehabilitate those people.  This is something the Minister might consider on Committee Stage so that we could introduce the concept of a non-custodial penalty for such offenders where appropriate.  I do not suggest that this Bill will deal exclusively with the people to which I am referring.  There is no doubt that hardened criminals will be stopped in their tracks moving to and from the scene of a crime and this Bill will cover that also but the majority of the offenders who will be covered by this legilation will not be hardened criminals but will be thoughtless young people drifting with a crowd or people who have been alienated from society.  Community work would be a better way of making these people realise that they can contribute effectively to society.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is sad that there is little commitment in the Estimates to the concept of a non-custodial penalty. Deputy Higgins is right in suggesting that we are locking away far too many people for the wrong reasons.  To lock people up for inability to pay fines, for non-payment of debt and for petty offences is wrong. The vast majority of prisoners are serving sentences of six months or less and we should question the financial cost involved and we should ask ourselves if anything useful is emerging in terms of the rate at which these people return to prison.  The only alternative is community <Col N="1963" /> service, the probation service, the non-custodial mechanism of punishment and control.  The small commitment in the Estimates as indicated by an increase of something of the order of £400,000 does not augur well for this proposition that has been repeated endlessly in this House, to move away from the use of the custodial penalty in so many of the instances in which it is used.</P>
    <P>While we can legislate for offences and try, through the criminal code, to regulate the activities of young people, particularly when they assemble in crowds, we cannot deal effectively with this type of crime problem and alienation until we deal with the root cause of poverty.  In some areas of the city and throughout the country there is 60 per cent and 70 per cent unemployment among our young people and they hang endlessly around street corners with no hope or prospects. They are becoming utterly alienated and disenchanted with the community.  It is not surprising that at the end of the day they resort to the mindless, thoughtless vandalism with which we are trying to deal in this Bill.  Until we can address those problems we will not ultimately beat the problem of vandalism and hooliganism.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's outright condemnation of vigilante activity.  In many housing areas in Dublin and elsewhere people are offended by the State by being obliged to live in squalor.  Official acts of assault are visited upon the poor when we oblige them to live in offensive conditions. In some of these areas an element of vigilante activity has arisen occasionally. Its primary, if not only, source here comes from Provisional Sinn Féin and IRA members.  They have operated in my constituency as self-appointed judges, jurors and executioners where they deem it necessary.  They have been confronted in the community and elsewhere by those who believe in the process of law and order and democracy.  It is with great dismay that I recall that after the successful prosecution of two of their number before the Special Criminal Court last year, a Member of this House <Col N="1964" /> sought to give character evidence in ease of penalty for a person who had been convicted of breaking into the home of an innocent person and imposing his own form of summary justice on that person. This House must be clear and unequivocal always in its condemnation of this form of activity, this type of thuggery that the IRA have learned to use so well in our neighbouring jurisdiction and are slowly but surely attempting to use here in the hope that they will reap a reward from it, the same type of political progress they appear to have gained temporarily in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill the issue of the martial arts was also raised because the Minister is attempting to address the proliferation of different forms of weapons, many of them of eastern origin. There is also a problem in dealing with the development of martial arts training. A lot of clubs are arming young people without weapons.  This must be considered at some stage by the Minister and his Department.  There should be some regulation and control of the martial arts clubs that are developing around the country.  Not too long ago in two separate incidents young constituents of mine were killed in hand-to-hand combat between the unfortunate deceased and a person trained in the martial arts code. It would be unfair to specify the type of martial art but it must be acknowledged that these clubs are unwittingly training many young people to be lethal in the use of their own limbs.  I accept that all the clubs and organisations are well intentioned but we need to introduce some code of control and licensing so that people who breach the rules can be effectively dealt with either in the clubs or outside.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised by the Bill is the long-standing Vagrancy Act, 1824.  This is the second time in this session alone that we have had to seek to introduce legislation to address this infamous legislation. We are seeking under section 14 to amend the Act further by the deletion of certain portions of it.  In the recently introduced Larceny Bill which we debated and which we will deal with on <Col N="1965" /> Committee Stage, we also attempted to amend the 1824 Vagrancy Act.  In the last session we dealt with two pieces of legislation that in some way impinged upon the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  For a long time we have demanded that that Act be entirely repealed.  This Act was mentioned in the Larceny Bill in the context of the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions against King where certain portions of it were found to be unconstitutional.  Is it not time that we do what groups like Simon have been asking us to do for so long, that is repeal once and for all that infamous legislation, the Vagrancy Act of 1924?  If there are features of the law that need to be updated and dealt with let us deal with them by way of a rational debate in this House, reflecting modern times, when the occasion arises.  But can any of us as legislators in a caring, modern society be happy that we are still regulated from the depths of the pre-Victorian age in Britain by legislation that was designed to deal with the movement of indigent rural landowners and workers into the urban sprawls in developing Britain after the Napoleonic wars?  Surely it is time to rid ourselves of the Vagrancy Act.  It is a great pity we do not take the opportunity of doing so on this occasion.  It is worth remembering in this context that until this Bill was introduced the primary law relating to the carrying of offensive weapons was the Act of 1824.  The 1916 Larceny Act dealt with the concept of the house-breaking implement, a concept which is now being sought to be dealt with and updated under the new Larceny Bill we are dealing with, but the primary leislation that has been in place dealing with the carrying of weapons of offence has been the Act of 1824 which refers to hangers, cutlasses, bludgeons, picklocks and a whole plethora, almost an endless litany, of offences.</P>
    <P>Another problem raised by the Bill and which should be dealt with at this stage relates to the dumping here of lethal weapons. It is recognised not only by us as legislators within the House but by the craven entrepreneur outside and living abroad that Ireland is at the moment fair <Col N="1966" /> game for the dumping of lethal weapons. It is quite clear that we have a huge problem of weapons of offence like the knives we see in our shops in the city and elsewhere being dumped here because they simply are illegal elsewhere.  Other people have passed laws to deal with this problem much earlier than is the case here.  It is recognised that we do not have effective legislation in place here but that we may have once our Bill is passed.  In the meantime there is huge dumping of lethal weapons on our markets.  I ask the Minister to move as quickly as possible to deal with this matter.  Deputy Garland has raised on a number of occasions the question the role the Director of Consumer Affairs could play in this regard as someone who could perhaps regulate dangerous toys on the markets, but I do not think that is adequate.  The Minister must and can move to ban importation of dangerous weapons and in some way regulate the disposal of the many thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these types of weapons that are already here with us.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a number of aspects of the Bill.  I welcome certainly the regulations in the various forms the Minister has sought in regard to the different types of weapons involved.  Let me deal with some of these briefly because I depart from the approach of the Minister in one or two respects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the banning and regulation of the use of silencers for firearms. Anyone who thinks this is not a problem can only be reminded of an incident that occurred in the city only a few months ago when a member of the legal profession appeared in court and was convicted of discharging a weapon, a rifle, with a silencer attached.  His explanation was that he, in the company apparently of a member of the Garda Síochána, was given to going around the green spaces and areas of the city shooting magpies because he believed magpies for some reason or other were beginning to take the upper hand in the avian world of the city.  Silencers are clearly implements that can facilitate the use of weapons, particularly in built-up areas, because who <Col N="1967" /> knows where and when some other solicitor, professional person or whoever might be about popping off magpies or some other unfortunate birds because of a belief?  It is important that silencers be controlled and restricted as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to the crossbow should be extended to include the longbow for this reason: if those who use the crossbow at the moment in circumstances which we want to try to regulate and control find themselves prohibited in that regard, they may easily turn to the use of the longbow if that is their penchant, their ways and means of dealing with people.  I had a persistent problem in my constituency where a difficult neighbour in a locality felt he could solve many of his problems by using a crossbow.  It took a long time and much argument to convince the gardaí at Coolock that they should confiscate the weapon.  The fear now of the residents living near that man is that he is going to resort to some other form of mechanically propelled weapon to deal with their inter-neighbour differences and disputes.  Again, the Bill covers crossbows of a certain poundage and drawweight; 1.4 kg is suggested.  I have looked briefly through the debates in the Seanad and have not been convinced that there is a good reason to introduce such a limit.  I ask the Minister, why have a limit at all?  Is there not a difficulty that a person confronted can claim that the poundage is below 1.4 kg in an effort to cause confusion?  How many more difficulties would it present for the prosecution in any case to prove that the poundage was above or below the level set?  There is a strong argument for suggesting that crossbows and other bows, be they long or otherwise, should be included as potential lethal weapons under the definition of the Firearms Acts as suggested under section 4.</P>
    <P>I welcome the restriction of the stun gun and the Minister's suggestion that its use as a means of crime deterrent is not legitimate or valid.  On the question of advising people that they should not seek to take the law into their own hands, <Col N="1968" /> again a problem is developing, that is the problem of the para-policeman who is to be seen right around our community and very close to this House.  The number of security firms now in our city and elsewhere is remarkable.  What is more remarkable is how daily they are becoming more like properly empowered policemen or members of the Garda Síochána.  I recall a case some time ago in the Dublin District Court when a bouncer or security man from a shop was being cross-examined.  The district justice was outraged, not only at the attire and demeanour of this man &mdash; he wore a blue shirt and a blue tie and, to all intents and purposes his attire looked like the uniform of a member of the Garda &mdash; but he had also developed the language and demeanour of a garda, even in the witness box, to the extent that he was claiming powers of arrest that it had never been contemplated he should have.  This illustrates the problem that has to be looked at in this whole area of the use of many of these weapons.  Again their use must be regulated in time.  It is not a matter directly of this Bill but it arises in the context of the people who use and will seek to use many of the weapons under licence from the Bill once it is passed.  It is a problem of security forces and the increasing tendency to dress these people up to look like policemen and to cause confusion in the minds of the public when confronted by them.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill, which deals with one of the primary areas, the regulation of and control in the use of knives, runs into serious difficulties and trouble.  One of the objectives of any piece of criminal legislation should be that it states the law clearly, simplistically, and that it makes it easy for the public generally to understand what is being done and regulated and sought to be achieved.  We know the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, but if we want to stand full square on that principle, there should be respect for the corollary, and that is the law should be easily understood and intelligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in seeking to maintain a balance, perhaps, has gone overboard <Col N="1969" /> into the realm of mild obscurity in this area.  Section 5 is grossly cumbersome and should be simplified as much as possible. The Minister says we should have a balance between trying to regulate and control the use of the lethal knife or weapon on the one hand and respect the innocent area of the pocket knife on the other.  Consequently, section 8 (1) prohibits the carrying of any knife or sharply pointed implement in dance halls, club premises, or basically, places of public entertainment and resort.  In those places one can carry only a folding pocket knife. If a person goes to a dance or a public place of resort, he must leave the straight knife at home, but he may carry the pocket knife, and when the time comes, if it does, there is nothing to stop him opening the blade and carrying on as he would have had he taken the fixed implement with him.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to suggest that in all other instances one cannot have a flick-knife, or &mdash; and I quote from section 8 (2) (b)&mdash;</P>
    <P>any other article whatsoever made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person,</P>
    <P>While we want to address the concept of the flick-knife in subsection (2) we are including the folding pocket knife, because it clearly can be any article whatsoever capable of causing an injury.  Why the difference?</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states that it shall be unlawful to have any such weapon for the purposes of seeking to incapacitate or intimidate.  That is fair enough.  The high watermark of confusion arises in subsection (4) and if the Ceann Comhairle will allow me I wish to quote it.  I have read it numerous times and short of standing on my head and reading it again I have difficulty understanding it.  How therefore can we hope any member of the public to understand it?  Subsection (4) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for an offence under subsection (3), it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to allege or prove <Col N="1970" /> that the intent to cause injury, incapacitate or intimidate was intent to cause injury to, incapacitate or intimidate a particular person; and if, having regard to all the circumstances (including the type of the article alleged to have been intended to cause injury, incapacitate or intimidate, the time of the day or night, and the place), the court (or the jury as the case may be) thinks it reasonable to do so, it may regard possession of the article as sufficient evidence of intent in the absence of any adequate explanation by the accused.</P>
    <P>I wonder what we are trying to achieve. I will read it again and I hope that by Committee Stage I will understand it a little better.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for different penalties other than those that would apply in the case of the plain pocket knife. Subsection (6) goes on to describe a public place &mdash; which is, basically, anywhere. I wonder whether it needs to be defined as it has been judically determined in the context of other legislation, in particular, the Road Traffic Acts.  Subsection (7) attempts to define &ldquo;flick-knife&rdquo;. I have no doubt that when this law comes to be enforced, before our courts, the lawyers will play havoc with the definitions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the provisions in section 8 at some length because I think we should be banning and restricting the use of all knives simpliciter, allowing for, in all instances, the standard defence that a reasonable excuse, proffered by the accused will be adequate and providing for that situation to arise whether in a private or public place; whether it is within the confines of our own home, on the street, in a public place, at a concert or whatever.  That should be the legislative framework in which to draft the law in this area.  All weapons of offence should be banned and regulated except by licence; that should apply in public and private places and an accused, where charged, should have the right of establishing a reasonable excuse as a good and adequate defence for the possession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> I have no doubt there will be those who say I am being illiberal in this approach. If it is looked at in a clear and reserved way it must be accepted as the only effective way of dealing with the law in this area and provide an easy formula which is readily understood and which does not provide for any confusion in understanding. Every implement is capable of creating offence, even the most innocuous piece of stick can be used to gouge the eye and cause untold injury.  Every implement, be it domestic or otherwise, is capable of offence inside and outside the home &mdash; in a public place or in a private place.  Equally, every potential weapon of offence is capable of innocent explanation.  Let us not worry about the boy scouts, cub scouts and girl guides who walk through the Wicklow Mountains and elsewhere.  Any police officer observing that type of activity will immediately know, and is equipped to know, that that represents a legititmate and innocent explanation.</P>
    <P>Equally, the man who takes out a pocket knife, scrapes the bowl of his pipe, replaces it with the plug and puts the knife back in his pocket is using it in innocent circumstances and need have no worry or fear regarding the law.  A person who carries a Swiss pocket knife in a public place, to a concert or anywhere else, who, when found in possession of it, can offer a reasonable explanation to the officer confronting him, has nothing to fear from the formula I suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the balanced approach of recognising that we must respect the myriad ways in which people in a community can carry knives, and pocket knives in particular.  I agree and I do not think that the formula I advocated would in any way take from respect for that innocent use of the pocket knife. Every case will be examined on the facts and the simplistic formula approach is preferable to the régime which the Minister sought to introduce.</P>
    <P>Arguments will arise in relation to a flick knife.  What is it?  What is a folding pocket knife?  What is a public place? What is a public resort?  What is a bazaar?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> What is a carnival?  What is an outdoor concert or, as the section says, a place where people are likely to congregate? All these questions will create massive areas of judicial and legislative interpretative debate when the issues arise.  I am worried that the legislation in this important area may prove substantially unworkable, cumbersome and difficult.  I ask the Minister to look again at that whole area.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that perhaps I would be criticised for being illiberal in my approach to this issue, but I remember a similar debate arising in the context of metal detectors.  At that time I advocated that we should ban the use of metal detectors in all circumstances as a means of allowing for the easy policing of their use ultimately.  I said that gradually &mdash; and in circumstances where a case has been made &mdash; we should allow for their use with a licence.  I did not win the argument on the day but, subsequently, people in the area of architectural protection and heritage and those in metal detector clubs have suggested that, perhaps, that might have been the better way of doing it because the law as it stands was &mdash; and is &mdash; impossible to police.  A policeman presented with this range of law providing for different circumstances and weapons will find it difficult, if not impossible, to implement.  On the other hand, the bad intentioned person who owns a fixed weapon, when going to a concert or public place where people are likely to congregate, will leave it at home and bring the folding pocket knife instead. Therefore, that person is not covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the powers of search warrants in section 11 there is the problem of granting the power of issuing such a warrant to a peace commissioner.  I do not believe we should give such powers to peace commissioners, for two reasons.  First, constitutionally, their status has been called into question by the higher courts, particularly as an authority to initiate and sign summonses for the commencement of criminal proceedings.  Equally, when the time comes for the matter to be debated the higher courts will have constitutional <Col N="1973" /> reservations regarding powers to give authority to people to invade the home of another.</P>
    <P>My second reason for opposing such powers is because of my experience as a practitioner.  It was brought home to me very forcefully one day in 1984 or 1985 when I visited Lucan Garda Station one Sunday morning to see a client who was detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  I was conducted to a waiting room which was clearly used by the gardaí normally for their business. As I sat at the desk waiting for the client to be brought in, I noticed the rubber stamp which I picked up and let fall on my pad of paper.  I discovered that the name of a peace commissioner came out on the reverse of the impression.  He was available by means of a rubber stamp.  It brought home to me what I believe and suspect to be the practice in many instances like this.  In some instances &mdash; not all &mdash; peace commissioners simply leave their rubber stamp signature at the local Garda station for convenience.  This illustrates the status and level to which this office has, unfortunately, been allowed to fall.</P>
    <P>Another incident concerned a public business owned by a peace commissioner in my constituency.  I noticed that the secretary at the reception desk was signing warrants for the local Garda at the direction of the peace commissioner who was too busy to attend to them.  I suspect that this practice is endemic in the practice of this office and we should have more regard for the judicial process.  I will be proposing an amendment that peace commissioners will be deleted from the enabling provision for the issuing of warrants in this area.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in the Bill underlining and providing for corporate responsibility for offences committed by a member of a company or by a company in the practice of importation, sale and distribution of lethal weapons.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will provide no safeguard or recourse for a company member who is negligent or answerable in this context to hide behind the veil of corporate security.  It is important that if a <Col N="1974" /> company has to answer to the law any officer acting and responsible within the company can also be made answerable under the law.</P>
    <P>Importers and those the sell lethal weapons prohibited under the Bill are covered but those who service, maintain or repair these weapons are not included. This was debated in the Seanad.  Section 8 deals with any person who manufactures, sells or hires or offers or exposes offensive weapons for sale or hire or has them in his possession for the purpose of sale or hire or display, etc.  That definition may not cover a person who repairs an implement of this sort.  We know that many of the weapons available have been adapted for particular lethal use and I am concerned to get at the people who adapt them.  I worry that the Bill is not wide enough in dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party welcome this Bill as constituting an important updating of the laws stretching back to the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  We will certainly assist its passage through Committee Stage.  I hope that the Minister, who has indicated that he will be receptive to points made on Committee Stage, will facilitate some amendment to render it even more workable and effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the introduction of this Bill which affords us an opportunity to tackle street violence. There have been outbreaks of such violence at such events as football matches, in dance halls, at discos and even at the seaside when we have observed the amount of suffering inflicted on people.</P>
      <P>The general problem of the maintenance of law and order, the increasing incidence of violence nationwide and the fears now felt by many ordinary people have been ignored for far too long by us politicians.  We have tended to leave the responsibility for tackling the problems of law and order to the Garda.  Despite their excellent work, much more needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my hope that the introduction of this Bill will signal a new awareness of the problems pertaining to <Col N="1975" /> the maintenance of law and order and will constitute the first of many initiatives in this area.  I look forward to its early implementation.  It is a sad reflection on Irish life that a Bill &mdash; seeking to extend the definition of &ldquo;firearms&rdquo; for the purposes of the Firearms Acts, seeking to render it unlawful to carry on trading in dangerous or offensive weapons in certain circumstances &mdash; should be so essential at this time.  Unfortunately, over the past 20 years this country has become a much more violent and dangerous place. The fact of the matter is that violence and lawlessness constitute a real problem now.  There are many no-go areas now in many of our towns and cities with older citizens in particular living in fear much of the time that they may be the subject of some horrendous attack or robbery.</P>
    <P>The extent of violence can be gleaned from an examination of the report of the Garda Commissioner on crime in 1988. For example, in 1988 there were 20 murders and 11 cases of manslaughter, a huge increase in former years, but it gives a small indication only of the extent of violence perpetrated today.  For example, last year there were 35,679 offences against property in the commission of which violence was used.  A huge proportion of such cases occur in the Dublin area but are by no means confined to Dublin; they are taking place right across the country.  I am sure every Member of this House will be aware of incidents having taken place in their constituencies, incidents of crime in which violence has been used, leaving people living in fear.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from many people living in rural areas in County Limerick who are endeavouring to get local authority housing in towns within the county.  They feel they can no longer live in the countryside for fear of being terrorised, attacked or robbed by gangs who prey on their vulnerability.  That is an appalling state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the increased incidence of violence.  Some must be the spill-over effects of the past 20 years of violence in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1976" /> during which time respect for life has been treated with such contempt.  There are also the economic difficulties which have aroused such a sense of hopelessness and almost alienation on the part of many of our young people in addition to the influence of the often glamourised violence seen on our television screens. However, it is obvious that the easy availability of dangerous weapons and young people's familiarity with their usage, particularly with regard to knives, must constitute a major factor in the overall incidence of crime.  It is welcome to note that the provisions of this Bill are intended to tackle this problem.  In particular I welcome the provisions with regard to the use of stun guns and knives. Indeed the provisions of this Bill anticipate the threat of the use of stun guns &mdash; much to be recommended &mdash; rather than reacting later when bitter experience will have shown how great is their threat.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the manner in which the Minister has approached the question of crossbows.  As an essential instrument of a legitimate, well organised sport, the question of the overall use of crossbows is somewhat different.  At the same time it has to be said they are an absolutely lethal weapon.  It is my opinion that the provisions of the Bill strike a good balance in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the long term the sections dealing with the use of knives and other offensive weapons in an intimidating manner will prove to be the most important for the majority of our population because of the extraordinarily easy availability of often lethal knives and other weapons such as sharpened screwdrivers used much in brawls, fights and generally to intimidate and terrorise people.  We have been somewhat lucky here in that we have avoided some of the appalling large-scale violence witnessed across the water at football matches and so on.  At the same time we have witnessed here in recent weeks incidents of violence in which knives have been used in the course of attacks.</P>
    <P>The continuing breakdown in the maintenance of law and order and the increased incidence of violence constitute <Col N="1977" /> the most urgent problems to be tackled here.  It is my belief that the provisions of this Bill constitute a valuable beginning in that direction.  I would hope there will be further action forthcoming to safeguard our citizens who are endeavouring to live in peace, comfort and safety.  The Garda Síochána must be given the greatest possible back-up in enforcing the law in combating violence on our streets and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. When first initiated there was concern expressed by people involved in the cutlery trade.  For example, the largest knife manufacturer in the country, Imperial Stag, based in Listowel, expressed concern about its provisions.  The fact that its provisions have been substantially amended by the Seanad has helped to allay their fears.  I understand they are now generally happy with its provisions. The management of Imperial Stag expressed concern about the provisions of section 11 (4).  If any such order is placed before this House it should be an affirmative one, to be considered by all sides, to ensure that it would not affect the cutlery business here.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the introduction of this Bill in itself is a reflection of the violence obtaining in our society, it being necessary to tackle the problems caused by the ossession of knives and other offensive weapons, such as stun guns and crossbows.  There have been a number of serious indicents recently in Dublin, Limerick and elsewhere that have given rise to grave public concern.  Deputy Clohessy and others mentioned such incidents.  Nonetheless severe penal legislation does not cure crime; it may help in the fight against crime but, in itself, does not totally protect society.  Indeed one wonders if such legislation has much effect when one takes into account the overcrowding of our prisons, the lack of space, rehabilitation facilities and so on. Nonetheless the provision of legislation constitutes an essential part of the legislative function, striking a correct balance. It is well known that much of our criminal legislation is very much out-of-date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Many Bills passed merely constitute minor amendments of Principal Acts &mdash; as does this one &mdash; covering a range of legislation from 1925 to 1989.  That point was made effectively by Deputy McCartan.  That renders much of the legislation incomprehensible to a large section of the community at whom its provisions are directed.  For example, those people most affected by the provisions of this Bill probably will hear about them in court only.  For that reason in many cases they cannot account for their actions.</P>
    <P>We must tackle crime, particularly urban crime, as a matter of urgency.  If the present trend continues it will severely damage our tourism industry and our international reputation in world tourism markets.  Attacks on tourists on the streets of Dublin, Limerick and Cork will have a negative effect on our image abroad.  We must try to create a climate of opinion which is anti-terrorist crime, whereby it is not seen as either macho or republican.  Bills such as this make no impact on the minds of many of our people.</P>
    <P>The serious consequences of the possession of firearms, knives, stun guns and offensive weapons prompts me to suggest that a major review of the causes and cures of crime should be undertaken by a study group or commission.  There are obviously some causes which are peculiar to this country, as well as causes which are found internationally.  If we are to build a large industrial and tourism base and have a future for our young people it is important that the whole idea of the prevention and detection of crime should be gone into.</P>
    <P>Crime is a costly social ill in terms of personnel and property.  Therefore, I suggest that a commission or study group should be set up to carry out an in-depth survey of the causes of crime and to suggest possible cures.  There are obviously environmental, social, hereditary, economic and employment causes, as well as feelings of alienation and the influence of drugs and videos.  An array of complex social issues should be considered.  As to cures, consideration must be given to <Col N="1979" /> prevention, retribution, rehabilitation, police problems and facilities, court systems, prison systems and the probation service.</P>
    <P>The public attitude to crime will have to be changed from indifference and some tolerance to a strong feeling that crime is bad for society and that criminals whom we call professionals are the scourge of society.  This may entail a major public relations operation because unfortunately there is a great deal of tolerance of the so-called &ldquo;political crime&rdquo; and great fear of the professional criminals. Often very little thought is given to victims of crime.  Victim support systems are not properly funded.  Organisations such as Community Watch should be encouraged.  However, there are certain developments like the so-called &ldquo;angels&rdquo; about which one must wonder seriously. We may reach the stage where people think they can take the law into their own hands; at times they feel they have no choice.  It is extraordinary that in Washington teenagers are under curfew and must be off the streets at night.  We could reach that stage if this legislation is not effective.</P>
    <P>The whole question needs to be examined in the context of our society and the likely developments in 1992 when borders will be swept away and there will be much freer movement of criminals, drugs and all types of offensive weapons. We must be careful not to become a haven for European criminals.</P>
    <P>Search warrants and the powers of peace commissioners have been mentioned. I understand there is some doubt about these powers and that section 14 confers powers on peace commissioners which may be unconstitutional, having regard to a number of cases during the past few years.  The Minister when replying should deal with this section and allay the fears expressed, particularly by Deputy McCartan.  His background as a barrister gives him more knowledge in this matter than I would have.  In view of the fears expressed I should like the section to be considered again.</P>
    <P>Pre-trial procedures and remedies <Col N="1980" /> must be legislated for.  I was interested in the Minister's reference to the interim report of the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Hamilton.  I agree with the committee that suitable amendments to give effect to a number of their recommendations should be incorporated in this Bill.  We have an opportunity now which may not occur again. The report will be published shortly and we should incorporate some of the recommendations.  Deputies on all sides would be anxious that this should be done.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in having very well disciplined supporters following our international teams, especially our football team.  Visiting teams could, however, bring with them undesirable elements. Fears have been expressed about the visit of the English football team next March. We need legislation to ensure that these people will not cause violent scenes and inflict injuries on the general public or on Irish soccer supporters.  That is why this type of legislation is vital.  In England there is legislation to control the use of knives and other weapons but we have had no such control here.  I hope the visit of the English team will be a very orderly affair.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I hope will be effective in dealing with the problems addressed and in ensuring public safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the opportunity of hearing the Minister's speech or the replies by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy McCartan because I was elsewhere dealing with the Companies Bill.  I listened to part of Deputy Deenihan's contribution and I thank him for a most constructive speech of the type we have come to expect from him.  I compliment the Minister for Justice on once again taking the initiative and bringing this major piece of criminal legislation before the House.  This is the second major legislative initiative undertaken by him in the six months since his appointment.  He has undertaken various other initiatives such as the appointment of the Martin Committee which will examine the various <Col N="1981" /> aspects of criminal procedure particularly pertaining to confessions and interrogation of suspects.  He has also taken some initiatives with regard to Garda recruitment and training.  If Deputy Burke continues in this vein, he will certainly gain a place in history as one of the great reforming Ministers for Justice.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the Bill before us that I want to address.  Section 11 deals with people who are manufacturing, selling, hiring or offering for sale, or hire, or by way of business repairs etc., certain weapons which are prohibited under the Bill.  As initially drafted &mdash; this Bill originated in the Seanad &mdash; this section was somewhat slightly different.  It has been changed as a result of an amendment proposed in the Seanad by Senator Joe O'Toole.  That amendment was considered and generously taken on board by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, now Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I want to compliment Senator O'Toole for having the initiative and the ingenuity to spot the defect in the legislation and to propose the amendment, and the then Minister, Deputy Gerry Collins, for having the generosity to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Companies Bill which we have been discussing, this legislation initiated in the Seanad.  I would suggest respectfully to the Minister and to the Government that they use the Seanad more to initiate legislation.  It is a desirable development that more legislation be initiated there and I hope it is a development that continues.  I certainly have benefited greatly from reading the Seanad debates on this legislation and I am sure the Minister has also.  The relevance of the Seanad has been called into question on a number of occasions recently.  I think anybody who reads the Seanad debate on this legislation, and indeed on the Companies legislation, will fully appreciate the relevance of that House.  I believe there should be more democracy; there should be more representative bodies, more TDs and more Senators &mdash; maybe a third House of the Oireachtas.  I stand firmly and solidly over that belief.  I will resist the temptation to refer to certain <Col N="1982" /> people who see fit to condemn the Seanad and announce from the rooftops that they are working for its abolition while at the same time accepting seats in it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is basically designed to do two things: to change the legislation on firearms so as to bring within the ambit of that legislation these two items known as stun guns and crossbows and to seek to make it unlawful in specific circumstances to carry on or trade in dangerous or offensive weapons.  As I have said, I did not have the opportunity of listening to the Second Stage speeches from the other side of the House but I think it will be agreed on all sides that there is need to extend the controls in the present firearms legislation.  There will be no reasonable person who could dispute that.</P>
    <P>During the Seanad debate one of the Senators &mdash; I think it was Senator John A. Murphy; I apologise for not being able to give the exact reference &mdash; quoted statistics from the United States which showed that in 1985 and 1986 the number of people who were murdered, killed or manslaughtered, whatever you want to call it, by firearms in circumstances of violence in relation to the commission of various offences, equalled the number of American lives lost in the Vietnam war. That is a frightening statistic.  There is no doubt that since 1970, with the outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland, firearms-related offences have proliferated in this country.  There is also no doubt that with developments in technology in manufacturing and so on, other items which do not emit a bullet or what is called a shot but emit an electric pulse, such as stun guns, have come on the market.  Another example is crossbows.  The Minister is seeking to bring these weapons within the ambit of the firearms legislation.  I have seen people carrying them to football matches in my own constituency.  They are horrendous-looking weapons and it is high time that we brought them within very firm and rigid control.</P>
    <P>In bringing stun guns and crossbows within the ambit of firearms legislation, it means that in order to acquire those items a person will have to have a certificate from a superintendent or, as I <Col N="1983" /> understand it, an inspector who is designated for the purpose by his superintendent. That is something that has been demanded for the past five to ten years, with increasing frequency and increasing vigour, by the Garda and the security forces.  Under existing firearms legislation a person needs a certificate in order to acquire a firearm.  If that person is refused a certificate by the local Garda superintendent, I have discovered through experience that his only recourse is by way of appeal to the High Court to have the decision of the Garda superintendent judicially reviewed.  While recognising the imperative need for controls, something will have to be done about this.  Any practising solicitor can tell you how this works in practice.  It is not the superintendent who makes the decision; it is made through his office. What happens in practice is that the man goes to the local Garda station and the superintendent will act on the recommendations of the local gardaí.</P>
    <P>I know of circumstances in my own constituency where, because of some personal dispute involving an individual and a member of the Garda in the local Garda station, that person was blocked from getting a firearm certificate.  The recommendation was that this man was not a suitable man to hold a firearms certificate. Apart from the stigma that is involved, almost invariably people who seek firearms certificates in this lawful, constitutional way want to use them for legitimate, bona fide purposes such as sporting purposes and they are prevented from exercising their right to engage in firearms-related sporting activities.  They have to bear the stigma in a local community of not being fit persons to hold a firearms certificate, because certainly in rural areas this kind of news gets around.</P>
    <P>In remote rural areas where there is an incestuous atmosphere, where the local garda lives side by side with the local population, naturally disputes arise and people fall out.  It is known in certain rural parts of my constituency that if you want to get firearms certificate it is very dangerous to fall out with a member of <Col N="1984" /> the local Garda.  That is something that should be reviewed.  It is not feasible, just or equitable that an ordinary individual &mdash; maybe somebody who is unemployed &mdash; who is refused a firearms certificate at his local Garda station, through the office of the superintendent, should have to go to the High Court and persuade the judge that the local superintendent acted unreasonably in refusing a certificate. Strictly speaking that might be outside the ambit of this Bill but it should be looked at and is a suggestion that has merit in its own right.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes the insertion of a new subsection after section 10 (3) of the Firearms Act, 1925.  I will refer to this point in a moment.  Section 4 of this Bill defines the word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo;.  It states that a firearm means &mdash; when some item is being described in legislation the usual terminology used is &ldquo;includes&rdquo;&mdash; lethal firearm or other lethal weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged.  Similar legislation in the United Kingdom is the Firearms Act, 1968.  In the case of Moore <i>v.</i> Gooderham, 1960, it was decided that the word &ldquo;lethal&rdquo; meant capable of causing death.  If this interpretation is applied to the provisions of section 4 I fear that a great deal of items will be brought within the ambit of firearms legislation which neither the Minister, the Garda nor the Houses of the Oireachtas, if they consider the matter in any detail, would want included.  A lethal weapon, that is a weapon which may cause death by discharging something, could include not just crossbows but also, and I think this point was made in the Seanad, longbows, slingshots, blowpipes, etc.  It could be argued that in so far as these items are used for nefarious purposes they should be controlled in this way but I do not think the Garda would appreciate it if slingshots, blowpipes or any of the other items I have mentioned had to be licensed.  I understand that firearms legislation controls the distribution and sale of firearms by reference to the numbering of those firearms.  If a court decided that all those items came within the ambit of the meaning of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; I do not think <Col N="1985" /> it would be realistic or feasible to operate the legislation in practice.</P>
    <P>In another case in England which was decided on the terminology used in section 17 (1) of the Firearms Act, 1968 &mdash; the case of The Crown <i>v.</i> Pierre, it was held that in order to secure a conviction it is unnecessary to prove that the accused knew the weapon was a firearm to which the Act applied.  I am citing that case to demonstrate the need for certainty in this area, in particular in so far as the definition of the word &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill refers to the sale, transfer or disposal of a firearm.  The use of the word &ldquo;dispose&rdquo; in the section would indicate that the item has to pass legally from one person to another.  This would not cover the hire, loan, etc. of an item which had not been legally transferred from one person to another.  Section 6 refers to silencers.  I cannot understand why section 6 (1) refers only to the sale or transfer of a silencer.  If section 5 refers to the sale, transfer or disposal of firearms why is section 6 confined to the sale or transfer of firearms? Perhaps there is some good reason for this or it may be an oversight in the legislation. I would appreciate it if the Minister could advert to this point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law &mdash; hopefully this will be in the very near future &mdash; stun guns will come within the ambit of firearms legislation.  In effect this will mean that a person who is trying to buy a stun gun from any of the normal retail outlets will have to produce a certificate from a Garda superintendent.  The Seanad considered at length the question of when, if ever, a superintendent will grant a firearms certificate to enable a person to secure a stun gun.  There was some debate on the effect of bringing stun guns within the ambit of firearms legislation.</P>
    <P>I think the argument was used that on occasions there is an outbreak of a particularly reprehensible form of crime where elderly people living in isolated areas are attacked in their homes by people who are a great deal younger and stronger than they are.  It was argued that <Col N="1986" /> if those elderly people were allowed to have stun guns in order to protect themselves they would knock out an intruder whereas if they used a firearm they could kill someone.  I believe the former solution is much better than the latter one. That theory sounds attractive but, as I think the famous economist, Keynes, said, the problem about economics is the destruction of beautiful theories by ugly facts.  This beautiful theory is destroyed by the following ugly facts.  Firstly, technology has only developed to the extent that in order to use a stun gun effectively it has to be held practically against a person's body for three seconds.  Therefore, in practice it would be of no use to the people we or the proponents of that argument are trying to protect.  Secondly, if stun guns are freely available and there is no control on their use, sale and distribution invariably they will fall into the hands of criminals.  That is precisely the type of situation we are trying to prevent. The Garda authorities have assailed us from all sides to do something about this problem since the use of these guns became prevalent over the past five years.  For those reasons I do not think any logical argument can be advanced as to why stun guns should not be controlled under the firearms legislation.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill does not refer to imitation firearms.  If the control of firearms included the control of imitation firearms I believe it would involve regulating the sale and distribution of a great deal of toy guns.  Nowadays toy guns look like real guns and the more real they look the better the market is for them.  This in turn creates competition and toy guns now look like real guns.  Under section 57 (1) of the United Kingdom Firearms Act, 1968, an imitation firearm is dealt with in another context.  It was defined &mdash; this illustrates the difficulty any Minister who comes in here has in trying to regulate the use of imitation firearms &mdash; as anything which has the appearance of a firearm, whether or not capable of discharging any shot, bullet, etc.  This provision would cover the items I am arguing should not be covered, namely toy guns. <Col N="1987" /> As I have said, the more marketable of these products look like real guns.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (f) deals with telescopic sights and silencers.  This provision is necessary and it is being introduced to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the control, acquisition and possession of firearms by individuals which regulates the control and movement of firearms and ammunition between member states.  There is an aspect of this provision which I should like to raise with the Minister but it probably should be raised on Committee Stage and I will reserve it for then.  It would appear that both under English law and our law the possession of a firearm without a certificate is an absolute offence.  However, it would also appear, particularly from the decision in the case of The Crown <i>v.</i> Debreli, 1964, that a firearm with the firing pin removed, in other words a firearm which is incapable of firing, was held not to be a firearm in law; it was held to be an imitation firearm. That decision is not relevant here because we do not have any provisions in law about imitation firearms.  If it is the case here that a firearm with the firing pin removed is not a firearm for the purposes of control, regulation, sale and distribution, etc. there is a very serious lacuna in our law which should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Section 6 regulates the possession and sale of component parts of firearms, such as telescopic sights and so on and it would be unreal if the sale of telescopic sights was not allowable unless a firearms certificate could be produced while the sale of a firearms with the firing pin removed could be.  That would be unreal and illogical. However, one could envisage that arising if the logic of the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal was carried forward into Irish law.  Perhaps there are very good reasons it should not be and why it is not being carried forward. I hope there are but if there is any possibility that this ludicrous, illogical and crazy situation can arise, I would ask the Minister to address it.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the Bill deals with <Col N="1988" /> the possession in certain circumstances of offensive weapons.  The provisions of the Bill appear to be based to a large extent on similar legislation in the UK, namely, the Prevention of Crime Act, 1953. However, our Bill is distinguishable from that legislation and makes changes the necessity for which have appeared with the passage of time.  The 1953 UK Act distinguishes between three different types of weapons and they are dealt with differently under that Act.  The first weapons dealt with in that Act are those made for causing injury, weapons made for one purpose and that is causing injury to the person.  The UK courts have held that the following types of weapons fall into that category, service rifles, a bayonet, a dagger, a cosh and a knuckle-duster. The second category of weapons dealt with in the UK Act are articles adapted in some way for causing injury to the person, in other words, weapons which of themselves are innocuous but which have been adapted or changed in some way to make them capable of causing injury to an individual.  The third type of weapons dealt with in the UK Act are weapons which were neither initially made nor adopted for causing injury to any person but which are carried by an individual with that intent.</P>
    <P>In so far as weapons which are made or adapted for causing injury to some person are concerned, the prosecution need only prove possession in a public place.  In order to establish that an offence has been committed the prosecution need only prove that the accused carried a weapon made for causing injury to a person or adapted so as to cause injury to a person and that the accused was in a public place.  In so far as the weapons which fall into category three of the UK Act are concerned, weapons which have been manufactured or made for some reason other than to cause injury, such as a kitchen knife or a chisel, the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the accused carried the weapon with an intent to injure somebody and that he carried it in a public place.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the approach adopted by the Minister sub-divides weapons into <Col N="1989" /> four different categories.  The text of the legislation contains three categories but for the purpose of comparison with the UK legislation, it is my view that it divides into four categories.  Firstly, it refers to weapons which are made for causing injury to any person, and that is similar to the provision in the 1953 UK Act.  I presume the UK decisions of what constitutes such weapons will be at least persuasive.  The second category are weapons which are adapted for causing injury to any person and that, again, corresponds with the second category dealt with in the UK legislation.  The third category dealt with in our Bill are weapons which are neither initially made nor adapted for causing injury to any person but which are carried with that intent in a public place.  That category, which corresponds to the third category in the UK legislation has been changed and extended so that it is now distinguishable and covers more ground than is covered in the UK legislation.</P>
    <P>The UK Act covered any article intended by the person having it with him for use for causing injury to any person. Naturally, as in all cases of that type, the onus is on the prosecution.  The wording I referred to came up for decision by the UK Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of Woodward <i>v.</i> Koessler, [1958].  The question that arose in that case was whether the accused intended to cause injury to a person or if he intended merely to frighten or intimidate that person by displaying the knife or whatever weapon was used.  It was held unanimously by the United Kingdom Court of Criminal Appeal that an intention to frighten or intimidate was not enough to satisfy the wording of the UK legislation.  There had to be proof of an intent to cause injury to, or incapacitate the intended victim.</P>
    <P>The Irish parliamentary draftsman, being mindful of this gap in the law, extended that third category of weapon. Section 8 (3) of the Bill states that it applies to any article intended .... unlawfully to cause injury to, incapacitate or intimidate any person either in particular eventuality or otherwise ....  That definition meets the difficulty which was <Col N="1990" /> encountered by the prosecution in the case I referred to and it considerably broadens the third category of weapon I mentioned.  There is one slight peculiarity in the Irish definition and, while I accept it is more a Committee Stage point.  I should like to mention it now so as to give the Minister an opportunity to deal with it when replying to the Second Stage debate.  The UK Act, in defining that third category of weapon, that is a weapon intended to cause injury to, incapacitate, intimidate and so on, did not use the word &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; whereas the Irish legislation, in section 8 (3), does.  I wonder about the necessity for the use of the word &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo;.  Section 8 (3) now states it is an offence to carry a weapon with the intention of unlawfully causing injury to, incapacitating or intimidating any individual.</P>
    <P>One wonders how one can lawfully injure a person with a weapon.  One wonders how a person can have the intent to lawfully intimidate somebody.  One wonders how somebody can have the intent when carrying a weapon around in a public place to lawfully incapacitate a person.  It has been my experience in the criminal court, which is fairly slight, that the more categories we put into the <i>mens rea</i> of a particular crime, the greater the obstacles one is placing in the way of the prosecution securing a conviction.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the use of the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; in the Bill creates obstacles or difficulties, and even if it does not, whether it is really necessary.  If it is not necessary, it should be taken out.  There may be some very good reasons that it is included and I invite the Minister to comment on that when replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to those three categories of weapons, category three expands on the third category in the UK Bill and deals with the reality of modern day Ireland, going on to create a new category or weapon and a new offence.  From the point of view of what it seeks to do here, the Bill must be welcomed.  The new category of weapon, and for the purposes of my contribution tonight I will call it category four, is defined in section 8 (1) <Col N="1991" /> as a &ldquo;knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed&rdquo;.  The legislation goes on to state that a person in possession of such an article in a dancehall, marquee, a recreation hall, a club premises or restaurant or in any place where a sports fixture, carnival, bazaar, outdoor concert or similar function is being held and where people are likely to congregate, is guilty of an offence.  The only defence a person has is the defence of either lawful authority to have the weapon or a reasonable excuse for having the weapon on him at the time.  It is noteworthy that section 8 (1) confines the offence so that it can only be committed in certain places at certain times.  At an outdoor event such as a football match, bazaar, a concert or whatever or at an indoor event such as a dance, marquee, discotheque etc. an offence is committed when a person is in possession of knives or other articles as defined and the only defence is lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  This initiative is to be welcomed. If we had followed the pattern of the 1953 United Kingdom legislation a person who carried a knife, a chisel etc. &mdash; in other words a weapon which was not made initially for causing injury but was quite capable of causing injury &mdash; into a discotheque would not commit an offence unless it could be proved that he intended to cause injury.  The attitude taken by the courts towards the wording of the section which created that offence gave people virtually <i>carte blanche</i> to carry chisels, screwdrivers, knuckledusters and knives of all sorts into discotheques and football matches.  There is a long line of legal authority on the 1953 legislation which begins with the Crown <i>v.</i> Edmunds, 1963, which demonstrated that the burden of proof, that is proof that the accused was carrying the weapon with intent, is a very heavy burden indeed and which the prosecution have found almost impossible to discharge in practice.  From that point of view, without considering other aspects of the legislation, the Irish solution to the worldwide problem is preferable to the solution adopted in the UK legislation of 1953.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> Notwithstanding all the praise I lavish on the Irish solution, I wonder if we could find a better solution during the course of discussion on the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider my suggestion that the possession of any article capable of causing serious injury at one of the crowded venues defined in section 8 (1) should be an offence in the absence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  The reason I am advancing that proposition is that under the Bill as drafted a person going to a football match or a discotheque with a knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed, can be convicted simply on possession and his only defence is lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  However, if he had had another item such as a hammer, a knuckleduster or a metal bar, something that does not have a blade or a sharp end, he could only be convicted if the prosecution can discharge the enormously heavy burden of proof that he intended to cause specific injury to somebody, not necessarily to an individual who has to be identified.  We are distinguishing between people who carry weapons with blades or sharpened points and those who carry other weapons, which are equally, if not more capable, of causing serious injury.  We are discriminating against the man who carries a blade or sharply pointed item into the crowded place against the man who carries any other type of weapon which is also capable of causing injury.  To secure conviction in the latter case the prosecution will have to discharge a far heavier burden than in the former case.  It may not be possible, and I am the first to say it, for the Minister to proceed in the manner which I suggested.  There may be some insurmountable obstacles to it.  It may be regarded by the Minister or his advisers as widening the law too much but as things stand there seems to be unfair discrimination against the person who carries one type of weapon as opposed to a person who carries another and this should be examined further.</P>
    <P>One could also advert to the different levels of punishment.  A person convicted under section 8 (1) of carrying a knife or <Col N="1993" /> sharp object into a crowded situation can receive 12 months imprisonment at most, as it is only a summary offence whereas a person with another type of weapon convicted of intent to injure can be prosecuted on indictment and can get up to five years imprisonment.  That would seem to discriminate against a person in the latter category.  However, one must compare like with like.  If a person is carrying a knife with intent to injure somebody, and if this can be proved, he could, and I would like the Minister to confirm this, be prosecuted under section 8 (3) in that he was carrying a weapon with intent to injure and therefore could be prosecuted on indictment and receive a sentence of up to five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the defences set out in the section are lawful authority or reasonable excuse but neither is defined in the legislation.  I would not expect a term like &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; to be defined in the legislation but I would welcome guidelines on the naming of the term &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo;, which is neither defined in this legislation nor in the UK legislation and is not self explanatory. The case of what is lawful authority was considered in the UK case, Bryan <i>v.</i> Matt, 1976.  In that case lord Chief Justice Widgery, who is well known in this county, stated that lawful authority refers to those people who from time to time carry an offensive weapon as a matter of duty, the soldier with his rifle and the police officer with his baton.  This seems to suggest that a duty, in order to constitute lawful authority, must be public in the narrowest possible sense.  It seems, for example, that an employer cannot authorise his employees to carry offensive weapons simply by contracting them to do so, in other words, that he cannot put them under a civil legal duty to do so, the duty has to be public in the narrowest possible sense.</P>

      <P>Prior to adjourning the debate last week I outlined the difference between a pardon and an acquittal.  I also made reference to the Minister's contribution, in reply to Deputy Spring's remarks in introducing this Private Members' Bill, in which he made the point that the Guildford Four would have had to be released once the new evidence unearthed by the Avon and Somerset police had been uncovered whether the <Col N="1995" /> power to refer cases back to the court existed in England or not.  Two important points need to be made here.</P>
      <P>First, it is extremely unlikely that the Avon and Somerset police would have been asked to reinvestigate the case if the Home Secretary was not considering using his powers of referral; in other words, if in the mind of the Home Secretary the issue was dead the Avon and Somerset police would not have been asked to reopen it.  Second, despite what the Minister has said, the Guildford Four were not simply released; they walked out of court both free and innocent of the charges on which they had originally been convicted.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the demarcation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary and implied strongly that giving a power to reopen cases which had been decided upon by the courts and to review evidence to a member of the Executive would be a breach of that separation of functions, but that is exactly what the Attorney General does when he refers a case to the Supreme Court and it is what the Director of Public Prosecutions does when he decides to initiate a prosecution in the first place.</P>
      <P>The power to put a case before the court is not in itself a judicial function. Furthermore, the Minister for Justice already has the power to release prisoners, notwithstanding the decisions of the courts, and to commute decisions. This is a power he exercises frequently. The Executive has the right to recommend the commutation of the death penalty and it has done so in all cases where it has been imposed in recent years.  We know from recent experience that the Attorney General has what was described in this House by the Taoiseach as a quasi-judicial function in relation to extradition where he assesses the weight of evidence among other matters.  None of these powers, which are not dissimilar to the powers being proposed in this Bill, has ever been seriously regarded as a breach of the separation of the role of the courts and the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> It is implicit in this Bill that the powers we are proposing to give to the Minister for Justice would be used judiciously and wisely.  The Minister also expressed total opposition to a statutory provision that would totally exclude the possibility of convictions based on uncorroborated evidence or confessions because, in his view, there could well be situations where it would be evident to everybody that such convictions were entirely unfair.  Our Bill makes reference to contested cases only. If a man confesses his guilt to the police and when, outside of police custody, stands over that confession by pleading guilty the question of his confession standing as evidence would not arise as he would be convicted on his own guilty plea.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to argue that the necessity for corroboration in Scotland is interpreted very lightly by the Scottish courts and that in practice they accept very slight evidence in corroboration of a confession.  That is tantamount to saying that because Scottish judges pay little regard to the rules of evidence Irish judges will do likewise.  That seems to be a slur on the judges of both jurisdictions which we, in the Labour Party, simply do not accept, but even if it were true &mdash; and we say it is not &mdash; the degree of corroboration written into our Bill owes nothing to the Scottish model.  The language used in our Bill is taken directly from the Children Act, 1908.  Under that Act the unsworn evidence of children requires corroboration in a manner that is familiar to and has effectively been operated by the Irish courts for 97 years.</P>
    <P>Having cast a slur on the Judiciary the Minister went on to cast a slur on the Garda Síochána by suggesting that if we were to impose a requirement for corroborative evidence on the Garda it would be just as easy for them to manufacture that evidence as it would to secure the confession in the first place.  We simply do not understand how the Minister can advance that argument.  He seems to be saying that we should not impose additional safeguards because the gardaí would ignore them and compound their perjury.  It is impossible to interpret <Col N="1997" /> such a comment as anything other than a slur on the Garda Síochána and we, in the Labour Party, do not accept it.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he accepts there are dangers with confession evidence &mdash; a case of having his cake and eating it &mdash; and he argued that the Judges' Rules which impose strict conditions within which police questioning can take place take care of this problem.  They do not.  The Judges' Rules, which incidentally were formulated by English judges, are administrative guidelines which have no force in law.  The Minister sought to reinforce his argument in this regard by referring to the treatment guidelines made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Again, these are only guidelines.  A breach of these guidelines does not necessarily result in a statement made in custody being inadmissible in court.  According to the Minister, all of these are important safeguards with confession evidence always being inadmissible in law unless the judge is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was given voluntarily.</P>
    <P>What happened in the Guildford case? What happened essentially was that there was a swearing match between the Guildford Four on the one hand and a very large number of policemen on the other with the police being believed while the Guildford Four were not.  The result was that four confessions, which we now know should never have been admitted in evidence, were enough to deprive the Guildford Four of their liberty for 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the provisions already recommended for the taping of interviews in Garda stations.  He also said that the question of establishing pilot schemes is under consideration.  That is all very well but it is surely worth pointing out that these recommendations were originally published in the Ó Briain report ten years ago.  It is about time we got beyond the consideration of the possible establishment of pilot schemes.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the proposal made by the Minister for Justice to establish a committee, under the chairmanship of Judge Frank Martin, to carry out an <Col N="1998" /> examination, as a matter of urgency, of the issues raised in the Guildford case, and referred to in our Bill, in the context of criminal procedure as a whole.  We welcome that decision which is an obvious attempt to respond positively to our Bill.  However, a large number of matters require clarification.  The Leader of the Labour Party sent the following letter to the Minister for Justice this morning, arising from our consideration of his proposal:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>With reference to the proposal made by you in response to the Labour Party's Criminal Justice Bill, this proposal has been considered by my Parliamentary Party, and they have authorised me to seek the following clarifications.</P>
    <P>First, the terms of reference of this Committee are vague and unspecified, and we would wish to see more concrete terms agreed.  For example, we would wish to see the following matters covered in the terms of reference for the Committee:</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether uncorroborated statements made in Garda custody should, if subsequently retracted, always be deemed to be admissable, and if not, the circumstances under which they should be admissable or not;</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether the power should be given to the Executive to reopen cases where existing appellate procedures have been exhausted, and if so, in what circumstances and at what level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the law relating to Garda powers of arrest, detention, and interrogation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the bringing forward of firm proposals for the videotaping of all interviews of detained persons in Garda custody;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a review of the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in so far as they relate to these powers;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" />&mdash;whether existing provisions, including non-statutory guidelines set out in judges' rules, and statutory guidelines governing treatment of suspects in Garda custody, are sufficient to safeguard the rights of accused and to ensure the reliability of statements made.</P>
    <P>Secondly, no time limit has been set on the operations of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the membership of the Committee has not been specified.  We believe that as the initiators of this legislation we should seek your agreement to enable us to nominate a representative on the Committee.  We also believe that there should be some lay representation.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we believe the Report should be published.</P>
    <P>I would hope to have an opportunity to discuss these points with you before the decision of the Dáil tomorrow night.  Our next spokesperson in the debate, Deputy Michael Ferris, will be placing these views on the record of the House tonight.  On the assumption that it is possible for us to reach broad agreement on these proposals, we would have no wish to force a vote on the Second Stage.  Instead, we would seek your support that the debate on the Bill be adjourned, so that the Bill is neither adopted nor defeated, but instead remains on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the debate tomorrow night, Deputy Spring will be elaborating on these points, and he will, hopefully, be in a position to convey the Minister's response by then.  For my part, I am glad that the presentation of our Bill has prompted action on these important issues, and I hope that it will be possible for that action to be brought to an amicable and speedy conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Bill last week, the Minister for Justice laid emphasis on the need to ensure that confessions obtained in police custody were <Col N="2000" /> obtained properly.  It is a concern shared by all democrats and we would all welcome the introduction of systems such as the taping of interrogations which would, provided there could be access to these tapes, go some way towards ensuring in cases of doubt that justice is done and seen to be done.  But, as Deputy O'Keeffe subsequently pointed out, such arrangements were suggested back in 1978 by the Ó Briain Committee, and provision had been made as long ago as 1984, under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Bill of that year, for just such recording.  In the intervening five years nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>Despite widespread concern with the operation of interrogation techniques in the case of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six throughout that period and despite the obvious implications for our own criminal justice system, and despite the fact that legislation to deal with this very problem was already passed by this House, nothing has been done. Yet, when someone of the calibre and integrity of Deputy Spring finally proposes that some action be taken, he is accused of being precipitate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we to have instead?  The Minister informs us of an apparently <i>ad hoc</i> decision to form yet another committee. We respect the Minister's choice of chairman for this committee.  Indeed, his honour, Judge Martin, is widely respected and rightly so.  He is certainly known as one who does not waste valuable time and we may expect a high quality report.  Indeed, I hope for a report that will get to the root problem of the criminal justice system in this country, and nothing less.  But we may also expect it with remarkable speed and efficiency. One could scarcely ask for anything better, but one can.  One can ask for action now which is precisely what Deputy Spring proposes.  No matter if it will be superceded by the report of the Martin Committee.  Who knows when this House will actually see the recommendations of that report, yet to be written and passed into law?  Who knows how many of those recommendations that are passed into law will lie neglected on a <Col N="2001" /> shelf for five years, ten years or 15 years? We cannot wait.  Has there not been enough waiting?  Has there not been too much waiting &mdash; 15 years waiting?</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring talked last week about the intimidation implicit in the few hours that a colleague of his suffered while mistakenly in custody.  It is an experience that not many Members of this House will have shared &mdash; being in custody, whether mistakenly or otherwise.  We must imagine what it is like for a person to find that the freedoms they have taken for granted for years are suddenly gone, that one's right to movement, to warmth, to sleep, to privacy are gone, that before a single shred of evidence may have been produced, one is being treated like a prison inmate, people treating one as if one is guilty.  It is deliberate, it is part of the way that the Garda get that confession needed to resolve 80 per cent of serious crimes, as we were told last week.</P>
    <P>That, I suspect, is the real reason we are being asked not to vote for this Bill. It would make a tactical device, heavily relied on by the Garda, largely ineffective. The business of making one feel guilty while in custody, in the hope of provoking a confession, would no longer be sufficient to achieve the large number of convictions it does at this time.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here, is whether or not one believes that that would be a change for the better.  As it stands, the method works very well, so well, that innocent people can on occasion be made to admit to the most horrible of crimes within a matter of hours.  They are innocent, often disturbed, people; poor, uneducated people; marginalised resentful people; some of them the very people who do commit crime, but not necessarily this time.  These people harbour attitudes that we dislike or distrust.  They arouse our suspicions.  They do not recommend themselves to our sympathy, but they just happen to be innocent of the crime of which they stand accused.</P>
    <P>The problem here is simple.  This method of extracting confessions cannot distinguish between the innocent and the guilty.  Confessions gained by it should, therefore, not be admissible as evidence <Col N="2002" /> in themselves, where they are later contested by the accused.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the other major provision of this Bill, that of empowering the Minister for Justice with the right of referral in cases where he sees fit to do so.  It has been suggested that this might prove an unconstitutional arrangement.  The reason given is that it would enable an arm of the Executive to countermand the legally-arrived at decisions of the courts not to reopen a case.  Is that unconstitutional? I do not know.  But I know that it is precisely the power that we need, if we are to refer cases such as that of the Guildford Four for reconsideration by the Judiciary.  It is the power that we, the democratically-elected representatives of the people, need.  If it is unconstitutional, let that be proved, and let the Constitution be amended if necessary.  That is no reason not to procede with this Bill at this time because we will have to cross that bridge sooner or later and it might as well be sooner for the sake of taking action now.</P>
    <P>It has been commented that this power of referral did not help in the case of the Guildford Four in the United Kingdom. That is accepted, but the other major proposal of the Bill &mdash; to disallow uncorroborated confessions &mdash; might well have done so.  It is, therefore, not a valid argument against the Bill, and not a valid argument against section 3 of the Bill, if there are instances when section 3 would not, of itself, have been enough to protect an innocent party.  That is why there are these two proposals in the Bill.  Not every section of a Bill must cater with every case.</P>
    <P>The power of referral is, therefore, not to be seen on its own, but in conjunction with the impact of section 2, when it would operate as a crucial failsafe mechanism, available at all times, whenever it seems likely that the normal processes of justice have acted in error, something which inevitably &mdash; as the Minister himself suggested &mdash; they will do.  For that very reason, this provision is not, as the Minister implied, an inadequate solution to a complex problem.  It is a democratically desirable piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> Private Members' Bills tend to suffer in this House.  They are something of an over-hunted species.  I ask the Members of this Chamber to relax their killer instinct a while, and let this remarkably enlightened Bill pass.  What if it is superseded in a year by Judge Martin's report becoming law?  So much the better.  It is action now that will motivate future reforms, reforms like the abolition of the death penalty, for which we have waited far too long already.  Failure to act now might well delay future developments. No one knows how many people will be wrongfully imprisoned in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Finally we should remember that the British authorities thought that they were all right with the law as it stood, and now look at the appalling vista that that overconfidence has wrought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have had the pleasure of hearing my South County Dublin colleague, Deputy Garland, speaking.  I would like to wish him well and congratulate him on his election to the Dáil and on his contribution.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that is where we part.  He said that this is a remarkably enlightened piece of legislation.  I would suggest the removal of the word &ldquo;remarkably&rdquo;.  It is undoubtedly an enlightened Bill in the sense that it was brought forward with the intention of tightening up criminal law procedure.  It is to be welcomed for that reason and for giving us the opportunity of discussing this fundamental question of the corroboration of evidence in the context of a criminal charge.  I can only presume that the Labour Party introduced this legislation as a result of their examination of the Guildford Four, Maguire family and Birmingham Six cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a civil lawyer with some peripheral experience in the criminal law, so that my comments might be seen as those of a layman, I have to say that section 3 (1) appears to me to give the Minister for Justice extremely wide powers &mdash; I am sure the draftsman did not intend this &mdash; and this would be of serious concern to <Col N="2004" /> me.  While the Constitution is not necessarily my forte, living under it and doing my best to practise within it, I would suggest that maybe there is an unconstitutional tinge in section 3 (1) which provides that where a person has been convicted on indictment of any offence the Minister may, if he thinks fit at any time, refer the case to the court.  As a person with an interest in human rights and civil liberties I would be very concerned at that.  I would also be concerned about it from the point of view of a person who is charged.  If a person applies for leave to appeal to the court of appeal and the court of appeal decides that the charge should stand, the case would then be referred to the Minister for Justice, and if he thinks fit at any time, he can refer the case back to the court.  I would not have thought the Executive should have that kind of wide ranging power.</P>
    <P>I understand that maybe the Minister is not supporting the Bill, having regard to the fact that he is setting up the Martin Committee to take a look at criminal law procedure, and that he may not allow the Bill to go further than this Stage.  If the Bill is to be reintroduced in the event of the Labour Party not being satisfied with what comes out of the Martin Committee, I would suggest that they might have a look at the section I have described as being loose.  It is well intentioned but it is loose in its meaning and I suggest that the constitutional lawyers might well have a field day in relation to it.</P>
    <P>To return to the reasons for the introduction of the Bill, maybe it is presumptuous on my part to assume that the Bill was introduced arising from the various miscarriages of justice in the cases I have just mentioned.  As a person who has pursued the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguires for some considerable time, I see the Sir John May inquiry into the circumstances of the evidence of the Guildford Four and the Maguires as an opportunity for this committee to review in depth not only the charges on which they were convicted but to go further and extend this inquiry even to people in high office in the British police judicial system. <Col N="2005" /> It is not good enough to simply suggest that the prison officers or the police officers into whose hands they were committed were entirely to blame for having them in prison for over 14 years on charges of which they were entirely innocent. In the final analysis the small fry were not the ones who made the decisions as to how these cases should have been processed further, based on the evidence obtained.  That is why I believe the Sir John May inquiry into these two cases should be wide ranging and fundamental.</P>
    <P>In that regard, while I was in Strasburg last Thursday at a first class discussion on the Birmingham Six, it came to my attention that an advertisement was placed by the Sir John May secretariat inquiring into the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguires inviting submissions from the public, either orally or by way of written submission.  While newspapers come in here from the United Kingdom, that point may not have received wide currency.  It is very important that anybody who may have a point of view on the Guildford Four and the Maguire family cases should make a submission to the Sir John May inquiry by writing to the secretariat as suggested in <i>The Guardian and The Independent</i> of London of last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and they could find the details from those advertisements.  They could write to the secretariat.  They could apply to present their case in person or they could make a written submission and no doubt very serious attention would be paid to those submissions.</P>
    <P>I am not certain whether it is appropriate that our Government make a submission to that inquiry, but my intention as chairman of the Oireachtas all-party committee on these cases is to ask the Oireachtas all party committee to make such a submission to the inquiry whether it be a personal oral submission or a written one.  We will be doing it as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Guildford Four and the Maguire cases, as far as I am concerned the Maguires must also be declared innocent.  The Court of Appeal decided on a submission from the Director of Public Prosecutions that the Guildford <Col N="2006" /> Four had no further case to answer and in a technical way the Court of Appeal released them.  However, I would not suggest for one moment that the English Court of Appeal is the best mechanism by way of appeal in the sense that this was not a full blown appeal by the Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>The Court of Appeal released the Guildford Four on a technical submission by the Director of Public Prosecutions and I believe in my heart the Court of Appeal in their hearts cannot find it possible to review the Birmingham Six case in as a complete a way as it should be reviewed.  I attended that Court of Appeal hearing and at the end of the proceedings I was astonished to hear Lord Chief Justice Lane hand down his decision without once commending the evidence proffered on behalf of the six men.  He gave them not one positive response arising out of some 28 days of a hearing, which was an astonishing revelation to me.  My conclusion, and I think the conclusion of the other people, was that the Court of Appeal, well intentioned though they may be in relation to matters of this nature, cannot find it in their hearts or in their perception, capacity or understanding of the accused to come to a conclusion on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say the team acting on behalf of the Birmingham Six produced very cogent, persuasive evidence.  My belief is that the Court of Appeal, again in their wisdom, should have decided the appeal be heard by a jury and that the jury in the circumstances, particularly on the very debatable and doubtful evidence given by Dr. Skuse the forensic scientist, would have acquitted the men.  There are two down and one to go in the sense that the Guildford Four have been declared innocent and it is now only a matter of time before the Maguires will be declared innocent.  As we know, the Maguires and the Guildford Four cases are interlinked.</P>
    <P>The Maguires were accused of having a bomb making factory and the forensic evidence obtained from the seven involved &mdash; the Maguire family, including two lodgers, Giuseppe Conlon, Paddy Maguire senior, Paddy Maguire junior, Vincent Maguire, Paddy O'Neill and Pat <Col N="2007" /> Hill &mdash; was so tenuous and so extraordinary that by any standards of evidence they should have been acquitted.  It is very important to remember that Annie Maguire herself was charged with implication in the Guildford and Woolwich bombings but she could establish an alibi and consequently was released but subsequently she was arraigned on the basis of supplying bombs to the Guildford Four for the Guildford and Woolwich pub bombings.  If the Guildford Four case falls, I would have thought that in justice and in fair play the Maguire case would automatically have fallen too.  The Balcombe Street siege group &mdash; the active service unit of the IRA involved in Balcombe Street siege &mdash; took &ldquo;credit&rdquo; for the Woolwich and Guildford bombings. If one can be fair to the members of the IRA, then it is fair to say that they were and are the guilty party but the judge at that time could not find it in his heart to accept that they may have been guilty on their own rather than guilty in association with Paddy Armstrong, Carol Richardson, Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the Bill before us and the whole question of corroboration and a declaration in the minds of people of the innocence of the people we are discussing, in November 1977 the Birmingham Six applied to institute civil assault proceedings against the West Midlands Police.  In 1978 Mr. Justice Cantley moved that these actions should be allowed to proceed.  However, the police lodged an appeal against this decision and in 1980 Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, upheld the police appeal with the following words which I use advisedly because effectively they have become somewhat of a cliché and in fairness to Lord Denning he apologised for them:</P>
    <P>In the light of the release of the Guildford Four and a declaration of their innocence, if the six men win</P>
    <P>&mdash;their appeal&mdash;</P>
    <P>it will mean that the police were guilty of perjury, that they were guilty of <Col N="2008" /> violence and threats, that the confessions were involuntary and improperly admitted in evidence and that the convictions were erroneous. This would mean that the Home Secretary would either have to recommend that they be pardoned or he would have to remit the case to the Court of Appeal.  This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would say it cannot be right that these actions should go any further.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I heard Ludovic Kennedy, the well known broadcaster, describe the Denning dicta &mdash; for want of a better expression &mdash; the Denning expression of an appalling vista as &ldquo;the most shocking thing I have heard by any English judge&rdquo;. It is important to remember that Lord Denning was then Master of the Rolls which is the second highest judicial position in England.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we are discussing the Bill before us.  The Bill cannot be lightly dismissed.  I have argued that maybe constitutionally it needs some tightening but that will be a matter for the Supreme Court in the final analysis. At the same time we have an obligation to express a point of view and it is for that that I praise the Labour Party because it gives us an opportunity to discuss widely the reasons for introducing the Bill.  In the nature of things it is a talking point, but if the Bill is introduced on the basis of what happened in Guildford and Woolwich and the &ldquo;Mulberry Tree&rdquo; pub, and the &ldquo;Tavern in the Town&rdquo; on 21 November 1974 in Birmingham and if the Bill was introduced on the basis of a miscarriage of justice in the Maguire Seven cases, it should be examined once more.</P>
    <P>While we have a deep interest in these three cases, taking into account that all but Carol Richardson are Irish, the three cases did not happen in Ireland and I am satisfied that it is most unlikely that they would have happened here.  There are people who would argue that we should put our own house in order and I do not think that is an unreasonable <Col N="2009" /> criticism.  I know the Nicky Kelly case and others will be thrown at me.  Nevertheless we have an obligation in Ireland to pursue these three cases.  Indeed, and I hope I am not treading on anybody's toes &mdash; we have an obligation to keep a very close eye on the Winchester case because the more I examine that case, the more I hear from the relatives and the more I delve into it, the more it becomes obvious that while there are two down with one to go, it may be two down with two to go.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation and an absolute duty as members in this Irish democratic Republican jurisdiction to keep an eye on our own citizens in another jurisdiction&mdash; this happens to be an English jurisdiction &mdash; to ensure that they receive justice and that justice is seen to be done on their behalf.  In that regard and on the basis that somebody may be foolish enough to read my contribution, I would like to pay tribute to a very strong radical, liberal tradition in the English psyche.  Throughout their history they have had this tradition. This tradition presents itself as fair and reasonable.  I believe it is that tradition of fair-minded English men and women which helped these cases most. Without the help &mdash; and I have said this on a number of occasions &mdash; of some members of the so-called English Establishment, whether it be Church or State, who took up these cases and who assisted in proclaiming the innocence of these 17 individuals we would not be as far today as we are.  Some of the people in the Tory Party, who espoused the case of the Birmingham Six are decent people who have been described as Shire Tories and complete right wingers, could find it in their hearts to espouse those cases that have given rise to the Bill before us this evening.  For that we should be most grateful.  They are the same people of that radical, liberal, English tradition who will find it in their hearts and minds to espouse the cause of the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>I am not in the business of predictions but keeping in mind that the Birmingham Six are in prison since 21 November 1974 and that they were convicted in August the following year, by my calculations <Col N="2010" /> they have been in prison for over 15 years.  I would like to put a time limit on the release of the Birmingham Six.  I want to praise all those people who have involved themselves with the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguires in the recent past.  The more people who support the Birmingham Six case, because that is the case we are left with, and closely examine the Winchester case the better.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way want to suggest or diminish the fact that there are three young Irish people still languishing in prison for over 12 months for a crime of which their families say they were not guilty.  The immediate problem, as I see it, is the Birmingham Six.  I would like to think that in the next 12 months we will see the end of this case and that these individuals will be released on bail, or that the incoming new Home Secretary, Mr. David Waddington, would find it possible under the mechanism of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, to release them.</P>
    <P>Having visited the Birmingham Six on a number of occasions I know they do not want pardons as such.  They would like to have the same treatment given them as was given the Guildford Four. Nevertheless I have argued with them and convinced some, if not all of them that it would be well to be outside prison seeking a declaration of innocence rather than inside prison having other people seeking that declaration on their behalf and engaging themselves in their own campaign for a declaration of innocence as, indeed, does the honourable and decent Mrs. Maguire.  This is a most remarkable lady in every respect.  She was in prison for a crime she did not commit.  She served ten years in very difficult circumstances.  She is a courageous and brave lady.  She is concerned for a declaration of her own innocence and that of her six associates, including one deceased Giuseppe Conlon.  The moment the question of the Birmingham Six arises, Mrs. Maguire and the Guildford Four say they want to support that campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> We have not heard much from Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson but I hope in the not too distant future we will hear something from them.  From the moment Messrs.  Conlon and Hill were released they made a special appeal on behalf of the Birmingham Six.  That is the generosity of these people and it should be recognised.  That is why I believe that within the next 12 months, led by the Government of this country, led by the Taoiseach, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in association with the Minister for Justice through the Anglo-Irish process, through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and led by the various committees associated with the Birmingham Six, there should be a strong and concerted effort to maintain a public and ongoing campaign on behalf of these individuals. I would like to see that campaign take off with a strong impetus in England but that may not be.  We have an obligation to keep the pressure &mdash; I cannot stand the word &ldquo;pressure&rdquo;&mdash; or the campaign at a high pitch and these people may well be released within 12 months.  There are a number of options open.  There is the mechanism under the statute available to the Home Secretary, there is the question of bail available to the courts and there is also the opportunity for the Director of Public Prosecutions to release them with a declaration of their innocence.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stir the so-called greasy pot but I was a little disappointed with the new Home Secretary in that almost 24 hours after he took office he said he was not going to review the Birmingham Six case until there was new evidence.  I cannot understand how a Home Secretary &mdash; no matter how bright, courteous and generous he may be &mdash; could have studied the case of the Birmingham Six in 24 hours and dismissed it on the grounds that he will not deal with it until new evidence turns up. I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately meets the new British Home Secretary and brings him up-to-date on the reality of the reasons for the Birmingham Six being in prison for <Col N="2012" /> crimes they did not commit and being convicted on the basis of evidence &mdash; confession and forensic &mdash; produced which, quite clearly, was not substantive or within the rules of evidence.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he ask for the release of the Birmingham Six pending an examination of the special crime squad of the West Midlands Police and that they be given bail.  I realise that the examination and inquiry into the West Midlands Police deal with the years 1986 and 1988 and only between those years.  We are asked to believe that the special crime squad were good boys up to 1986, became bad boys between 1986 and 1988, and remain bad boys until they are declared to be good boys.  I do not accept the logic of that argument.  My view is &mdash; and I come back to the meeting which I hope will soon take place between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Home Secretary &mdash; that the Minister should ask for the release of the Birmingham Six pending, within the West Midlands inquiry, an examination of their case on a once-off basis.  A number of the police officers under investigation by the West Midlands Police inquiry were involved in the Birmingham Six case, there is no gainsaying that.</P>

      <P>Thank you for your indulgence and that of your predecessor for giving us an opportunity to discuss this very important Bill.  I welcome the Martin Committee and the appointment of a first class judge as chairman.  I hope the committee will be made up of very powered individuals who will have something to tell us about criminal law and its procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that we put a time limit on a debate such as this. I will continue in the same vein as Deputy Andrews by adding my voice to the main thrust of his contribution.  If the Birmingham Six are not released by the time the new intergovernmental tier meet, it <Col N="2013" /> is a matter which should be high on the agenda for early consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating our criminal justice system and I hope that areas in need of urgent reform will be addressed by the committee promised by the Minister a week ago.  Such a debate is particularly timely in the aftermath of the gross miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom.  The years served in prison by the Guildford Four, which resulted in their youth being savagely eroded, can never be redressed and no form of compensation can ever be regarded as sufficient when one considers the appalling circumstances of their conviction.</P>
      <P>Nobody in high office in the Executive or Judiciary of the United Kingdom has formally apologised to the Guildford Four, which is a sad condemnation of a legal system which finds it so difficult to redress a judicial wrong.  One comment from a high ranking member of the British Judiciary was disgusting.  When asked why there was not a formal apology he replied that nobody said these people were innocent, they said that the manner of their conviction was wrong and that there was inadmissible evidence which led to the recent decision.  I hope a formal apology might yet be made by high ranking officials across the water.  I also hope that criminal prosecutions will be brought, where necessary, and that there will be no cover up in bringing all those involved to justice, even if that means going to the highest level within the stratum of the British legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judicial miscarriage that prompted this Private Members' Bill has not been corrected by the release of those involved and it is important to acknowledge that the decision to release them would never have been made but for the fact that the Guildford Four &mdash; like the Birmingham Six &mdash; are fortunate to have a number of courageous and tenacious lawyers and public figures constantly keeping their grievance before the public.  I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you will forgive me on this occasion if I compliment the previous speaker on the work that he, as chairman of the committee, has undertaken <Col N="2014" /> over the past number of months. The work of Deputy Andrews and the committee played no small part in the decision and I hope, notwithstanding the success in the Guildford Four decision, the committee will keep this matter before the public through any avenue open to this House, the European Parliament or the new structure to which I referred at the outset.</P>
    <P>My welcome for this debate, however, does not extend to the substance of the Bill because it is defective.  I hope that its promoter, Deputy Spring, and the Labour Party, having had the benefit of certain ministerial assurances last week, will seriously consider not proceeding further.  Deputy Spring said that justice delayed is justice denied.  That is true but it is also true that justice hastily considered is equally bad law and would also have serious consequences.  Notwithstanding the contents of the letter referred to by Deputy Ferris, I hope that the Labour Party will consider the Minister's assurances and the Fine Gael amendment which would allow this matter to be considered by a special committee which would not only look at the matters raised in sections 1 and 2 of the Bill but would further expand to discuss the general areas of our criminal legal system.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the proper context in which to discuss the provisions of the Private Members' Bill. We cannot over-emphasise the need to tackle our crime problem as a matter of urgency.  Even if we see a certain stabilisation in the crime rate, we must constantly remind ourselves that there is no such thing as an acceptable level of crime.  Law enforcement is one of the really large tasks at present confronting our society and has a major impact on the quality of life enjoyed by the vast majority of our citizens wishing to live in a peaceful, ordered society.  The incidence of crime here is at an alarmingly high level.  Violence in our society has not abated as the daily quota of armed robberies clearly demonstrates.  There is no doubt that the members of the Garda Síochána enjoy the support and confidence of the vast <Col N="2015" /> majority of people in this State.  While there is clear need for a criminal law review and for codification of elements of the criminal law, to act hastily in the manner proposed in this Bill is not advisable. We all wish to live under a legal code and system geared to serving the interests of our citizens as a whole, one in which we could have a certain degree of pride.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance for the day-to-day management of a democratic State that the exercise of power by each State institution be subject to a system of checks, controls and balances in order to minimise the risk of injustice.  The type of controls envisaged in the provisions of this Bill, in my view, would benefit the criminal only and, as such, would not be in the best interests of society generally.</P>
    <P>The overriding reason for the introduction of this Bill, openly admitted by Deputy Spring, stems from the miscarriage of justice perpetrated in Britain by those responsible for the conviction of the Guildfour Four.  The most important aspect of that trial was the matter of the admissibility of the false confessions.  I contend that the provisions of section 2 of this Bill would have the effect of outlawing all confessions made without the benefit of corroborated evidence. This could have grave implications for the operations of our criminal law code and, in fact, would benefit many law breakers.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the regulations governing the taking of confessions. It is also important to underline the basic tenet running through our criminal law, that is, that no person charged is obliged to incriminate himself but he can do so at all times if he so wishes.  Trial judges, at all levels, are obliged to warn an accused of this fact.  Before any confession of an accused is admissible the prosecution must establish that the confession was made voluntarily, without any duress or undue influence having been exerted.  The basic test of admissibility of a statement is whether it was made voluntarily.  The Minister was correct when he stated that there are cases <Col N="2016" /> in which there is no corroborated evidence at all but in respect of which convictions can be properly sustained.  I request that Deputy Spring refer to this matter when replying tomorrow evening. Surely Deputy Spring is not considering outlawing or rendering unsustainable a conviction in respect of an accused who enters a plea of guilty &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; to an offence?  In accepting the provisions of section 2 &mdash; requiring the necessity for corroborated evidence &mdash; we are making it impossible for the State to succeed with a conviction on a confession of guilt alone.  That will be the case no matter how voluntary such an admission of guilt.</P>
    <P>I invite the Labour Party to reflect on the very common occurrence of an accused entering a plea of guilty, volunteering a confession, in order that he might receive a less severe sentence.  It happens every day of the week.  Somebody may be caught red-handed, may commit a crime and become a remorseful almost immediately deciding voluntarily, or when apprehended by the forces of the law, to come clean and make a confession. It happens in the vast majority of cases, probably in the hope that one will receive a lesser sentence from a justice by being upfront and admitting guilt. Rather than outlawing the confession &mdash; as the Bill does &mdash; what we should be doing is outlawing the confession improperly obtained.  That is the nub of the argument which the provisions of this Bill ignore.</P>
    <P>One cannot discuss the very important matter of the confession improperly obtained without referring to the Judges' Rules.  I would hope that the expert committee proposed by the Minister under Mr. Justice Martin would seriously consider giving statutory effect to the Judges' Rules rather than view them as a set of rules which constitute a mere guide for police officers in the taking of a statement from a person suspected of having committed a crime.  Given that the Judges' Rules have not got the force of law, are merely administrative directions to police officers, I hope consideration might be given to tightening them or giving them <Col N="2017" /> statutory effect.  The Judges' Rules have been part and parcel of our legal system for quite some time.  The first four have been with us since 1912.  It has been clear that these rules constituted no more than guidelines for police officers.  Rules Nos. 7 and 8 are of particular importance in discussing the provisions of this Bill which arose out of the unfortunate consequences across the water.  Judges' Rule No. 7 clearly states:</P>
    <P>A prisoner making a voluntary statement must not be cross-examined and no questions should be put to him about it except for the purpose of removing an ambiguity in what he actually said.</P>
    <P>Even more importantly, Judges' Rule No. 8 says:</P>
    <P>When two or more persons are charged with the same offence and statements are taken separately from the persons charged, the police should not read these statements to the other persons charged but each of such persons should be furnished by the police with a copy of such statements and nothing should be said or done by the police to invite a reply.  If the person charged desires to make a statement in reply the usual caution should be administered.</P>
    <P>Clearly, having regard to what we know so far from the manner in which the statements were obtained from the Guildford Four, the Judges' Rules must have been thrown into the nearest wastepaper basket.  That is an indication of how important it is for us to consider giving legal effect to the Judges' Rules and not have them remain as mere guidelines which may not be enforced from time to time or to the same degree as if they were incorporated on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>At present a statement obtained in breach of the provisions of the Judges' Rules is admissable if it can be shown that such a confession or statement was voluntary.  The fact that it is a voluntary confession does not take away from a judge's discretion to refuse to admit the <Col N="2018" /> evidence if it has been obtained in violation of the Judges' Rules.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that the expert committee would consider whether the discretion of the trial judge is sufficiently tight to meet the needs in this regard.  The fight against crime must not be rendered remote.  Were we to enact the provisions of this Bill, as at present drafted, we would be seriously hindering the forces of the State in the battle against serious crime.  While accepting that the matter of a confession is of extreme importance in this fight, I contend that the provisions of section 2 are defective.  The questions we should be addressing are confessions improperly obtained and the provision of sufficient safeguards against the obtaining of lawful confessions.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and the matter of tape recording.  I was happy to note that at long last the initiation of pilot schemes for practical testing of this wide-ranging reform is under consideration at present.  I might pose the question asked before: when?  While the Minister will not have an opportunity of replying I hope he will place his views on that matter on the record at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Accepting the principle of tape recording, we must ensure that the entirety of interviews in police stations are recorded rather than summaries, extracts, edited portions or whatever.  I hope that requirement will be borne in mind when making the necessary regulations here, so that the entirety of conversations between the relevant parties is available on tape.  It is absolutely essential that the regulations in the form of guidelines for such pilot schemes should be taken in the context of the judge's rules.  They might even replace the judge's rules entirely.  I believe the Minister has power in this regard under the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>It is important that all tape recordings should be made openly, not surreptitiously. The aim of such recording must be to produce an accurate record of the interview and to monitor police behaviour during the interview so that the court can be satisfied at all times that <Col N="2019" /> the product of the interview, namely the statement, is free from any duress or malpractice.  This procedure has the sanction of the Garda Síochána.  Nobody is saying that statements are illegally obtained to any significant degree, but the fact that the proceedings will be tape recorded will benefit members of the Garda Síochána as well as those who claim from time to time to be oppressed. On the arrival of the parties at a Garda station it is important that all the interviews be recorded and also that the suspect be cautioned and reminded of the fact that all his subsequent conversations are on tape.</P>
    <P>Much is expected of tape recording.  It will cause many changes in the criminal justice system.  It will involve the disclosure of the central part of the prosecution case in summary trials.  It may increase the &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; plea rate.  It will certainly reduce contests over verbals and it will also minimise the number of complaints against the police force.  It will undoubtedly tend to outflow oppressive questioning and is a reform which should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I hope the expert committee will see fit to proceed with haste as soon as the Minister provides the committee with the terms of reference.  Tape recording alone could achieve what is intended by the Labour Party in this Bill.  Regulations under the 1984 Act are perhaps a better way of proceeding than enacting the Bill before us.  The Minister must give a clear and unambiguous statement of clarification as to the terms of reference of the special committee.  Will the committee deal with provisions outside the scope of this Bill, such as the right to silence or bail?  Will they consider changing the judge's rules?  Will they have power to summon witnesses?  Will their report be laid before the House and will the Minister provide the House with a date by which the committee might begin their deliberations and subsequently produce a report?</P>
    <P>A further safeguard is that a judge might be legally required to warn a jury of the dangers of convicting an accused <Col N="2020" /> person solely on the basis of a confession, without any corroborating evidence.  This is already used to good effect in regard to sexual offences and it is worth further consideration.  The Minister conceded that point and I hope to see immediate action.  Safeguards such as these will ensure that the type of confession unlawfully extracted by police inspectors who stand accused in Britain cannot be sustained in our courts.  If that is the case, then we have done exactly what this Bill was designed to do.</P>
    <P>I must express some fears about the powers vested in the Minister under section 3 to refer cases at any time he thinks fit.  On initial reading I felt this referred to cases where confessions were at issue but I now see this is not the case.  Where a person has been convicted on indictment of any offence the Minister may refer the matter back to the courts.  I am somewhat afraid of vesting such unfettered powers in a Minister of the day.  I would not be entirely against a review which would allow us to have a valve in the event of there being a miscarriage of justice, but the answer is not to allow the Minister for Justice of the day to have free rein to do what he likes and refer any case back to a court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have every confidence in our legal system and in our courts.  I do not think it is possible for much evidence to be laid before this House which would direct us otherwise. We must safeguard at all times in our democratic society the separate institutions of the Executive and the Judiciary.  By allowing a Minister unfettered power under section 3 we would be encroaching on a very important line. I am not entirely against a review and perhaps there might be scope to give power to the Minister in consultation with the Attorney General or other officers of the State.  This might be thrashed out by the committee.  Our providing the Minister with such power could give rise to very serious dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> The committee is welcome but its inauguration must be seen in the context of our criminal justice system.  The onus of establishing the guilt of an accused never shifts from the prosecution.  There is never an onus on the accused to participate in the proceedings other than by appearing in court and he has at all times an absolute right to remain silent, both during police investigations and the entire court proceedings.  The fundamental principle before the court is not whether the accused is guilty but whether the prosecution succeed in proving that guilt.  This distinction must never be forgotten. The prosecutor must prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty; on the other hand, the accused has no burden of proof whatever and not even a duty to disclose certain facts which may be at issue.  We must remember when dealing with crime that we are dealing with a very small group within society who from time to time may be unfortunate enough to come before a court.  Nevertheless, it is of vital importance that, however unfortunate or marginalised that person might be, he or she must be afforded a trial that is free at all times from any taint of prejudice or abuse.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Spring for initiating this debate, which I do not think we would otherwise have.  The debate has been worthwhile and I look forward to the positive results expected from this ministerial committee.  I would like to be associated with the amendment in the name of the Fine Gael Party which broadly recommends the type of action the Minister has promised.  It is high time that either the Law Reform Commission or a special commission such as that envisaged by the Minister takes a look at the manner in which the criminal justice system operates in the hope that we can ensure, in so far as we possibly can, that no miscarriage of justice can take place.  I am glad to be associated with the debate. The Bill, as constructed at present, is not one that should receive the wholehearted support of the House and I hope Deputy Spring, along the lines of his earlier letter, might consider withdrawing it at this <Col N="2022" /> stage until we see what fruit this special committee will bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity that Deputy Spring's Bill has given to Deputies to express their views on the very tragic happenings in the United Kingdom, which is the reason we are having this debate.  Various background details to decisions taken by the British courts have been found to be sadly wanting and there were tragic consequences for the people affected by these decisions.  The Guildford Four case, which came to a painful, slow, tortuous but satisfactory conclusion, brought to people's minds the question whether such an occurrence could take place in this country and whether our laws in this regard are adequate.  In that context, Deputy Spring gave this matter some very detailed thought and put forward this Bill to the House.  The Minister very adequately dealt with a number of the concerns of the House in the event of the Bill, as circulated at present, being enacted.  In asking the eminent High Court justice, Mr. Justice Martin, to chair a special committee to look at the broad range of issues that need attention the Minister has taken the right course of action.  On the understanding that it will not be too long before the chairman and his committee go about their task of looking at the present procedures and making recommendations, the Minister should then bring before the House the necessary changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of wrongs do not make a right, as can be seen from the tragedy of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and other cases.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I would like to comment on the excellent work carried out by my colleague, Deputy David Andrews, who raised the matter in this House at every available opportunity.  He was very ably supported by members of all the parties across the floor in an effort to ensure that justice was seen to be done in the end.  Sometimes there were doubts that the circumstances would ever change and those doubts still exist in the case of the Birmingham Six.  Deputy Andrews, when <Col N="2023" /> speaking earlier, articulated a number of opportunities and options available to the Home Secretary in an effort to establish the bona fides of the claim of innocence by the Birmingham Six, believed so vigorously by many of us.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the very tragic circumstances surrounding brutal acts of bombing resulting in innocent deaths in the UK.  As a result of the political table-thumping to bring about action and to bring the bombers to justice, there was a very severe over-reaction by the police and the results are only too sadly known to us all.  That is not a satisfactory background against which to rush legislation on to the Statute Book. As was so glaringly seen in the UK, an over-reaction in those circumstances brought about a whole web of activities which resulted in the convictions of people whom we all believe to be innocent. The whole tragedy in Northern Ireland also spilled over into these cases and there was an urgency on the part of the police officers to charge people and bring them before the courts.</P>
    <P>We must stand back and look coldly and calmly at the circumstances which apply in this country.  We do not want to give the impression that there is a grave urgency for action on the basis of the workings of the Garda Síochána.  There is no specific case where people have been found guilty in our courts which would in any way compare with the cases that have highlighted the need for a detailed scrutiny of the system.  There should be a provision whereby such cases could be reheard.  In those circumstances, the setting up of a working committee, as proposed by the Minister, is the right course of action.  Deputy Spring and the Labour Party can recognise that this is not a matter that will be put on the long finger, dismissed or left with the great backlog of other legislation that is so badly needed.  Action will be taken and the Minister, in his contribution, has given a very firm commitment as to the necessary course of action.</P>
    <P>From a reading of the debate on this Bill last week, it is quite obvious that <Col N="2024" /> Deputy Spring quite simplistically adopted the procedures from the English law and embodied them in this Bill.  As we only too well know, with all the safeguards in the English law, the tragic cases that we are only too familiar with still occurred.  For that and other reasons we do not want a knee jerk reaction.  We do not want to be seen to be rushing into putting legislation in place as a result of the recent outcome of the Guildford Four case.  This whole area needs to be looked at.  Deputy Flanagan has touched on a number of other areas that could be embraced in the workings of this committee. I would like to think that a time scale could be put on the workings of the committee so that they would report back within a minimum of three months and maximum of six months.  In that way the Minister, before the rising of this House next year for the summer recess, could bring forward any changes that may be necessary.  A target date of reporting back is necessary so that we can all feel that the subject is getting the urgent attention it so badly needs.</P>
    <P>With that view in mind, I think the Labour Party Bill is premature and is an over-reaction.  This subject needs attention and I hope it will be dealt with in a much more balanced and realistic way. The workings of the committee will probably highlight a number of other areas which need to be looked at.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister moves the Supplementary Estimate I want to advise the House that in respect of Supplementary Estimates the debate is normally confined to the items specified in the Supplementary Estimate and matters of the general Estimate are acceptable only in so far as they might provide the background for it.  I might also advise the House that in respect of an Estimate of this kind it is not advisable nor acceptable that any <Col N="2025" /> direct references which would be either in the form of a compliment or criticism of any public official is acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £435,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate I am moving today for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions requires an additional sum of £375,000 for the payment of &ldquo;Fees to Counsel&rdquo; engaged to represent the Director in criminal prosecutions in the various courts; and £60,000 for the &ldquo;Other Law Expenses&rdquo; sub-head which provides mainly for the payment of costs awarded to defendants either in criminal prosecutions or in proceedings in the Superior Courts which arise out of such prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The need for the additional sum for fees to counsel arises from the need for the Director of Public Prosecutions to engage fee paid counsel to a greater extent than envisaged in: (a)  Prosecutions in the Dublin District Courts and (b) District Court appeals in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that there will be a major reduction in the need for such expenditure in future I have sanctioned the appointment of an additional ten full time solicitors and two technical staff to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to be assigned to prosecution work currently being handled by fee-paid counsel.  As an exceptional measure, I have approved the immediate filling of these ten solicitor posts on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the forthcoming competition by the Civil Service Commission.  I am <Col N="2026" /> satisfied that these additional appointments will result in considerable nett benefits to the Exchequer and the necessary adjustments have been made in the Book of Estimates for 1990.</P>
    <P>As to the costs awarded to defendants, it has been impossible to forecast the requirements under this heading with accuracy.  In the past the figures have varied substantially from one year to another.  Notwithstanding the uncertainties associated with this Vote, however, the operation of the office is kept under constant review with a view to effecting economies wherever possible.</P>
    <P>With these comments I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House. If the Deputies wish to relate any points, I will be glad to address them in my reply at the end of this debate.</P>

      <P>It is rare that we have an opportunity to focus on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In dealing with the Supplementary Estimate it is very clear that a comprehensive review of that office is now needed.  I want to make that very serious proposal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions carries out very important functions which are set out in section 3 of the Prosecution of Offences, Act, 1974.  It provides that &ldquo;the Director shall perform all the functions capable of being performed in relation to criminal matters and in relation to election petitions and referendum petitions by the Attorney General immediately before the commencement of this section ... &rdquo;.  The definition of criminal matters included in section 1 is very comprehensive.  It covers all criminal proceedings and applications for any order of <i>certiorari, mandamus,</i> prohibition or other State side order or injunction with respect to criminal proceedings or any other proceedings connected with criminal proceedings or any matter arising therefrom.  It goes on to deal with other matters under various sections.  It is clear that the functions of <Col N="2027" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions are very wide ranging and it is appropriate to look at the support which he gets in relation to these very important statutory functions.</P>
    <P>When I looked at the Revised Book of Estimates for the Public Services I was surprised to see that the total staffing of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is 16, including himself.  By way of comparison &mdash; this is probably the only way in which we can put it in perspective &mdash; the number of staff in other offices, as shown in the Revised Estimates for the Public Services, are as follows: the Office of the Ombudsman, 36; the Office of the Civil Service Commission, 39; the Attorney General's Office, 29 and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, 100 with 32 part time solicitors around the country.  I mention these figures merely to show that the staff of 16 in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is, from the outside, very small indeed.  On a personal note, the rural legal office with which I am associated has more staff than that.  In the context of the very important national functions being carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Act I wonder if we are providing him with sufficient support to carry out those functions.</P>
    <P>The old saying in law is &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo;.  To be blunt about it there have been complaints about delays in the carrying out of functions in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Ryan case was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act and the final decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions took almost a year.  That is an indication not only of the complexity of the case but also of the very heavy workload on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am also aware that there has been a recent judicial review where a case was dismissed, I think by the President of the <Col N="2028" /> High Court, because of the long delay in bringing it to a head.  There is also the Cavan shooting case of last week where serious problems arose &mdash; I am not saying they were directly attributable to the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; in the prosecution case as a consequence of which a <i>nolle prosequi</i> had to be entered and the case withdrawn.  These problems were quite serious in that it emerged that copies of an important statement which should have been made available to defence solicitors had not been handed over and, in addition, the court were told that a material alteration of a serious sort was made in the statement of the main prosecution witness.  In dealing with the matter the judge indicated that what happened could have led to a serious miscarriage of justice.  I am not pointing the finger at the Director of Public Prosecutions himself; I am merely illustrating that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is probably overloaded with work and that he needs additional support.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that additional staff were being assigned to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  This raises the point as to what exactly the relationship is between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor.  What is the relationship between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the 32 part time solicitors around the country?  This is not set out in the Act.  I am not sure whether the appointment of additional staff to the Chief State Solicitor's Office will solve the problem of the work overload in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Another reason for the overload is the alarming increase in the crime rate.  We have been told that in 1988 there were almost 90,000 indictable crimes recorded, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous year.  That, inevitably, must result in additional work for the Director of Public Prosecutions in whose name charges are ultimately brought.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the Bills <Col N="2029" /> which are before the House such as the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill we debated today and the Video Recordings Bill, the Committee Stage of which we will be discussing tomorrow, and there is no doubt that when they are passed they will result in additional work and pressure on the Director of Public Prosecutions. As part of the general case I am making for a review of that Office I am indicating that there is a need for additional support and staffing.</P>
    <P>Now that we are talking about providing extra money for the Director of Public Prosecutions it is important to point out that there appears to be no consistency in the Government's approach to funding that Office.  There appears to be a see-saw in relation to figures.  The Book of Estimates for 1990 is not any help in that it does not show clearly the Government's policy in regard to funding that Office.  Any person looking at the figures for 1990 would come away with the impression that there will be a 19 per cent increase in the funding for that Office next year but that would be wrong.  One has to go behind the figures to get at the truth.  The 1989 figure for that Office was cut from £1.5 million to about £1.4 million and we are now adding a sum which will bring the total figure to more than £1.8 million.  What will be the position next year?  Instead of that Office getting the 19 per cent increase next year their allocation will be reduced.  The figure allocated in the 1990 Estimates is £1.6 million.  The explanation is that the 19 per cent relates to the original Estimate rather than what will now be the outturn.  The actual figure for 1990 will be almost £200,000 less than what is available to that Office in 1989. That is not being consistent.</P>
    <P>In the context of staffing I should like to ask whether it is possible to find a more efficient and cost effective way of running that Office.  There are 16 people on the staff in that Office and salaries, wages and allowances comes to about £330,000. However, the total figure to be paid to <Col N="2030" /> counsel will be more than £1.2 million.  I may be treading on some corns in the Bar Library when I raise this but I wonder if it would be more cost effective to have additional professional staff in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might strike a chord and I will let Deputy Spring defend the Bar.  I mention that matter in the context of the review I have proposed. We should see if we are getting value for money and consider if extra staffing, whether solicitors or barristers, should be employed in the Director of Public Prosecutions Office.  The figure of £1.2 million paid to counsel is not significant particularly when compared with the outlay for salaries for the Office.</P>
      <P>Another fact which prompts me to suggest we should have a review is that the Act under which the Office was established has been in operation for 15 years. We should consider whether that legislation needs to be reviewed and updated. For example, it would be of interest to know what consultations take place between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, as provided for in section 2.  It was a relevant point in discussions held recently in relation to the Ryan case.  Are the arrangements for those consultations adequate?  Perhaps we might get a clue as to the apparent discrepancy that arose in the views of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in the context of that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also consider the relationship between the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor and State solicitors around the country which is not covered in the Act.  I am not sure of the extent of it.  In the Cavan shooting case the charge was brought in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions and it appears that, following the statement of Mr. Justice Roe, guidelines are <Col N="2031" /> to be issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In passing, I should mention that we have not had an opportunity of seeing those guidelines.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice asking him to make a full statement on the case to the House.</P>
    <P>Another point of interest to me is that section 7, which deals with the retaining of barristers on behalf of the State &mdash; that arises in the context of the £1.2 million allocated for the payment of barristers this year &mdash; provides that the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions should ensure that barristers retained by them in their official capacity are chosen in such a manner as to effect a distribution of such retainers among the barristers that in the opinion of the Director and the Attorney General is fair and equitable taking one year with another.  I wonder if that section has been examined as to its effectiveness?  There are provisions for consultation with the Bar Council in relation to the operation of that section and I wonder if that has operated effectively.  Section 10 gives power to the Minister to make regulations to enable the Act to have full effect and it is important that we should be satisfied with those regulations.</P>
    <P>There was an obvious benefit to the country following the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the 1974 Act.  We have had the same Director of Public Prosecutions since the first appointment and he has established a reputation of honour and integrity.  I am glad the then Government established the Office and in suggesting that there should be a review of the operations of the Office I am not casting a scintilla of an aspersion in the direction of the person who holds the office of Director of Public Prosecutions. I am anxious that what appears to be an overload on the Director of Public Prosecutions is looked at and my proposal for a review of the functions of the Office follows on that line.  It is time for <Col N="2032" /> a full review of the functions, funding, and operation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and indeed of the legislation and regulations under which the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions operates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very brief Supplementary Estimate, the Minister's speech was appropriately brief and I, likewise, will try to confine my remarks to some technical matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be supporting the Supplementary Estimate because it is very necessary.  There have always been inordinate delays in paying fees to counsel. This is regrettable.  Obviously somebody got it all wrong in the course of the preparation of last year's Estimates.  It is regrettable that we have to come into the House late in the month of November to vote an additional sum of money, £435,000, for fees to counsel and for other general law expenses.  It is also regrettable that a situation has been allowed to develop where we are now faced with the appointment of ten full time solicitors and two technical staff. It is poor housekeeping that we have allowed a shortfall of 12 staff to arise in the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  I <Col N="2033" /> am not sure that I approve of the filling of these positions on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the competition. I would prefer if full time posts were filled following the completion of the competition because I suspect that people filling posts in a temporary capacity have a greater advantage than people on the outside when doing interviews for the full time position.  Perhaps the Minister might look at this again.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker has said so eloquently, there is always room for improvement and there are always ways of getting better value for money.  I am not sure, to be a little partisan, if employing solicitors as opposed to counsel is the better way of doing that.  Solicitors have an amazing ability to insinuate that the barristers are making all the money.  I suspect that on a detailed examination of the costs, clients may be surprised on occasion to see who is making more money.  I suppose solicitors have the additional expense of carrying a large staff even in west Cork, as we were informed tonight.</P>
    <P>I do not think the State should be in the position, in which we are now, that there are long delays before paying solicitors and barristers.  Regardless of the impression that some people are making very high incomes at the Bar, there are very many barristers who would prefer to be paid monthly and on a regular basis by the State.  I am assuming and I think I would be correct in my assumption that a great portion of the money voted tonight will go to pay fees that should have been paid 18 months to two years ago.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Estimate tonight I request the Minister &mdash; there is not much point requesting the Minister for the Marine whose hands are full with Rambo battles around the country &mdash; or the Minister who claims responsibility for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor to try to ensure that there are adequate staff <i>in situ</i> at any given time to ensure <Col N="2034" /> the efficient disposal of the duties of the Director of Public Prosecutions and of the Chief State Solicitor.  These are both very responsible positions and it is imperative that prosecutions be carried out as efficiently and correctly as possible. It brings the law and the legal offices of the State into disrepute when there are serious delays or serious problems as have arisen in the recent case in Cavan.  It is important that the resources, funding and personnel are made available. I certainly support any Minister who comes into the House looking for the resources, personnel and funds to ensure that we have an efficient Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and of the Chief State Solicitor so as to ensure that justice is done and within a short period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Supplementary Estimates.  I have no difficulty with where the money is allocated or the amount involved.  However, a number of points should be made.  Some of these have been made already by the previous two speakers and I add my voice in support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of a further ten solicitors and two clerical staff to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  One thing that has not been made clear either by the Minister for Finance when moving the Estimate tonight or by the Minister for Justice when he announced the decision in this House is whether those ten staff would be allocated specifically for the purpose of prosecution and the preparation and presentation of prosecution cases in court.  As we know that office deals with the entire gamut of legal work and there is grave concern that a good proportion, if not the majority of those being recruited, will be assigned to areas other than the bottleneck that exists which was illustrated by the threat of a district justice in Dublin to dismiss prosecutions because of the failure of the State to present the book of evidence in good time.  I would like clarification, if <Col N="2035" /> possible, as to where and what duties the ten staff will be assigned to within the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and whether they will be totally involved in the preparation and presentation of prosecution cases in the courts.  I take this opportunity, having worked for 15 years as a defence lawyer in opposition, daily if not hourly, to the staff of the Chief State Solicitor's office in the Dublin courts, to pay the highest tribute I possibly can to them for the excellence and diligence to which they apply themselves to their work.  It was remarkable to see the scope and commitment in the range of expertise that they showed and still show on a daily basis in our courts.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate suggests that there has been and will be greater reliance on the use of barristers in the presentation and prosecution of cases. That is a welcome feature, but there is a practice growing up around it of allowing barristers to appear in court unattended and without proper attendance from the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  That practice should not be allowed develop. I hope that with the recruitment of staff to the office that will not be the practice in future.  Deputy Spring has raised the issue, which is certainly very close to my own heart, of the inordinate delays that occur in the discharge of fees to barristers, and indeed solicitors, working under the parallel criminal legal aid scheme.  It is a source of great annoyance to people working in the area when they consider the speed and efficiency with which other Departments, particularly the Department of Health pay doctors under the GMS scheme or pay dentists under the dental scheme or the Department of Agriculture and Food pay veterinary surgeons under the bovine disease control schemes.  These Departments can pay for work on a monthly ongoing basis but despite numerous requests and endless deputations to the office of the Minister nothing can be done to speed up the payment to law-years. <Col N="2036" /> This is grossly unfair, particularly to those who rely almost exclusively for their livelihood on the work they get under the criminal legal aid or Attorney General schemes through the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I would like that matter dealt with.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and indeed all of us, must be that cases are presented and prosecuted on an efficient and speedy basis.  In addition to an inadequate number of staff, in the office of the director and the office of Chief State Solicitor one of the greatest factors militating against this objective is the grossly inefficient way in which our courts are expected to operate.  When one walks into any of the metropolitan courts in Dublin, in particular, one is stepping back in time to another era.  The courtroom in Kilmainham had to be closed on many occasions because the district justice simply could not survive the elements and the district justice in Dún Laoghaire is sitting in vastly inferior accommodation which does no tribute to the work the judges are seeking to carry out at these locations.</P>
    <P>The work of the Director of Public Prosecutions and all those officers of the courts in presenting and prosecuting cases in this jurisdiction would be so much easier if we had courts which were properly furnished, maintained, heated and equipped.  I appreciate that this does not have a direct bearing on this Supplementary Estimate but it certainly does have an indirect bearing on the efficiency with which the Director of Public Prosecutions can present and deal with cases.</P>
    <P>As has been said, the time has come to look again at the position which the director holds within the system.  One matter which is a source of concern is the utter non-accountability of the director to any level within the administrative or parliamentary process.  I am thinking here of his power to refer unchallenged <Col N="2037" /> a case involving non-terrorist offences from the ordinary courts to the Special Criminal Court and cases of controversy where he is obliged to make decisions, such as the Ryan extradition case, in the face of what seems to have been a fairly strong suggestion from other quarters that there was a case to answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer if the Deputy did not go into any detail in respect of personalities of that kind.  My colleague advised the House earlier that we should be very careful not to comment on or criticise or make charges against persons outside the House who are defenceless against accusations made under the privilege of this House.  I ask the Deputy to be very careful before he would reflect on any member outside the House, be it the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other person.</P>

As I said, there are occasions when he is called upon to, and must in the course of his duty, make controversial decisions.  We should look at a process where in regard to those decisions he would have the opportunity to give an explanation in the proper forum.  I believe that the interests of justice and the better interests of his Office in the long term would be served by giving him such an opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is one matter in relation to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which is of great concern and that is the affair surrounding our planning processes in the city.  I hope we will see the Office bring an effective and speedy conclusion to this matter.  If not, The Workers' Party will use this House to try to expose some of the facts surrounding that scandal.  I support this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up <Col N="2038" /> the House for too long.  I am the exception in making a contribution on this Supplementary Estimate as I am not a member of the legal fraternity who always seem to be very concerned with what is going on in the city and county of Dublin but who do not seem to be concerned with what is happening in the country.  I support the call of my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for a review of the various legal offices, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the delays in the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the problems which have arisen because of the lack of full-time solicitors.  The Minister, in his speech, stated that additional staff will be made available almost immediately.  I, too, want to find out what exactly these ten additional staff will be employed at.  There seem to be great delays in the processing of documents referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office by various Departments of State. These may result in delays in conveyancing and in the start-up of businesses. This Office has a role to play in the efficient running of the State and, therefore, I appeal to the Minister to assign some of these legal people to the task of giving assent or otherwise to documents referred to them by sections of the public service.</P>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's Office should be able to liaise with the public directly.  If one wants to find out, for instance, if a document is being processed through the Chief State Solicitor's Office, one has to go to the legal people who may already be behind in the processing of these documents and one may not get any information.  I would like the Minister to consider some way by which the public would have access to these offices.</P>

      <P>I thank all those Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will do my <Col N="2039" /> best to respond to the points raised by them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of staffing in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office provides support staff, that is, solicitors, for the Director of Public Prosecutions Office who does not employ solicitors directly.  However, in response to the shortage of available staff in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, additional appointments &mdash; ten solicitors and two technical staff &mdash; have been sanctioned.  The same question was raised by Deputy Spring who asked why the numbers had dropped so much.  He said he was not happy that only temporary staff were being recruited.  The reason they are being appointed on a temporary basis is our desire to ensure that the savings I have projected in 1990 will be effected.  In other words, they will be assigned on a temporary basis but the Civil Service Commission will take over and carry out permanent recruitment of staff.  On analysis, we are able to see to what level fees have risen over a particular period.  While it is always difficult to estimate what level they will reach, it is quite clear that by appointing solicitors there will be a saving.  This is one area where a special exemption can be made.  By appointing more staff we can save the Exchequer money and that is why we have taken this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also asked if the number of staff is adequate to carry out the work it does at present.  I want to confirm that the Director of Public Prosecutions Office is adequately staffed. None of the cases mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe which allegedly went wrong have anything to do with the staffing level of the Director of Public Prosecutions Office.  He also referred to a review of the Director of Public Prosecutions Office and revised legislation for that Office.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is a matter for the Taoiseach.  I will <Col N="2040" /> bring the Deputy's comments to the Taoiseach's attention as he deals with that Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Deputy O'Keeffe also raised the question why the 1990 Estimate is lower than the 1989 outturn.  The 1990 Estimate is based on current expenditure trends and allows for the fact that expenditure on counsel fees will be less than it would have been as a result of the availability of solicitors from the Chief State Solicitor's Office; in other words, the reason for a lower projection for 1990 is that we are getting the extra staff I spoke about.  Therefore, savings will arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan raised the question of the assignment of Chief State Solicitor's Office staff and I would confirm that the ten solicitors and two technical staff now being recruited to the Chief State Solicitor's Office will be assigned to prosecution work on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Deputy Spring raised the question that the Estimate for 1989 fees to counsel was based on our consideration of the availability of solicitors in the Chief State Solicitors's Office to prosecute.  As it turns out a great number of these solicitors were unavailable and barristers had to be paid on a freelance basis.  That basically is the reason for the additional fees there. Deputy Spring raised the question of the payment of fees to counsel.  There is no delay in the payment of fees to counsel employed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of staff being sent to court from the Director of Public Prosecutions Office.  The Director of Public Prosecutions' Office do not send their staff to court.  Deputy McCartan raised the question of the delay in paying solicitors under the criminal legal aid scheme.  This is not the fault of the Director of Public Prosecutions Office.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment.  One might assume that the farm development service affects only those directly involved in agriculture but the present crisis has a significant impact on those directly involved in farming and also on the quality of the environment and on industrial relations, <Col N="2042" /> given the present dispute between the Civil and Public Servants Union and the Department.  The dispute must have implications also for the national understanding because the union are a party to that.</P>
      <P>To appreciate this crisis fully one must cast one's mind back to the mid-eighties when a series of fish kills alerted the community to the environment issue, to the quality of our environment and to the fact that any damage to our environment would adversely affect our international image and our important tourist industry. As a result of that awareness Governments since have introduced and pursued a series of initiatives to combat environmental crises.  We had the farm improvement programme, the PWDH initially introduced in the western drainage areas and subsequently extended to cover the whole country, and the most recent and possibly most attractive help, the control of farm pollution grants introduced in August 1989.  Tribute must be paid to individual farmers who availed of the attractive grant aid to combat what was a serious problem for them and a problem which affected the whole community. Much progress has been made, as I am sure is recognised by the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture and by the Minister having regard to the lessening number of fish kills and the improved quality of the environment.</P>
      <P>I am sceptical that the present mood is towards publicity hype about solving the environment problems.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment published a new booklet today but little resources are being deployed where needed in order to effectively tackle the problems.</P>

    <P>The crisis to which I refer arose because a series of initiatives were introduced with little consideration for the effect on the farm development service. The initiatives introduced in the mid-eighties coincided with the embargo on recruitment to the public service and, <Col N="2043" /> since 1987, the devastating voluntary redundancy package which took many of the best and the brightest from the service, from top management down to clerical level.  The lack of planning and consideration for the ability of the organisation to carry out its duties effectively and efficiently has led to the unions refusing to handle the CFP grants which since August 1989 grant aided to the tune of 55 per cent categories of farm pollution control.  Throughout farm development services and in the Minister's Department grant applications that passed through the local farm development services are lying there because the unions are legitimately and understandably refusing to process them.  All these schemes have been foisted on the workers with little consideration for staffing levels and that is where the crisis arises.  This dispute has gone on too long.  I earnestly request the Minister to tackle the problems. Since 1 November the unions have been blacking these applications and no progress has been made.  What steps has the Minister taken or does he intend to take to resolve the dispute?  The Minister should provide adequate staffing and finance for the various sections.  Field officers have found themselves office bound because their travelling allowances have run out and farmers anxious to play their part in protecting the environment are unable to fulfil that desire due to the present legitimate dispute. Little attention was paid to the effect of these schemes on staffing, given that the introduction of the schemes coincided with the embargo on recruitment and the voluntary redundancy package.</P>
    <P>In Teagasc there is a particular difficulty with regard to the installation aid grants in the Cork, Kerry and Limerick areas which relate to the failure to replace a Mr. Cadogan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a failure to replace a senior agricultural officer who had direct responsibility for inspecting installation aid grants which were a significant incentive to handing over farms by elderly holders to young and more enthusiastic entrepreneurs.  They are facing inordinate difficulties any way in the Land Registry office.  A senior officer from the Department in the Dublin area is being asked to visit Cork, Kerry and Limerick on a once, twice or thrice monthly basis which is totally inadequate.  The installation aid applications are piling up in Teagasc offices through Cork, Kerry and Limerick and there is no hope of resolving the matter unless that post is filled.</P>
      <P>Many of these farmers are operating to deadlines, tax year deadlines, bank deadlines, etc. and it behoves the Minister to act in a positive manner to resolve the dispute forthwith.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Creed for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Creed in expressing my concern at the delay in the processing of grants for the control of pollution due mainly to the reduction of staff in the farm development service.  It is unfair to expect a depleted staff to cope with an increasing volume of work, due mainly to the Government's insistence, and rightly so, on farm pollution control.  It is equally unfair to expect farmers to spend large sums of money providing the buildings necessary for farm pollution control if they cannot expect to receive the grant when the work is completed.  They are discovering that when work is completed the grants are delayed for several months.  This is totally unacceptable to a farming community that has responded magnificently to the general demands for farm pollution control.  Delays in payments puts much stress on farmers who have a commitment to pay their lending agency when buildings are completed. These honourable farmers are rightly <Col N="2045" /> upset at not having the money when payment is due.  It puts them in a position where they may not have credibility with their lending agency when they look for a further loan in the future.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately a similar situation exists with Teagasc.  In my own constituency in South Tipperary both technical and clerical staff have been reduced by over 60 per cent.  Two area offices in Cahir and Killenaule have been closed and further areas, Tipperary and Dundrum, have an almost depleted service.  As a result only 700 farm families out of a total of 5,000 can avail of the Teagasc service.  I see little point in the Minister paying lip service to quality production, to farm pollution control and to modern farm management techniques while at the same time presiding over the removal of the necessary assistance to members of the agricultural community by reducing the number of staff in Teagasc and the farm development service who provide the necessary incentives for farmers to deal with farm pollution by the speedy payment of grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get his priorities right.  If he wishes to enhance the name of Irish agriculture as a producer of good quality food and as a protector of the environment, he must remember that that job starts at the farm gate and can only be continued by providing adequate staff in the farm development service and Teagasc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for allowing me this brief intervention in the debate.  There is a crisis in the farm development services.  The Minister's decisions have put at grave risk this antipollution programme which has been heralded in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm development service is so depleted that in my own area farmers entitled to £700,000 worth of grants have not had the final inspection carried out because the officers have a limited travel budget.  It is very difficult to understand <Col N="2046" /> why the Department decided to discriminate against the officers in the farm development service by putting this upper limit of approximately £2,000 on their travelling expenses while an ERAD officer of the same standing has a travel allowance in excess of that provided for the farm development officers.</P>
    <P>I want to make a telling point about the services being given by the farm development service.  In the regulations the Minister implies a clawback system. There is a clawback of £30 for a visit and that is given as a subsidy towards the farm development officer's work.  When this money is available as a result of the good work done by farmers, why is this niggardly approach being adopted by the Minister with regard to the travel budget of the farm development service officers?</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in regard to the appointment of senior officers.  In my constituency a senior officer has retired and he has not been replaced.  In west Clare in particular some applicants have been two years waiting for inspection. That is not a modern way to look at things.  While we have to work within the constraints of the budget cuts that have been imposed on us, surely the Minister, with this self-financing programme, could make a better effort to resolve this dispute in his Department.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to reply to the short debate we have had here and I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>
      <P>There is no crisis in the farm, development service or Teagasc.  The workload of the local offices is, admittedly, heavy due to the volume of applications generated by the very attractive incentives introduced by this Government for on-farm investment.  These applications are being dealt with as quickly as possible having regard to existing staff resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning of 1989 to the end of September over 14,000 approvals <Col N="2047" /> issued to farmers for investments costing in the region of £120 million under the revised western package, the farm improvement programme and the new scheme for the control of farmyard pollution. In addition nearly 500 applications were received under the scheme of installation aid and 422 premiums were paid.</P>
    <P>The processing of applications of the young farmer installation scheme is generally a lengthy and complex process. This is due to the detailed examination required in determining eligibility to comply with the relevant EC regulation. In many cases, however, failure of the applicant to have his title registered adds to the delay.</P>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme was introduced last August. Unfortunately, in many offices throughout the country, industrial action has been taking place in relation to the processing of applications under this scheme. Officials of my Department are having negotiations with the union involved and it is hoped that agreement will be reached shortly.</P>
    <P>As the demand for grants this year has exceeded the budgetary allocation of £19.4 million, there is now a short time lag in payments.  I expect, however, that all the outstanding grants will be paid before the end of the year.  I am sure Deputies are aware that we hope to have a Supplementary Estimate to the tune of £8 million in the next week or so and that should certainly help in coming to terms very quickly with the backlog of payment of grants that are now ready for payment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the lack of adequate policing in Dublin north-east and the problems arising therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank <Col N="2048" /> you for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment debate tonight.  In addressing the inadequacy of policing in Dublin north-east, I speak on behalf of every Member of the constituency of Dublin north-east, an area that is served primarily by three police stations under the subdivision headquarters at Santry.  The stations are Coolock, Raheny and Howth.</P>
      <P>I wish at the outset to pay tribute to the gardaí of each of these stations to their superintendent and to their superiors for the very excellent job they are doing in circumstances where they are clearly not being helped by the current Government and Minister.  When one looks at the staffing statistics of the three Garda stations over the past five years the picture clearly emerges.  One starts with the most easterly of the three Garda stations, Howth, which in 1984 boasted 41 members of the Garda and currently on its 1988 allocation has 37 members, a drop of four in that period.  Raheny in 1984 boasted 62 members and currently has 61.  Coolock Garda Station in 1984 had 98 members and currently has 105, but that must be contrasted with the figure in 1986 when it had an allocation of 110.  In the last two years the busiest station, arguably, in the area has lost five members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must put Coolock and Dublin north-east in the overall context of crime nationally.  The Garda Síochána Commissioner's report indicates that 61.9 per cent of all crime recorded is within the confines of the Dublin metropolitan area. On the other hand, crime detected is 28.2 per cent.  Those figures indicating the Dublin scene are very strongly reflected in the comparable figures for the Dublin north-east constituency and indicate the scale of the job expected of our Garda.  In another context, Coolock Garda station polices a population equal to that of Limerick city which can boast of a minimum of three if not four, Garda stations &mdash; I am not exactly sure how many &mdash; but far more resources are spread over a greater <Col N="2049" /> geographic area than that of the north-east constituency, and more particularly the catchment area of Coolock.</P>
    <P>One of the issues related to the Coolock Garda station has been the campaign of the people in the Donaghmede area for years for the establishment of another Garda station there.  This area has expanded rapidly over the years, is in the catchment area of Coolock Garda station and contains within it some of the districts most geographically remote from the station. Some time ago a Garda clinic was opened in the Donaghmede shopping centre.  It was originally envisaged to have a complement of a minimum of eight gardaí assigned to it on the basis that it would operate on a 24 hour roster. However, since it has been opened &mdash; and it has worked as well as could be expected, again within its constraints &mdash; it opens on only six days a week, excluding Sundays, from 10 a.m. to midday, 2.30 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 8 p.m., again depending on the availability of the gardaí assigned to it, not the eight as originally envisaged but far fewer than that.  I understand from a recent answer from the Minister in the House that he does not intend to expand that service and establish a proper Garda station in the area.  The need for a Garda station additional to those existing and located in the Donaghmede area I believe is unanswerable and until this Government are prepared to acknowledge the huge workload that rests on the shoulders of the gardaí in the three stations in Dublin north-east I do not think we can make a great deal of progress with that issue. Nonetheless, we cannot get away from this problem, and we will not.</P>
    <P>In the event that the Minister and Government are not prepared to expend the obvious needed funding for an expansion of the Garda station network in the constituency, I argue that certainly the complement of gardaí assigned to the various stations must be dramatically improved.  There is great need to get back to and expand the numbers that were <Col N="2050" /> there so many years ago as illustrated by the figures.</P>
    <P>Another area of major concern is the non-expansion of the Garda community schemes, that have operated in the area since February 1988.  We understood these were being introduced as pilot schemes in that month and would operate in three locations &mdash; the Darndale-Belcamp area, Edenmore and Woodbine, and Priorswood and Riverside estates with two gardaí in each estate, and they would carry out their tours of duty in the area whenever on duty and available.  As a pilot scheme that has worked remarkably well but, unfortunately, its introduction has raised expectations, but deserved expectations, that should be fulfilled and met.  The concept of community policing must now be acknowledged as a resounding success in areas where it has been introduced as a pilot scheme and it must now be expanded but, let us be clear, it can be expanded only by the allocation of additional gardaí.  No one contends that the gardaí currently rostered in these stations for other duties should be taken off them and made available for community work. The concept is a good one and in this regard in July of this year I made the case in a statement in response to the Garda crime figures then released that &ldquo;it was a time to review manning policy and provision must be made for the greater use of civilian personnel in back-up roles&rdquo;.  I noted in November of this year that the Minister has responded to that suggestion and is now embarking upon a programme of introducing civilian personnel into the force, consequently releasing very experienced and useful members of the Garda from desk duties into the community. That process if it is the only vehicle for the recruitment of additional staff to the Dublin north-east area, must be given priority consideration.</P>
    <P>One particularly important and worrying aspect of the inadequacy of policing in the three stations is the juvenile liaison officer scheme located at Coolock Garda <Col N="2051" /> station.  Recently the scheme, which boasted a sergeant and three members, was operating on one member only, and on weekdays exclusively.  Because of the ban an overtime and the non-availability of funds, juvenile liaison officer schemes around the city and in the country, not only in Coolock but elsewhere, were constrained to work hours other than weekends. Surely that is the time when the juvenile liaison officer scheme should be operating most effectively.  In addition in the Coolock area one member had gone to Namibia &mdash; no one would wish him other than well there &mdash; and the other juvenile liaison officer had been on maternity duty.  Again I wish her well.  I understand her confinement was successful and she is now back on duty.  But this meant that for a considerable time the juvenile liaison officer scheme was over-stretched and overworked.  I make an urgent plea that as a basic minimum the juvenile liaison officer scheme be kept to full complement and that they be allowed work at weekends when young people need most supervision, when they are out of school and perhaps away from immediate parental notice as parents may be shopping, etc. at weekends.  That is a crucial minimum.</P>
    <P>The final matter that concerns me is the non-availability of a school attendance officer.  A member of the Garda Síochána has been appointed temporarily to this position.  For a long time, I understand, there was no such officer in the area. This is another cause of concern.  This is consistent with the picture that emerges of Dublin north-east and from information received from the Minister in answer to questions in the recent past, things are not good in the constituency.</P>
    <P>There is need for improvement of the service, for an increase in the number of police cars available for patrolling and, most important of all, there is a need for more gardaí to be assigned to the stations so that the community policing project can be extended.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="2052" /> respond positively to the concerns I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is away on official duty this evening and I am standing in on his behalf.  I would like at the outset to pay tribute to the gardaí and, in particular, to the new Commissioner, Commissioner Crowley, who is now coming to the end of his first year. Indeed, in relation to the Howth, Raheny and Coolock districts in particular, I would like to pay tribute to Superintendent Curran and Superintendent Geary, with whom I worked frequently in relation to the problems referred to this evening and to Chief Superintendent Moore who has been particularly helpful in resolving many of the difficulties which have arisen.  We have had excellent co-operation from the gardaí in that area generally and especially with the local communities in the neighbourhood watch groups.  I have made the needs of the area very clear to the Minister and he has recognised them.  Indeed, the pilot scheme of policing and community policing in the areas ranging from Kilbarrack to Coolock has been very successful, as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that the Government are fully conscious of the concern of the public that our basic right as citizens to go about our business, without fear of attack or interference is protected.  I know that the elderly, in particular, are concerned that there should be an adequate level of policing in their neighbourhood and that there should be a swift response by the Garda to any call for assistance.  Indeed, I might say to the Deputy who is a councillor in Dublin Corporation that there are also corporation elements in it in relation to roads, housing and the care of the elderly and it is also important that there is a contribution from that side to assist the Garda.  That comes to mind particularly in relation to the needs of the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has taken <Col N="2053" /> action to ensure a more visible Garda presence on the streets and cities of our towns.  Last week he announced a major crime fighting package for 1990 in which funding is being made available to provide the necessary resources to meet this objective.  With the basic aim of increasing the number of gardaí on the beat, the Government have authorised a number of major initiatives.  I emphasise, to the Deputy that the principal requirement is to increase the number of gardaí on the beat and increase their visibility in the community.  These are as follows, first, arrangements are being made for the appointment of 250 civilian clerical staff to work in Garda offices and thereby release gardaí for operational duties in the prevention and detection of crime for which they were recruited and trained.  I think the Minister deserves to be congratulated for taking that step.  The need for this has been pointed out over many years.  He has taken this step recently and it is something which will be beneficial to the areas in question.</P>
    <P>All areas will benefit from the appointment of these extra staff, including stations on the north side of Dublin.  The Civil Service Commission have already started the necessary arrangements to recruit these staff and, while it is too early yet for me to say when such staff will be available for assignment to particular Garda stations, the indications are that the first staff will be available early in the New Year.  That is an action programme and a speedy response.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister for Justice has made regulations to extend the retirement age to 60 in the case of 250 gardaí in the ranks of Garda, sergeant and inspector who would be due to retire on reaching the age of 57 before the end of 1991.  That will also help to increase the presence of gardaí in the community.</P>
    <P>Third, the pace of recruitment of 1,000 trainee gardaí is being accelerated; 348 trainees will be taken on during 1990, which is 50 more than originally planned; 260 young men and women will become <Col N="2054" /> full attested members of the Force next year, 86 of whom are already on the streets of Dublin as part of their initial training and 86 additional gardaí trainees will commence doing their on-the-job training in Dublin on Monday next.</P>
    <P>As well as having more gardaí on the beat, the Government have acted to ensure that those members of the force have the appropriate technical back-up and that criminals they apprehend actually serve their sentences.  The crime-fighting package for 1990 provides for the creation of 300 extra prison spaces over the next 12 to 18 months.  These places will start to be filled in the new Wheatfield prison in January next.  Later on more places will be taken up in the refurbished St. Patrick's Institution and in the new cell block in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that those who are found guilty must be contained for a reasonable period.  Much of the crime is committed by people who have been before the court and who are out again.  The gardaí know them, the people in the community know them, I know them and I am sure the Deputy knows a good number of them.  One of the problems has been the lack of adequate space to detain them.  The Minister is taking action in that area.</P>
    <P>A new approach to policing in the Dublin suburbs is well underway at this point involving the assignment of individual gardaí to local neighbourhoods on a full-time basis.  Community policing has already proved a popular and effective means of improving law enforcement throughout Dublin.  I understand the question of extending this scheme to new areas of the city and of allocating additional gardaí to it is under active consideration. I believe the Minister hopes to be in a position to make an important announcement on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Dublin north area, in particular, I can say that this area, in common with all other Garda divisions, will benefit from the measures announced by the Minister last week and from the <Col N="2055" /> forthcoming community policing initiative. I am not, of course, in a position to be specific about the precise number of gardaí and clerical staff involved but I can assure the Deputy and this House that my ministerial colleague is well aware of the policing needs of Dublin north-east and that he will ensure that the Garda authorities take these needs into account when the additional resources become available.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Garda authorities have assured the Minister that the current strength of 238 gardaí assigned to the four stations in Dublin north-east is being used to the best possible advantage.  Every effort is being made and will continue to be made to ensure that the gardaí in this area will respond quickly to every request for assistance.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the lead-up to Christmas the Minister, with the approval of the Government, has approved an additional £500,000 for overtime to ensure a very full police presence on the streets of <Col N="2056" /> Dublin at this crucial time.  This is effective action taken by the Minister which will ensure that more gardaí will be on the streets in the period leading up to Christmas.  Overtime for 1990 has been increased by £2.85 million over this year's allocation which will ensure the flexibility which the Garda need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this time leading up to Christmas is a particularly difficult one for the Garda, when their task is especially important.  The Minister recognises this and is applying all the additional resources he can to immediately tackle this problem in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  He is also taking measures which will ensure that as we go into the New Year the position of the Garda Síochána in the community will be greatly strengthened.  This is something which I know will be welcomed both by the Garda and the community in general.</P>

      <P>I support the general proposition that lottery funding should not be allocated to organisations which pursue active discrimination in the delivery of services in the sense of the Deputy's question. This is not to say, however, that organisations which have a particular religious or cultural orientation should be ineligible for lottery support for programmes which meet the eligibility criteria laid down for the relevant grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the eligibility criteria for individual grant schemes <Col N="1843" /> funded from the lottery are primarily a matter for the relevant Ministers.  I will bring his concerns to the attention of Ministers responsible for the spending of lottery allocations.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the sub-regional review committees provided for in the Community support framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-regional review committees comprise the existing sub-regional working and advisory groups, which were established by the Government to assist with the preparation of the <i>National Development Plan.</i>  The Government considered that the committees should be retained to ensure sub-regional monitoring of implementation of the plan and supporting operational programmes.  The EC Commission agreed to this proposal <Col N="1844" /> and, accordingly, the Community support framework, which governs disbursements from the Structural Funds to 1993, provides that the sub-regional working and advisory groups be merged to form sub-regional review committees. These review committees will be responsible for monitoring implementation of operational programmes at a sub-regional level.</P>
    <P>The committees will be convened as soon as the operational programmes, which are currently being finalised in discussion with the Commission, are approved in accordance with the terms of the Community support framework.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Supreme Court decision of May 1989 in the case of Patrick Hyland <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare and the Attorney General.  I understand that the judgment in that case was to the effect that the relevant social welfare provision was invalid, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, since it resulted in a married couple living together being treated less favourably <Col N="1847" /> than an unmarried couple living together. The income tax code already provides that a married couple is not treated less favourably than an unmarried couple living together.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, because of the vast number of individual cases involved covering all the taxes concerned, they did not compile statistics for the total amount of interest due by persons and companies who came within the terms of the amnesty.  All available resources during the amnesty period were fully extended in coping with accounting and receipting procedures and could not be deployed to the costly exercise of calculating interest that might otherwise be due.  The task of managing the amnesty would have been totally disrupted if resources had been expended on such a calculation.  This disruption would have adversely affected the success of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that precise information on numbers who benefited from the amnesty is not available.  In 1988, as a result of the amnesty, 357,000 more payments were receipted by the Collector-General than in 1987.  This represents a 30 per cent increase in 1988 as compared with 1987.  As many of those availing of the amnesty submitted multiple payments in respect of their various tax liabilities it is not possible to state the number of taxpayers from whom payments were received.</P>

      <P>Married participants with no other earnings in the tax year do not pay tax on earnings under the social employment scheme.  In many cases single participants do not pay tax either because the participant's income is less than his accumulated personal allowances.  In cases where tax is deducted, the participant will usually be entitled to claim a repayment at four-weekly intervals as <Col N="1851" /> long as he remains unemployed, up to the end of the tax year.  I have no plans to treat social employment scheme payments differently from payments made to employees on comparable incomes in relation to the operation of PAYE.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, in relation to a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 62 of 14 June 1988, if he will stipulate the manner in which the Attorney General can be held accountable to Dáil Éireann, as is the Government under Article 28.4.1 of the Constitution, for the discretionary decisions he is empowered to take under functions and duties conferred on him by law in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Constitution, in particular, the manner in which he may be asked questions about decisions he has taken under the powers imposed on him by the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, which powers enable him to decide that certain statutory instruments are not to be published, examples being virtually all regulations governing publicly funded education; if there is any mechanism for Dáil Éireann to question the Attorney General; if he will consider amending the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, to assign to a Minister the powers given to the Attorney General; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The administrative <i>raison d'etre</i> for the provision in question is economy of administration with particular reference to the volume and variety of statutory instruments (SIs) and the fact that some SIs are of particular application or receive adequate publicity otherwise.  Departments are required to apply in writing to the Attorney General for any necessary direction, giving reasons <i>inter alia,</i> when requesting drafting of the instrument by the parliamentary draftsman.  They are also required to ensure that exempted SIs receive adequate publicity when made and are <Col N="1852" /> brought fully to the notice of any persons or bodies concerned.  Section 2 (5) requires that every direction be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
      <P>I am advised that the Attorney General is not accountable to the Dáil under present law.  Only members of the Government are accountable to the Dáil under its Standing Orders and, by virtue of Article 30.4 of the Constitution, the Attorney General is not a member of the Government.  There is, however, nothing to preclude Deputies from seeking from the appropriate Minister his reasons for applying for a direction to exempt particular SIs from the publication requirements of the 1947 Act.</P>
      <P>I believe that, by virtue of his position as an independent constitutional officer, as has been accepted by the Supreme Court &mdash; McLoughlin <i>v.</i> Minister for Social Welfare, in particular &mdash; it is more appropriate that the quasi-judicial functions in section 2 of the 1947 Act should continue to be exercised by the Attorney General than by a Minister.  The statutory procedure governing publication of directions in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> together with the requirement that Departments ensure adequate publicity for exempted SIs ensure ample information for persons or bodies concerned.  Therefore, I do not favour an amendment on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have also inquired into the question of the application of the exemption provisions of section 2 of the 1947 Act in the area of publicly funded education.  One such direction, given by the Attorney General on 28 May 1948 in relation to the annual Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools &mdash; made by the Minister for Education under the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Acts, 1878-1924 &mdash; was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 1 June 1948.  I am informed, however, that the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools are in fact published annually by the Stationery Office.  It has not been possible to find any other direction under section 2 in this area.</P>

      <P>Self-assessment, while providing a fairer and easier system for the compliant taxpayer, is releasing Revenue resources to concentrate on the non-compliant taxpayer including tax evaders. While taxpayers will be helped and encouraged to comply voluntarily with their obligations, those who fail to comply will be dealt with swiftly and severely.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have, therefore, initiated a programme to verify in selected cases the accuracy of the income declared and the deductions and reliefs claimed.  Cases are selected for this programme on the basis of certain features present in the tax return or accounts or by reference to other information or criteria.  An essential part of this programme is the carrying out of a tax audit in selected cases, that is, an in-depth investigation of all aspects of a taxpayer's business.</P>

      <P>The Government have always recognised the importance of ensuring involvement at sub-regional level so that the increased support now available from the EC Structural Funds will be directed <Col N="1855" /> towards meeting the priority development needs identified at national, sub-regional and local level.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland is one region for European Community purposes, the Government considered that proper preparation of the National Development Plan required comprehensive consulation at national, sub-regional and local levels.  For this reason, the Government set up at a sub-regional level, special advisory and working groups representative of local authorities, the social partners and State agencies concerned with economic and social development. These groups played a major role in identifying development needs and priorities at sub-regional and local level, and provided a most valuable input to the planning process.</P>
      <P>The Government also consider that the sub-regional groups should have a continued role in monitoring the implementation of the plan and supporting operational programmes.  I am pleased to say that Commissioner Millan shares our view.  Accordingly, the Community support framework which will govern allocations from the Structural Funds to 1993, and which has now been adopted by the Commission, will include provision for a close monitoring of implementation of the plan and programmes at sub-regional level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community support framework provides that the sub-regional advisory and working groups will be merged to from sub-regional review committees. Government Departments responsible for overseeing operational programmes will be required to provide the review committees with regular reports detailing progress to date and proposed measures under the Structural Funds, in, or significantly affecting the sub-region concerned. My Department will have overall responsibility for ensuring that the review committees are kept properly informed. The review committees will be empowered to convey views on any aspect of implementation of the plan and programmes to the attention of a high level monitoring committee which will include <Col N="1856" /> representatives of the Commission, and which will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the Community support framework.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the heavy burden of taxation which has been borne by PAYE taxpayers and I have already taken significant steps to address the issue.  The income tax reliefs in the 1988 and 1989 budgets, including the reduction in the rates of tax that I brought in this year, will have a cumulative cost over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of over £700 million. The PAYE sector benefited significantly from the general reliefs and of course that sector has benefited also from the specific increases in the PAYE and PRSI allowances which, as the Deputy is aware, are not available to self-employed taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tandem with these reliefs we have introduced an unprecedented range of measures aimed at improving the effectiveness of the tax collection and enforcement system, so as to broaden the tax base and thus ensure a fairer distribution of the tax burden.  The most notable measures have been: the introduction of self-assessment procedures for self-employed and corporate taxpayers; the granting of a power to the Revenue Commissioners to attach the financial assets of defaulters; the introduction of a withholding tax on payments made by specified State bodies and by health insurers for certain professional services and the 1988 tax amnesty which brought about a significant reduction in arrears, particularly amongst the self-employed including farmers, and has had an ongoing <Col N="1859" /> knock-on effect in ensuring better compliance and enabling the Revenue to concentrate resources more effectively on tax default.  All of these measures have increased the tax yield from the non-PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>As regards future progress, I would point out to the Deputy that the <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a commitment to further reduce the standard rate of income tax, to 25 per cent by 1993, and to move towards a single higher rate of tax; and also to make further improvements in the tax exemption limits, in order to provide targeted help for part-time workers and the lower paid, especially those with families.  These reliefs will be funded, in part, by a further broadening of the tax base including an increased tax yield from the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>The detailed implementation of the programme commitments will of course be a matter for the annual budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The average annual rate of inflation for 1989 as a whole is expected to be about 4 per cent.  Thus, for the second successive year, our inflation rate will be below that of the UK, our biggest single trading partner and, indeed, below the average of the EC.  Current indications are that the annual rate of price increase will fall from the turn of the year to not much more than 3 per cent in the second half of next year.  This situation implies a favourable climate for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the gross pay of workers receiving the standard increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has not fully kept pace with the rate of inflation over the past two years, inflation to date has been closely in line with expectations. The modest shortfall has been more than made up by the income tax reliefs introduced in both the 1988 and 1989 budgets. As a result, there has been a real increase in take-home pay of workers in the period that the programme has been in operation. Furthermore, when account is taken of the fact that the actual increase in average earnings is estimated to be greater than the basic increase provided for, it is obvious that the living standards of workers have been more than protected to date under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In such circumstances, the question of reviewing <Col N="1861" /> the pay provisions of the programme should not arise.  As I said recently, renegotiation of the programme pay terms would jeopardise the underlying progress currently being made on the competitiveness and employment fronts. Moreover, for workers to seek higher pay increases at this stage would only add further to inflationary pressures and quickly erode the apparent value of the newly won concession.</P>

      <P>There are no EC funds available for arterial drainage schemes at present.  The Community measures whereby EC funds were made available for arterial drainage works in the less favoured areas of the west of Ireland and in the cross-Border region and on the Boyne and Maigue schemes expired some years ago and applications made in 1985 for further Community funding for arterial drainage were rejected by the EC.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a review of the taxpayer's liability for 1987-88 has now been carried out and an overpayment of £530.85 has arisen.  A cheque in settlement, representing all the tax deducted from her earnings in that year, will be issued to her within the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in reviewing the liability was caused by the fact that the taxpayer was unable to supply necessary evidence of pay and tax deducted in support of her claim.  Her employer had since ceased to trade and after some difficulty the Revenue Commissioners traced the employer <Col N="1870" /> and he supplied the evidence required on 7 September 1989.  Further information was required from the taxpayer and this was supplied in early November.</P>
    <P>I have also been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that at no time was the taxpayer admonished by a tax official for contacting a Member of Dáil Éireann about the delay.</P>

      <P>Changes in capital acquisitions tax, as with all taxes, fall to be considered by the Government in the context of the budget. It should be noted, however, that agricultural land is already very favourably treated under the capital acquisitions tax code in that the value of agricultural land passing to a farmer is reduced by the lesser of 50 per cent or £200,000.  No similar relief is provided for persons involved in any other form of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1985, provides a £2,000 exemption from income tax on leasing income obtained by lessors of agricultural land who are aged 55 years or more, or who are unable to carry on farming because of a permanent mental or physical infirmity.  One of the conditions attaching to the exemption is that the land must be leased by an individual who is not connected with the lessor.  Thus, lettings between persons who are close relatives do not come within the scope of the exemption.  The principal reason for this exclusion is to prevent tax avoidance, and the definition of closely connected relatives is the standard provision used for other income tax purposes.  Failure to exclude such persons <Col N="1873" /> from the scheme could result in an abuse of its provisions, as otherwise overall farming income could be manipulated between the persons involved to reduce, if not eliminate, any tax liability which would otherwise arise.  For these reasons, I would not be in favour of changing the current legislative provisions as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>It is expected that the Bonet scheme will be certified complete early in 1990 and the Boyle in 1993.  Total expenditure to date on these schemes amounts to £18 million of which almost £5 million was recovered by way of EC grants.  The projected total cost of completing the schemes as scheduled is of the order of £29 million.  It is, however, intended to <Col N="1875" /> curtail works on environmental and economic grounds.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the section of the River Bonet from Dromahair to Lough Gill is not scheduled for drainage work or clearance work in the Bonet arterial drainage scheme; that because of the improvements resulting from the drainage work up river the position regarding silting and flooding has become much more serious in this particular stretch of the river; that there is considerable blockage caused by trees and shrubs and collapsed river banks; and if, in view of this, he will sanction a programme of work for this stretch of the river while the appropriate machinery is still on the Bonet, to alleviate these difficulties thereby bringing considerable benefit to the farm and forestry land in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stretch of the River Bonet between Dromahair and Lough Gill was excluded from the Bonet catchment drainage scheme for practical and economic reasons.  The channel immediately downstream of Dromahair has a very steep gradient levelling out as it nears the lake.  In these lower reaches the channel is greatly influenced by lake levels which would to a large extent negate the effects of any drainage works.  In addition the bed of the river is largely composed of rock which would render prohibitive the cost of any works which might be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of siltation, the Commissioners of Public Works have had a number of surveys of the area carried out during the course of scheme works and the results of these show that the drainage scheme has not caused any deterioration of the position.  Any flooding which occurs is of shorter duration than existed pre-drainage and the Commissioners are satisfied with the capacity of the river to cater for post drainage flows.  The Commissioners will, of course keep the position under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Killery river enters the Bonet at a point downstream of Dromahair, County Leitrim.  As I have outlined today in a reply to a separate question regarding the drainage of this catchment, these downstream areas were excluded from the scheme for practical and economic reasons.  During the course of scheme works a number of representations were made on behalf of the landowners concerned to have this river included in the scheme and it was decided to re-examine the feasibility of carrying out some works in the area when the scheduled works of the scheme has been completed.  Early indications for a <Col N="1879" /> scheme of works were relatively promising and it was decided to process the matter further.  However, more recently it has proved necessary to re-examine the scheme as a whole on environmental and economic grounds and, as I have stated today, also in reply to a parliamentary question relating to the Bonet scheme, it is imperative now that works be curtailed for the reasons stated.  The inclusion of Killery river in the Bonet scheme could not be justified as the cost would be incommensurate with the benefits to be derived.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that conditions on the Killery have not been worsened by scheme works.</P>

      <P>This year I succeeded in obtaining an increased allocation of intervention beef from the EC for free distribution to the most needy welfare categories.  As a result it has been possible to extend the scheme substantially, and <Col N="1881" /> some 120,000 people have benefited under the 1989 arrangements compared with less than 50,000 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The quantity of beef available is strictly limited, thus making it necessary to identify specific beneficiaries.  In consultation with the Department of Social Welfare those on long-term unemployment assistance were identified as the welfare category in greatest need together with equivalent FÁS trainees and recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance. I am glad that all the long-term unemployed can be catered for this year, as last year only those on long term unemployment with fuel allowance were included.</P>
      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul agreed to operate the scheme, and some 600 tonnes of beef have, by now, been distributed by the society to the eligible social welfare categories.  Vouchers, redeemable at the local St. Vincent de Paul depot, were issued automatically through the employment exchanges and community welfare officers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, hostels and day-centres who provide meals for homeless people are being supplied with free intervention beef and butter on a year round basis.</P>
      <P>The increase in the numbers eligible for this year's free beef scheme indicates the Government's clear commitment to expand it to the maximum possible extent and for 1990 I will, of course, be seeking to ensure an even wider application.</P>

Since the initiation of the revised procedures the number of animals being presented at meat plants without ear-tags has been reduced to very low levels.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a number of steps to ensure that EC support measures are applied for the benefit of the Irish beef industry as a whole.  In the context of the reform of the beef regime introduced earlier this year, I obtained the formal recognition of the EC Commission and the Council of Ministers of the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy.  I have continuously and successfully insisted that this recognition should be given practical effect in the way the various support measures are operated.  In March of this year we got agreement to the introduction of carcase intervention because of the particular problems encountered by the winter feeder at that time.  In September an aids to private storage scheme was introduced. In addition to these specific measures, we have succeeded throughout the peak supply period this autumn in getting agreement at the beef management committee to the purchase of considerable quantities of beef into intervention in Ireland under the tendering system.  This culminated in last week's beef management committee's decision where the only bids for steers which were accepted were from Ireland i.e. 16,371 tonnes from the Republic and 1,040 tonnes from Northern Ireland.  These <Col N="1886" /> support measures have helped to maintain cattle prices at all stages of the production cycle.</P>

      <P>Cumulative arrears at 30 September 1989, the latest date for which such information is available, stood at £4.01 million and a more efficient system of collection will be put in place shortly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to unemployment benefit and claimed unemployment assistance on 18 May 1989.

      <P>As this assessment exceeds the maximum weekly rate payable in his case, he is not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance from that date.</P>

      <P>That apart, I should like to point out that the concept of family courts is achieved at present by having exclusive family law hearings and in certain cases, purpose built courtrooms.  More informality in all family law proceedings is required by the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That Act also provides for the use of counselling and mediation.</P>

      <P>The overall impact on Garda numbers of the package of measures which I announced recently was indicated in the press statement released at the time&mdash; provision is made for the appointment of 250 civilian clerical staff to release gardaí for operational duties, extension from 57 to 60 of the retirement age for members up to the rank of inspector and for recruitment of an extra 50 Garda trainees in 1990.  While Garda numbers in the Louth/Meath Garda Division, in common will all divisions, can be expected to benefit from these proposals, I am not in a position to be specific about the precise numbers that may go to each particular place.  The Garda authorities will assign the additional manpower as it becomes available to those areas which, in their professional judgment, have the greatest need for an increased Garda presence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The family mediation services available consist of the State's pilot scheme and services provided privately.  The State family mediation service was set up in 1986 as a three-year pilot scheme and the steering committee of the service have submitted their report to me on the effectiveness of that pilot scheme.  As I indicated in reply to Dáil Questions Nos. 26, 29 and 84 on the 9 November, I will not be in a position to comment on the future of the service until I have completed my examination of the report.  I consider that a number of wider issues need to be examined before decisions are reached on the long term future of the service.</P>
      <P>In the meantime there is a provision in the 1990 Estimates to allow the family mediation service to continue in operation, at least in its present form.</P>

      <P>On 24 October 1989, I announced that phases 3 and 4 of the Dundalk Inner Relief Road will be implemented, subject to the outcome of any statutory proceedures that may arise.  Recently, discussions were held with officials of the local authority regarding the detailed design, land acquisition, commencement and financing of the scheme.  It is envisaged that the estimated cost of this scheme &mdash; £6 million &mdash; may be financed by a combination of EC grants, funding from the private sector and State grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, it has been represented <Col N="1911" /> that the private sector may be prepared to contribute to the cost either: (a) on the basis of tolling the scheme; (b) a payment in respect of the development potential of the land adjoining the route; and (c) a combination of (a) and (b).</P>
    <P>The local authority have been asked for their observations on the prospects of private sector funds for the scheme.  In law, the tolling of a road project is a matter for the local authority, subject to statutory procedures, which include approval by the Minister to the toll scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department operates two schemes for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The first of these is a scheme of additional teaching assistance for national schools serving disadvantaged areas, the second a scheme of financial assistance for schools in such areas.</P>
      <P>The scheme of additional teaching assistance commenced in 1982 and, in the last school-year some 78 schools were benefiting under it.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government has made provision for up to 95 additional concessionary teaching posts in such areas from this year.  While the position of some schools with low enrolments has not been finalised, these additional posts are in general being approved in schools benefiting from the second (financial) scheme which had not had a concessionary teaching post to date.</P>
      <P>Currently, a further 54 schools have applied for additional teaching assistance on the basis that they claim to serve disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The scheme of financial assistance was initiated in 1984.  Selection of schools is on the basis of assessment by the Department rather than for formal application. A total of 178 schools have been assisted under the scheme to date.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible in the time available to categorise applicants in the manner sought by the Deputy but this information will be sent to him as soon as possible.</P>
