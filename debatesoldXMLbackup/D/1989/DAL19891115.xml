      <P>On a point of order. Before you put the questions on today's Order of Business, while we agreed yesterday with regard to the business today on the Trustee Saving Banks Bill, is it not in order to expect that there should be a question on today's Order of Business, this being a separate day's sitting? We cannot be bound by yesterday's order <Col N="410" /> in relation to today and poor progress has been made on that item.</P>

For that reason we oppose the Adjournment of the House at 10.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one final, brief point on section 5.  I had an opportunity last night of looking at the constitutional aspect of what the Minister is proposing in this section.  While undoubtedly the Constitution makes provision for delegated legislation, on reading the appropriate constitutional provisions it seems to me that it does not envisage giving to any person or authority power to amend, detract or in any way take from the legislative role given to the Oireachtas.  It seems to me that what the Minister proposes is a category of delegated legislation of a type not envisaged under the terms of the Constitution. I have very serious doubts about the provision to enable the Minister to amend or modify an Act of the Oireachtas.  I think it would be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>At some stage, the Minister should look at this again and consider that point. The Constitution is quite clear in laying down the legislative function and vesting it in the Oireachtas, and in the Oireachtas alone.  It provides that the Oireachtas may delegate powers to do certain things under it.  Giving powers to do things under the umbrella of the Oireachtas is one thing but giving power to put a subordinate authority on a par with the Oireachtas in constitutional terms is not envisaged under the Constitution.  For that reason alone this provision would have to be opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We all have had the opportunity to reflect on the section overnight.  My reflection only confirms me in my opposition.  The Minister quoted many precedents, but the difference between those examples and the Bill before us is that the provisions of those Bills to a very great extent were transparent.  One simply read the Bill and the provisions were clear.  In this Bill there are whole areas left to the discretion of the Minister, or to the discretion of the Minister in consultation with the Central Bank, or to the discretion of the Central Bank.  When we add to that powers as wide ranging as to modify each and every section of the Bill, if there is any difficulty in bringing the <Col N="426" /> provisions of the section into operation it is so sweeping as to put the Oireachtas in a position of not knowing what we are doing if we accept this section of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to hold the view that I expressed yesterday.  It was I who made the remark about it being unprecedented, and I stood corrected by the Minister.  Having looked at two of the precedents he quoted, I do not think the situation is analogous.  The correct way to deal with the matter is to bring in amending legislation if that is necessary. The provisions of this section are entirely too sweeping.  Deputy Taylor has now raised the spectre of their constitutionality. Notwithstanding that, if the Minister refuses to take on board the pleas from this side of the House at this stage, we have no alternative but to oppose the section and call a vote on it.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  I accept that the Supreme Court will interpret the law in any situation.  Similar provisions have been contained in other Bills.  The section contains the best wording possible and it is similar to that in other Bills.  Provisions similar to this are contained in section 71 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952; section 13 of the Canals Act, 1986; section 25 of the Farm Tax Act, 1985; section 10 of the Valuation Act, 1988.  The provision was included verbatim in the Building Societies Act, 1989, which got very strong, detailed debate and discussion in this House.  In the end it was accepted that there was no intention of using this provision to subvert the original legislation. The provision is intended merely to enable the Minister to deal with any unforeseen technical difficulties which <Col N="427" /> might arise in giving effect to any provision. In addition, it is provided under section 4 of this Bill that any regulation made under this section will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, who will have the power to annul the <Col N="428" /> regulation if they so wish.  Taking all that into account and the fact that the provision is contained in four other Acts, I suggest to the House that we should be able to accept this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is another section which would empower the Minister to do certain things by regulation which are inappropriate.  It would allow the Minister to modify the provisions of this Bill for the purpose of assimilating the law relating to trustee savings banks to the modifications of the law relating to companies, banks or building societies.  The Central Bank Act and the Building Societies Act are already on the Statute Book, so if any modifications were necessary to assimilate the law in so far as it is written in the Building Societies Act or in the Central Bank Act, they should be included in this Bill.  The Companies Bill is now going before a special committee.  If it becomes necessary to take on board certain provisions of the Companies Bill at a later date this should be done by way of amending legislation rather than by way of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments I have to make on this section are similar to the ones I made on the previous section, section 5.  If anything, the powers it is proposed to give to the Minister to modify the provisions of this Bill are even more extensive than the ones contained in section 5.  I am quite appalled by this.  The Minister would even have the power to provide for the charging of fees, although not in the nature of taxation.  Subsection (4) is particularly invidious.  It would enable the Minister to modify or alter Acts.  The section is so wide ranging that it is quite impossible to encompass it.  My party and I are totally opposed to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We can anticipate the Minister giving the same response to points made on section 6 as he gave on section 5.  This is regrettable.  If that is the response the Minister gives, the disposition of my party would be to call a vote.  However, having regard to the fact that some other important sections of the Bill remain to be dealt with, that perhaps is not the most expeditious way of registering one's dissent at the all-embracing and sweeping powers which it is proposed to confer on the Minister by way of this section.  It is inappropriate that provisions relating to other Acts should be imported into this Bill in the manner suggested here.  Certainly, we are opposed to this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 would empower the Minister to modify provisions of this Bill by regulation to take account of relevant changes in company, banking or building society legislation. This provision is necessary because many of the provisions contained in this Bill have originated in company, banking or building society legislation and trustee savings banks legislation will almost inevitably require amendment in order to keep up with any changes in these areas. Instead of having to return to the House to amend the Bill, this provision would allow the Minister to make such amendments by regulation.  This would in no way undermine the authority of the Oireachtas as it would apply only to legislation which has already been adopted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would not involve providing any new legislation. These regulations would also be subject to section 4, where they would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas which would have the power to annul the regulations within 21 days of the regulations being placed before them.  The intention is not to allow the Minister to change existing law but where changes may be made to an Act, such as the Central Bank Act, which would have implications for trustee savings banks as they would for building societies or other institutions, this section would allow the Minister to make the technical adjustments necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Cognisance must be taken of the interpretation of the law of <Col N="432" /> the courts.  We must make sure that laws we are introducing would not be at variance with other Acts if changes were made in other Acts.  In the case of an amendment to the Central Bank Act or some other Act which would impinge on this Act, the Minister must be given the power to make any technical adjustment necessary in order to ensure balance and equity within the effects of the Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Central Bank would be the supervising authority but there may be some technical matters relevant to the Minister and unless we give the power to the Minister to make the technical adjustments it may not be possible for the Central Bank as the supervisory authority to impose the technical changes desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The section is suffering from an overdose of prudence on the part of the Minister and his advisers.  There is nothing here about technical matters although the Minister replies to our comments by saying that it is to deal with technical matters.  The Bill says that if there is a modification in the law in parallel legislation the Minister may be regulation apply that modification to the Trustee Savings Banks.  That is not a technical matter.  It is a major provision dealing with the Trustee Savings Banks. If a change is made in the way building societies are treated in legislation that change may be applied to the Trustee Savings Banks in accordance with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Taylor pointed out in the Bill before the House, there is nothing to stop the Minister for Finance saying that the provisions of a section will also apply to the Trustee Savings Banks and that would be the appropriate way to legislate, but here again we have sweeping powers <Col N="433" /> being taken by the Minister, and the Minister of State is unable to outline the circumstances in which he envisages they would be used in any reasonable fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's point is a particularly poor one.  The only possible reason advocated for the need to have this section in the Bill is that, for example, he will be bringing in an amending Act dealing with the Central Bank and that it could affect the position of the Trustee Savings Banks under this Act and that therefore the Minister would need power to enable him to bring in regulations to modify the Act.  If the Minister is introducing an amending Act in respect of the Central Bank, he will have the opportunity then to put in a clause covering that point, and that would be the right way to do it.  Obviously the way to amend an Act of the Oireachtas is by an Act of the Oireachtas and not by ministerial regulation which is what is being advocated here.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point on section 5 and will probably make the same point on section 6, that the Minister has good intentions and that he would not abuse the powers given to him under these sections. That may well be true, and I am certain it is true so far as the present Minister is concerned, but that is not the point.  The point is that when making a provision like that it must be done in an orderly way.  There is no point allowing this go through because this Minister will not abuse it.  It is inappropriate that a Minister should have that power.  The sole reason given here this morning for giving this power is that there could be an amending Central Bank Act which would require modification to this Act. That is singularly uninspiring and most unimpressive.  I cannot see any force in that argument.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 47 to 51, to delete subsection (8) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The grant of a licence shall constitute a warranty as to the solvency of the institution concerned and the Central Bank shall be liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a person to whom a licence is granted or the trustee savings bank in respect of which it is granted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment I am suggesting that where a licence is granted it shall constitute a warranty as to the solvency of <Col N="437" /> the institution concerned and that the Central Bank shall be liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a person to whom a licence is granted or the Trustee Savings Bank in which the licence is granted. Subsection (8) as it stands will come as a great shock to the overwhelming majority of clients of the Trustee Savings Banks and their depositors.  Like other aspects of the functioning and administration of the Trustee Savings Banks at the moment, it is rather difficult to establish precisely what the position is in law.  Certainly, the public perception is that such a warranty applies at the moment and depositors with the banks believe that their savings are under-written by the Exchequer.  I instanced last night one case where that was brought into effect.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why we should change the position.  It seems to me that compatible with the remarks we made last night about what is the end purpose of the Bill is the fact that all distinguishing characteristics that mark out the Trustee Savings Banks, and their role in the banking community, are gradually being removed.  I am all in favour, in so far as is consistent, of maintaining the banks effectively in public ownership and in removing whatever restrictions there are in terms of enabling those banks to compete. We know that the rules of the marketplace, especially as practised by the Associated Banks, are ruthless.  I am all in favour of removing the restrictions and I do not see how that requires the removal of the warranty which people believe exists.  It has been part of the attraction of the Trustee Savings Banks for a particular type of saver or client who does business with them rather than with the Associated Banks that they believe that such a warranty exists.  Their confidence will be undermined if that subsection is passed.  I hope the Minister will change his view about it.  I cannot imagine why it is considered necessary.  Presumably, it will have some relation to section 59 which relates to whether or not the banks may advertise the fact that this security exists.</P>
    <Col N="438" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment and I should like to point out that my amendments, Nos. 15 and 16, would have the same effect as his.  We take the view that the Central Bank should be responsible to compensate any saver or investor in the Trustee Savings Banks in the event of a failure or of any saver or investor losing money as a result of the failure of the Central Bank to carry out its task of properly supervising the banks which has been given to it under the Bill.  Is there anything unfair or inequitable about that?  Section 4, which has been adopted, states that the Central Bank may give a direction to a trustee savings bank in relation to any matter.  In other words, the Central Bank is taking full control of the Trustee Savings Banks.  That is fair enough, but to what end can it give a direction to them?  It can do so in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of the Trustee Savings Banks.  It will have to ensure that they organise their financial affairs in a proper manner and that they made wise and sensible investments.  The Central Bank can supervise and control Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Central Bank has those powers and it exercises them badly or something goes amiss &mdash; those things can happen; we all remember the PMPS, the banks and the insurance companies that have gone &mdash; and ordinary savers lose their money as a result, is there any reason on earth why it should escape its responsibility to compensate those people for failing to do a job properly?  If the Central Bank does its job properly and exercise the exhaustive and wide ranging powers it is taking under the Bill, there will be no loss.  It follows therefore, that if a saver loses money the Central Bank would not have done its job properly. It would not have issued directions on matters that it should have, or seen to it that the affairs of the banks were carried on in an orderly and proper manner.  It would not have seen to it that regulations were introduced or supervised the banks sheets properly.  It would not have supervised the range of investments of the <Col N="439" /> banks or who the banks were lending their money to.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to take power and responsibility but there is another side to that coin.  When the Central Bank take on responsibility, like any other citizen of the State who does not carry his or her affairs in a proper manner or is negligent or careless, it must pay up to the person who suffers.  If one is not prepared to exercise that power in a responsible manner and stand over what one is doing, or not doing, one should not seek supervisory powers from the House.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is not going to issue licences to somebody to take people's savings and put them at risk. The Central Bank is a fine body of men and women who would take great care in regard to whom they would grant licences.  People do assume, and are entitled to assume, that when a body like the Central Bank not only issues a licence but takes on itself the power to supervise to such a detailed exhaustive extent, that their savings are safe.  There are two sides to the question, one is the taking of the power and other is the responsibility to compensate, and I say that when they take those powers they must at the same time be responsible if they use them badly, incorrectly or wrongly and unfortunate savers lose.  We do not want any other PMPS type situations in the country; one was enough.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have a different view from that of my colleagues. I do not think it follows that when the Central Bank takes to itself a regulatory role over the Trustee Savings Banks they subsequently have a liability if the Trustee Savings Banks get into difficulty. There are various licensing authorities and if licensing authorities act prudently and in accordance with the law I do not see why they should have a liability subsequently if something goes wrong.  The licensing authority for public houses is the District Court, and the enforcement agency is the Garda Síochána.  Nobody has ever suggested that if a publican <Col N="440" /> becomes bankrupt the Garda and the court should have liability to the creditors.</P>

The 80 per cent is either on deposit with the Minister or in Government paper and both are totally under-written, so there is a full guarantee for 80 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, it is backed by the Exchequer.  As I understand it, that is what was outlined in 1984 when there was a run on the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Minister for Finance of the day went on the 1.30 news on radio and said that every pound of depositors' money was under-written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in section 59 the Minister, for reasons best known to himself, is drawing attention to the fact that the Trustee Savings Banks are not supposed to advertise this guarantee and is forbidding them to publicise the fact that deposits are under-written; he is not saying that the deposits are not going to be underwritten.  There is also provision <Col N="441" /> in the Bill whereby the designated proportion, the 80-20 proportion, can be changed after consultations between the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  I presume it will be and I presume it will be changed in relation to the Trustee Savings Banks to give them a larger proportion for the increased banking activities which are being allowed to them under the provisions of this Bill.  If the <i>de jure</i> mechanism remains the same, that all deposits are notionally deposited with the Minister for Finance and he then returns a designated proportion for banking activities to the Trustee Savings Banks, it seems to me that the guarantee remains in place, and that under the terms of the legislation proposed &mdash; the Minister may correct me if I am wrong &mdash; there is a guarantee from the Exchequer to cover the full amount of all deposits in the Trustee Savings Banks, and that position remains.  The focus here on the fact that the grant of the licence shall not constitute a warranty from the Central Bank underwriting depositor's funds is not saying there is no warranty because so far as I can see there is a remaining guarantee from the Exchequer, not from the Central Bank, and that is the way it should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister just clarify that one net point?  After this Bill is passed &mdash; and I think this is something savers would be very interested in &mdash; is the Minister the guarantor of deposits with the Trustee Savings Banks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 follows section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971 with the European Community's licensing and supervision of bank regulations 1979. This provision alters the current situation where the Trustee Savings Banks are supervised by the Department of Finance. Under this and subsequent sections this function would transfer to the Central Bank as the principal authority supervising the banking system.  This would be a major step in the evolution of Trustee Savings Banks as it would put them into the same bracket as other banking and financial institutions and enable them to <Col N="442" /> compete with them on a more equal basis.</P>
      <P>An equally important aspect of this change in the banks' situation is that the banks' performance and growth would be monitored by the Central Bank with its overview and deeper knowledge of the banking and financial sector in Ireland, that the Central Bank would be responsible for the prudent supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks; but it is going much further than beyond the bounds of acceptability to accept that the Central Bank should be legally liable for Trustee Savings Banks' losses.  In that event the Central Bank would, effectively, have to run the Trustee Savings Banks on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>The present position, as the Minister for Finance has already stated in referring to section 59 on Second Stage, is that there is no State guarantee of deposits to depositors.  As 80 per cent of deposits are lodged with the Minister for Finance, these are, in effect, guaranteed to the Trustee Savings Banks against default. The remaining 20 per cent of the resources of the banks are invested prudently and profitably and it would be the function of the Central Bank to ensure that this continues.  When this legislation is put into effect the proportion of the deposit lodged with the Exchequer will only be reduced to the extent that there are opportunities for prudent and profitable expansion of Trustee Savings Banks business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the situation pertaining to the other banks.  The other commercial banks are obliged to place 10 per cent of their deposits with the Central Bank.  They are obliged to use 25 per cent of their deposits for buying gilts and other Government paper.  That means they have total flexibility with regard to prudent investment with the other 65 per cent.  We must give the Trustee Savings Banks credit for the fact that they have been able to operate on a very narrow 20 per cent of money available to them for lending and other purposes; they have not had the same flexibility as the other banks, and it is that we want to improve. It is not proposed that the ratio will be <Col N="443" /> reduced dramatically but as the Central Bank, as the supervising authority, in consultation with the Minister for Finance considers requests from the Trustee Savings Banks, the ratio would be reduced over a period giving a similar opportunity to the Trustee Savings Banks to operate in a similar financial environment and manage their affairs efficiently and prudently to the benefit of their investors and of the public at large. Where difficulties are restrictive impositions on any banking institution it is not possible for that banking institution to operate on an equal basis.  We must respect the performance and the track record of Trustee Savings Banks and of the other banks.  The Central Bank as a supervising authority would be there to supervise, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, the situation pertaining to the Trustee Savings Banks.  I do not think investors have anything to fear from putting their money into a Trustee Savings Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is not the stuff that sets the world on fire, but a great number of people outside will get a very rude shock from what has been elicited from the Minister now.  I have no doubt that the perception of the public, especially that section who are banking with Trustee Savings Banks, is that their savings are guaranteed.  It was to maintain that <i>status quo</i> that I put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Noonan's interpretation of it.  Deputy Noonan's distinction between the Central Bank as the licensing authority and the liability of the Exchequer for the full amount of the savings would go some way towards meeting the motivation for putting down this amendment.  If that were the case and if it could establish that the Exchequer had full liability, that would largely meet the situation but I think the Minister has answered unequivocally that that is not so.  I do not have the breakdown of the make-up of the clients of the Trustee Savings Banks but I suspect a majority of them would be known as <Col N="444" /> small savers.  It is puzzling when you have the instance that has been given of what happened in 1984 when there was a run on the banks caused by the rumour machine and so on, and the Minister for Finance of the day went on radio to assure depositors that not one penny would be put at risk.  That is the public perception of the Trustee Savings Banks.  What the Minister has now said &mdash; that 80 per cent of funds on loan to the Government are safe and prudent management would look after the rest &mdash; may be so.  It may well do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not in other areas to date.  Even professionals working in the maelstrom of the financial area in a bigger pool than the Trustee Saving Banks have made mistakes in the past; for example when the taxpayer was expected to bail out ICI to the extent of £146 million if I recall correctly the latest figure given by the then Minister, Deputy John Bruton.  Mistakes can happen, especially as it is proposed that the ratio may be changed.  I do not know what change in the ratio is proposed, but I do not think an improvement is suggested.  I do not think it is suggested that the ratio be 90:10 or anything like that.  It is likely to be a worsening of the ratio, and therefore an increase in exposure.  This is something of a revelation for the people banking with the Trustee Savings Banks.  I see no reason the change is necessary.  I thought the Minister was going to advance some reasons it would impede the competitive capacity of the Trustee Saving Banks <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Associated Banks if we did not do this, but he has not advanced that.  Therefore I see no reason we should be prepared to relinquish this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume this has emerged from discussions that have taken place not only with the Central Bank but perhaps with the lobby for the Associated Banks as well.  Section 59, which I submit is related expressly prohibits the Trustee Savings Banks from advertising this warranty, which I thought would be of advantage <Col N="445" /> to them.  Presumably this was the result of a lobby from the Associated Banks who would say that that would give the Trustee Savings Banks an unfair advantage. My disposition is to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think the Minister is correct.  I think there is a 100 per cent guarantee on the Trustee Savings Banks deposits at the moment, and that was the legal advice to the Minister's predecessors.  The Minister and his Department might prefer if that was not so but it seems it is.  I do not know whether he intends to change that.  At present he seems to suggest that only 80 per cent of the deposits in the banks are guaranteed.  I think the other 20 per cent is guaranteed as well because whatever happens in practice, the <i>de jure</i> position is that it passes through the hands of the Minister and is returned to the Trustee Savings Banks for banking activities.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, the uncertainty which runs right through this Bill concerns me. The stated intention of the Minister is that we will have a level playing field between all the banks, and that will include the Trustee Savings Banks.  If that were so, one would expect provisions here for liquidity which apply to the commercial banks.  We would have something to the effect that there would be primary liquidity and secondary liquidity and that would have to be up to 35 per cent of all deposits.  After that the Trustee Savings Banks would be free, as other banks are, to invest prudently on behalf of their depositors the remaining 65 per cent which is on deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister does not say that.  He says that new arrangements will be made for the designated proportion which can be used for banking activities. The present <i>de jure</i> position is an 80:20 proportion; 20 per cent is designated for the banking activities which the Trustee Savings Banks can engage in at present, and it seems reasonable that that 20 per cent would be expanded since we are expanding the range of activities they can become involved in.  I understand the <i>de facto</i> position at the moment is that the <Col N="446" /> break is about 75:25, that the Trustee Savings Banks have been operating ahead of the 20 per cent proportion and about 75 per cent of depositors' funds are being invested prudently at the moment. We are not clear what the Minister's intention or that of the Department is, and there are conflicts.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance have a vested interest in keeping a very large proportion of the depositors' funds in the hands of the Minister for Finance and in Government paper because that is a relatively inexpensive way of financing part of the Exchequer borrowing requirement, particularly when you apply DIRT to it.  I do not think DIRT applies to Government paper but it applies to deposits in the Trustee Savings Banks as it does to those in other banks, and there will be a conflict between the Trustee Savings Banks and the Department of Finance as to what proportion should be invested prudently.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister.  It will be a long time before the Trustee Savings Banks get a significantly greater proportion than the 25 per cent they are using already because there is a conflict of interest which has little or nothing to do with banking.  There is a conflict of interest between the people who run the Government debt and the EBR.  The State must be run, it needs money and this is a source of funding they will be reluctant to let go.  The provisions here are that a new designated proportion will be arrived at only in consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, but there is no level playing field.  There should be a provision here that the Trustee Savings Banks be treated for liquidity purposes by the Central Bank in exactly the same fashion as the Associated Banks.  I accept it will take time for them to invest prudently a proportion of deposits which at present is around 25 per cent and bring it back up to 60 or 70 per cent because at the moment they do not have the investment opportunities to do so and there is a loss to the Exchequer on the other side. However, a provision should be written in so that they will arrive at the level <Col N="447" /> playing field with all the other banks. That is not being done here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start some kind of scare here today, saying depositors' funds in the Trustee Savings Banks are not secure, because I think the Trustee Savings Banks at the moment are as safe as Fort Knox.  People can feel quite safe about leaving their money in the Trustee Savings Banks and I would hate an impression to be created in this House that people should switch their money to other banks as they did in panic in 1984. There was no reason to do it in 1984 and there is no reason to do it now, but the Minister would need to be very clear in what he says and he would need to state in this House that there is no change in the present position.  In case there is any contrary impression given, the Minister of State should get up and say that as far as he is concerned the Trustee Savings Banks, both before and after the Bill is enacted, will be as safe as Fort Knox and there should be no fear for any depositor who has money in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree absolutely with Deputy Noonan when he says that, as far as he knows, and I say as far as I know, funds deposited in the Trustee Savings Banks are absolutely 100 per cent secure. It is because we know they are secure &mdash; and I hope the Minister will confirm that when he replies &mdash; there is no reason on earth why the guarantee sought here in these amendments should not be given, because we know there is no question of any such guarantee ever having to be called in.  The purport of the amendments is not to provide for a situation where such a guarantee may have to be called in but rather to enhance the position of the Trustee Savings Banks as State-owned banks &mdash; that is something we want &mdash; that they have a State guarantee. Because the funds are secure there is no potential loss whatsoever on the Central Bank or on the Minister by confirming that the guarantee exists.  There appears to be a woolly feeling in the House on whether this guarantee exists or whether it does not.  The Minister said there is no <Col N="448" /> such guarantee and that there will be no such guarantee.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan thinks that the Minister's advice on this matter is wrong or is different from what it was when he was in Cabinet.  There appears to be a direct conflict on this issue.  Quite frankly it is a net point and it ought to be clarified one way or the other.  People are entitled to know which of the two versions is the correct one.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a new situation that will pertain after the Bill is enacted. Why should people not be enabled to go into a State-owned bank, a bank for all practical purposes in public ownership, which is only one technicality away from it and, as the Minister said, their assets are within the disposal of the Oireachtas. In my book that makes them, for all practical purposes, State-owned banks. Nobody else owns them, there are no shareholders and they are at the disposal of the Oireachtas.  They are a State-owned bank and why then should investors and small depositors not be able to invest their money in them in the secure knowledge that there is a State backed guarantee for it?  There is no exposure on the Minister or the Central Bank.  The Central Bank had itself exposed on non-State owned institutions, as Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, in the case of ICI and so on.  How much more would this apply in the case of a State-owned enterprise such as the Trustee Savings Banks?  Is it not entirely appropriate that it should be clear that the public should know that their money is 100 per cent safe, firstly, because the investments are wisely made under the controlled direction and close supervision of the Central Bank and, secondly, because the guarantee is there?  It would be a tremendous help to the Trustee Savings Banks in carrying out their operations because it would be a great encouragement to achieve more and higher deposits which would enable the Trustee Savings Banks to expand their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 18:20 position has been referred to. I would regard it as a complete breach of faith on the part of the Minister if the Trustee Savings Banks were not in a <Col N="449" /> number of years allowed to operate on a level pegging system so far as deposits with the Government were concerned, as are the cartel banks.  Clearly, the Minister is conveying to the House in the entire course of this debate that he wants the Trustee Savings Banks to be able to compete on a level playing pitch with the cartel banks.  The clear implication of that must be that there will be no constraint put on the Trustee Savings Banks in any way which is different from that which applies to the cartel banks.  I accept that that is not something that could be done overnight, because we are talking about hundreds of millions of pounds which are involved in these deposits.  It may take some little time to achieve that parity of position on deposits as between the Trustee Savings Banks and the cartel banks.  I would like a clear indication from the Minister to confirm that in the short to medium term the parity position will be achieved because otherwise his wish that the Trustee Savings Banks should have an equal opportunity to compete with the cartel banks would prove to be entirely hollow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are now two questions which the Minister must answer, the first relates to whether or not deposits are guaranteed at present.  As recently as 1984 the Minister of the day assured the public that they were guaranteed; now there appears to be some doubt about that position.  Second, if they are guaranteed does subsection (8) change that position?  Deputy Noonan submits that it does not.  The Minister has already said it does.  We need to clarify the position. The investors and depositors and so on with the bank believe the guarantee exists.  I did not say their savings were at risk or were not secure.  What I said was that they believe them to be guaranteed. I am satisfied that the overwhelming majority of depositors with the Trustee Savings Banks believe that guarantee exists.  That is a different matter from commenting on whether the funds are secure.  I believe they are secure but does the guarantee exist?  Does subsection (8) change that position or not?  On that <Col N="450" /> basis, I will make up my mind on whether to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>This can only be changed by the Oireachtas and we are making provisions under section 58 should it arise.  Eighty per cent of deposits are lodged with the Exchequer.  Only 80 per cent of the deposits come to the Minister. The remainder are retained by the Trustee Savings Banks and do not come to the Minister.  As 80 per cent of the deposits are lodged with the Exchequer, through the Minister for Finance, these are in effect guaranteed to the Trustee Savings Banks against default, the remaining 20 per cent of the resources are invested by the banks.  If the Central Bank and the Minister after consultation decide to reduce that ratio this Bill will give them the power to do so.  Let there be no doubt or ambiguity about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised this matter on Second Stage and referred to assurances given by the Minister for Finance in 1984 when there was an exceptional level of withdrawals of deposits from the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank.  In 1984 the then Minister for Finance was satisfied that the Trustee Savings Banks were entirely solvent and were in a position to repay all their depositors in full.  I am very happy to say that this continues to be the case <Col N="451" /> today and I have no doubt will continue to be the case in the future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is talking about a subsidiary body of a parent company. The matter got a thorough airing in this House and as far as I am concerned we cannot compare the Trustee Savings Banks with the ICI.  The function of the Trustee Savings Banks is to take in deposits.  They are obliged by law to place 80 per cent of those deposits with the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Noonan referred to the Exchequer borrowing position and the fact that it suits the Department of Finance and Governments to have those deposits at their disposal because they are a reasonably cheap means of Exchequer borrowing. I appreciate that.  The ratio of Trustee Savings Banks money available for Exchequer borrowing <i>vis-à-vis</i> total Exchequer borrowing would be small. If the playing field is improved for the Trustee Savings Banks I cannot see that there will be any detrimental effect on Exchequer borrowing requirements.  It would be possible for the Exchequer to make alternative arrangments which would not cost the taxpayer a lot more money.  It is unfair to compare the Trustee Savings Banks with the ICI.  We must not put them into a straitjacket but <Col N="452" /> must judiciously and carefuly remove the impediments and restrictions, under the supervision of the Central Bank and in consultation with the Minister for Finance. We must slowly reduce the ratio of investment with the State and move towards the area which the associated and commercial banks enjoy.  This must be done carefully, not in a very dramatic manner.  People who have deposits with the Trustee Savings Banks can be absolutely certain that their money is safe.  If the proportion of Trustee Savings Banks funds with the Minister falls significantly, they will be brought into the deposit protection scheme under the Central Bank Act.</P>

      <P>I do not want to waste too much time on the question of the AIB analogy, not the ICI.  I submit that the business of acquisition could very much become the business of the Trustee Savings Banks in the future.  One cannot glibly say that the kind of mistake made then could not be repeated.  I would ask the Minister, in attempting to make up my mind whether to press this amendment, to state clearly that the depositors <Col N="453" /> will be protected to the extent of the 80 per cent of funds invested with the Exchequer and that as regards the remaining 20 per cent the Minister is free to have discussions with the Central Bank, following which he could and would guarantee the remainder.  That is presumably what happened in 1984.  Is the Minister saying that nothing in subsection (8) changes the position?  It is necessary for the Minister to say clearly that nothing in subsection (8) changes his ability and freedom to act as in 1984.</P>

      <P>Because 80 per cent of the deposits are left with the Minister, the suggestion is made that the 80 per cent is safe.  That does not make sense. Theoretically the Trustee Savings Banks could make a very bad investment by lending a substantial sum to somebody. They could invest 30 or 40 per cent of their assets and lose that amount.  The 80 per cent would not then be safe because it would be called in to cover the loss that had been made.  We should not proceed with the debate on the basis that the 80 per cent is fully protected.</P>

      <P>Under present conditions the Trustee Savings Banks are obliged to lodge 80 per cent of their money to the Exchequer.  The funds are virtually guaranteed because they are in the Exchequer, but the Trustee Savings Banks can prudently invest the other 20 per cent at their discretion.  These people are in the banking business to make money and return the investment to their depositors.  Like other banks, they have reserves and a bad debt provision.  They engage in normal commercial activities like other banks, except that they are restricted as to the amount of money they can use in that area.  In 1984 when there was a certain withdrawal of funds from the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank the Minister for Finance was able to say that the bank was solvent if the depositors wanted their money, taking into account the money in the Exchequer, the bad debts provision, the reserves and the overall management of the Trustee Savings Banks.  That position prevails <Col N="454" /> today and will prevail in the future.  We must not place more restrictions on the Trustee Savings Banks and put them at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other financial institutions.</P>

Has the Minister any information on the profile of the size of deposits in the Trustee Savings Bank? The general impression is that these banks are for small savers and that the amount on deposit by any individual would not be huge.  I ask the question because is there no limit on the deposit protection scheme in the Central Bank Act?  If I recall correctly, it is protected up to £10,000 with some variation after that?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 4, after &ldquo;determine.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Central Bank shall take account of, the rates of interest charged and paid by other licensed banks and building societies in fixing these rates.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 15 makes provision for the setting of interest rates for Trustee Savings Banks.  It provides for the setting of rates of interest to be charged by a Trustee Savings Bank on loans provided by them and the level of interest to be paid for money on deposit.  It allows the Central Bank to decide these matters at its own discretion.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of the Bill is to put all banks on the same basis.  I understand there is a mechanism for the setting of interest rates in the commercial banks, as a particular matrix of interest rate, which apply to the banks, and I would like a similar provision to apply in relation to the Trustee Savings Banks.  I cannot understand why a separate provision should be made for the Trustee Savings Banks.  This amendment provides that the Central Bank in setting the interest to be charged and paid by the Trustee Savings Bank should be obliged to take into account the rates of interest charged and paid by the other licensed banks and building societies carrying out the same business.</P>

      <P>Section 15 deals with the rate of interest charged and paid by the Trustee Savings Banks, gives them power to borrow and specifies that Central Bank approval is necessary for any activities other than the taking of <Col N="462" /> deposits.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan provides for Central Bank control over the rates of interest on loans and deposits.  Deputy Noonan proposes that there should be a link between the Trustee Savings Banks' rates and the rates charged by the associated banks and building societies.  Obviously there will be a link and there is no need whatever to provide for this in legislation. The Central Bank will, of course, take account of developments elsewhere on setting the Trustee Savings Banks' rates. They will have to take the whole financial scenario into account when they are making decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 24 is to give a person borrowing money from a Trustee Savings Bank the same protection a person borrowing money from a moneylender has under the terms of the Moneylenders Act, 1933. Some important protections are given to people who borrow money under sections 11, 17 and 20 of the Moneylenders Act and I do not understand why people borrowing money from a Trustee Savings Bank or any of the commercial and mercantile banks should not have the same protections given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to section 11 which requires that any contract of loan must be in writing, otherwise it will be void.  It also provides that the APR, the annualised rate of interest, per cent per annum, must be specified in that written contract otherwise it will be void.  I know that many of the merchant banks who carry on their lending business in the State avail of the provision whereby they <Col N="463" /> are not obliged to comply with the Moneylenders Act and they do not state on their loan notes the true annual rate of interest.  They put down the monthly rate &mdash; I have seen this many times &mdash; of 2.2 per cent per month and many of the unfortunate people who take out loans with them do not realise that that amounts to about 36 per cent or 37 per cent per annum.  Section 11 of the Moneylenders Act says that that is not allowed and they are obliged to state the annual rate of interest per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>I am not hitting in particular at the Trustee Savings Banks on this &mdash; maybe they do this already &mdash; but I want it as a marker that not only should the Trustee Savings Banks but all banks who lend money to people should, as a basic consumer's right, be obliged to specify the amount of the annual rate of interest. That is the purpose of amendment No. 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I enthusiastically support amendment No. 24 in the name of Deputy Taylor.  It is the first worthwhile amendment to be put down to the Bill so far and I cannot imagine why the Minister would not want to take it on board.  I can validate entirely what Deputy Taylor has said.  Members of this House have had people come into their clinics and explain to them the terrible circumstances they are in because they bought a washing machine or some other machine and did not understand, had not explained to them, or had concealed from them, the effective annual interest rate.  I imagine that is the general experience of Deputies with the exception of a small number who represent rather exclusive constituencies. I suspect it is not within the everyday knowledge of people drafting legislation such as this that there are a great many people who have serious numeracy problems and do not appreciate the implications of entering into this type of contract.  I am satisfied that many people concerned with the drafting of this legislation simply do not come into everyday contact with people who end up being victimised by their inability to read such <Col N="464" /> contracts or by the fact that central elements such as this are concealed from them.  It is probably true to say that the Trustee Savings Banks are by no means the worst culprits.  Various subsidiary companies and hire purchase companies owned by the major associated banks are the main culprits.  The precedent being set by Deputy Taylor's amendment is worthy of the support of this House.  I do not see how it is inconsistent in any way with the purpose of the Bill as outlined by the Minister.

      <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte have said.  I want to assure Deputy Rabbitte that I come from a constituency where many people borrow money.  I am sure the vast majority have to borrow money so no one can claim exclusiveness in that regard.  Deputy Taylor proposes that the Trustee Savings Banks be brought under the Money Lenders Act, 1933, and he refered to three sections in particular; section 11 where loans must be secured by written contracts, section 17 where if the rate of interest exceeds 39 per cent per annum, there is recourse to the courts, who can deem it excessive; section 20 allows the court to enforce compliance with the contract. So far as we are concerned such provisions are inappropriate.  Section 136 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, provides that any person carrying on bona fide the business of banking will not come under the Money Lenders Act.  This is an established practice and to single out the Trustee Savings Banks would not be in their interest in competing with others who are excluded from that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks makes Deputy Taylor's amendment unnecessary because a structure of interest rates would have to be agreed with the Central Bank, which lays down the rules within which the Trustee Savings Banks operate. The interest rates to be charged and the interest rates to be paid to depositors are agreed under the Central Bank Act.  The <Col N="465" /><i>bona fides</i>, the composition and the resources on the banks <i>vis-à-vis</i> money lenders are different.  It would be inappropriate to put the Trustee Savings Banks under the provisions of the Money Lenders Act, in particular when their competitors are not covered by that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's reply seriously disappointing.  I am not talking about controlling the rates of interest.  Let them charge what rates they like, be it 150 per cent or 350 per cent. That is not the point I am making.  My point is that they should spell out the rate of interest charged in language that the ordinary person borrowing money from them understands.  That is all I seek.  I do not seek to control the rate of interest but I ask that they should spell it out. Why pull the wool over people's eyes by saying that the rate of interest is 2.2 per cent per month, when in actual fact this means an interest rate of 36 per cent per annum?  I know that institutions who have a banking licence under the Central Bank Act do not have to comply with the Money Lenders Act, but quite frankly that is a disgrace.  It is utterly beyond me how that ever came about because in effect these institutions are moneylenders. They may be seen as banks but in fact they are moneylenders.  There are two distinct categories of banks that get the same licence.  The Allied Irish Bank, Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland etc. are in one category.  However a very different category get the same licence, and are also exempt, yet carry on a radically different type of business.  Those include Allied Irish Finance, Mercantile Credit, Merchant Banking Ltd., UDT Bank and others.  They are very different from the first category.  They do a different type of business yet, because they hold a licence under the Central Bank Act, they are exempt from stating the annualised rate of interest &mdash; that important protection to which any consumer should be entitled is denied to them, because they have a licence on the same basis as the associated banks, such as the Ulster Bank or Bank of Ireland.  I was trying to set down a marker to try to rectify that situation. <Col N="466" /> Let me tell the Minister that people are being hurt and hurt badly.  They are losing their homes because of it.  It is not good enough to say that the Trustee Savings Banks should be free to operate in the same way as their competitors.  I had hoped that this amendment would be accepted as a start in rectifying that situation under which the hire purchase type finance companies rank in the same way as the Ulster Bank or Bank of Ireland although their business is radically different. I was entirely wrong.  This is very disappointing.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say that the Minister did not appreciate the phenomenon we are talking about.  I believe he does and it is for that very reason he should accede to this amendment. One gets the impression that no matter what is within the Minister's experience, regardless of whether he agrees with the points made in this House, the Department of Finance officials are impervious to being made aware of the facts of life as they apply to a great number of people.  The fact that this does not apply in the case of the associated banks is no argument to make as to why it should not apply in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks.  It should be imported into the associated banks, having regard to the hardship and suffering being caused to so many people.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is also aware that the effect of the failure to be provided with this information when one is engaging in a contract to buy whatever, is that people are being driven into the arms of illegal moneylenders in order to pay off unforeseen and unexpected additional charges arising from the fact that the annual rate of interest is being concealed in the manner that has been described.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his approach to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 32 and 33, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) There shall be not less than five and not more than ten ordinary trustees of a trustee savings bank and in addition there shall be two worker trustees.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that in addition to the ordinary trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank, there shall be two worker trustees on each board of the bank.  As I have said, the Trustee Savings Bank, for practical purposes, is a State-owned institution or a semi-State type body.  The trend is and should be that there be worker directors or trustees, as they are in this case, on such boards. There are large numbers of employees in <Col N="470" /> the Trustee Savings Banks who have done a very fine job in those banks and built them up to their present size and the very respected and worthwhile organisations they are.  It is entirely right and proper that they should have representation on the board to espouse the interests of the workers in those various institutions.</P>
    <P>Heaven knows the manner of appointment of the trustees ordinarily leaves a lot to be desired and is undemocratic. The public and the Minister have no say in the appointment of the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks at present.  How are they appointed?  They are a self-perpetuating body.  When a vacancy occurs, the old boy network no doubt comes into play and some friend or acquaintance of one of the remaining close knit group of trustees, some person of no known qualifications, is co-opted to the board. That is how these boards of trustees are perpetuated year after year and decade after decade.  It would be like a breath of fresh air to bring worker representatives on to the board of trustees of those banks. That would be a very good and democratic trend.  These people would be democratically elected by the workers in the bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It would be in keeping with all modern trends in voluntary negotiations and indeed, to an increasing extent, in legislation if this provision was accepted. We have had this arcane argument about trusteeships and whether the banks are in public ownership.  For example, we know legislation has been introduced in various areas to permit worker directors to become members of the boards of various State enterprises.  Notwithstanding the arcane distinction we have been making, I continue to argue that these banks are effectively in public ownership at the moment and therefore the provision I have referred to regarding other enterprises should also apply here. We are not talking about Mickey Mouse institutions; we are talking about assets of approximately £1 billion, vested <Col N="471" /> admittedly in the trustees but at the disposal of the Oireachtas.  I, like Deputy Taylor, am unhappy with what I have managed to learn about the position regarding trustees at present.  It seems to be surrounded in a fair amount of mystery and secrecy and is most definitely undemocratic.</P>
      <P>The workforce in the Trustee Savings Banks have increased very significantly in recent years.  I can see no good argument why they ought not be facilitated through this mechanism by electing directors or trustees as in this case.  We do not want to see the kind of situation that has been permitted in the building societies where one effectively has oligarchies where families seem to have retained control.  I cannot accept that that is in the interests of the consumer or in the interests of society.  The row that can be caused by attempting to have a woman elected to the board of the building societies is a very good example of what ought not be allowed happen here.  I hope one can anticipate a positive response from the Minister to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 deals with the number of trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank, the provisions in respect of commencement of the section, the amalgamation of Trustee Savings Banks and where the number of trustees falls below the minimum level.  Under existing legislation there would appear to be no legal limits on the maximum number of trustees in a Trustee Savings Bank, although a minimum of four is required for the authentification of the savings bank rules under the Savings Bank Act, 1904.  The main requirement is that for the future the number will be between five and ten and the consent of the Central Bank should be required for their appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendments, both Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte want to provide for the election of worker trustees.  This is a variation of the worker directors in various State and semi-State bodies at present.  Deputy Taylor also proposes that those trustee directors who are not <Col N="472" /> elected should be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Central Bank.  The trustees are in effect a selfappointing body as existing members coopt new members but it is not an ideal arrangement.  It may have been in the past when trustees were well known local people who served in a voluntary capacity in the interests of the community but this is now changing, especially as they can be paid for their work.</P>
    <P>In defence of the existing system it must be said that the record of trustees over many years is very good indeed. The Central Bank will be exercising a supervisory function over the trustees and Central Bank consent will be required in the appointment of new trustees.  On the question of worker appointees, which the Deputies seem to hope for, this is really a matter for the trustees to consider in consultation with the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance should not be involved as the Trustee Savings Banks are not State bodies.  Consequently I regret I will not be able to accommodate the Deputies with this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have listened with interest to the Minister's reply.  It seems that if the management and staff of the Trustee Savings Banks were to negotiate a position whereby trustees would be co-opted to the boards of Trustee Savings Banks, that can be done.  I have no information to suggest that the management or staff of the Trustee Savings Banks see this as a priority in their industrial relations.  I would be inclined to think it is very low down on their list of priorities.  If they want to do that, the proper way is to negotiate with the management and the trustees and there is provision for that.  I do not think this House should force on institutions which are not State institutions a formula which was derived from the arrangements which were made in certain State bodies and semi-State companies for worker directors.  I would be far more interested if the Minister, when he is incorporating the Trustee Savings Banks under section 58, would make provision <Col N="473" /> for an appropriate allocation of shares to all who work in that bank.  It seems that workers are far more motivated by having a stake in the company in the form of a share than they are by helping whatever trade union or association is involved to form a power base for the leaders of the trade union movement. While the trade union as an institution is very interested in the idea of worker directors and worker trustees, those who actually work in institutions would be far happier if they were beneficial shareholders in the institution.  I know the Minister has not time to reply now but we might take this matter up on another occasion.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> I already sent a message last Sunday to Chancellor Kohl offering my support and good wishes at this time of change which brings new hope for all of us in Europe. I should also recall the statement which we, together with our EC partners, issued on Friday last calling for far-reaching reforms to allow the people of the German Democratic Republic to define their own future and to enjoy their democratic rights in full freedom.  As the House will probably be aware, I shall be taking part in the informal dinner meeting of EC leaders which has been convened by President Mitterrand on Saturday next in Paris to consider these and other developments.</P>
    <P>Changes in the German Democratic Republic and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe and the position of the Community are likely to be to the forefront of the agenda at the European Council in Strasbourg and during our EC Presidency beginning next January.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the tact, wisdom and vision of President Gorbachev that lies behind the developments in Eastern Europe ought to be reciprocated in full by Western leaders, and that it is unhelpful for them to talk of cold war victories and so on?

Has the Taoiseach sent any message to President Gorbachev in support of his initiatives which are so exciting for the world?</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy about the basic contribution President Gorbachev has made in all these developments.  We could all agree that if it had not been for President Gorbachev and for the concepts which he has advocated and put into practice, very few <Col N="478" /> of these developments would have taken place.  The feeling, I think, is shared by the leaders of Western Europe and I doubt very much if any would be speaking in terms of triumphalism or victory in the cold war.  There would be a general welcome for all that has taken place in Eastern Europe and for the progress there towards democratic freedom.  To that extent it will not be necessary for me to drive that message home to my fellow Heads of State in Paris on Saturday, or later in Strasbourg.  I assure the Deputy that I share the sentiments being expressed.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware of the angry comments made by President Gorbachev in Moscow along those lines this morning, and about the gloating, especially from Washington, about cold war victory?  In view of that and of the delicacy of the situation, will the Taoiseach at least express that sentiment to ensure that it is indeed shared by all our western colleagues?</P>

I compliment the Taoiseach on his role in that.  Because of the momentous events that are taking place in Eastern Europe, perhaps the Taoiseach will assure the House that in his role as President of the European Community from January next, the approach will be a totally positive one in relation to the opening up of Eastern Europe and in relation to the major advances taking place in terms of the democratisation of Eastern Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="482" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 28, 55, 46 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Mr. Christy Walsh was neither removed from office in the Southern Health Board nor dismissed as Opposition Deputies persistently keep trying to claim.  As I explained in this House in response to questions put down on 11 May last by a number of Deputies, see reply in columns 2155 to 2169 of the Dáil Official Report of that date, changes made in the management structures in the Southern Health Board on Friday, 18 April 1989 were made by the chief executive officer in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act.</P>
      <P>This is what in fact transpired.  A letter issued by the Southern Health Board management on 24 April 1989 indicated that it was most likely that salary payments would be postponed for periods commencing with the first batch of payments due at the end of April 1989. Serious concern was expressed in Government at the implications of the issue of that letter for the Government's policy on the public finances and indeed on the stability of the system generally.  I asked the secretary of my Department and two assistant secretaries with responsibility for financial and personnel matters to meet with the chief executive officer of the health board and to advise him of the Government's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer who had returned to Ireland from annual leave early on the morning of 28 April met with those officers of my Department in Cork Airport on that day.  The chief executive officer who was ill, and in fact, had been so for some time, indicated on being contacted that he would not be resuming duty as he had planned as his illness had continued.  He also indicated that he would be appointing a deputy and after consultation with the chairman of the board as he is required to do under the Health Act, 1970, he appointed Mr. Seán Hurley, programme manager, as deputy chief executive officer from 28 April 1989.  I should also make the point that Mr. Christy Walsh, programme manager's period as deputy chief executive officer ended with the return of the chief <Col N="483" /> executive officer to Ireland.  I should say also that Mr. Walsh retired from his position as programme manager in the health board service on 8 August 1989, as the Deputy is well aware.</P>

      <P>In Question No. 5 in my name I asked what discussions took place between the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach that led to the visit by the secretary of his Department to Cork Airport to notify Mr. Walsh that he was being relieved of his duties.  He has failed to answer that question.  Can we take it now that the allegations made by Mr. Walsh are in fact correct, as the Minister has not denied them; and will the Minister confirm, in relation to the dismissal of Mr. Walsh as programme manager for the general hospitals in the Southern Health Board, that all aspects of the 1970 Health Act were conformed with?</P>

In other health board areas the <Col N="484" /> deputy CEO's position is rotated amongst the senior members of the various health boards.  Indeed there is no independent or structured post of deputy CEO.  There is a special provision in the midlands and the mid-west because the CEO is in charge of both boards.  Otherwise the Deputy CEO is only appointed when the CEO is unable to perform his duties as was the case in the Southern Health Board.  As to the question raised by the Deputy I would say that there are 15 members of Government and it is usual to have discussions on various topics.  In this case not alone members of the Government but members of the Opposition expressed concern, and one member at the time suggested that I should go to Cork myself to sort out the very serious problems that had arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of 1,571 doctors <Col N="486" /> participating in the General Medical Services Scheme, 1,499 are remunerated on a capitation basis.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter of the High Court action, I presume the Deputy is referring here to the legal action taken by a particular doctor concerning the continuance of her GMS contract.  As a result of the High Court judgment the particular doctor has the right to continue to provide services to eligible persons in accordance with the terms of the 1972 GMS contract.  On the same basis, a further 71 doctors continue to provide services in accordance with the terms of the 1972 contract.</P>
      <P>In relation to the new terms and conditions for medical practitioners participating in the scheme, I am satisfied that Mr. Horgan's recommendation represented a sound basis for the development of general practice, for achieving a more efficient and effective delivery of practitioner services and to enable the cost of the scheme to be brought under control, allied to a more cost-effective use of the resources committed to the GMS.  The Deputy will understand that the new arrangements have only been in operation for a few months.  Furthermore, all elements of the new arrangements are not yet fully operational. It is, therefore, too early to make conclusive judgments in relation to expenditure trends under the scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards alleged claims by some doctors that they signed the new contract under duress, I have no evidence which would substantiate such claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a £25 million over-run on the GMS budget; that the expected savings by the revised contract have not materialised; that there is now, in effect, a two-tier operation of the scheme arising out of this court case whereby some doctors are on a fee per item basis and others are on a capitation basis, and that the whole purpose of this scheme was to get everybody on capitation and this has failed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept <Col N="487" /> what the Deputy is saying.  Features of the GMS in 1989 gave rise to the expenditure which will be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate this evening.  First, the scheme did not come on stream until April; it did not come on stream at the beginning of the year.  There was a once off payment to doctors who formerly were paid three months in arrears. Because of the nature of the fee for service payments and processing of them, they are now paid at the end of each month.  That added £8 million to the cost of the scheme.  There was a significant increase in expenditure on drugs and medicines, some of it because of an increase in the price of drugs and the scheme was in operation for three months of the year.  As the Deputy is aware, it was a demand led scheme and there was an increase in the number of drugs prescribed in the earlier part of the year.  I am satisfied that when the scheme settles down we will see the benefit in terms of a reduction in the number of prescribed drugs.</P>

They have a budgetary problem.  They are in discussion with my Department and the EHB, and the issue will be resolved.  No patients will be discharged as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The latest information available to my Department on the number of persons awaiting admission as in-patients is as follows: (a) cataracts 3,374; (b) hip replacements 1,993; (c) heart surgery 675 and (d) child deafness 1,810.  The total number of patients awaiting all types of orthopaedic operations is around 7,300. Information on the average waiting period is not collected since the length of time any individual patient waits for treatment differs according to medical priority.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have, in response to demands to reduce unacceptably long waiting times, provided an additional £15 million earlier this year.  A substantial amount of this was directed specifically to help reduce waiting lists with priority given to ear, nose and throat, cataracts and hip replacement operations.  Substantial funds were also allocated to provide for restoration of beds closed, to open additional beds and to avoid planned bed closures.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this injection of funds has been effective in helping to reduce waiting lists in the areas targeted and in protecting services in general.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy is saying.  For example, in Temple Street Children's Hospital provision was made for special review clinics and outpatient departments for ear, nose and throat cases.  The number of appointments sent out to date &mdash; provided out of the special funding &mdash; was 171.  The number of patients who phoned to say they would not be coming was three, the number who did not attend was 58, the number who attended 110, and of that 110, 19 were taken off the list as they did not need treatment.  The inpatient list in Temple Street has been reduced by 200 since August as a result of the intervention of August 1989.  That is the general pattern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that the standard of health care throughout the country varies very much within each of the eight health boards?  Because of varying subventions facilities such as speech therapy, community care services, hospital services, the ambulance service and so on, vary considerably depending on what part of the country one resides.  It is very unfair and on the basis of service to patients, that alone is a reason for changing the structures.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister that in rejecting that earlier budget the health boards were proved right, because he had to provide an extra £1,090,000.</P>
      <P>The health committees are part of the structure of the health boards as set up under the Health Act, 1970, and under that Act were given advisory powers. Health boards are required by statute to accept the advice of the health committees. Health committees have been in limbo since 1970 when the Minister wrote to health boards saying that responsibility would be taken over by the health boards. Would the Minister now state what the position is likely to be in the future in regard to the health committees which were set up under the Health Act, 1970?</P>

While acknowledging that there are gaps in the service, does the Minister accept that those gaps amount to a crisis in some areas?  Is he aware of the statement concerning the largest hospital in the country where yesterday a decision was made not to admit any non-emergency cases for 48 hours, that the consultant in that hospital remarked that there are simply not enough beds in Dublin to cater for non-emergency cases, that some of the patients being discharged are suffering from bowel diseases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the financial provision still does not cater for critical areas?  His Department or the health boards are responsible indirectly for the provision of speech therapy to special schools.  Yet in those special schools where the children so badly need the assistance of speech therapists they are denied them and the number of hours available are limited because of the absence of finance from the health boards through his Department. These gaps are repeated in dental care and care for the aged in nursing homes.  The provision being made for the remainder of this year has proved to be inadequate.</P>

      <P>While I do not have specific figures for speech therapists, one of the difficulties is in recruiting these people.  In relation to the subventions to the Eastern Health Board it might interest the House to know that rather than a reduction in the amount being spent on subventing elderly people in nursing homes the board are subventing 16,000 more bed days in 1989 than in 1988.  The Eastern Health Board have increased their expenditure on subventions by over £250,000 in 1989 over 1988.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Supplementary Estimate, would the Minister acknowledge that most of the extra £31 million is not to provide improved health care services or to fill the gaps, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred?  Would he <Col N="499" /> agree that it is to cover over-runs of overestimated expenditure, that none of the money will provide dental services, child care services, the needs of AIDS patients and so on; but that it is to cover the wrong calculation of the cost of running the health service in 1989 and that therefore it is false to represent it as the cash boost to the health services?</P>

I raised a point concerning subventions from health boards for the care of the aged.  To speak about £250,000 being an improvement on the previous year is to conceal the fact that so many long-stay hospitals have been closed and patients have been discharged who are now depending on these nursing homes where their care is subvented by the health boards.</P>

I took responsibility for asking the Eastern Health Board to take over Baggot Street Hospital where not alone have they provided 35 beds for the elderly but also 35 beds for respite care, so that the carers might be looked after.

      <P>The provision of dentures is part of the general dental service provided by the health boards for eligible persons.  Therefore, the question of allocating funds for dentures, or to any <Col N="502" /> other area of the dental services, is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.  However, I am concerned at the level of the dental service for adults generally and am pursuing the provision of additional funding at present.</P>
      <P>On the question of introducing denturists, this is a matter for the Dental Council initially.  The council recently set up a special sub-group to undertake a full objective examination of denturism and it is expected that the sub-group will complete their investigation later this month. The Dental Council expect to be in a position to make recommendation in the matter early in the New Year and I intend to pursue them to ensure that the work is completed quickly.  I propose to consider the views of the Dental Council before making a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the statement in the working party report on services for the elderly issued this time last year that 72 per cent of the elderly have no natural teeth and that a survey in west Galway indicated that 40 per cent of the elderly there had no teeth and no dentures?  They made the comment that the absence of teeth is a contributory factor to malnutrition in the elderly.  Is the Minister aware that according to the report the cost of fitting dentures is about £500 but that dental technicians could do the job for £140? The recommendation was that in the interest of providing dentures to elderly people on low incomes the Dental Council should introduce a scheme to permit dental technicians to fit dentures.  Would the Minister agree that he and the dentists are responsible for malnutrition amongst the elderly since they are prevented from getting dentures?</P>

      <P>The guidelines issued by my Department to the health boards in relation to the provision of specialist orthodontic treatment are based on the principle that the more severe cases must get priority.  The priorities are clearly defined in the guidelines and every category of need is recognised and catered for according to its degree of priority. Therefore, it is not true to say that only those with very severe defects are catered for.</P>

A sum of £300,000 is provided in the Supplementary Estimate and in the context of the Estimate for 1990 the Minister is doing his utmost to ensure that extra funding will be made available.

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks but orthodontists in the public service feel that priority must be given to people who have impediments as a result of the need for proper orthodontic treatment.  Cosmetic orthodontics is a secondary consideration.  Taking into account the guidelines laid down, the resources available and the professional judgment of the orthodontists, we are doing the best we can.  I am confident that with the 500 extra cases which will be treated and the commitment we have to improving the situation in the new year, we can reduce the waiting list and provide a better service.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the sum of £300,000 is inadequate because it is a commitment by the Minister, the Government, the Department and myself to improve the situation.  The 500 cases have already been decided on by the orthodontists within the health board areas and by the chief dental surgeons and their teams.  The 50 most severe cases have been selected by them and sent forward to the Department.  The resources will be made available and I hope that the 500 cases will be treated between now and Christmas.</P>

The urgency attached to any patient's condition is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned.

With regard to the question of the operating theatre, I have not had any indication that they will be closing.  All I know is that they received an extra £425,000 out of the £15 million, that they intend to continue working and hope to carry out <Col N="511" /> another 100 hip operations as a result of that increased allocation between now and the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has satisfied himself regarding the disciplinary procedures for staff working in psychiatric hospitals; and if he will review this procedure with particular reference to ensuring that salaries will be paid to staff who are subsequently reinstated or that staff would not be suspended until a full adjudication had taken place on their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suspension of officers of health boards is provided for in Section 22 of the Health Act, 1970.  Suspension arises only where the chief executive officer has reason to believe there has been misconduct or that the officer is unfit to hold office.  It is a step taken only where there are serious grounds and only following consultation with the chairman or vice-chairman of the health board.  In cases of suspension, the matters requiring investigation are of a serious nature and it would be inappropriate to delay the suspension of an officer pending full adjudication on them.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that, on termination of a suspension, the salary may be restored by the chief executive officer or, in the case of suspension of more than one month's duration, by the Minister. Provision is also made for <i>ex gratia</i> payments during the period of suspension.</P>
      <P>The disciplinary function must strike a reasonable balance between the welfare of patients in the care of health boards and the legitimate interests of staff members and employers.  I know that health board managements take their responsibilities in this regard very seriously.  I have no proposals to amend the legislation which is similar to that applying in other branches of the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the financial restrictions of recent years it has been my general policy, as far as possible, to protect community care services.  I am continuing with the policy of changing the emphasis away from institutional care to health promotion and primary care.</P>
      <P>The new general medical services contract, which provides for the payment of general practitioners on a capitation basis, came into operation on 1 March 1989.  This new arrangement constitutes a sound base, not only for the future of the GMS on a cost effective basis, but also for the development of general practice as a whole, enabling it to fulfil its full potential as the primary core of an integrated and comprehensive health service.</P>
      <P>As far as psychiatric services are concerned, progress continues to be made in developing a community-based psychiatric service as outlined in the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i>  There has been a considerable expansion of community-based facilities such as day hospitals, day centres, hostels and community residences. For example, at the end of 1988 there were 32 day hospitals and 47 day centres catering for some 7,500 persons as well as 272 hostels and community residences providing accommodation for 1,800 persons who suffer from psychiatric illness.</P>
      <P>In October 1988 the report of the working party on services for the elderly was published.  The report, which has wide ranging recommendations in relation to services for the elderly, has been accepted in principle by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> The Department, in conjunction with the other Departments involved and the health boards, are looking at ways of implementing the recommendations of the report in so far as resources will permit.</P>
    <P>The level of services for the handicapped is gradually being improved through the joint efforts of the health boards and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The recently published report of the Commission on Health Funding contains wide-ranging recommendations, many of which relate to the area of community care.  I am examining these proposals at present and I am consulting with all health care organisations and bodies concerned on the issues raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he is very committed to the development of the community care services.  Would the Minister agree that there is an urgent requirement to increase the number of public health nurses in view of the practice in general hospitals of discharging people early?  In my area, the Southern Health Board area, the number of public health nurses is way below the national average and is not adequate to deal with the numbers being discharged from hospital.</P>
      <P>Secondly, would the Minister agree that home helps are being paid a pittance and as a consequence are losing interest in the work?  It has come to my notice that patients who are required to return to out-patients for treatment very often do not have transport, or the money to meet the cost of transport to the hospital and are therefore not returning for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of services in the community is being improved, as I pointed out in my reply to the Deputy. For example the hostel provision for the mentally handicapped has been increased from accommodating 773 in 127 hostels to 1,056 residents in 178 hostels in 1988 &mdash; an increase of 51 hostels in that period. Similarily, there was an increase in the number of day centres and workshops and the additional 71 new centres cater for 2,350 mentally handicapped adults.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's point about patients travelling to and from out-patients. I have been in contact with the agencies asking them to look at the organisation of services to ensure that there is the minimum inconvience for patients. Certainly patients in rural Ireland, and in some areas of the city, have always had a problem finding their way to out-patients. I am sure the Deputy would accept that it would never be possible for a health board to provide a transport service for everybody who would want to go to hospital, because it would be using a resource that then would not be available for other priority needs.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a vital aspect of the community care service is the work of public health nurses?

      <P>The Bill is being recommitted in respect of certain amendments on which we can now have a full Committee Stage discussion.  Amendments Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7 will be discussed together, with the agreement of the House.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. a1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 7 and 8 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has been a change in the Long Title.  The Long Title is being changed to agree with the short title to accommodate the amendment to the definition of hatred, which will make it an offence to incite to hatred on account of sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>The effect of the official amendments is twofold.  The first is that the offences under sections 2 and 3, which relate respectively to actions and broadcasts likely to stir up hatred against groups of persons in the State on account of their race, etc. will apply to stirring up hatred against groups of persons whether in the State or elsewhere.  The offence under section 4 of preparation or possession of material likely to stir up hatred already applies to hatred against groups of persons in the State or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is that it will be an offence to incite to hatred against groups of persons on account of their sexual orientation. I would first like to discuss the first part of the amendment.  When the Bill was introduced, the Government considered that the offences under sections 2 and 3 should apply only as regards hatred against groups in the State.  The United Nations Convenant on Civil and Political Rights only requires countries to prevent abuses of the kinds in question from occurring in their own territories, and it did not seem to the Government that there was any practical problem in this country sufficient to require the widening of sections 2 and 3 so as to cover doing things in the State likely to stir up hatred against groups outside the State. However, during the Committee Stage debate Deputies put forward amendments to delete the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;<Col N="582" /> from the definition of hatred in sections 2 and 3.  My predecessor, as Minister for Justice, recognised that there was force to their arguments and undertook to examine the question further before Report Stage.  After much consideration I have decided to accept the arguments for applying sections 2 and 3 to hatred against groups outside the State and hence these amendments.</P>
    <P>As to why I have come to these conclusions I would like to say first that the arguments for and against are finely balanced. However, I accept that there might be a slight illogicality in making it an offence under section 4 to prepare material in order to incite to hatred against groups outside the State and not making it an offence under section 3 to incite hatred against such groups.  It would be possible for offensive broadcasts under section 3 to be heard in Northern Ireland and in many areas of Britain just as offensive material or recordings prepared here for distribution abroad could be seen or heard in the UK or further afield.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister explained during Committee Stage that if hatred was stirred up against any of the groups mentioned in the definition of hatred outside the State, an offence could be committed if the particular group was represented within the State and members of the group were affected by incitement.  In practice, incitement on, say, grounds of nationality or religion against groups in Northern Ireland or Great Britain would usually be felt by their co-religionists or fellow nationals in this jurisdiction.  However, if an unscrupulous person was to incite hatred in a very specific manner against groups resident outside the State, it would be possible that the circumstances might not be comprehended by the Bill as it stands. Accordingly, for that reason also, I consider it worthwhile extending the scope of the Bill as proposed in these amendments.</P>
    <P>If what I now propose is acceptable to the House, the result is that the same definition of hatrd, that is to say, hatred against groups in the State or elsewhere, <Col N="583" /> should apply to all three sections &mdash; 2, 3 and 4.  Therefore, amendment No. 1 proposes to insert a new definition in section 1, the general interpretation section, and amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 7 delete the existing definitions in sections 2, 3 and 4.  It may be puzzling at first sight that amendment No. 6 consists of the definitions of script.  The explanation is that section 3(9) at present contains the definitions of hatred and script and amendment No. 6 simply reproduces the definition of script alone.  That definition is unchanged.</P>
    <P>I come now to the second element in the amendment.  This will make it an offence to incite hatred against groups of persons on account of their sexual orientation. In deciding to propose this amendment I have to say I have been impressed with the arguments put forward in both Houses by those Deputies and Senators who claim that homosexual persons need the protection afforded by the Bill.  I am prepared to accept the view that it is of little or no benefit to these people merely to say that I sympathise with them when they are verbally attacked if I am not prepared to do something about it when the opportunity arises.  The opportunity now arises and I am happy to give homosexuals the protection of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Well done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also been very conscious, when arriving at this decision, that verbal attacks will often lead to physical attacks as there is always a danger that if something is repeated often enough, no matter how untrue or outlandish it might be, it will eventually be believed by some people.  There would be, in the absence of this amendment, an opportunity for bigoted and unscrupulous persons to latch on to the prevalence of AIDS for example to incite hatred against homosexuals in a totally unfair manner.  In fact I believe there are examples of this already happening and I am glad to be able to do something that should put a stop to it.  I commend amendment No.1, <Col N="584" /> with its two important new features, to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to his predecessor in the Department of Justice. The record of the House speaks for itself as regards what was said in the Seanad and also when this legislation was discussed on Committee Stage.  I am delighted there has been a change of heart on the part of the Government. During the previous lengthy Committee Stage debate, time again the Minister said he was unprepared to accept the amendment he is now bringing forward. It is fairly clear that when this legislation was passed in the Seanad, it was toothless and did not even conform to the United Nations Conventions it was meant to allow us to ratify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially the Minister for Justice said that the main purpose of bringing forward the legislation was to allow this country to ratify a UN Convention on political and civil declarations.  We subsequently found that the Bill, as initiated, was not sufficiently strong to allow us sign and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which was signed by this country more than 20 years ago.  I am delighted the Minister has seen fit, in this Report Stage amendment, to include both the travelling community, a move which was prompted by Fine Gael on Committee Stage, and the gay community.  It is only now that the Minister can say we are dealing with legislation that will have some practical relevance.  It was not sufficient for us to discuss legislation that would only allow us to ratify what was little more than an empty formula.  Now we see this legislation providing for our <Col N="585" /> own people.  We are not a multi-racial society, but we have our minority groups and I am glad the Minister has now recognised that.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcome amendments Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7 as outlined by the Minister.  We believe we can make the legislation even more far reaching by passing a later amendment in the name of my colleague, Deputy Monica Barnes. If this legislation is to be relevant to Irish society, the amendments outlined by the Minister must be accepted.  There are a few questions the Minister might address. In amendment No. 1, hatred means hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere.  Surely there is an element of superfluity there in so far as in &ldquo;the State or elsewhere&rdquo; covers the universe.  If the definition of hatred was hatred against a group of persons because of their race or colour, surely it would have the effect of what the Minister is trying to provide for in this amendment. That is only a technical point but from a drafting point of view, the distinction between the State and elsewhere should be omitted.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party will be accepting amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 7.  We appreciate the difficulty the Minister has had in defining &ldquo;script&rdquo;.  We would be prepared to accept that the amendment he has now come up with is more realistic than the earlier one.  Amendment No. 4 defines a private residence.  I take it that what the Minister is seeking to do is to cover everyone entering a premises, with the exception of a trespasser, that is, all occupiers, invitees and licencees are covered with the exception perhaps of somebody who is there without the consent of the owner of the dwelling house. I hope at a later stage to have the opportunity to comment on the amendments tabled by my colleagues.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that in the last few hours the Minister has seen the light in so far as these amendments are concerned and I heartily commend him for agreeing to introduce something which Opposition Deputies and Senators have been calling for since this legislation was <Col N="586" /> introduced in the Upper House.  It is better late than never and I thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>Without any begrudgery whatever, I wish to compliment the Minister and express our appreciation to him <Col N="588" /> for bringing forward these amendments and accepting the comments made by a number of Deputies on earlier Stages of this Bill.  If I may say so, it is refreshing to see that a Minister is prepared on occasion, albeit all too rarely, to listen to the other side of the House to ensure that we end up with a Bill made up of the collective wisdom of the House.  I only wish that other Ministers on other occasions would be as open-minded as this Minister has showed himself to be on this occasion.  I am aware that the Gay community will be very relieved to see this additional provision included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Since this Bill commenced its run in the Seanad some time ago it has been very substantially improved.  The protection for members of the travelling community has already been added to it and now it is proposed to add this protection for the Gay community.  This will make it a much better and stronger measure.  However, the Bill could be further strengthened and improved if the Minister was willing to consider amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 1 tabled by Deputy Kavanagh and me which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the fifth line, after &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include conduct likely to hold up any such person or group to ridicule or contempt&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about the definition is that it relates only to material which could be used to stir up hatred.  That of course is very important and is one of the key elements in the Bill.  I concede that point. However, there is a lot of material which may be the source of grievous and serious offence.  Although it may not warrant the use of the definition, nonetheless it could be used with the objective of holding up to ridicule or contempt a group of people on account of their religion, sexual orientation, race or whatever.  That is a very real possibility.  There is a great deal of material which is and could well be produced and circulated and which would be regarded as very reprehensible and unacceptable.  I would be interested in what the Minister has to say in reply to <Col N="589" /> that amendment in due course.  It is quite reasonable that material which could be used in holding up a group to ridicule or contempt should come within the ambit of this Bill.  Accordingly, Deputy Kavanagh and I wish to propose that amendment.</P>

      <P>Thanks for the correction. I doubly welcome the fact that the matter has to be debated in the Seanad for a reason I will mention later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that every effort be made to have this Bill as a symbolic gesture on the Statute Book and that we announce to the world, coming up to the anniversary of Human Rights Day which is 10 December, that we are in a position to sign and acknowledge the UN Convention on racial and other discriminations. A point was made on Second Stage that it was a source of wonder as to how this small piece of <Col N="590" /> legislation could achieve such a great thing on our behalf, given that that Convention deals with a far greater number of discriminations not addressed at all in this Bill.  We are told that this is a device to get that Convention signed.  I will not say anything against that procedure.</P>
    <P>The issues being addressed in this group of amendments raise a number of issues that we should discuss.  The first relates to the efforts to take out of section 3 the question of restriction to Acts within the State.  The Minister had suggested that this was a small tidying up exercise and from what Deputy Flanagan said, I understand that he also was inclined to that view, but there is a lot more to it than that.  There was a remarkable oversight by the previous Minister and the Government in not realising the significance of this amendment.  It must be uppermost in everybody's minds that the central plank of the Provisional IRA campaign is one of hatred on grounds of religious and cultural origins towards a group in Northern Ireland, which is outside of the State for all practical purposes. They have clearly engaged in a campaign of genocide against members of the Unionist and Protestant community, particularly those living along the Border areas of South Armagh.  To suggest that our amendment of this legislation to directly deal with actions, statements or broadcasts by members of Sinn Féin or of the Provisional IRA in advocating the aims and objections of their military organisation, is merely a tidying up exercise, is a remarkable statement indeed. The implications of the Minister's oversight screamed from the heavens to us when we read the Bill as circulated.  I greatly appreciate that the Minister has corrected that oversight.  In that context it would be very remiss of us to suggest that this was merely a tidying up exercise when the amendment has remarkable significance and far reaching effects in relation to the effectiveness of this law.</P>
    <P>We have to have regard to the fact here that Ireland was rapidly becoming recognised in Europe as the place where one could safely get fascist and neo-fascist <Col N="591" /> documents printed and prepared for circulation abroad.  The neo-fascists in Britain and the continent were sending their materials into Dublin, Cork and other locations to be prepared and printed, because we had not had any of this type of legislation.  Should a printer, compiler, or a messenger be found in possession of these seditious documents and documents of hatred, without the removal or the restriction confining our law under these sections to within the State, he could not have been dealt with effectively and we would have been in a difficult situation in dealing with publications, documents or potential broadcasts located here but directed at persons outside of the State.  I welcome the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the fact that the Minister has taken on board The Workers' Party amendment to his amendment, No. 1, to insert the considerations with regard to sexual orientation.  In this context it is gratifying that the Bill will return to the Seanad very briefly because the Senator there who most highlighted this problem was Senator David Norris who did so in the context of having received documentation issued to him personally attacking him and other members of the gay community.  These documents had come from a provincial location.  The Senator raised the matter with the Minister during the debates in the Seanad and the Minister felt that the documents were capable of being dealt with under existing criminal law.  Senator Norris took the Minister's advice, withdrew his amendments and submitted his documents to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions whose response, before the conclusion of the debates on this Bill, was that the documentation, though undesirable and certainly redolent of hatred against a community, did not constitute facts upon which the Director could find an offence under the existing law.  Consequently this was a cause of major concern.  The Senator had withdrawn amendments on the advice of the Minister.  It is gratifying that we have now put this problem right and that the Bill <Col N="592" /> will be available for comment by Senator Norris in the Upper House.</P>
    <P>In the context of sexual orientation I will briefly refer to a related debate which we will shortly have in the House in relation to the legislation dealing with video nasties.  The Minister of State who handled the matter in the House last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be and it is related to what we are debating here.  In the context of that Bill an explanation was constantly given by the Minister that any issue of worry with regard to sexual orientation in the context of broadcasts in the form of videos or otherwise would be dealt with adequately under this Bill. I am pleased that in the context of the prohibition on incitement to racial hatred and other hatreds the Minister has addressed the problem.  However, in the aspect of broadcasting that videos represent, the Bill will not adequately deal with what we will be dealing with later.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the amendments I welcome and will support the proposal of the Minister to extend the long title of the Bill to include sexual <Col N="593" /> orientation.  I am sad that we did not go a step further with regard to ethnicity as is suggested in amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputies Taylor and Kavanagh. The travelling community, in their representations to us and to the Department, made a good case for the concept of ethnicity.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Title of the Bill, particularly having regard to the amendment.  We are talking to this amendment at the moment, reverting back to the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all up for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might facilitate discussion, because he did not refer to it in his address.  As I understand it, if I may put the shake of the head on the record, the Minister will not be accepting amendment No. 9, and that is unfortunate.  As I was saying, the travelling community make the point that the concept of ethnicity is above and apart from nationality or race.  I do not accept that the inclusion of the references to the travelling community <i>per se</i> in the narrow way that they are referred to in amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister adequately deals with this concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The travelling community make the case, and I make it here on their behalf, that they are not a group aspiring to or claiming nationality on the one hand or the specifics of race on the other; but that they have, as a community, aspects of ethnicity and of ethnical origin that require respect and recognition, and we should have had regard to their peculiar origins and status as an ethnic group and have recognised that concept by including it in the title of the Bill or in the definitions further on in the Bill.  We have not done that and I am sad that we have not. It is a pity.  Nevertheless, in the balance of things, the Minister has conceded a lot.  I do not want to seem to be trading <Col N="594" /> the cause and case of the travelling community, and I merely put on record my regrets in this regard.</P>
    <P>The definition of hatred as now amended by the Minister is welcome and we will be supporting that definition.  In particular the inclusion of the travelling community and those persons with particular sexual orientation is to be welcomed. In respect of the travelling community, none of us can be complacent about their position and status within our society, Christian though we claim to be.  They are very much victims and potential victims on a daily basis of comments, of attacks, both physical and verbal, and of social attitudes amounting to hatred, and this is something that we must be constantly aware of.  To the extent that this Bill will afford them a means of directly addressing those instances of potential incitement to hatred or hatred itself, it is to be welcomed. There must be major reservations that the Bill will, in fact, provide them with any such means of direct confrontation.  It is absolutely clear that to this day our law has never provided any effective means of addressing directly, in a court of law or elsewhere, the constant and unremitting attacks, the uncharitable attitude and hatred towards travellers in our community.  The Minister will be only too aware, from his previous experience as Chairman of Dublin County Council, of the terribly confused, ill-founded, ill-meant remarks that were developing and are still developing around the efforts of that authority to provide basis accommodation for the travelling community. I have no doubt that his promotion of this Bill reflects the initiatives he took in trying to ensure that travellers would be properly accommodated in the community. The sorry state of relationships between us and the travelling community is illustrated by the ongoing rancour in Dublin County Council in regard to their accommodation.  To the extent that this Bill, as now amended, will afford that community the opportunity to redress the <Col N="595" /> wrongs against them it has to be welcomed. We will be supporting that amendment.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that we welcome the amendments that allow for the inclusion of sexual orientation.  The Workers' Party also welcome the efforts of Deputy Barnes in attempting to address an item that was debated here in the context of the Video Recordings Bill, the potential to incite hatred or ridicule against women and children by protraying them in pornography.  It is to be welcomed that even at this late stage in the debate on the Bill this issue has been raised because it has been met by a stone wall on the part of the Minister and his predecessor when dealing with the Video Recordings Bill.  It has to be recognised that the promulgation of pornographic material showing women and children as objects of vile and depraved sexual gratification amount to potential incitement to hatred towards women and children in those circumstances and perhaps the Minister should be constrained to add the definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would practice those constraints himself and leave that until we come to deal with that legislation in the Video Recordings Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am specifically addressing this amendment.  I did make the remark that we are perhaps addressing it here because we had met a stone wall elsewhere.  Nonetheless, they represent a genuine concern and a relative concern within the terms of the legislation we are dealing with and I would urge the Minister to consider taking these amendments on board as adding to what is now emerging as a very useful piece of legislation.  The consequential amendments that have been tabled in regard to the new definition of hatred will clearly be supported as we welcome the broadening of the definition.</P>
      <P>Finally, in addressing all the amendments that are there, I would say that we support that of Deputies Taylor and Kavanagh in regard to the extension to or inclusion in the title, if nothing more, of the concept of ethnicity as something that is above and apart from what is already covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to welcome this legislation and to say how very pleased I am that we had it recommitted and can discuss it at length.  What the Minister has done is certainly to be welcomed. We are indeed very grateful that the debate that took place both in the Seanad and in the Dáil prior to the last election has been taken account of by the Minister.  It is in the best tradition of the Department in the context of the reform of the illegitimacy legislation that this concept has been brought in and I am pleased that the good tradition I enjoyed in the Department of Justice is still abiding. I hope when the Minister goes out, feeling a nice warm glow from the compliments from this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a change before the debate concludes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he will convey these compliments to his colleagues, particularly the Minister of State at the Department of Health for his handling of the <Col N="597" /> Child Care Bill.  We need this kind of co-operation to bring in meaningful legislation and to ensure that what happens in the Dáil is not just an issue of who wins the votes.  That is a bad criterion to apply to legislation.  A great deal of sense, wisdom and experience can come from the Opposition benches as well as from the Government and the Department.  I am very pleased that we are here discussing reform legislation.</P>
      <P>I was in the other House when this Bill was introduced and I recall the frustration and disappointment of many Members there at the apparent reluctance of the Minister's predecessor to accept any amendments or to be open-minded on what was being proposed, which is the subject of the amendments here today. Many people felt it was just window dressing, that we were just going through the motion but the legislation was not meaningful because the subjects of the main amendments here &mdash; sexual orientation and the travelling community &mdash; could not be included.  If I remember correctly, at that time it was suggested there would be drafting difficulties.  For whatever reason, I am very happy the problem has been overcome and that we now have legislation everybody can feel good about.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy that protection is to be given to the travelling community in this Bill.  I share the last speaker's concern about the travelling community, a minority who get little enough joy from what we do in this House.  It seems they are marginalised and passed over in many areas &mdash; work, housing and so on.  These are fundamental needs.  I am glad we are going to include the travelling community in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In almost every case changing the law, giving justice and rights in law precede a change in social and community attitudes. This is well known here and elsewhere. We can instance the change in law with regard to single mothers.  If we change the law and state that this is the law of the land, then changing social attitudes will result.  This is the least we can do for the travelling community and I am very pleased for us and for them.  None <Col N="598" /> of us can be anything but ashamed of the state of our development of halting sites. I will not go into that now, but this is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In the other House I made the same points Deputy McCartan made with regard to the need to include an amendment to make the Bill relevant to the propaganda of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin.  Anybody who reads <i>An Poblacht</i> and its bloodthirsty editorials and articles must feel the need for legislation such as this.  I hope when this Bill is passed action will be taken against this kind of writing.  In my opinion such propaganda journalism or whatever they want to call it, is a grave incitement to hatred.</P>
    <P>I was very happy in the other House to listen to Senator Norris making the case for the inclusion of an amendment to deal with sexual orientation.  The homosexual community, male and female, will be very pleased that this amendment is incorporated in the legislation.  Again I welcome this change which the Minister is bringing in.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to Deputy Barnes' amendments.  She has done a great deal of research in this area.  I welcome these amendments and hope the Minister will continue to co-operate and accept them. They are very important and relate to not a minority but to a majority of women who need this kind of protection which I trust will be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because most of what I wanted to say has been said already.  Like previous speakers I compliment the Minister on the very substantial change he has made in accepting the amendment dealing with homosexual groups and ethnic orientation which extends this Bill considerably and makes it far more acceptable than the limited area to which it related previously.  On occasions Ministers can improve Bills by taking on board suggestions from the Opposition.  On this occasion it behoves none of us to grab the limelight for that. The Minister could have come in here and simply said no to everything and that would have been that, but he has opened <Col N="599" /> his heart and I compliment and congratulate him on that.</P>
      <P>There is always a &ldquo;but&rdquo; at the end of such sentences, and I would have liked him to have gone a little further and accepted the concept of &ldquo;ethnicity&rdquo; as it has been called.  It is a difficult word to pronounce.  That, in our view, would have added a dimension to the Bill which it lacks at the moment.  Nevertheless, so far so good.  He has time to change his mind.  The arguments from this side have been persuasive so that for the moment we will not write them off as a dead loss.  We hope the Minister will see the argument in favour of this.</P>
      <P>In referring to the amendments put down in the names of Deputy Taylor and myself, let me take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Taylor because he has carried on the work on behalf of my party &mdash; I have come to join him only in the last week or so.  Any arguments he has made have extended the terms of this Bill and I take the opportunity to thank him for the work he has done.  In that regard I thank other speakers also.</P>
      <P>Even in the smallest town or village in this country, particularly since the problems of Vietnam, we have various ethnic groups setting up in business.  In places like golf clubs and other meeting places we hear about various individuals who moved in, and others who are moving from one county to another and one town to another being referred to traditionally as &ldquo;blow ins&rdquo;.  Now we have &ldquo;blow ins&rdquo; from as far away as Vietnam, the South China Seas and Pakistan.  The Bill would have been improved had the Minister taken that fact on board.  I do not think he needs to do it for Tipperary men coming to Wicklow or Cork men coming to Dublin, but the Minister might have taken this opportunity to consider colour or creeds which are different from what we have known traditionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Barnes for endeavouring to do what I tried to do last week, and perhaps doing it very much better, that is, introducing a definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; and &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; into this legislation.  Last week when speaking on <Col N="600" /> the Video Recordings Bill I said nobody else and no other party in the House had endeavoured to put in a more satisfactory definition.  I am glad Deputy Barnes has taken the opportunity to introduce it into this legislation.  Of course, our party will support that amendment.  Wherever we can include a condemnation of pornography and get it written into our legislation we feel we should take that opportunity.  Maybe when we reach the other legislation today the Minister will have had a change of heart in that area too.  I am sorry to see him shake his head east to west.  I would prefer north to south.  We will be supporting the amendment in the name of Deputy Barnes and, obviously, the amendments in our own names.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the rewarding periods in the life of a Minister and Deputies on all sides of the House when we can welcome the amendments which the Minister has accepted and which he will include in this Bill.  As legislators we know our responsibility is to bring in the very best and most responsible and comprehensive legislation we can to cover all the various complexities.  As others have done, I pay tribute to the draftspeople in the Department who have to endeavour to draft the legislation, because it is a complex task and it may be dangerous in other ways.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to a recommittal.  This is what good legislation is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister as I have not spoken to him across the floor of the House since he became Minister for Justice.  I would like to think this is the beginning of many reforms he will have the opportunity and privilege of bringing to this House.  Like other speakers, I will not take up too much time because, having got the amendments and in pushing for the remaining few, we would like to allow time for this to be completed and brought in.  It is important to be proud of the legislation, the freedoms and the protections we give to our people and particularly to minority <Col N="601" /> groups.  To our great shame and embarrassment this has been one of the outstanding items of legislation that did not allow us to ratify the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and its covenants. If the Children Bill comes through in this session those two items of legislation should enable us to ratify.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy McCartan and the other Members who are speaking on this Bill in hoping we can celebrate United Nations Day on 10 December by being able to ratify and fully acknowledge the UN covenants.  It is important both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill and the title have been widened to include &ldquo;race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation&rdquo;. Before I speak on my own amendment I support the Members of this House on the amendment dealing with ethnic groups.  Deputy Kavanagh, in a very graphic and practical way, reminded us that there may be a need to highlight the fact that as a country we have been isolated and insulated from any incursion, apart from those we have in our folk memory, of the Vikings and the Norse,. etc., and allow further integration with the European Community and open borders with a country that will be able to attract races and ethnic groups.</P>
    <P>We have evidence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as I am sure you and others are aware from the studies of Father Micheál Mac Greil that we do not have a high tolerance but we do have a high level of prejudice against colour and ethnic groups in this country.  Perhaps it is because we have not been exposed to a great mingling and integration of races up to now.  It is important that we foresee, and even protect, the rights of those ethnic groups in our country who are trying to make a living.  As Deputy Fennell pointed out, the foundation of all tolerance, freedoms, protections and removal of discriminations lies within legislation.  Human conditioning and human fallibility being what they are &mdash; and this is why legislators are of such tremendous importance &mdash; this is the first foundation stone on which we build the society of pluralism and tolerance we <Col N="602" /> wish to have and of which the people who set up this State had a vision.</P>
    <P>Regarding the inclusion of the travelling community, I do not wish to let the opportunity go by without welcoming it. I know that the introduction of this legislation, and the debate which is taking place, will change attitudes and people's sense of compassion towards a group of people who are our own but whom we have managed to isolate and have made them feel alien.  This legislation will allow this group to be protected and not abused, but I hope they will be housed and integrated with the community according to their needs and their culture. I know that the Minister and county councillors throughout Ireland have been working on this matter for some time. Until such time as we achieve this we cannot rest easily and we cannot believe we have the kind of Christian, accepting, tolerant society which all of us would like to think we are working towards.</P>
    <P>I would also like to welcome the support which all amendments to the Bill have got, collectively from Members on this side.  I thank also my own colleagues who gave me every support in putting down the amendment which I hope will be accepted by the Minister.  When we are talking about incitement to hatred towards women and, sadly, more recently, towards children, it must be perceived as an incitement to sexual hatred and violence.  In the same way as this debate has teased out the various attitudes and the definition of hatred we have towards other groups within our community, for whom we wish to legislate, we all agree that this Bill had to take on and fight the incitement to racial hatred, for instance, by literature, by visual material and by the behaviour of people who would incite racist hatred.</P>
    <P>There are many surveys and much research to illustrate the use and abuse of hard pornography, as defined in my amendment No. a1a.  This amendment tries to spell out the various forms of violence and the humiliations involved in it as an incitement to sexual hatred and violence.  On behalf of women and, indeed, on behalf of many men who share <Col N="603" /> the same concern about that kind of pollution of our society, I would say that unless we also legislate against that freedom for women &mdash; that includes women's civil rights and civil liberties &mdash; will depend on the elimination of that pornography as part of the whole elimination of sexist discrimination.  I would also remind the Minister and the House of other UN conventions, particularly the convention which guarantees freedom of movement, which is a basic human right, plus the UN convention on the elimination of all discrimination against women.  One of the points they highlight is that women must have freedom comparable to that of men.</P>
    <P>The spread of pornography and the depiction of women in pornography curbs their freedom.  A recent US commission on pornography has shown quite clearly that there is a direct relationship between hard pornography and violence against women.  We are talking about the protection of the life and liberty of women, which must hold as high a place on the agenda as the other areas within this legislation. It is an important time for us to include it.  Until recently not much research had been carried out into the effects of pornography and its widescale distribution.  The proliferation of videos and computer games laden with images which attack women means that we are no longer talking about a small group of people who have access to such material under adult conditions.  This is something which is expanding and polluting society, depicting perversion and violence against women on an unprecedented scale.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that there is a direct relationship between pornography and racism in that it is usually very poor and deprived women from Third World countries who are used and abused in these films.  I make my case not only against sexism but also against racism. Studies or pornography substantiate this point.  In the light of the amendments which have been allowed already to this Bill I hope it will not go forward to the <Col N="604" /> Seanad in an incomplete form.  The Minister has been assured by every speaker that this amendment will be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my collegue, Deputy Barnes, on this amendment and appeal to the Minister, who has shown himself to be in a generous mood today by introducing very welcome amendments, to improve this legislation yet again by accepting the amendment in the name of Deputy Barnes.  I would compliment my colleague on her parliamentary drafting acumen, given that she has, for the first time in any legislation, placed before the House a very succinct definition of pornography.  We had a broadly similar debate last week on another Bill but did not reach a successful conclusion. For the first time, the House is now identifying in succinct terms a definition which in the past has proved very difficult. In that sense we are making a little bit of history.  I compliment Deputy Barnes and hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I now turn to a number of other amendments, particularly amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Taylor and Kavanagh which states:</P>
      <P>In the third line, after &ldquo;community&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or their sexual orientation and shall include conduct likely to hold up any such person or group to ridicule or contempt&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Are we broadening the scope of the definition, bearing in mind that we are attempting to insert these words following a definition of hatred?  I hope Deputy Taylor disagrees, but the logical continuum appears to be that we would be defining hatred as holding persons up to ridicule.  Perhaps we are broadening the scope by equating hatred with ridicule.</P>

      <P>From a drafting point of view we may be in difficulty.  Perhaps we should consider the point.  I offer the support of my party for amendment No. 1a.  The Bill makes it an offence to publish <Col N="605" /> or distribute certain written material and I agree that it should also be an offence to print or keep in possession or custody material that is likely to incite hatred. Having regard to the practicalities and evidence adduced in the course of Second Stage debate with regard to material which has been freely printed in this city and throughout the State, we should tighten this legislation by agreeing to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Members who have spoken for the warmth of their welcome for the extension of this Bill to include the element of sexual orientation. The points made by Members reflect my own view that it would be remiss not to take the opportunity afforded by this legislation to extend to the gay community the protection of this Bill.  I appreciate the warmth of the welcome it has received.  It is now a much better Bill as it will prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although not covered in the title, the <Col N="606" /> ethnic question is included in the definition of hatred.  &ldquo;Hatred&rdquo; means hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community, or sexual orientation. That is a very broad interpretation extending as it does now to the travelling and gay communities.</P>
    <P>I endorse the views of Members in relation to the plight of the travelling community and the need for a more enlightened, charitable, Christian and general liberal view to the question of accommodation at halting sites, or permanent accommodation, whichever suits the travelling community.  The expressions of support for the efforts of local authorities who have been trying to do something in this area are welcome and I take the opportunity in the House of encouraging communities around the country to take their share of the national responsibility in this regard, which should be tackled.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of Dublin County Council I introduced a programme of sites for travelling families the length and breadth of County Dublin and there was a general welcome for it in many areas.  Some people opposed it, they wanted something done but not in their area or next door to them.  These people had liberal views in relation to many other areas and thought it was appalling to see unfortunate families on the bypass in Tallaght &mdash; as they were at that time &mdash; and at the side of the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We mentioned to the Minister that that was a likely outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the proposal was adopted and it should be implemented, not just in County Dublin, but throughout the country.  We should have sites in every county for the travelling community and some of the hatred expressed towards them will now be covered by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset &mdash; but I will reiterate it&mdash;that we are conscious of the fact that <Col N="607" /> verbal attacks on the gay community will often lead to physical attacks.  There is always a danger that if something is repeated often enough, no matter how untrue or outlandish, it may eventually be believed by some people.  If we did not introduce an amendment it would give an opportunity to bigoted and unscrupulous people to latch on to the prevalence of AIDS to incite hatred against the gay community.  I believe that there are already examples of this and I am glad to be able to do something by means of this amendment which should put a stop to it.  I appreciate the welcome it has received in the House.</P>
    <P>I oppose the points made by Deputy Taylor regarding ridicule and contempt because they are neither practical nor desirable.  However, I understand Deputy Taylor's reason for submitting the amendment.  Under sections 2, 3 and 4 it will be an offence for a person to act or speak in such a way as to be threatening, abusive or insulting with the intent or likelihood of hatred being stirred up.  The words &ldquo;threatening&rdquo;, &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; and &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; are well known and have been included in legislation here and abroad for a long time.  They are strong words&mdash; as indeed is &ldquo;hatred&rdquo;&mdash; and mean more than &ldquo;annoying&rdquo;, &ldquo;ridiculing&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating someone with contempt&rdquo;.  They are undefined but they are clear in their meaning, a meaning which any ordinary citizen could understand.</P>
    <P>For example, an ordinary citizen would recognise an insult when he heard it but it would not be appropriate to penalise those who say or publish something in bad taste.  To hold up groups of persons to ridicule or contempt may not be ideal human behaviour but it is certainly not a crime and I do not intend to make it one. To accept Deputy Taylor's amendment would leave the legislation so lacking in the type of respect and sense of fairness that all legislation needs in order to be acceptable that its value would be greatly diluted.</P>
    <P>It has also been said, on more than one occasion during the debates on this Bill, that we must be very careful not to <Col N="608" /> include anything that might infringe the constitutional right of free speech.  I submit that the amendment we are now discussing could well upset the fine balance we have achieved in the Bill in this respect.  After all, there must surely be a limit to how far the criminal law should seek to enforce standards of good taste. It may not be good taste to make a speech expressing contempt for persons, for example, from a particular country, or to ridicule them, but it would surely be going too far to penalise such a speech even if it could be regarded as insulting.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about how &ldquo;ridicule&rdquo; and &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; are treated in other laws.  They are not, as far as I can ascertain, contained in any statute law.  However, in common law the tort of defamation can be committed by the wrongful publication of a false statement about a person which tends to lower that person in the eyes of right thinking members of society, or tends to hold that person up to hatred, ridicule or contempt, or causes that person to be shunned or avoided by right thinking members of society.  That definition derives from judicial pronouncements and is non-statutory.  However, it bears no relation to this Bill.  First, it is concerned with false statements.  The offences in the Bill could be committed even where the words uttered or material published were true.  It would not be a defence to a charge of an offence under this Bill to say that the words were true. The important aspect is that they would be intended or likely to stir up hatred.  In regard to defamation, the false statement must be about a person or persons, not a wide group of persons, because of their membership of certain categories in society, as in this Bill.  This is as it should be because individuals have the right not to be ridiculed or held up to contempt by reason of false statements.  I have said enough about the law of defamation to show that there is no comparison between it and the incitement Bill.  It would be totally inappropriate to give &ldquo;ridicule&rdquo; or &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; the same status in this Bill as &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Deputy Flanagan made a number of points.  This Bill is only intended to allow ratification of the UN covenant on civil and political rights.  It is not relevant to ratification under the UN racial discrimination convention.  That is another day's work for all of us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also asked about the interpretation of &ldquo;or elsewhere&rdquo;.  That is the way the draftsman recommended that we should deal with the amendment.  The Deputy also had questions in relation to amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 7.  The definition of &ldquo;script&rdquo; is the same as that in the Bill as published.  It is purely a technical amendment.</P>
    <P>I fully share Deputy Barnes's abhorrence of pornography and how it demeans the role and status of women and children. That is why under the 1946 Censorship of Publications Act if the censorship board, having duly examined a book, are of the opinion that it is indecent or obscene, they may ban it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be the same in relation to videos.  Videos will be covered in the Video Recordings Bill, 1987, which we hope to have passed later this evening also.</P>
      <P>I accept fully the principle of what the Deputy is trying to achieve in relation to pornography, having a ban on pornography, as outlined.  First, I cannot accept it in the technical sense of its drafting. I will admit it is the first time I have seen an attempt made at such a wide drafting of the definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. I accept that it was a genuine effort and I compliment Deputy Barnes thereon.  I am informed by the draftsman that, under no circumstances, could it be accepted in its present form but that is a technical difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the principle, what the Deputy is attempting to introduce into this Bill is the element of subordination generally and, within this context, subordination. I would suggest that, were I to accept this definition, we could take it <Col N="610" /> to its logical conclusion, that of incorporating subordination on many other grounds such as, for example, subordination on account of poverty, class or social origin.  I say that with regret.  I join the Deputy in her abhorrence of pornography, as would every Member of this House with regard to anything that would demean the role of women in any way, lead to any reduction of their status or indeed that would lead to attacks on women or children or their degradation.</P>
    <P>I will examine this definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; ascertaining whether in some other way, in some other Bill, I can tackle it.  But I cannot accept the definition in its present form.  I will give the Deputy this commitment, that I will have it examined to ascertain whether the concept can be incorporated in some way in legislation, a concept with which I agree but which cannot be included in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the amendments I have tabled in relation to the gay and the travelling communities, in the extension of the definition of &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; I have gone a long way in relation to the provisions of this Bill. It will be a much better Bill as a result of the combined efforts of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the agreement of the Government.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the points made on previous stages of debate in both Houses &mdash; in relation both to the travelling community and sexual orientation &mdash; I felt that, having gone that far, that would be the end of the road.  Now I discover that more has arisen.  It is the old case that, once one opens the gates, something else enters.  I cannot go any further in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I do give the Deputy and the House this commitment, that I will examine this whole broad area of pornography as interpreted and drafted by Deputy Barnes.  I will ascertain what can be done to meet what is the general feeling and wishes of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise my voice in support of the amendment proposed by Deputy Barnes and to make one final effort to urge the Minister to <Col N="611" /> reconsider its acceptance.  It is not really a reasonable defence for the Minister to say that he has gone a long way to meet us because we pressed him to include prohibition in relation to hatred of the travelling and the gay communities.  Let us be honest about this, those two arguments stood on their merits.  While I am very glad the Minister has accepted the case advanced by my colleagues earlier in this debate &mdash; and has now included those two groups &mdash; no doubt he himself will accept that it has led to an improvement of the Bill.  That is what democracy and parliamentary debate is all about.</P>
      <P>Without pointing the finger at the present Minister perhaps it is a reflection of an old time attitude emanating more from ministerial advisers than Ministers themselves, that it is with the most grudging attitude Ministers accept anything from the Opposition.  The Minister himself has shown in relation to the travelling and the gay communities that he has been prepared to listen to the views expressed by the Opposition and has taken on board the spirit of the amendments previously proposed.  That is good but I cannot accept that the Minister should use that, as it were, as an excuse for not taking on board the very legitimate case made by Deputy Barnes which must be examined separately.  That is the only way we can tease out the question of whether that definition should be included in this Bill. I accept that the Minister has said he will examine the proposal in the context of another Bill but that could be next week, next year or never.  We are afforded an opportunity now to consider its inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now dispose of the technical aspect of the drafting.  Deputy Barnes is to be complimented on her effort to produce a definition of &ldquo;pornography.&rdquo; If technically it does not totally qualify for inclusion in this Bill, the Minister can overcome that difficulty by asking his advisers and parliamentary draftsmen, as it were, to punch it into shape.  Let us get to the principle of it.  There is a very strong view held in this country that every effort should be made to outlaw and restrict pornography.  The difficulty with <Col N="612" /> coming up with an appropriate definition should not stymie those attempts.  Surely there is sufficient wisdom between the Minister's office and his parliamentary draftsmen to draft an appropriate definition.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the principle.  If we are against it we should make every effort, examine every piece of legislation as it arises to ascertain what we can do to follow that principle.  I have to say very bluntly, as a family man that I am appalled by the level of pornography that has crept in here; from a personal point of view I am gravely concerned.  As a public representative I feel very strongly that we must avail of every opportunity to send out the message loudly and clearly from this House that we shall make every effort to stem this tide of pornography. From that point of view then we have a Bill before us, we have a very reasonable and reasoned case made by Deputy Barnes.  I would invite the Minister to think again.  If he accepts the view that we should be availing of every opportunity to stem this tide of pornography, this Bill constitutes one vehicle we should be using.  In those circumstances the Minister should be accepting the spirit of Deputy Barnes' amendment.  If he did that, I have no doubt we could find the appropriate procedures to allow the amendment be put in proper shape for inclusion in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of brief responses to the points made by the Minister.  On the ethnic point, I am slightly puzzled as to why there should be any objection to including the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; in the title when the matter of ethnicity is accepted by the Minister as constituting a critical part of the Bill.  The Minister has taken that on board in his definition of hatred.  Consequently as it is a key part of what the Bill imports it is difficult to understand why there should be any rooted objection on the Minister's part to including it in the title, having regard to the fact that it is already included in the definition.  It does not seem to be an unreasonable request, if it is a key part of the Bill, as expressed in <Col N="613" /> the definition, to ask for it to be included in the title also.  It is only one word and I do not understand why it should not be included.  What difference would it make?  Would it not reflect the Bill more accurately if it was included in the title when it is an integral part of the Bill and included already in the definition?</P>
      <P>I am a bit disappointed that the Minister is not agreeable to accepting our amendment on the extension of the definition of hatred to include the holding up of a group to ridicule or contempt.  I did not think, on consideration, that that was an unreasonable request to make of the Minister.  Certainly the expressions &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; and &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; are well known to the law but as the Minister said, in the defamation context, so are hatred, ridicule and contempt.  That applies in the context of an individual but we are not talking about an individual here; we are talking primarily about a group of people.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have known that there are certain elements of the media whereby a certain group of people can be held up to ridicule or contempt. This can be extremely hurtful to them and it well warranted that it should be deemed to be a criminal offence under the terms of this Bill.  I am sure the Minister must have seen some of the anti-semitic material of a <i>der Sturmer</i> type which has been printed quite frequently and circulated in this country.  Obviously the Minister for Justice has seen that cartoon-type material in which people are shown with certain characteristics which hold them up to contempt and ridicule.  It is known that when the Nazis were about their business the first thing they did when they wanted to debase people was to hold them up to ridicule; the next stage was to hold them up to contempt and then it was an easy slot on to stir up hatred against them.  One thing leads on to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that a cartoon lampooning a person &mdash; be it the Minister, myself, Deputy Dukes or whoever &mdash; in a newspaper should come within the terms of this Bill.  This is fair enough activity, and I would be the first to admit <Col N="614" /> that.  I am not talking about that kind of activity.  I am talking about the way a group of people, a category of people, a religious group or an ethnic division of people are depicted in cartoons.  These cartoons can be very effective and can have a tremendous impact, far more than the written word can have, in not so much stirring up hatred as an initial factor but showing up people with characteristics at which people will laugh and ask &ldquo;did you see this group of people?&rdquo; The people depicted in these cartoons could be itinerants, Jews or gays.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not extend the definition in the way I seek I cannot see that that kind of activity would come within the terms of the Bill and remain as a legal activity.  I cannot imagine that the Minister has that in mind or that he would want that kind of situation to develop.  I am sure he does not but it seems that that is what will follow.  This is why I devised the amendment with Deputy Kavanagh.  I still believe it is a necessary protection which should be brought in and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Barnes's amendment which the Minister has said he cannot accept as it is worded.  I think he said he accepted the principle and objective of the amendment, the thinking behind it and the general feelings Deputy Barnes and other speakers here have on it.  I hope the Minister will come some of the way &mdash; hopefully he may come all of the way &mdash; towards resolving the difficulty we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are dealing with legislation like this &mdash; I am sure we will not be dealing with it for a long time again &mdash; the tendency is to say that the legislation must remain in force for as long a time as possible.  We have to accept that there is a trend towards the greater use of females in all kinds of unacceptable ways for pornographic purposes.  If we do not attempt to address this problem now I do not think it will be dealt with in any other legislation.  We may discuss it in relation to the Video Recordings Bill and include a provision in it in this regard but what <Col N="615" /> legislation will govern publications, magazines and newspapers which use these pornographic pictures?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will accept that there is an association between hard pornography and the increased incidence of violence against women and children.  I cannot quote statistics or research that has been carried out in this country or the UK but research carried out in the United States has shown conclusively that there is a very strong link between the two.  That should be reason enough for us to move now on the problem in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The people who deal with rape victims tell us that deviant sex, violent sex and pornography are associated with horrific crimes of violence and rape.  I plead with the Minister to be open-minded on this aspect and to be aware that we need to bring in protection for these women.  If the Minister does not agree with us or thinks that it could cause drafting problems in this section, perhaps he will give a commitment to look at it again and try to meet the requirement of Deputy Barnes.  I do not think the problem is as bad in Ireland &mdash; I know we are not talking about this problem only in regard to Ireland; we are talking about it in an international context &mdash; and not as many pornographic magazines are on view here compared to the UK or Germany.  I think Germany is a classic case where there is a thriving trade in pornographic magazines which portray women in the most appalling way.</P>
    <P>I think many men are very uncomfortable with explicit pornography where women are used, as the amendment stresses, as objects and in a depraved manner.  Some young men think it is soft or sissy to be critical of this type of use of the female body and they are not sure whether it is bad, wrong and unacceptable. This is not an issue for women. Deputy Barnes and myself are the two women representatives in this debate. This problem of pornography debases all of us.  It is a growing trend and tends to be picked up by the commercial world and used in the most awful way.  I wish <Col N="616" /> we could deal with this problem in a practical manner and arrive at a solution that would suit everybody.  I am not sure I could say that we have seen pornographic books and magazines in Ireland.  I tend to ignore pornography, I find that it makes me most uncomfortable and at times I cannot cope with the front page of <i>The Sunday World.</i>  I am not suggesting for a moment that this is hard pornography but on some Sundays the poses of women where they are portrayed as sexual objects or commodities, would fall within the scope of this amendment.  I feel we should be legislating for the here and now and for the years ahead and I appeal to the Minister to co-operate with what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify some points before Deputy Barnes speaks.  As I have said already, I share the view that pornography not only debases women, but all of us.  I have committed myself to examine it.  However, the Bill before us is the wrong place for an amendment such as that proposed by Deputy Barnes. The problem of pornography is much wider that what could be handled in this Bill.  Let me remind Members that we are creating a new offence of incitement to hatred against certain named groups.  The groups are named in the amendment I tabled to the title of the Bill, &ldquo;To prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation&rdquo;. Hatred is defined in another amendment as:</P>
      <P>Hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation ...</P>
      <P>Let me say this is the wrong legislation for the proposed amendment, in case Deputies should think that it is only the drafting of the amendment that I cannot accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already complimented Deputy Barnes on her attempt at drafting the amendment.  My experts have told me <Col N="617" /> that it would not be adequate but I compliment the Deputy on making such a comprehensive shot at drafting it and it is much better than what I could do.  I accept that pornography is a problem.  I am not long-fingering the problem and I will try genuinely to meet the wishes of Members.  It would distort the situation if it was portrayed that I am opposed to what Deputy Barnes is trying to achieve, but this is simply the wrong place to include what Deputy Barnes envisages.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to comment on the points raised by Deputy Taylor.  I have a long note on why the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is omitted from the title but let me say briefly that whether ethnic is in the title makes no difference to its meaning, scope or potential within the Bill and makes no difference to any other aspects of the Bill.  It is unnecessary. Imagine somebody being prosecuted for stirring up hatred against a group on account of their ethnic origin and arguing that he is not guilty because the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; is not in the title of the Bill.  To include the word &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; would not be good drafting and it could have unforeseeable repercussions.  All things considered, and in the context of the expert advice available to me, I am unable to accept that amendment.  Ethnic is covered in the interpretation of hatred. On the question of anti-Semitic material, most of the anti-Semitic material that I have seen would be seen to have incited others to hatred.  It is stronger than simply ridiculing people or holding them up to contempt in the manner to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    <P>I apologise for speaking before Deputy Barnes but I thought it important to make those points.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is committed to legislating for this area. I welcome that.  I will not repeat myself but it is very important to stress the problem of pornography.  I know the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman believe that this Bill is not the appropriate place to include such provisions.  However, women have, from their collective experience a fear of being in certain places at <Col N="618" /> certain times, of not being freely able to move as men can, and of being constantly under threat of rape or assault and, above all else, the violence engendered by hard porn.  This violence includes not only beatings, dismemberings, burnings, multiple rape, but leads as some hard porn films do, to the death of the women in the film.  That is an incitement to hatred and an expression of hatred towards all women, because those &ldquo;objects&rdquo; and that is what they are seen as in such films, are really personifying all women.  There is the in-built humiliation, degradation and threat to all women.  While the Minister may not be able to accept that this is the appropriate Bill for this amendment, I want to place on record that out of the experience of women and research on the subject, we realise that what is involved in pornography is incitement to hatred and not just incitement to degradation but to actual hatred that would allow titillation from the violation and torture of other human beings.  It is as basic, fundamental and frightening as that for women.  I feel it is terribly important to put this on record.</P>
      <P>In case I will be seen as a fraud &mdash; and I feel very guilty about all the compliments I have received, which I welcome, on the drafting of the definition &mdash; I have to admit that this was defined by the National Council for Civil Liberties in Britain by a commission set up to campaign against pornography and censorship and it has been accepted by an Irish national campaign against pornography and censorship.  The definition is an attempt, in a wide and non-censorious way, to show the breadth of violence without attempting to censor good, erotic sex or good relationships between men and women.  It is extraordinarily difficult to do this.  I look forward to seeing the more refined version produced by the draftsman.  Drafting can lead to quite complex difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's commitment but I wish to press very hard to have the amendment included in this Bill.  This does not mean it cannot also be covered in other legislation, particularly if this Bill does not cover all aspects.  I would <Col N="619" /> like a definition of pornography and the seriousness of it to be incorporated in legislation as quickly as possible, so that we can begin to protect ourselves from it.  If the Minister is adamant that he cannot accept what I consider to be a logical and valid viewpoint that the incitement to hatred against women is as acceptable as incitement to other groups, could he indicate where such a provision could be included in legislation?  For example, could it be considered on Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill, where it may also have a place?</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;publish&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, print or keep in their possession or custody&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;print or keep in their possession or custody&rdquo; in section 2 (1) (a).  I thank Deputy Flanagan for his support for this amendment and I hope the Minister can accept it.  The wording of the original draft of the Bill is too narrow.  It provides only for publishing or distribution of written material and does not cover the printing of this material.  People who print this material and also people who store it and keep it in their possession or custody, should be equally covered by the terms of the Bill.  If we regard this material as something that we are not prepared to accept, if we prohibit its publication and <Col N="621" /> its distribution, it is logical to prohibit printers from printing it or other people from keeping it in their possession or custody.</P>
    <P>Many and varied attempts will be made to get around this Bill when it is in force. Experience with similar legislation in other countries has shown that great ingenuity goes into trying to avoid its terms and large amounts of money are spent on legal people trying to find loopholes. Of course that happens with all legislation but it has happened very frequently with this kind of legislation.  The equivalent Act in England has been rendered almost useless as a result of pitfalls and defects that have turned up in it.  I will say more about that later in the context of a different amendment.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful on this Stage to ensure that we cast the net as widely as we can and that we do not leave loopholes for unscrupulous people to try to evade the prohibitions we are making in the Bill.  It would be useful to add to the prohibition on publication and distribution, the prohibition on printing and keeping in possession or custody.  I hope the House will agree to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appreciates that it is not possible on Report Stage to amend the Title of a Bill.  So far as the Minister's amendment referred to the amendment of the Title, it had to be dealt with on a special Stage called Recommittal Stage.  Under that Stage, debate follows on the lines of a Committee Stage.  That has been completed and we are on Report Stage <Col N="622" /> proper.  Deputy Flanagan might not be happy with that but he understands the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome your clarification of the position too.  I am opposing this amendment.  It was discussed at very great length during Committee Stage and it was more than adequately dealt with there.  Section 2 (1) (a) makes it an offence to publish or distribute written material that is threatening, abusive or insulting and is intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to stir up hatred.  It does not deal with, nor was it intended that it should, mere possession or preparation, such as printing, of this material.  Preparation or possession with a view to distribution etc. is dealt with in section 4 and, accordingly, the substance of the amendment is already catered for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the Director of Public Prosecutions wishes to prosecute a person for printing or being in possession of racist material with a view to distribution he can do so under section 4. Adding the words of the amendment into section 2 would be duplication and therefore unnecessary and as such would be both bad drafting and confusing.  Section 2 is specifically intended as a provision aimed at preventing actions that are intended or are likely to stir up hatred. It would be used where the offending material or words are seen or heard by the public.  On the other hand, section 4 is aimed at persons who are preparing or are in possession of such material with a view to distribution, etc., and it gives <Col N="623" /> the Garda an opportunity to take action before the material ever reaches the public.</P>
    <P>As I said, the amendment is unnecessary. Its substance is already covered in the Bill and I must, accordingly, in the interests of good drafting, oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken in support of the amendment in the name of Deputy Taylor.  Obviously the Minister will agree that printing a document that is likely to stir up hatred is an action that is likely to stir up hatred and for that reason alone I would be happy to support the amendment.  The Minister, in defence of his opposition to the amendment, stated that this matter is already catered for in section 4.  I am not so sure about that because section 4 (1) (b) states that the material must be intended for distribution. Deputy Taylor quite rightly spoke of ingenious efforts being made by people who are likely to profit from publishing, printing and distributing literature of a reprehensible nature. These prople will go to great lengths to find loopholes in the legislation.  It could prove extremely difficult for the Gárda Síochána to show, on discovery of a printing press, that it was intended to distribute these documents.  That difficulty would be overcome by accepting Deputy Taylor's amendment.  If the Minister was willing to consider an amendment to section 4 which sought to obviate the necessity for the prosecutor to prove that it was intended to distribute the literature I would be less supportive of Deputy Taylor's amendment but as things stand I must inform the Minister that I am in agreement with what Deputy Taylor says.  Given the lengths some people will go to get around the legislation to continue peddling their filth the amendment introduced by Deputy Taylor is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>If the Minister was prepared to include the word &ldquo;print&rdquo; alongside the word &ldquo;prepare&rdquo;, which are two separate operations, this would go some way towards meeting our demands.  In <Col N="624" /> my opinion preparing and printing are two different things.  It could be argued that &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; covers printing but it is our intention in moving this amendment to leave people in no doubt that it would be an offence to produce certain material.  I do not think that the Minister's assurance is adequate and the Bill would be a great deal stronger if he was prepared to accept our amendment or include the words &ldquo;to prepare or print&rdquo; in section 4.  We could then move on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I said, the substance of the amendment is dealt with in section 4 which was included in the Bill to deal with the preparation and possession of inflammatory material.  Section 4 has been drafted in a way which is suitable for dealing with the concept of preparation and possession.  Including it in section 2 would not only amount to duplication, it would also be an inappropriate way of dealing with it.  As a layman, I can only go by what the draftsman tells me which is that the word &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; covers printing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to invite him.  Let me make one brief point.  I do not know why it is we have to invite difficulties when, very simply, through the insertion of one word we could put the matter beyond yea or nay.  By occupation, I am a lawyer, as is Deputy Flanagan, <Col N="625" /> and I can visualise myself going into court and arguing with some force that the person who printed the material did not prepare it and that the word &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; does not include printing.  I do not know whether I would win the case, much would depend on who the judge was but I might well win it.  Therefore why do we have to take this risk and put this matter in doubt when the addition of one word at this stage where it means nothing would put the matter beyond yea or nay?  Why do we have to create difficulty when it is not necessary to do so? I think the word &ldquo;print&rdquo; should appear in the Bill.  As Deputy Kavanagh has said, if it did appear in section 4 everything would be all right.  If the Minister is willing to put it in section 4 I will withdraw the amendment.  If not, we must vote on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 7 to 9 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) to use words, behave or display written material&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in any place other than inside a private residence, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) inside a private residence so that the words, behaviour or material <Col N="628" /> are heard or seen by persons outside the residence,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To meet points made on Second Stage, the previous Minister for Justice proposed three amendments in Committee to section 2 in an effort to tighten-up its provisions.  However, it was argued that the amendments did not cover the situation where a public meeting at which hatred in the terms of the Bill was incited was held in a private residence.  The amendments were withdrawn to see if the reservations expressed in Committee could be met and, accordingly, I now propose amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5 in order to meet those reservations. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are the same as amendments Nos. 4 and 6 on Committee Stage but amendment No. 5 is different from amendment No. 11 in Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> Deputies will have noticed that I retained the concept of the &ldquo;private residence&rdquo; in this section.  The effect of the amendments that my predecessor proposed on Committee Stage, but withdrew, would have been that it would be an offence to use inflammatory words, etc., either (a) outside a private residence or (b) inside a private residence but so that the words could be heard, etc, by a person outside that residence.  Therefore if, for example, inflammatory words spoken in a private residence were heard in the street outside or even in another flat in the same block, the offence would be committed.  But Deputy Barrett and Deputy Taylor pointed our correctly that, if a public meeting were to be held in a private residence, and if inflammatory words were spoken at the meeting, this would not be an offence under the section, because the words would be spoken in a private residence.  What I am now proposing is to meet this point by defining &ldquo;private residence&rdquo; in such a way as to exclude from the definition any part of the House or other structure in question in which a public meeting is being held. Therefore, if inflammatory words are spoken either (a) in the part of the structure where the public meeting is being held or (b) in any other part but so that the words are heard in the part where the meeting is being held, an offence will be committed, because then the words will not have been spoken or heard, as the case may be, only in a private residence.</P>
    <P>As a result of amendment No. 3 the defence provided in section 2 (2) (b) (i) will be available when the person concerned can prove that he was in a private residence, as defined, and that he had no reason to believe that the words could be heard by a person outside the residence or by a person who was inside the residence but in a part of it where a public meeting was being held.  This defence could not be used when the offending words were spoken in any other place, for example, in the open or in a factory, club, town hall or at any private meeting held outside the used part of a private residence or at a public meeting in the private residence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I will now say a few words about the definition in this section.  The definition of &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo;, as it appeared in the original draft of the Bill, is being joined to that of &ldquo;private residence&rdquo; as the words &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; do not appear elsewhere in the section.  The definition will ensure, first of all, that it is only genuine and lived in dwellings and other structures, such as mobile homes, which will be excluded from the terms of this section. Therefore a derelict building or any part of a house not used for residential purposes will not be considered to be a private residence for the purposes of the section.  The definition also excludes the part of the private residence in which a public meeting is being held.  In other words, offensive words spoken in a part of a house used as a private residence will constitute an offence if heard outside that part or if heard in any part of the building when a public meeting is taking place in that part.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; aspect is comprehensive and covers a whole range of circumstances, including invitations to members of the public.  The elements going to make up this part of the definition are as follows.</P>
    <P>First of all, the meeting would be one at which the public were entitled to be present.  Any advertisements or other notices for the meeting &mdash; whether in newspapers, or more likely in practice by way of posters or leaflets &mdash; would constitute an invitation to the public and as such members of the public would be entitled to be present.  The second element is that it does not matter whether the public have to pay or whether entry is free.  Thirdly, a meeting will be a public meeting if any members of the public are present as of right or by virtue of an express or implied permission.  Again, advertisements, or word of mouth, or any other means of notice of a public meeting, no matter where it is to be held, would represent an express or implied permission to members of the public to be present and would be caught by the provisions of this section.  A meeting would still be a public meeting, as defined, where an advertisement or <Col N="631" /> notice reserved the right of admittance, because in this case the members of the public who were not refused admittance would be entitled to be present by virtue of the express or implied permission.</P>
    <P>To sum up, an offence can be committed in any place under this section, public or private, except in the used part of a private residence &mdash; that is to say, the residential part.  This exception will not apply if the offending words are heard outside the used part of the residence or if the words are spoken at a public meeting which is taking place in the private residence or are spoken in the used part but heard in the part where the meeting is being held or, indeed, heard anywhere else, including the remainder of the premises.</P>
    <P>I hope I have met all the reservations expressed about this section and I recommend amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5 to the House.</P>

While realising the difficulties that the Minister had in overcoming the reservations on Committee Stage, I believe he has done as good a job as can be done. In the circumstances, he has covered many of the loopholes that might have existed in the Bill as initiated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;and is intended&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is directed to the standard of proof required.  The difficulty as I see it arises from the fact that under this section it would be necessary for the prosecution to prove the intention of the person who was preparing or distributing this material.  That is notoriously difficult to prove.  The equivalent English Act &mdash; and this section closely follows the form of the English Act &mdash; fell foul of this difficulty and to a very large extent has proved to be a legal minefield and many people who ought to have been convicted were freed because it was not possible to prove intent.  There are other legal situations where it is necessary to prove <Col N="634" /> a person's intent, and in those cases it is always a matter of great difficulty for the courts to tell what a person intended, what was in a person's mind.  The only person who knows that for truth is the person himself or herself, and this is a source of great difficulty for the courts.</P>
    <P>It is too high a standard of proof to require the prosecution to cover this kind of situation altogether.  If a person has prepared or is in possession of filth &mdash; which is what this material is &mdash; it is a fair enough presumption, unless he proves to the contrary, that he intended to dirty people with it.  I do not think it should be necessary for the prosecution to prove that he intended to use this filth to dirty people.  That should follow.  He may have a defence that would enable him to give some explanation why he prepared this material or was in possession of it, but that should be a matter of defence, not the responsibility of the prosecution.  We should set a reasonable standard of proof. That always has to be done, but if the material itself meets the criteria of prohibition laid down in the Bill, that should be sufficient to establish the prosecution's case.  There is no great benefit or merit in bringing in a Bill that makes it so difficult for the prosecution to establish success in prosecutions that it becomes very little availed of.  That is precisely what happened in Britain.  We should learn from the British experience and avoid this pitfall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor and, I think I covered this in an earlier amendment when we spoke about printing.  Deputy Taylor makes a fair point.  In this legislation we are talking about making it an offence to print, publish or distribute any documents that are likely to stir up hatred.  Perhaps we are putting an extra burden on the prosecution to show intent on the part of the producers, printers, suppliers or manufacturers but the very fact that persons are apprehended in the process of printing or preparation should be sufficient to constitute an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am reading section 4 correctly, that is not the case; there is an extra onus on <Col N="635" /> the prosecution to show an intention to distribute, to supply or to broadcast.  That element of intent could be the rock this legislation perished on by making it very difficult for the prosecution to successfully bring a case against the defendant. I ask the Minister to look further at the burden of proof he is placing on the prosecution.  It should be sufficient to apprehend a transgressor with the material, irrespective of what he is going to do with it.  By deleting &ldquo;intention to distribute&rdquo; perhaps we are making this legislation more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing these amendments.</P>
      <P>In the preparation of this Bill much thought was given to what should be the basis for the taking of prosecutions for offences committed under sections 2, 3 or 4.  Many reference books, publications and legislation elsewhere were consulted and, indeed, if I may say so in this regard, the Deputy's own Private Member's Incitement to Hatred Bill in 1986 was noted.</P>
      <P>I think we could learn a salutary lesson from the experience of our neighbours in trying to come up with the right answer in their legislation in this area.  When incitement to racial hatred was first criminalised in Britain in 1965, the legislation made it a requirement that an intention to incite to racial hatred be proved.  The Act had the effect of penalising crude forms of racial hatred where such an intention could easily be inferred because of the overtness of the language or conduct in question.  Apparently, more subtle forms of propaganda began to appear.  Thus, it became difficult to prove intent.  The law was changed so that the subjective criterion of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; was repealed and in its place was put the objective criterion of &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;.  This gave rise to other problems.  For example, where the recipients of racist material were already racist, it was difficult to prove that the material was likely to influence them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the British Public Order Act, 1986, reintroduced the subjective <Col N="636" /> criterion of intent to stir up racial hatred while retaining as an alternative to the objective criterion that hatred would be likely to be stirred up.  I agree with that approach which is why the alternatives of intent and likelihood have been included in the Bill.  These criteria are not complementary, they are alternatives, and where the DPP is deciding whether or not to prosecute, his task will be made easier in many cases by having these alternatives; he can frame the charge in such a way that the accused can be convicted whether the evidence proves that he intended to stir up hatred or only that the words, etc. were likely to do so.  Accordingly, I feel it would greatly diminish the effectiveness of the Bill to remove the &ldquo;intent&rdquo; requirement and that is not, I am sure, what the Deputy's own intentions are.  Therefore, I am opposing amendment No. 6a.</P>
    <P>I am also opposing amendment No. 6b. In opposing amendment No. 6a amendment No. 6b must also be opposed as it could not stand on its own, for it would not make sense to say that a person who intended to stir up hatred should have a defence if he proved that he did not suspect that the material or recording was threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 28 to 31 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash; Where a person is charged with an offence under section 2, 3 or 4, no further proceedings in the matter (other than any remand in custody or on bail) shall be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>I am proposing amendment No. 8 to meet a point raised by Deputy Taylor and supported by others, including Deputy McCartan, on the wording of the section, as it stands, during Committee Stage on the motion that section 8 should stand part of the Bill.  Deputy Taylor's point was that it was not clear whether the wording would allow a person to be charged without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I agree that there may well be some ambiguity on that point and, accordingly, I am recommending to the House amendment No. 8 in order to clarify the position.  It was never the intention that a person could not be arrested and charged by the Garda with an offence under the Bill without the consent of the DPP.  The position, if the amendment is accepted, will be that a person can be arrested and charged and brought before the court where he can be remanded in custody or on bail.  Before a formal charge can be brought against the person in the court, the consent of the DPP will be necessary.  The purpose of the procedure is to enable the Garda to take immediate action, where necessary, before the matter can be reported to the DPP and he can decide whether there should be a prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar wording to that proposed in the amendment has been used in other Acts, for example at section 20 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and at section 6 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  Indeed, a wording very similar to the above was used as far back as 1883 <Col N="638" /> in the Explosive Substances Act of that year.</P>

      <P>In the fourth line, after &ldquo;Prosecutions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy enough with the Minister's amendment subject to my own amendment to it.  The net point of my amendment to amendment No. 8 is my unhappiness with the provision that a prosecution under this Act may only be instituted by, or with the consent of, the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am puzzled by this requirement.  I do not know why that standard is adopted by the Minister in this Bill and, indeed, persisted in now on Report Stage.  It was argued forcibly by Deputy McCartan, by others and by myself on Committee Stage.  I had hoped there would have been some give on this issue on Report Stage.  I spoke with Deputy McCartan a little while ago and he made the point that it should be open to anybody &mdash; even a person who is not a member of the Garda &mdash; to issue a private prosecution if they were so minded for an offence under this Bill. There is a lot of force to that point of view.  My amendment at least tries to strike a balance and to say that a prosecution can be brought if the Director of Public Prosecutions directs one &mdash; that goes without saying &mdash; but to say also that any Garda officer of the rank of <Col N="639" /> inspector or higher may of his own volition, in an appropriate case, bring a prosecution under this Act.  Why on earth should that be not so?  Do we have such little degree of support or confidence in the Garda Síochána of the rank of inspector and upwards that we are not prepared to leave it to them to issue a prosecution under the Act in important matters such as this?  We know what the pressures are in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This House discussed recently the delays in that office and how long it takes to have material dealt with. One of the key necessities when the kind of incident arises which this Bill seeks to deal with is that speed is required.  You cannot wait for a prosecution for up to six months after a detection.  That could be the time lag involved in referrals to the Director of Public Prosecution's office and waiting for them to make up their mind as to whether there is to be a prosecution.  By that time the offending material will all have been given out. Speed is absolutely essential.  We might as well not bother with the Bill if we have to wait for months after a detection takes place to collect statements and have them submitted and examined by the Director of Public Prosecution's office with all the excessive delays that take place in that office.  Why in Heaven's name can it not be left to a local Garda station with a local inspector, superintendent or chief superintendent who sends his detectives out and discovers this material, to decide that there is an obvious case for a prosecution under the Act?  These people are trained in this line of business.  Gardaí of a much lesser rank than inspector bring and initiate important prosecutions in serious matters so why is a prosecution under this Act being hived off into such a special category that the Director of Public Prosecutions alone is given the right to authorise the bringing of prosecutions? There is no logical reason for it.</P>
    <P>We regard this as a most important matter.  It is a compromise even as it is worded because it could well be argued <Col N="640" /> with force &mdash; and I would be very sensitive to the argument &mdash; that even a private prosecution should be possible. There may be cases where the Garda, let alone the Director of Public Prosecutions, may not be induced to bother to issue a prosecution while a person who was a member of a group affected may be so minded as to issue a prosecution, as can be done, for a wide range of serious offences.  Why not in this case?  I find it difficult to see that the Minister can find fault with leaving the responsibility with an inspector of the Garda Síochána or a superintendent or a chief superintendent. The reason for that escapes me and I cannot imagine what it would be.  This matter is important.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comment on this aspect and to what I hope will be his acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose as strongly as possible the provision in the Bill that all prosecutions to be initiated under this Bill can only be taken with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The first principle is that in law every citizen should have the right of recourse to the courts including the right of recourse to initiate a criminal prosecution if he or she believes such an offence has been committed and the prosecution so warrants it.  That is the general principle of law as it exists.  It is a matter of history that we have ascribed to the person so acting the title &ldquo;common informer&rdquo;.  It has been established in law that a member of the Garda Síochána, above and beyond acting on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, is acting in the capacity, as may be all other citizens, as common informers with the right of prosecution in their name before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the police force is a relatively new institution in the development of civilisation.  In the early nineteenth century the Bow Street Runners appeared for the first time and the concept of a community relying on a police force to regulate their affairs entered into it.  Since then it has been the rare occasion on which we have restricted <Col N="641" /> the right of a citizen to initiate criminal prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has instanced two similar provisions that exist at present.  One relates to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act and the other is in the context of extradition.  I can understand fully that in the extra-territorial inter-State type of proceedings it may be necessary, in the best policy of Government and inter-Government arrangements, to allow for the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be consulted as an absolute necessity prior to a prosecution.  There are other instances which do not take away from the general principles.</P>
    <P>The second important principle of law that applies in this area is that even if the proceedings are initiated by a private citizen in the District Court, should the District Court, by whatever device, move the proceedings on to the Circuit Court or the High Court, the proceedings are taken over by that court, the indictment is laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the matter is then out of the hands of the private citizen.  I have no quibble with or objection to that principle either.  It is important to remember that the private citizen should have access to the District Court to initiate whatever proceedings he or she believes should be initiated.  There have been instances in which that right has been abused and the District Court can deal with those matters very quickly, expeditiously and effectively. There is no case to be made that the citizenry at large abuse that right.  It is an important protection and one that we in this House should be very slow to move from.  We should be particularly slow to move from it in the context of this Bill and what it is proposing to do.</P>
    <P>It is proposing, among other things, to give protections to minorities; to people who are in a minority by reason of their religion, by reason of their race, their nationality, their sexual orientation or the fact that they could possibly be construed as members of the travelling community. The very people who may find difficulty in convincing an official in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that an infringement of the Act <Col N="642" /> has been committed against them may well have difficulty in convincing an inspector, or other higher officer of the Garda Síochána that an offence has been committed against them.  The whole essence of this is the protection against incitement to hatred of minority groups within our community.  We have to think very carefully about this.  It is generally accepted that the Garda Síochána, particularly those in the higher ranks would reflect a conservative view of society.  I have no particular criticism of that.  That is, perhaps, the way the order of things breaks down in what is predominantly a conservative community.  I am, however, seriously concerned about a member of the travelling community, for example, who may feel aggrieved about some act done out of hatred or lack of regard for him or her and goes to a Garda station in a locality where he or she might not be known, seeking to convince a Garda officer that a crime has been committed and that proceedings should be initiated. It may well be that the Garda officer will take up the case and submit the file to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but there must be a fundamental right of persons from the minority sections of the community to have direct access to the office of the local District Court, to take out a summons, have it served and let a judge decide in open hearing whether a crime has been committed. It is wrong to allow these decisions to be arrived at in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the office of any inspector or higher officer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister persists in maintaining this provision, I will certainly support Deputy Taylor's suggestion as the second best.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment in its entirely and allow the matter to stand.  We are talking here about the initiations of proceedings. If, for any reason, they go beyond hearing in the District Court then as a matter of general principle the matter becomes exclusively one for the office of the DPP. The right to initiate proceedings, particularly in the context of this legislation, must be available to the individual who <Col N="643" /> must be able to go into the court office and ask the clerk to issue a summons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some surprise to the attitude expressed by Deputy McCartan in his tirade against the Garda Síochána.  I fail to understand why he cannot accept that the function of the Garda Síochána is to protect the community.  Listening to Deputy McCartan one would think that the duties of the Garda Síochána, from the Commissioner down, were to engage in behaviour against the community rather than to protect it.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that I am happy with the Minister's amendment.  Deputy Taylor has taken a compromise position which is worth some consideration.  If we had a free-for-all, we would be opening up this legislation to actions of a very frivolous nature which would make it somewhat farcical.  I have every confidence that the members of the Garda Síochána will at all times investigate any complaint made by an individual or group within the community.</P>
      <P>The nub of the argument relating to the Minister's amendment is the amount of resources which the Department of Justice will make available to the Director of Public Prosecutions to make sure he can deal adequately with any references under this Bill.  I have not had an opportunity of looking at the little booklet produced earlier today which has reference to the office of the DPP.  Perhaps the Minister can confirm that he has increased the allocation quite substantially to allow the DPP to engage in the functions for which he was appointed. There is merit in Deputy Taylor's amendment but if the office of the DPP had the necessary resources there would not be the backlog of complaints which Deputy Taylor fears.  I should be interested to hear certain assurances from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the last moments we have to speak on this legislation.  We in Fine Gael welcome it and believe it will go a long way towards tackling various problems. <Col N="644" /> We have ample evidence of racial bigotry, discrimination and prejudice.  This is the first legislation to tackle it and we hope to follow it up at a later stage with a comprehensive anti-discrimination Bill to cover the inadequacies mentioned in this House and in the Seanad.  I thank the Minister for his amendments earlier in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The DPP has been consulted about this legislation and is happy that he will have no difficulty in coping with any extra burden that may arise.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides that the authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions is required for a prosecution for any offence under sections 2, 3 or 4.  In accordance with amendment No. 8, this will be subject to the usual qualification permitting the exercise of the ordinary powers of arrest, charge and remand in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>This provision was criticised on Committee Stage on the grounds that the office of the DPP was already overworked and speed was of the essence; and that members of the garda of the rank of Inspector or above have more than a sufficient degree of responsibility to ensure that a proper prosecution would be brought and that frivolous and unnecessary prosecutions would not be authorised by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course I accept that latter point &mdash; the argument about frivolous and mischievous prosecutions mainly has force in the context of private prosecutions where I would be concerned about the courts being used to settle personal squabbles.  However, I am just as concerned as a matter of policy that there is a consistent policy as to the prosecutions taken under this Act.  This is a special kind of legislation.  For an offence to be committed there need be no violence, no robbery or no discord between any groups in society.  An offence can be committed through something being said or written about a group of persons &mdash; not a single person where the laws of defamation would be relevant &mdash; but a group. Deputy McCartan was referring to individuals, not groups.  Built into any such <Col N="645" /> offences is the potential for the creation of martyrs or heroes and also a disrespect for the Act if different prosecution policies in different parts of the country lead to confusion in people's minds about the Act.  Therefore, I have no doubt that it is right to confer this responsibility on the DPP in this section.</P>
    <P>Because the amendment to amendment <Col N="646" /> No. 8, if accepted, would conflict with that policy, I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the crisis which exists in the Land Registry Office. I think there was a measure of agreement from all sides of the House last night that there is a problem in this office because it is understaffed and underfunded.  The increase of 10 per cent in the salaries, wages and allowances of the staff in today's Estimate is not an indication that the Minister, who gave a commitment in this respect in the House last night, is urgently addressing this problem.  When one takes into account the normal increases in staff and salaries under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> this is an indication that there will be no dynamic progress made by the Government in the area of staffing.</P>
      <P>In spite of the commitment given by the Minister in the House last night that he would address the problems, this Estimate does not indicate that the problems we have highlighted by way of our amendment will be addressed by the Government in time to deal with the crisis in the Land Registry office.</P>
      <P>Having put that on the record, along with the comments I made last night, I propose to share the rest of my time, as has been agreed, with Deputy Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make some brief comments on this subject.  I am glad that this matter is before the House.  It is regrettable in many respects that we have to spend an hour and a half of very valuable Dáil time debating something which should have been dealt with many months ago, if not many years ago.  It is also a subject matter which I would say most Deputies in this House, particularly Deputies from outside the Dublin area, are familiar with on a day to day basis because of the difficulties being experienced by their constituents in relation to property transactions.  It is also regrettable in that for most private citizens a property transaction, the buying or selling of their house, will probably be the biggest undertaking they will have in the <Col N="650" /> course of their lifetime in terms of the amount of money involved.</P>
      <P>The problems in the Land Registry, which in fairness to the Minister he acknowledged last night, are now at crisis point.  I do not believe we will be doing enough if extra staff are put into the registry along the lines suggested by the Minister or that the amount of money provided in today's Estimate is anything like adequate to address this problem.</P>
      <P>This office has another unique feature in that as opposed to many State Departments and other functions of the State, this function administered by the State makes a return to the State.  It is rather ludicrous to say the least that a facility provided by the State which can and has been making money is run in such a backward fashion.  I say that with total respect for the civil servants who are trying to carry out their functions with inadequate resources, a lack of facilities and Victorian machinery at their disposal.  Their function could be totally mechanised and computerised with the modern facilities now available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are some 49,000 cases presently on hands waiting to be dealt with and that that number will increase to over 52,000 by December, going on present trends.  It is absolutely and totally unacceptable that there should be this major blockage in what should be a simple procedure.  I will be urging the Government to deal with the obvious crisis in the Land Registry.  I do not believe additional staff on their own will be adequate.  I am not sure that the Minister &mdash; while recognising that there is a problem &mdash; grasps the urgency of tackling the problem and dealing with it in the manner required.  Some sort of a crash programme such as the appointment of additional personnel for a limited period &mdash; whether by means of transferring civil servants from other Departments or bringing in private personnel into the Land Registry &mdash; and total computerisation, as was said today by the trade union representative on behalf of the workers is needed in the Land Registry. The additional staff on their own will <Col N="651" /> not bring the system up to the level of efficiency required.</P>
    <P>A burden is being placed on other ancillary services.  First the public are totally frustrated in the processing of their land transactions.  Solicitors offices invariably contact TDs and they invariably contact the Land Registry.  As a result we are all clogging up the system. This system should be able to function without the necessity for representations, letters or phone calls having to be made to the Land Registry which perhaps at the end of the day slow up the procedure because we are urging people to do work which they are trying to do without adequate resources or manpower.  As I said at the outset it is unlikely there is any TD in this House who has not had to contact the Land Registry as a matter of course during his weekly representations on behalf of his constituents.  If additional resources and staff were made available in the Land Registry, needless to say, the public who would be the first beneficiaries and the staff in the registry who have been neglected over the years, would benefit.  One might say there are no particular votes in the Land Registry and thus it has not been looked after.  Notwithstanding this the impact in recent years has been totally negative in the indifference shown by the Government in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I raised this problem at the beginning of the summer and numerous questions have been asked of the Minister for Justice who, by virtue of the motion being on the Floor of this House, at least acknowledges that a serious problem exists.  I would urge the Minister to show his bona fides in relation to the aspirations he expressed here last night in the provision of additional staff.  The office of registrar has not been filled for a number of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is unwise to come in here and say additional staff will be appointed while at the same time a very important appointment in relation to the <Col N="652" /> administration of the Land Registry has not been made.  I would ask the Minister, if he is replying to the debate this evening, or to whoever replies on behalf of the Government, to give an assurance to the House that that office will be filled forthwith. Given the procedures for public appointments there is no reason that this post should not be filled by January at the latest.  If that was done it would be a signal both to this House in regard to the frustration which is being expressed by all Members and a signal to the staff in the Land Registry that they are not being forgotten by the Government of the day and the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a major rationalisation and major changes are needed in regard to administration, work and computerisation.  There is no point in having additional staff if land registration will still be carried out under a system which is almost 100 years old.  I urge the Minister to set out a programme of work in relation to computerisation which would speed up the work in the Land Registry.  I would also urge him to look at the lack of requirements which should prevail in land registrations, particularly in relation to building sites.  There may be 300 to 500 houses in an estate and rather than have a single registration for each one there could be a single document used for all of them similar to that used in the registration of cars.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister will take cognisance of the views expressed in the House.  I would certainly welcome a statement to the effect that immediate action will be taken to alleviate some of the very serious problems in the Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks on the Land Registry by stating that the examiners of titles in the Land Registry are among the best and most professional of all the professions.  These people are absolute experts at their work and have given tremendous service over many years.  That point should be noted and acknowledged at the outset.</P>
      <P>We have had serious problems in the Land Registry for some time.  In practice the problem relates to registration of the transfer of parts of folios, with section 49 applications where people apply for registration, and in the issue of Land Registry maps.  Mortgages, if they are affected at all are affected minimally because the practice is to lodge the mortgage deed with the deed of transfer and other documents.  Delays in registration in the Land Registry have a minimal effect on mortgages because of this practice.</P>
      <P>Everybody has to welcome the fact that the Minister has provided for the employment of an additional 33 staff. This is bound to make an impact, which I welcome.  The Land Registry, and the entire concept of land registration should ideally be extended further.  It is fair to say that the Registry of Deeds system is cumbersome and it would be desirable if all cases were dealt with by the Land Registry.  It is many years since a system of compulsory registration was introduced for a small number of counties, and in an ideal situation that should be extended to other counties, and throughout the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is believed that only a title of 40 years standing should be accepted in the <Col N="654" /> Registry of Deeds and I believe this should change.  Solicitors should change their view on this because a title stretching back 20 years is quite sufficient.</P>
    <P>The upturn in the property market has caused difficulties for the Land Registry. The employment of additional staff should go a long way towards solving the problem together with the computerisation of the system which began in the Dublin region in 1982 and was extended to some western counties in 1987.  It is most desirable that this should continue.</P>
    <P>The practice, whereby examiners of title must examine all cases where the transaction involves a consideration of more than £50,000, should be changed and examiners of title should only be called in where the consideration is £100,000 or more.  This would be a welcome change.  Senior examiners of title are not used for administrative purposes at present.  Very often these are the best qualified people in the running of the Land Registry and yet they have no input into land registry management.  It is time the Minister had a close look at this and changed that system in the interest of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two Members present who were here in 1970, when there was another crisis in the Land Registry offices.  At that time it was suggested that the employment of additional draughtsmen would solve the problem for all time.  Unfortunately, most of them were poached by builders in the private sector when they were trained and were paid at a higher rate.  I mention that because I am delighted that the Minister is not appointing anybody to the Land Registry until the system has been reviewed.  There have been nine Governments since 1970 and there have been crises in the Land Registry over that period.  The workload has increased by 20 per cent over the past ten months. We are aware that since 1970 properties farms, shops and houses, are changing hands more frequently.  New houses are being built.  All this causes a blockage in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> I do not agree with Deputy O'Donoghue's suggestion on title.  I have recently come across a number of cases of transfers from the local authorities 20 or 30 years ago and I have found the sites were marked on the wrong place.  In fact they were marked on the wrong side of the ditch so, while they exist physically, they do not exist officially.  I presume that is due to the local input of the legal fraternity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not, but they supervise them when they are finished and they submit them to the Land Registry. Various mistakes have been made over a long time.  However, seeing that the legal profession is represented in force here tonight, I will not upset them, because they are the most touchy body God ever made.  Nobody can examine them, nobody can look at them, they are perfect.</P>
      <P>What worries me is that young people are caught for bridging finance when waiting for the deeds of a house to come through.  If this is extended beyond a certain period it is extremely dangerous for them because the interest on the loan is mounting.  One would imagine from the difficulties people experience in obtaining bridging finance that the banks were not charging interest.  I take this opportunity to condemn the banks for charging extra for bridging facilities. They charge people for whom a house may be the biggest investment they will ever make in their lives over and above the normal lending rates.  They have to pay for the site, build and furnish the house while the banks, adding insult to injury, make a compliment of giving them the loan and charge them extra for doing so.  In the interests of young people who want to own their home I ask the banks publicly to reduce the interest rate on mortgages during the current crisis in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard tonight that a Civil Service <Col N="656" /> union are concerned about the total computerisation of the Land Registry.  It was also suggested that the Land Registry should become a semi-State body.  I for one have doubts about taking the Land Registry from the Department of Justice. There is something about the fact that the Land Registry is in the Department of Justice that gives a certain guarantee that the job will be done properly. However, if it is proved that semi-State is the proper way to do the job, I will accept that.  I ask the Minister not to panic during the interim stage.  I acknowledge that he has appointed 33 extra staff. If there is to be a review of the Land Registry let it be done properly on a once and for all basis to gear us for the year 2200 and not just for this year.  It would be very serious if in 40, 50 or 60 years time somebody looked for their deeds and found they were not properly examined. We all know the consequences of that.</P>
    <P>I would make one plea to the Minister. In local authorities where the matter has been dealt with officially, it should be expedited particularly in view of the fact that the greatest number of cases have been dealt with in the past year.  At least there would be no legal cost in that regard.  I would like to compliment the staff who are doing a good job.  I would rather see a total review of the system now than do anything for short-term gain. We should implement a measure now which would last into the next century. Again, I thank the staff who are doing a tremendous job under pressure in that office.</P>

If you telephone them in an emergency they are always willing to assist you at the drop of <Col N="657" /> a hat.  For Deputy Davern's information, in relation to the county council and the problems that might arise in that area, it has been my experience that grave problems arise because of the drafting of the maps by the county council engineers.</P>

      <P>No, they were not checked by a solicitor; they were sent there directly from the county council housing office.  I am aware of a case at present where, because of an inaccuracy by the local council, two people were registered on each other's plots.  That happens all the time.  The Land Registry have in recent years brought in rules to deal with the rectification of title and they are to be congratulated on that because grave problems arose in that area.</P>
      <P>When the Land Registry was set up in the early sixties it was intended to simplify matters and for a while that did happen, but because of the building boom in the seventies the whole area became a lot more complicated.  Legislation was introduced, such as the Family Home Protection Act and the Family Law Act which achieved a lot, but the Family Home Protection Act in particular led to many problems in the examination of title.  Matters have settled in recent times, but for a long time that Act created grave problems for the Land Registry.  The housing estates which were built in the early seventies have been dealt with and that is one of the reasons there should not be as many delays as there are at present in the Land Registry. All that work has been done and it is now only a matter of a simple transfer of the houses in those estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see provision has been made in the Estimate for an extra 33 staff.  I agree with Deputy Spring that that in itself will not help matters.  It may be of help from an administrative point of view, in getting copy folios and maps, but it may not necessarily cater for the examiner cases, as my colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue stated.  I wonder will <Col N="658" /> these 33 extra staff be qualified in that area.  If not, the log jam will still remain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern referred to the fact that there has been an increase of 21 per cent in the workload in the last year. That is an indication of the upturn in the economy and obviously an effort will have to be made to deal with that increased workload.  In relation to the examiner cases, I suggest that the Minister address the first registration and conversion of title.  Section 64 of the Succession Act provide that on a transmission on death the onus is on the applicant to ensure that everything is right.  In other words, the Registrar of Titles has no responsibility to investigate the title on a transmission on death.  In cases like first registration and conversion of title, I wonder would it be possible to consider putting the onus on the applicant to a greater degree than has been the case up to now.  In these days when the vast majority of the legal profession have professional indemnity insurance, perhaps a greater onus could be put on the applicants. In areas where applications are put in by the legal profession who are not insured or by ordinary individuals, perhaps the Land Registry could demand some sort of a title insurance bond, which is quite frequently used in America.</P>
    <P>Another area which should be looked at is the Land Registry forms.  They have not been changed for a long time, as far as I am aware.  There is a plethora of forms which could be very much simplified and that should be considered when a review is taking place.  Everyone who is involved, or has dealings with the Land Registry will know of the drastic delays in trying to get Land Registry maps which are very badly needed in some cases.  I noticed in recent times that transactions have been held up because the folio in the Land Registry is not readily available.  When someone comes to close a transaction, because the folio is not available from the Land Registry, the whole transaction is held up.  That may not mean much to you or me sitting here, but it could mean a week's delay for people moving into their homes and it could mean somebody being on bridging <Col N="659" /> finance for a lot longer than they anticipated.</P>

      <P>I will wind up and I will give the rest of my time to Deputy Clohessy.  I heard the interview with Mr. O'Dowd and I agree with him.  I am not very happy with the idea of a semi-State corporation even though the Incorporated Law Society have promoted it. A greater emphasis should be placed on the use of the excess income that is generated by the Land Registry.  Perhaps the Department of Justice should put that money back into the Land Registry.  That is a matter that should be considered.</P>

      <P>The present position with regard to the Land Registry is untenable despite the fact that this country is rife with examples of overloaded, inefficient and cumbersome bureaucracies and institutions.  The Land Registry stands out for the appalling condition to which it has deteriorated and the extent to which it is unable to meet the task for which it was set up.  There is crying need for a fundamental review of the institution and for sweeping changes to its structure and the way it operates.  The basic problem with the registry is its total inability to cater for the demands for its services.  We have seen, highlighted in the debate last night and in the media today the extent of this inability.  There are tens of thousands of cases in arrears and years' delay in registering plots of ground and so on.  This is an appalling position for any body but in the case of a body which plays a central role in the business life of this country, it is indefensible. Changes from top to bottom are needed if we are to create the type of <Col N="660" /> enterprise society needs to get this country working and to tackle the acute problems of unemployment and emigration. The changes necessary go beyond getting the economic indicators right.  We need to start getting rid of the bureaucratic red tape which has often needlessly built up to suffocate people's initiative and to re-examine the role the State plays in our business life and on an individual basis to see whether it is to our advantage.</P>
      <P>I believe the Land Registry is one example of the State having an involvement where it is not necessary and which has proved to be inefficient and lacking. The Fine Gael motion argues that the present structure should be replaced by some kind of semi-State body but this raises the question of why the State should have any involvement in the running of the registry.  I urge the Government to seriously examine the possibility of privatising the Land Registry, removing it from public ownership, and placing it entirely under proper supervision. Where a body has failed, as obviously the Land Registry has, we should not try to fiddle around with its relationship with the State but should re-examine the basis for that relationship in the first place. We should judge whether either partner benefits from the relationship and whether the task could not be carried out more effectively and fairly by a private body under proper regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion <Col N="661" /> tabled by the Fine Gael Party on the Land Registry.  I have put down an amendment asking that this debate not be confined solely to the Land Registry but that it cover also its sister and closely related organisation, the Registry of Deeds.  I have been led to understand by the mover of the Fine Gael motion, Deputy O'Keeffe, that that amendment is acceptable and as the Government amendment includes a reference to the Registry of Deeds I presume there will be no difficulties with what I have to say from that side.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this motion, let me say that particular attention must be paid to the very reasoned and detailed case prepared by the Law Society in favour of the establishment of a semi-State authority who would regulate and run in an efficient and profit making basis the two agencies.  I am appalled that the whimper of the Progressive Democrats for privatisation can still be heard, even though they have now been consumed back into their party of creation, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>In reply to the motion the Minister indicated that his biggest difficulty with regard to any proposal to take the Land Registry out of State hands is that if this were to happen he would be faced with the problem of providing adequate security of title, which would emanate from an authority, be it semi-State or otherwise. I would have absolutely no confidence in the private sector taking on the serious, onerous burden of underwriting all titles, handled by that agency, once established. As I said, that whimper can still be heard, however feebly, from Deputy Clohessy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have to say that I am very disappointed with the contributions which have been made from the Government side to this debate.  The motion seeks to address the question of how the Land Registry should be constructed and organised.  It suggests that its status should be changed, that it should no longer be another office within a Department of Government and that it should be established as an efficient semi-State organisation with a proper budget, <Col N="662" /> proper resources and the capacity to reinvest its proceeds with the aim of making the office more efficient in its operations. It is unacceptable that the present position be allowed continue for one moment longer.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of computerisation, we have to look at the overall position and make recommendations. That is what Fine Gael in their motion are seeking to do and that is what the Law Society in their submission tried to do.  That submission has been available to all sides of this House since early this year, yet we have had a procession of Deputies into the House who quite frankly should address the issues much better.  What we are talking about here is a reorganisation of the Land Registry but all we hear is that maybe there is a need to change the form of the Land Registry here or there.</P>
    <P>I am sure also that I heard one Deputy suggest that the Land Registry was established in 1963.  The Land Registry has been in existence since 1891.  It was set up for a particular purpose, in recognition of the changes which were taking place as this country moved towards independence in the title of lands.  In 1963 it was admitted that there was a crisis then and this House was asked to address issues in connection with the running of the Land Registry.  I would like briefly to refer to the contribution made by the Taoiseach, who was Minister for Justice at that time, in which he indicated what needed and should be done.  In saying what he did he underlined the importance of the Land Registry and its sister organisation, the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>Before I do so, I have been reminded that I should have said at the outset that I wish to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Sheehan and three minutes to Deputy Carey, if the House is agreeable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time the Taoiseach highlighted a number of things about the Land Registry which have been <Col N="663" /> completely lost in this debate.  He indicated, as reported at column 1134 of the Official Report of 7 November 1963, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Registration of title is in essence a system of simplified conveyancing. One of its biggest advantages is that the forms used for sales, mortgages and other dealings are readily intelligible to the layman.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of that can be said of the Land Registry today.  Difficulties were created by the legal profession who have not been ready accessories to the simplification of conveyancing during the years and they have not worked to simplify the system.  At the end of the day it may well be that the problem will come back to the Floor of this House but in essence the Land Registry was to have provided a simplified card system when anyone could walk in off the street, look at the index and find out there and then who was the possessor of the title of a particular piece of land.  Such a system is not in place.  The Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Justice, went on to say that &ldquo;the transfer of land becomes, as it should be, a painless, simple and inexpensive process&rdquo;.  He went on to say, from the point of view of the Government, and this is one of the points often missed, that one of the great merits of registration of title is the invaluable assistance it can afford both to central and local authorities in providing a definite basis for taxation and valuation and the operation of a sound system of agricultural credit facilities for the provision and repair of houses and such matters as the administration of planning legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how long has it been since the Land Registry was consulted by central Government or local authorities in connection with any of those functions.  I believe this has never happened and could not be countenanced because of the conditions under which the Land Registry have to operate today.  The <Col N="664" /> Taoiseach went on to say that the encouragement of registration of title is therefore a sound administrative policy.  No one could be encouraged now to consider approaching the Land Registry or to consider transferring title from the Registry of Deeds to the Land Registry.  It is preposterous to believe that there is anything operating in the system to encourage this development.</P>
    <P>In 1963 the Bill then was to impose compulsory registration of title for the first time, to force people to use the Land Registry.  At that time the House was being advised that for the first time we were getting amplification services into the Chamber.  It would appear that progress in the Land Registry has been slow with regard to the improvement of facilities as progress has been here.  Taking Deputy Davern's contribution we are left today with a situation that reappears cyclically every seven to ten years and the Minister on a cyclical basis comes in and says that he will give extra staff and will try to provide extra funds to keep the Land Registry going.</P>
    <P>The provision of extra staff at this stage or the allocation of a better computer system might make the system more efficient in the short term but not in the long term.  We should seriously address what has been proposed in the motion, the simple concept of establishing a semi-State authority.  The importance of such an authority is underlined in the submission of the Law Society that there is a difficulty in staff being assigned through the Department of Justice to the Land Registry in that no sooner than do they develop expertise or a knowledge of the area of work than they are transferred to other sections within that wide ranging section of government so that continuity of expertise is not allowed.  They found also that where there is an issue relating to the allocation of resources, demands from this House and other quarters for allocations to the police service, to the prison service and all the different services that the Department of Justice must look after, rank far greater in priority with the result that yet again the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds must <Col N="665" /> wait.  The Law Society talk about the difficulties in maintaining staff morale and good work practices as a result.</P>
    <P>Lost in this debate is the fact that the Land Registry is a revenue creating agency.  Last year it created a profit approaching £1 million despite all the difficulties and despite the fact that it provides at this stage a poor, unsatisfactory and shoddy service.  That profit can be trebled or quadrupled if not increased tenfold and those moneys can and should be allocated to develop efficiencies and to develop the service, to develop the concept of a one-stop shop where a member of the public who wants to engage in conveyancing and the transfer of title can come to the counter and get this service not just in Dublin but in the regions.  They should be able to go to the counter, deal with an authorised person, indicate the interests of the transaction they are involved in and at the press of the computer entry the title should be changed under proper certification procedures.  Some people including the Law Society and lawyers would say that it is outrageous but that is what we should aim for.  We should work towards the concept of a simplified and inexpensive process.  That is the type of system that exists in the land bank outlets in America where one, in a matter of minutes can have title to land or property transferred by simple recourse to computer entry without the long tedious scrutiny of documents, compilation of deeds and indentures, the lodging of deeds in the Registry of Deeds or with the Land Registry for scrutiny so that ultimately a registered certificate is maintained. Paper itself has a short life compared with what can be done with the use of the computer.  All of this will never happen because no sooner does the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds move in a direction under the aegis of the Department of Justice to improve their facilities than some other section of the Department will say &ldquo;if they have it, we should have it&rdquo; and if the Department of Justice seem to be getting facilities in an over predominant way, another Department in another related area will say &ldquo;if those <Col N="666" /> are the conditions within which my colleagues are working in the public service than I want them for my area as well&rdquo;, and no one can complain.  The problem at the end of the day is that because of huge competing demands on scarce resources which are becoming scarcer because of Government cutbacks, the more the reality faces us that nothing concrete will be done and so we will move from this crisis by a short term injection of cash and resources by way of personnel, on to the next crisis and to the next bottleneck that will emerge in the next five to ten years.  That is not what we should be about.  We should not just introduce a short term initiative and talk about changing forms to make them more simple so that lawyers can understand them better.  We should talk about a system that provides a one stop, over the counter service, relying on up to date technology and facilities available on a regional basis so that people can deal with this whole issue of title and its transfer in a simple, inexpensive and easily managed process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of raising this important matter in an Adjournment debate on Wednesday, 19 July of this year.  I outlined the position of the serious backlog of applications for registration of title and the issuing of Land Registry maps.  I stated that it took two years to register a plot of land and that it took from six to nine months to obtain a land certificate.  That was the first week that Deputy Burke sat in his office as Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications and perhaps he was not aware of the serious situation existing. However I was assured by the Minister that evening on the conclusion of the debate that he would take immediate steps to put extra staff in the Land Registry office to deal with the applications. Four months later nothing has been done and the delays continue.  There is an air of desperation throughout the country. Week after week people are coming to my clinics asking if anything can be done to expedite the issuing of land certificates and Land Registry maps.  People going to <Col N="667" /> the Land Registry office are being told that there is a backlog and that it takes between six and nine months to issue maps and about two years to register a title.  This is despicable under any Minister or any Government.  The time is ripe for common sense to prevail.  When will the Minister wipe out the backlog of 49,000 applications in the Department? Actions speak louder than words.  The Minister should get going immediately and try to clear this backlog.  It is shocking to think that young farmers are held up in receiving the farm installation grants because they cannot produce the title to their farms which were handed over, perhaps two years earlier, by their parents.  Surely this is not progress.  It is not good enough that people buying council houses cannot get their deeds. Local authorities all over the country have the same story as that of ordinary citizens.  Nothing has been done about this problem in the past number of years.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this business of converting the Land Registry into a semi-State corporation would be self financing.  Approximately £7 million per year is paid through the Land Registry to the Department of Justice for land registry business by our citizens.  That sum would run a very big efficient outlet.  I do not blame the staff working in the Land Registry who are great to have put up with all the criticism that has been levelled against them over the past few years.  What is happening is due to the embargo on employment in the Department. Let us lift this embargo immediately. Let us computerise the Land Registry and give it sufficient staff to deal with the backlog of 49,000 applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister has better sense than to come into the House and say that the matter is under review four months after stating to the House that as an interim measure a number of clerical staff were being assigned immediately to the Land Registry office to try to improve the situation; that the Department were having discussions with the Department <Col N="668" /> of Finance concerning the urgent provision of further additional staff for the Land Registry; that the computerisation programme was in operation, and that further progress would be made in the near future?  That is what the Minister said four months ago.  Last night we heard the same &mdash; he is going to bring in staff. When is he going to do the job?  It is high time the Minister copped himself on and stopped trying to cod not alone himself and the Land Registry office but the whole country, the people whose applications for title registrations are being frustrated.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful state of affairs.  I call on the Minister here and now to take immediate steps to meet the demands in the Private Members' Motion tabled by my colleague Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. If the Minister does that he will be taking a step in the right direction to eradicate the backlog of applications.</P>
    <P>Coming from a disadvantaged area, I know only too well the serious problems that exist in regard to mountain commonages from Mizen Head to Malin Head.  What are the Minister and his Department doing to expedite the registration of such mountain commonages? Bovine animals are intermingling, risking the spread of TB at an alarming rate. This is a shocking state of affairs and the sooner it is remedied the better.  Let the Minister of State tell his boss, the Minister for Justice, that what we want is action, not pious platitudes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the generosity of Deputy McCartan in giving me some of his time.  I joined in the motion last July to ask the Minister to make some effort to reduce the backlog in the Land Registry.  These delays are unseemly.  People are left with an impression of great inefficiency when they cannot get their land transferred. One case I had to deal with in my office in the last few days concerned a small cottage the sale of which has not been executed in four years because the solicitor is having great difficulty getting all the elements organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's motion aims at <Col N="669" /> trying to establish an efficient area in the Land Registry.  The Land Registry has been inhibited by the Civil Service embargo.  Over 120 jobs have been lost in the Land Registry since that embargo came into effect; job numbers went down from 510 to 390.  Senior people were not replaced over long periods.  The Minister made excuses and told us he would have these officers replaced, but he said nothing about that in his speech last night.  All he said was that it was being reviewed.  That is not good enough.  It is a black mark against the institution of Dáil Éireann that we cannot even properly order the affairs of the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I had a question on the Order Paper a couple of days ago about one transfer that is being held up in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I got a reply acknowledging receipt of the application for this vesting order and informing me that they did not know when a decision would be reached.  This has been going on for five years, and they still do not know.  I have been in communication with the Department of Agriculture and Food but it seems that all the officers there go into hiding. What is going on in some Departments at present is intolerable.  I investigated the position in the Department of Agriculture and Food and I have been told that there are no people working in the vesting section.  I am quite certain it is the same in the Land Registry.  I appeal to the better judgement of the Minister and ask him to reconsider this review and act immediately on the motion proposed by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for tabling this very relevant motion.  Many people across the country are extremely affected by the problems in the Land Registry where there is a backlog of 49,000 cases.  This means that it will take one to two years before a land certificate will issue.  That very serious delay will put many people in serious financial difficulty.  Somebody in the process of purchasing a house could be on bridging finance for anything up to two <Col N="670" /> years and the cost of that is phenomenal and puts great strain on the purchasers, particularly young married people.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are having farms transferred find that they are not in a position to do developmental work until they have the land certificate in their name because until this has been done they cannot raise the necessary finance.  This is stifling development in the agricultural area.  The development of small business is also being stifled as a result of land certificates not being issued.  Those who want a plot transferred in order to build have the same difficulty.</P>
      <P>The overall result is that all the economy is being stifled particularly in the building, agricultural and small businesses sectors.  That is very serious for the economy particularly when there are so many people unemployed and so many thousands are emigrating.  We have this system glueing up the process and making things much more difficult, and in despair some people are deciding to get out of the country and go elsewhere.  It is unfortunate that this situation has been allowed to develop particularly when, with a bit of common sense and ingenuity, matters could be rectified.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe already stated, it would be a fairly simple process to computerise the transactions, maps and so on.  Now that many of the maps are disintegrating because of their age there is a need for something to be done. Indeed, there is a need to do something about the basic problem of having a map issued because the delay in issuing a map from the Land Registry can be considerable.</P>
      <P>The Registrar retired last year and he has not been replaced.  Why have the Government not acted in this?  In all my dealings with the staff there I find them extremely courteous and helpful but there is a problem in that there is no overall, proper management there.  The whole affair of the Land Registry could be very easily sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for promoting the idea of having the Land Registry turned into <Col N="671" /> a semi-State body.  This should be considered seriously.  As a semi-State body they could be properly computerised and managed and be self-financing.  Most people would be prepared to pay considerably more than they are paying at the moment to get early registration. With the money they pay at the moment while not securing registration, and the havoc that is creating for many of them, an increase in registration fees would be a very small hindrance compared with the hindrances they are now experiencing. There is an onus on this House and on the Minister to act.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a promise in this House last July and I am amazed therefore that something positive has not been done.  Day after day and week after week I come across cases in my constituency of people being seriously inconvenienced as a result of the problems in the Land Registry.  Many people are under terrible financial strain.  This is unsatisfactory and unacceptable, particularly when there is a way out and a way of accommodating these people.  I urge the Minister here tonight in this House to do something immediately to ensure that the backlog of 49,000 cases existing at the moment is tackled quickly with the object of relieving many people who are affected by it. This House should not tolerate that.</P>

      <P>The Land Registry should have more autonomy as set out by Deputy O'Keeffe.  They should not be tied so much to the Department of Justice.  For example, at the moment I understand all equipment required by the Land Registry, photocopiers, computers, etc., have to be cleared by the Department of Justice and then by the Department of Finance before it can be purchased.  This takes up unnecessary <Col N="672" /> time and money and does not facilitate efficiency.</P>
      <P>Since 1983 the staffing level in the Land Registry has decreased by 130.  Prior to the Civil Service embargo the Land Registry had 520 staff; now they have 390, although the workload and throughput in that period have increased by more than 25 per cent.  I welcome the Minister's announcement tonight that 33 extra staff will be added to the existing staff.  This could help to overcome the backlog of cases.  If we want a better service from the Land Registry we must provide extra personnel for them.</P>
      <P>We should examine the fee structure existing at the moment in the Land Registry. The maximum fee is £200 for any transaction over £30,000.  This means transactions involving millions of pounds, which take up vast amounts of the time of senior examiners, cost the same as the registration of a house costing £35,000, which takes about five minutes to complete. This is totally unfair.  The present fee structure penalises people who cannot afford it and those who can pay are not paying accordingly.  Fees should be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis as in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and other speakers have made the point, with which I agree, that all existing data and information in the Land Registry should be computerised. This has been done for Dublin; it must be done for the rest of the country. Mapping should also be computerised. The public could have access to some of these data.  This again would be of great assistance to the public and to solicitors seeking information.  I see no reason why this should not be technologically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delays at the moment which occur through no fault of the people working in the Land Registry are causing considerable distress for many people who are on bridging loans, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn mentioned.  This is a source of deep frustration and anguish for many young couples, for example.  The problem must be faced now rather than later. This motion presents a plausible solution <Col N="673" /> and I urge the Minister and the Government to give it due consideration and to accept the recommendations contained in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Deputies who have contributed to this motion indicating intense interest in the subject of the motion and an acknowledgment of the crisis that clearly exists in the Land Registry.  I have to say that the reply to the motion by the Minister for Justice was utterly unconvincing.  He accepts fully the point made in the motion that the appalling delays in the Land Registry are unacceptable, yet his own amendment to the motion provides for the removal of that section of the motion which provides that Dáil Éireann deplores these enormous delays and the deteriorating position in the Land Registry. With respect, let me say that does not make sense.  The Minister has acknowledged the delays and clearly accepts there is a deteriorating position yet his amendment seeks to remove that part of the motion.  Why?  Every speaker in this House, whether on the Government side or the Opposition side, has repeatedly stressed and acknowledged the appalling situation in the Land Registry. There may be some difference of opinion as to the solution, but it is right and proper that a view which is clearly accepted on all sides in this House should stand in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states he is carrying out an urgent review of the operations of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. This urgent review was announced four months ago, but we have no evidence whatever of the action being taken, certainly no action of consequence.  In some ways it is like Nero fiddling while Rome burned.  The Minister stated that as part of the process of review he visited the Land Registry office in the Setanta Centre and had discussions with the personnel involved with the object of obtaining their views.  Anybody who knows anything about the Land Registry must know that the Setanta Centre office is but a small out-office of the Land Registry operation which is centred in the Four <Col N="674" /> Courts complex in Chancery Street.  It might have been more convincing if the Minister had given some indication that he had visited the Land Registry head office rather than that small portion thereof which, let us be fair, is about the only modern part of the Land Registry system.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that requests for copy folios and instruments can be dealt with very speedily.  I am advised that in many instances people wait up to three months before they receive them. If this is an indication of the Minister's perception as to what constitutes an efficient Land Registry operation I have very little confidence in his ability to put in place the structures needed very urgently for a total, radical overhaul of the entire system.  The Minister uses the excuse that the establishment of a semi-State corporation would require legislation and that this would cause delay.  I accept that it would take some months to prepare the legislation.  Of course, it has taken four months since the Minister announced the urgent review.  There was no reason, in the meantime, why preliminary steps could not have been taken in regard to such legislation.  If that has not been done there is no reason the steps should not be taken straight away.</P>
    <P>The Minister has conceded that there are precedents for such legislation, not least in the Coillte Teoranta Bill, which the Minister in a previous manifestation put through this House.  I accept that the legislation would take some time, that the democratic process should be followed and that we should debate it here in the House.  I do not believe that the delay in putting through the legislation should be used as an excuse for taking the step which I have proposed in the motion.  The establishment of a semi-State corporation could be announced here and now and the cosequential steps that are necessary, from the point of view of legislation and otherwise, could be put in place in the coming months.</P>
    <P>So far as accommodation is concerned, the Minister used what I can only refer to as the usual Civil Service clap trap, that the accommodation needs are kept <Col N="675" /> under constant review.  I have seen that expression so often in ministerial speeches that I can only hope that the Minister's urgent review is more effective than the constant review to which he refers when he deals with accommodation. We all know that very often this phraseology is an excuse for a doing nothing policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of staffing and stated that it was his intention to tackle the problem in the Land Registry by relieving the immediate arrears difficulty.  The figures which he mentioned for staffing do not lend any confidence that there will be any improvement.  In relation to arrears, he mentioned the sanction of 33 additional staff for the current year.  However, taking into account resignations and retirements the net increase is now only two.  On this basis, the provision in the estimate for 1990 of 33 staff will leave the Land Registry without any net increase if the same picture emerges for natural wastage and resignations.  I am afraid that resignation is a matter which has to be taken into account for what is a totally demoralised and frustrated workforce.  In any event, the provision of a few extra staff will not relieve the problem which has far deeper roots.</P>
    <P>The Minister uses the excuse of the urgent review announced in July for the failure to appoint a Registrar of Titles. I would say that this excuse is entirely unconvincing.  The post became vacant on the retirement of the last Registrar a year ago.  The review was not even announced until July.  I am not sure what significance can be read into the fact that the Minister, Deputy Burke, did not trouble himself to provide any explanation or excuse for his predecessor for failure to move on this issue for several months.  Why does the Minister not have an open competition now and appoint a Chief Executive?  If he moves in the direction I propose he will have a Chief Executive appointed by open competition, He will have somebody with the kind of managerial skills that are needed to rescue the Land Registry from the <Col N="676" /> devastated position into which it has fallen.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to computerisation, the Minister is entirely unconvincing.  He has not faced the fact that virtually no progress has been made in recent times nor has he outlined how there is to be any progress in the future following the resignation of the computer expert at the end of October.  The trade union delegate today, speaking on RTÉ, strongly supported the case for computerisation. Yet, when we look at the 1990 Estimate we see an increase in the order of £100,000.  The money is there. Why is a proper programme not put in place?</P>
    <P>Generally, the figures given by the Minister in relation to delays are very interesting.  It is important for the Minister to note that with an arrears figure of 30,000 in October 1985, that figure had increased by no more than 2,000 in the three years up to 1 January 1989 when the figure totalled 32,000.  It was a difficult positon but it was not considered a crisis, yet, on his own admission, nine months later, by the beginning of October that figure had increased to 47,448 for the current year.  Even the figures given last night by the Minister were out of date because by the end of October &mdash; apparently this has not been drawn to his attention &mdash; the figure had risen again to 49,000.  At that rate of deterioration the Land Registry will be in total chaos by the time we reach the new year.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances it is impossible to accept the alleged urgency of the review being carried out by the Minister or to have any confidence that it will result in the bringing about of substantial improvements in the level of service provided by the Land Registry.  It is now 12 months since the Law Society presented to the Government a well-researched and well-argued proposal calling for the establishment of the Land Registry, including the Registry of Deeds, as a business orientated semi-State corporation. Nothing of any consequence has occured in the meantime except that the arrears position in the Land Registry <Col N="677" /> has deteriorated in that year by a further 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this appalling situation are now well documented.  The impact of such outrageous delays on the economy are very clear.  The effect on economic activity and job creation is obvious.  There is not a solicitor in the country who has not complained on behalf of his clients about the present position.  The effect on those who want to make investment decisions, who want to purchase lands for forestry purposes, or who want to establish or expand business is clear.  On a personal level, poor unfortunate people groaning under the burden of bridging finance must get relief.  There are many young farmers throughout the country who cannot get their installation grants because they cannot produce their titles, through no fault of their own, to claim them.  The Minister admits that there are many thousands suffering from hardship.  The time for talking is over.  The time for action is now.  The solution is clear.  The Minister should announce, this very night, that he is prepared to take the necessary decisive action and confirm that he is putting in hand the drafting of the necessary legislation to establish the Land Registry as an efficient business orientated semi-State corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that it was his intention to tackle this problem by relieving the immediate arrears difficulties. He did not say how, but said he would do it within a structure which, in the future, would be able to respond speedily and efficiently to the demands. I suggest to the Minister that he resist the Civil Service solution that will be offered. If the Civil Service do not keep total control over the position the next step will be the executive office which provides much the same element of control. Now we have the Department of Justice <Col N="678" /> and the Department of Finance in charge of every decision that has to be made in the Land Registry.  The position would not be a whole lot different with an executive office.  If I can look into the minds of the Civil Service advisers, I have not the slightest doubt that if they have to change that will be the hard step they will suggest. I strongly advise the Minister not to fall for it.  The solution is clear.  We have the precedents in Coillte Teoranta.  An Post and in Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that if they finally agree that movement is necessary that will be the step they will be urging the Minister to take.  I am telling him here and now to resist that step because it will not solve the problem.  Finally, I want to make it clear that I have no difficulty whatever with the amendment from The Workers' Party which wants to ensure that the Registry of Deeds is included in the motion.  In fact, that was my intention and I have no difficulty with it.  Neither have I any difficulty with the addendum proposed by the Labour Party.  I suggest, therefore, that the Government should face the situation squarely and accept not just the appalling position that exists in the Land Registry but the sensible proposal, originally coming from the Law Society, which was well researched and documented and is now proposed to this House.  The proper course for the Government is to accept the Fine Gael motion and the proper course for that part of the Government represented by the Progressive Democrats, who wanted to go beyond what I am proposing and privatise the Land Registry, is at least to support the establishment of a semi-State corporation.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1989. - Vote 42: Health.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £32,898,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1989, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig and Ard-Chlár-aitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The original net Vote for Health for 1989 was £1,144.905 million, including a capital provision of £35,000,000.  This is a very significant provision, representing almost 20 per cent of total State spending on services and should lay to rest the perception that pervades the environment that good health services are not available to the population.  This perception could not be further from the truth.  We have an excellent service with essential treatment at the highest level available on demand and most elective treatment available within a reasonable timeframe.  Over one million people have at their disposal, without charge, a comprehensive general practitioner and medicines service.  Over 500,000 in-patients pass through the acute hospital system in a year getting the most sophisticated high technology services up to and including transplant.  Over 1,500,000 out-patient attendances are serviced each year.  Over 5,000 orthodontic cases are carried out and over £130 million is spent on our services for the mentally handicapped. These are not features of a negligible service, as some would have it. Rather they are features of a first rate service provided by dedicated competent people and in a most caring way.</P>
      <P>The movement of this supplementary sum is a sign of the Government's commitment to the maintenance of this service and to the provision of funds for its improvements in specific areas and in a prioritised way as funds allow.  Specifically it provides £15 million for the cost of improved acute hospital services including improvements in the sectoral accident and emergency services in Dublin; £25 million being the additional cash requirements of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board due to, <i>inter alia</i>, the delay in the introduction of the new GMS contract and the once-off additional cost of two months' doctors fees.  It also provides £8 million being the cost of additional expenditure on demand-led schemes such as the drug refund scheme, the disabled persons' maintenance allowance scheme, the cost of the measles, mumps and rubella campaign and the hepatitis immunisation programme. It also provides £2.1 million for the cost of discharging liabilities associated with the winding up of the Hospitals Joint Services Board; £300,000 for the cost of additional expenditure on orthodontic services; a figure of £5 million to cover the cost of additional expenditure on capital services; a figure of £1 million to cover the cost of a special health cash allowances bonus payment, less £23.5 million additional Appropriations-in-Aid; less the token Supplementary Estimate taken earlier this year amounting to £2,000, leaving us now with a net Supplementary Estimate of £32.898 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Estimates statement to the House in July last I pointed out that the health services over recent years had seen <Col N="683" /> a number of developments which indicated that, while the services were generally successful in meeting demand, difficulties arose in some specific areas due to a number of factors.  These factors included changes in the investigation and treatment of patients.  I do not have to tell the House about the level of high technology available to patients at present or indeed the new developments coming on stream on a regular basis. Other facets of these difficulties were increased day surgery activity, the changing demographic picture and the major challenge of AIDS, a condition which, as the House knows, is increasing, is a very serious public health issue, constituting a major challenge to our services with the number of patients suffering from AIDS doubling every ten months.  Unfortunately, this is something that will continue for a few more years.</P>
    <P>To relieve all of these pressures the Government decided to approve the use of an additional £15 million for the general hospital sector.  Those £15 million were allocated as follows.  First, a figure of £1.5 million for the introduction of sectoral and accident and emergency services in the Eastern Health Board area. That included the opening of the six hospital accident and emergency departments in this city on a 24-hour basis, whereas formerly there had been a rota over the past 12 to 15 years between the three hospitals on the north side and the three on the south side.  That allocation also included a figure of £1.7 million for operations this year to reduce waiting lists, particularly for ear, nose and throat complaints and hip replacements.  I am glad to say that we are seeing the waiting lists being reduced.  We will not be able to reduce them all this year but we shall continue to do so next year.  Hopefully we will be able to bring the various waiting lists into line.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be no harm to mention to the House a few specific procedures. The question was raised earlier today at Question Time of the number of patients on waiting lists for some specific procedures.  For example, there are some <Col N="684" /> 3,374 patients awaiting cataract removals; for hip replacements, there are 1,993; for heart surgery, 675, and in respect of glue ears there are 1,810.  It is important to remember that these figures must be treated with caution in view of our experiences in Temple Street Hospital and with the Midland Health Board. For example, in Temple Street Hospital a consultant was appointed to carry out a review of all patients on the waiting list.  To date, 171 patients have got an appointment, three telephoned to say they were not coming, 58 did not attend and 110 attended.  Of those 110, it was found that 19 no longer needed a service. Therefore, it will be readily seen that approximately half the patients on the waiting lists did not need a service.  That was the ear, nose and throat service in Temple Street Hospital.  Despite that, the in-patient waiting list at that hospital has been reduced by some 200 since August last as a result of the intervention.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar position obtained in the Midland Health Board area when 470 patients were transferred to the Midland Health Board from the Royal Eye and Ear Hospital who had been on the waiting list.  The Midland Health Board decided to contact each of those patients asking them whether they wished to continue their treatment.  Thirty-six patients replied saying that treatment was not required and 73 did not reply at all.  That reduces the figure from 470 to 361 in respect of the number of patients awaiting surgery.  Of course, when examined, it may be that some of those patients will not need treatment either.  That was my purpose in pointing out that we must treat such lists with caution.</P>
    <P>Again, of that allocation of £15 million, £9 million is being provided to cover the cessation of bed closures, the restoration of beds, the opening of additional beds and a figure of £2.8 million for the acceleration of planned opening of new beds, including the purchase of new equipment.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £25 million in respect of the GMS is being sought on foot of a number of factors. Firstly, the GMS is a demand-led <Col N="685" /> scheme.  The cost of meeting patients' statutory entitlements is determined by the numbers eligible, the level of illness and the nature and extent of treatment provided by GPs.  One of the principal advantages of the new GMS contract is that it introduces a greater degree of certainty into the forecasting of costs.</P>
    <P>The new contract came into effect by 1 April last for the vast majority of GMS doctors.  This was later than had been hoped for.  As a result, there were a number of teething problems associated with the introduction of the new scheme, due in part to uncertainty as to when it would, in fact, come into operation.  This delay has led to some increase in the original forecast of costs.</P>
    <P>A second factor underlying this Supplementary Estimate is the once-off cost of introducing the new contract.  As Deputies may be aware, payment of fees under the old GMS contract was made two months in arrears, due to the need for checking and calculation of claims. Payment of capitation is made on a current month basis.  In terminating the old contract there was, therefore, a once-off additional expenditure of two months' doctors fees.</P>
    <P>The third factor which has affected the 1989 cost of the GMS has been a significant increase in drug prices.  The vast majority of our drugs are imported from Britain.  Price levels there have increased significantly and this has affected our drug costs here.  Under an agreement between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, there is a strict control on the prices charged for drugs here relative to their UK price.  As part of that agreement there was, in addition, an 18-month price freeze which terminated last October. The recent increases in UK prices have significantly increased the drug Bill, both in the GMS and in the drug schemes operated by health boards.</P>
    <P>While the agreement with the FICI proved a useful means of capping drug prices here relative to the UK, I believe that it is time to consider alternative strategies to reduce drug costs.  I have given 12 months' notice to FICI under the <Col N="686" /> terms of the agreement and I am having a detailed examination carried out on all of the alternative options to such an agreement as a matter of urgency.  I would expect that negotiations with all of the affected parties to any new arrangements on drug purchasing would commence early in the new year.</P>
    <P>An amount of £8 million is included in the Supplementary Estimate to meet the cost of certain demand led drug schemes. Specifically £4.5 million is included to meet the additional cost of the drugs refund scheme.  This requirement has arisen due to an increase in drug prices and to an increase in the number of claims.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2.5 million is included to meet the cost of the MMR programme and the cost of immunising high risk health service employees against hepatitis B and £1.5 million is included to meet the cost of an increase in recipients of the disabled persons' maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>I have recently reviewed the operation of the community drugs schemes for which my Department are responsible.  I am concerned that there may be some hardship in relation to the existing drug refund scheme whereby people must pay the full retail price of required drugs and await subsequent reimbursement some weeks later.  I hope to introduce the new scheme shortly.  We are finalising negotiations with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union whereby patients will not have to pay in excess of £28 per month for their drugs and then have to wait some months to be reimbursed.</P>
    <P>The Hospital Joint Services Board were set up under the Corporate Bodies Act, 1961, to provide central laundry and sterile supplies to hospitals.  Over the years there were some difficulties, including financial ones, and the board decided to sell their assets as a going concern by public tender.  This was done and the residual debt of the board after the sale was £2.1 million which is provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that in 1981 I established a small working group under the chairmanship of the then Minister of <Col N="687" /> State, Deputy Terry Leyden, to review the delivery of the dental services.  The working group concluded that there were many difficulties in the dental services area.  As a result we decided in the current year to provide £300,000 to ensure that 500 top priority patients in the eight health boards would receive orthodontic treatment.  We intend to continue this scheme to ensure that an adequate and proper dental scheme is provided for people.</P>
    <P>The water flouridation programme continues to expand and to bring the benefits of a flouridated water supply to an increasing percentage of our population.</P>
    <P>As part of the Supplementary Estimate I am seeking an additional £5 million for the capital programme.  The need for this extra provision has arisen for a number of reasons.  Many of the projects in the health capital programme involve payments over a number of years and some of these liabilities are maturing for payment in 1989 at a faster rate than was originally envisaged.  In addition, considerable capital expenditure has had to be incurred this year on the replacement of hospital equipment in emergency situations and in doing necessary fire precautions work.</P>
    <P>The need for this expenditure cannot always be anticipated but it is vital for patient safety that equipment is replaced when it becomes unserviceable and that hospital buildings are maintained to the highest safety standards.</P>
    <P>It has also been necessary to accelerate the programme of computerising systems in the health services and this has meant setting aside a bigger than normal component of our total capital resources for this purpose.</P>
    <P>An additional yield of £8 million from health contributions has arisen in line with the general buoyancy in income related revenue and the receipts under EC Regulations will now be £15.5 million over and above the original forecast.</P>
    <P>These latter receipts represent the reimbursement by the UK authorities of the cost of health services provided in Ireland to UK social security pensioners, <Col N="688" /> to dependants of Irish migrant workers and to temporary visitors from the UK.</P>
    <P>The gross amount necessary to cater for these increases has been reduced by the £23.5 million additional appro-priations-in-aid. Specifically the main reason for this increase is that the final accounts for both 1985 and 1986 were in fact settled and paid by the UK authorities in the course of the year and that currency rates were more favourable than expected.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will be voting against this Supplementary Health Estimate because it does not address a number of the crucial areas in which public patients are suffering under the present régime of the Minister for Health.  I want to refer to one titbit I read in Back Chat in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the week before last which said that the Progressive Democrats were particularly delighted at the extra cash boost for the health services over and above £15 million and that Fianna Fáil had recognised the difficulties in the health services.</P>
      <P>What is being provided for in this Supplementary Estimate is the same service which is costing more than was anticipated. There has been a £25 million over-run in expenditure in the medical card service and a £8 million overrun in demand led schemes such as the drug refund scheme.  That comes to £33 million and if we add £9 million of the £15 million which was to deal with waiting lists &mdash; on the Minister's admission tonight this £9 million was simply to prevent the closure of wards and beds in hospitals during the summer &mdash; this gives us £42 million.  This is more than the total Estimate and is being provided to shore up a shabby 1989 Estimate.  Not one person will be eligible for a better service, there will be no better access to services, there will be no improvements in services and none of the needs in the health service which we on this side of the House identified during the past two years have been met in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling that the Minister has <Col N="689" /> forgotten the commitment he gave in this House during a Private Members' debate when the VHI refund scheme was precipitously abandoned.  The Minister promised that he would have a drug subsidy scheme in place by August so that people could go into their chemists and be assured they would not have to pay over £28 per month for their drugs.  Since then we have heard that this proposal is under discussion, it is imminent and is being given further consideration.  In the meantime people with long-term illnesses, kidney sufferers, those suffering from hypertension and those with incurable illnesses are suffering great hardship.  These people require heavy medication but no relief will be forthcoming for them this year despite a solemn commitment given to this House by the Minister that this scheme would be introduced by August.</P>
    <P>The Minister is starting to play a very dangerous game in relation to waiting lists.  He is starting to pick holes in his own figures.  He said Temple Street Hospital or the Midland Health Board have waiting lists but when they went through them some people did not turn up and others did not want the treatment, but he forgot all the waiting lists for out-patient clinics.  If I require a routine tonsillectomy I will have to wait a year and a half to see the ENT surgeon at an out-patient clinic, and if he decides I need to have the operation I will have to wait another year and a half.  The Minister is referring only to the second half of the waiting list &mdash; to those people who have been approved for treatment and who are awaiting it.  Only last night a GP phoned me about Ardkeen Hospital.  One of his patients, having waited a year to see the ENT consultant, was told it will be a further year and a half before the operation can be carried out.  All the waiting lists can be doubled because of the numbers waiting to see consultants at out-patient clinics.</P>
    <P>My information from the Eye and Ear Hospital is that pensioners are going clinically blind while waiting for cataract operations.  The timing of these operations is vital but these people cannot <Col N="690" /> get the treatment they need.  There is a variation in the waiting lists for hip operations within counties in the health board areas.  Within the South-Eastern Health Board patients from County Wexford have to wait longer than patients from County Waterford or County Tipperary, because there is more demand on certain consultants.  A four year waiting list is still a reality for people hobbling around in excruciating pain with the support of walking aids and rollaters and who cannot sleep at night because the hip operations are not available to them.  This is the reality of the situation.  The other day an ENT consultant contacted me about a referral he had made for a cancer patient to St. Luke's and St. Anne's for radium therapy treatment.  The delay for people who have no accommodation in Dublin and have to stay overnight in hospital is four to six weeks.  Any oncology expert will tell you that that period can be critical to the survival of the patient. I was through that hospital very recently and it was harrowing to go through a 36 bed ward and see nothing but bare mattresses.  The way to get the waiting list down is by opening these wards and not by picking holes in statistics in the House tonight.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing and will do in the 1990 Estimate is to provide more money without ensuring that more people will be treated.  There is no limit to the money the health services can swallow up.  Earlier today we were told that the country's largest hospital sent home cancer and other patients because the very thing I feared when changes were made in the accident and emergency admissions, that there would not be an adequate bed requirement, has come to pass.  People will be shuffled out of day beds and elective beds to make way for accident and emergency patients.  The Minister had not thought out the accident and emergency service and thus made adequate bed provision.  In the six hospitals where the new procedures have been introduced the situation has got worse instead of better.  Catchment areas for each hospital were not put in place. The same tests are being done in different <Col N="691" /> hospitals on the same patient.  More senior doctors need to be put in place in casualty and accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of drugs.  Drugs are costing us £200 million a year between hospital drugs, the drug refund scheme and the GMS drug scheme.  I cannot understand why we persist with an argument that is linked to UK prices plus 4 per cent, when prices in the United Kingdom are some of the highest in Europe, when we import 95 per cent of our drugs and when a stipulation of the agreement is that we cannot have any system that insists on using generic drugs. A generic drug is not a thrift or yellow pack drug.  It is produced under licence, under the approval of the National Drugs Advisory Board to produce not a similar drug but the identical medical compound that cannot be superior or inferior to the branded product.  It is the very same item at a fraction of the cost.  We are told there is no money for the dental service and there is no money for adult mentally handicapped services.  Why are we persisting with an agreement that is costing £20 million too much?  The health commission report clearly outlines and puts down in black and white what needs to be done, but still we persist with this agreement.  A 10 per cent saving on our drug bill amounts to £20 million.  Such a sum of money could do much for our health services.</P>
    <P>None of the major issues in the health services has been addressed.  I will not labour on the dental service because we have gone over and over it during Private Members' time and Question Time in this House.  There are 24,000 people waiting for the orthodontic service.  Under the guidelines in operation two-thirds of those people will not be seen at all throughout their school life.  There is no dental service for adult medical card holders, who are eligible under section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, and have a legal right to this service.  There is no attempt to introduce a referral system as was there since 1979.</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings with the aged <Col N="692" /> parents of adult mentally handicapped persons and they are in the most considerable anguish because they are unable to mind their 30 year and 40 year old mentally handicapped sons and daughters.  They will have no one to mind them when their parents die and we need to provide adult residential places on a planned basis through the country.  Their elderly parents go to the grave with the anxiety and misery of not knowing what will happen to their children, after giving a lifetime of care to them.  Brothers and sisters and first cousins will not provide the same level of care for these people. We have no national plan to provide facilities for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Bill is before a special committee of this House, yet programme managers have not been put in place to establish referral centres or establish liaison with the school attendance officers and the juvenile justice system or to ensure that there are an adequate number of social workers to deal with the bare minimum legal requirements of access by parents to their children in foster or residential care.</P>
    <P>The rate of increase in the number of patients contracting AIDS is doubling every seven months.  No provision is being made for this catastrophe of epidemic proportions.  According to the Department we have an AIDS epidemic and there is no plan forthcoming to deal with the special needs of AIDS patients in relation to their mobility, their loss of earnings, heating allowances, not to speak of providing a long-term illness card as they deteriorate.  These are pressing health problems.</P>
    <P>A very fine report was produced by a working group on the care of the elderly. It clearly outlined the need to build up services to cater for the 7 per cent increase in the elderly population between now and the turn of the century to ensure that they have sheltered housing and that they have proper access to all the facilities, such as meals on wheels, a central location to churches and proper security systems.  All it would need is a <Col N="693" /> little bit of planning with the local authorities to put it together.  Nothing is happening on the ground and in a few years we will have a crisis in geriatric care.  At present subventions to nursing homes are paid on a stop-go basis, and it varies from one health board to another whether a subvention is paid or not.</P>
    <P>This is a very confined and limited debate and it is not possible for me to go through each and every one of the complaints we have received.  We have seen that this Government and the previous Government have the ability to set up commissions, committees, be they <i>ad hoc,</i> working party or consultative bodies.  We wait patiently for their reports and when our hopes are raised by good reports we find there is no response to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go on in this way.  More money is necessary &mdash; it annoys me that more money is going to provide more of the same and not improve the health services.  No attempt has been made to get proper accountability in our health services.  No attempt has been made to implement the decisions of the Committee on Health Funding.  The health boards, and the fact that some hospitals are funded directly by the Department of Health while others are funded through health boards, are not the most efficient system.  We have scores of voluntary organisations all operating in a different way.  I do not believe the Department of Health are capable of dealing with the different aspects of delivery of the health care system that are necessary.  We need major structural reform because the nature of medical technology is that the same service will cost more.  It will cost more to provide the same health service because of the demographic structure of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are real limitations to what we can spend on health.  It is not enough <Col N="694" /> for the Minister to mark time.  It is not enough to have a fire brigade response to deal with services on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, to put out the bush fire of hip replacements thus causing problems on the elective orthopaedic waiting lists.  Orthopaedic surgeons have told me that they were interviewed by Department of Health personnel looking for a breakdown and details not of their management of overall trauma cases but just on hip replacement operations.  One cannot pick out one segment and just deal with it.  We have no hospital plan.  We have no basis on which to allocate national or regional specialities, let alone speak about enforcing catchment areas.  We cannot defer the major decisions that have to be taken on the health services.  This side of the House will co-operate if those issues are confronted. This together with skillful spending of resources is the way to deal with the problems of patients.</P>
    <P>The reason we are voting against this Supplementary Estimate tonight is that this is not a cash boost to the health service.  It is a sham.  It is a shoring up of a very faulty 1989 Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>For three years, through three budgets and three Estimates I have striven to the best of my ability to underscore to the Minister during two administrations the crisis that he has brought about week in and week out at every level in the health services.  For three years the same Minister said it was not about resources; it was not about money but about management and organisation, about anything but the things for which he had responsibility.  Repeatedly for those three years we were assured that adequate money was being provided and that if it could only be managed properly at board level or hospital level, if we had better administrators, all would be well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken a general election to bring about a partial conversion.  We now have Fine Gael on our side.  It has dawned on them that it was not about shifting around or sacking a few administrators, which was for a while the tonic they had peddled, but that it was about funding a proper health service that a civilised <Col N="695" /> society demands at the closing of the 20th century.  Hype has been created by the Minister in recent days or by those who surround him that suddenly the crisis has been recognised.  The Taoiseach looked into his heart on a radio programme during the election campaign; nobody had told him about the crisis.  Obviously the discussions at the Cabinet table had never focused on the calamity that was facing the health services, but when the Fianna Fáil Party had started knocking on doors the Taoiseach had become aware of it and when he was returned to power he was going to do something about it.</P>
    <P>What has he done about it?  Have the waiting lists been reduced since he came back to office and since this Minister was reappointed?  Has he taken charge to structurally change the health services? Has he provided extra money?  When we are talking about money on the scale of well over £1 billion, it is easy to lose sight of fundamentals.  I have sought consistently to focus on the fundamentals so that we know what we are talking about and can do some comparative analysis. That is why, when the Minister introduced the Estimate in July, the Minister who had presided over the sacking of 5,000 health workers and the closure of 4,000 beds, I wanted to focus in on what we were spending in relation to our wealth and in relation to other civilised countries.</P>
    <P>I want to re-focus the Minister's thoughts on that now because of the much maligned former Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond on whom the Minister wants to reflect on any occasion his name is mentioned here.  Let me remind the Minister that in the last year that Mr. Desmond had responsibility for the health services he expended more than £1 billion. That was the outturn for 1986.  It is interesting, if we add the Estimate that was approved earlier this year &mdash; £1.144 billion &mdash; and the Supplementary Estimate of £32 million which is before us tonight, to find that the figure would be very close to the 1986 figure.  But, we must ask what has happened in the matter <Col N="696" /> of inflation in the last three years.  We are still expending at the rate at which Mr. Desmond spent three years ago and yet week in week out when the present Minister was spokesman on this side of House he berated that Minister and attacked him consistently for not spending enough money.  Now we are back, after years of cajoling and after forcing the Minister to realise in the general election the extent of the problems in the health service, approaching a level of funding that was spent three years ago, with no account being taken of inflation, increased costs or increased technology in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The only true picture, I have said consistently, of our expenditure is the proportion of money we spend on health in relation to our wealth.  In each of the years since 1985 the proportion of our national wealth that we were prepared to spend on health care has declined dramatically. We spent £7 out of every £100 on our national health services in 1985. Barry Desmond maintained that at 7 per cent of GNP for the four years he was Minister for Health.  The figure declined to 6.3 per cent in 1988.  The end net result of the Estimate plus the Supplementary Estimate will mean we will expend on health care about £5.90 per £100 of our national wealth.  We are decreasing the proportion of our national wealth that we devote to the health services year in year out despite the fact that our dependency ratios are increasing all the time as we live longer while, at the same time, unfortunately, so many of our young people &mdash; 46,000 in the last 12 months &mdash; are forced out of the country.</P>
    <P>The number of people who are fit and able to work is fewer in relation to the number who are dependent on health services.  There is a greater demand all the time on our health services and yet this Minister and this administration are consistently reducing the proportion of our national wealth that we spend on health care.  We are now in the invidious position that, as a proportion of GNP, we are one of the worst countries in the EC and will be compared not to the Germans, the French or the British but rather <Col N="697" /> to the Portuguese and the Greeks, on the lowest level of health expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have said consistently that there is a consensus in this country that health care is important.  In the latest submission the Minister will have on his desk from The Conference of Major Religious Superiors, <i>Must the Poor Always Wait?</i> they have some scathing things to say about the health services.  I would like to quote these references because these people cannot be accused of being politically motivated or biased.  On page 38 of their report they say:</P>
    <P>Long waiting lists in public hospitals have become a fact of life for many poor people.  The length of aftercare has shortened dramatically resulting in much hardship for the patient and his/her family ...</P>
    <P>This is the reality that is accepted by any objective person looking at our health services.  The consensus to provide an adequate health service is noted by the Justice Commission and by the report of the Commission on Health Funding which stated clearly that there is a consensus in the country to expend money on health services.  Therefore why are we doing this patchwork job of putting sticking plaster on major issues?</P>
    <P>Let us look in detail at the Estimate the Minister has brought with such hooha before us tonight.  The Minister's speech was much more subdued than some of the media comment his Department and his party colleagues have generated in recent days.  What is he spending money on?  He is reannouncing the £15 million for improved acute hospital services &mdash; I think this is about the third time that has surfaced but at least we are passing it here.  He is spending £25 million on the additional cash requirements for the GMS.  That is money that has been already spent and that was not properly budgeted for.</P>

He did not provide adequate money although we told him that at the time.  He is coming back here now and making a virtue out of necessity. He is implying that he is going to do great things with the £31 million he is injecting into the health service when most of it has been spent already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These people are looking to the Taoiseach to live up to the promises he made to them during the election campaign, that the realisation had dawned upon him and that he was going to go back to the Government and solve the health crisis that he belatedly and finally acknowledged existed.  What is he doing? The answer is nothing.  The Minister has a responsibility to tell the people tonight that he is not going to solve the problems facing the health service because he is not committed to doing so.  This Government are not going to provide the necessary resources to enable the problems facing the health service to be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again it has been announced &mdash; this must be the sixth time this has been <Col N="699" /> announced &mdash; that £300,000 will be made available to the orthodontic service to enable 500 priority cases to be dealt with. During Question Time today it was pointed out there was a backlog of 24,000 cases.  The Minister did not contradict this figure.  All he said was he did not have the figures.  Is that his response to the children who require orthodontic treatment?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to our mental handicap services in which I have a particular interest and which I think have been sadly neglected.  In this House on 20 July last I spoke about our mental handicap service and the need to provide residential places for mentally handicapped people.  According to the estimate prepared by the Eastern Health Board 1,645 new residential places for mentally handicapped people will be needed by 1991.  What is the Minister doing to ensure that those 1,645 new residential places for mentally handicapped people as identified by the Eastern Health Board will be provided? Residential places are required where the severity of the condition is such that the person is incapable of being cared for at home or where carers or parents are ill or aging.  I made that appeal last July but to date it has fallen on deaf ears.  No provision for this service has been made in the Supplementary Estimate before us.</P>
    <P>AIDS was also referred to.  During the life of the previous administration the Minister set up 22 committees one of which was chaired by the former Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden.  However, we have not seen that report.  I put down a parliamentary question to find out when that report would be published so that we would know the Government's strategy.  In reply the Minister indicated that it was a private report and he had no intention of publishing it; it was for his own information. It is likely that it highlighted inaction on the part of the Government on this very serious problem.  He undermined and demeaned the work done by Deputy Leyden and insulted this House by making excuses month after month <Col N="700" /> before finally deciding that he was not going to publish it, that it was for his private bedtime reading.</P>
    <P>Since assuming the office of Minister for Health, he has presided over the destruction of the health service.  There is one other disquieting statistic I would like to give before I conclude, which was drawn to my attention this evening, and perhaps the Minister will comment upon it.  The infant mortality rate, as outlined in the journal of the Central Statistics Office, has increased from 7.4 per 1,000 live births in 1988 to 9.2 per 1,000 live births this year.  With the exception of one little blip&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will let the Minister have a copy of this report.  With the exception of the blip between 1983 and 1984 when there was a very insignificant increase of 0.3 per 1,000 live births, this is the only significant increase in 17 years.  I wonder if this is related to the policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government?</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate amounts to another PR job by a Minister who cannot obtain Cabinet agreement to provide a health service the people agree must be provided for those who cannot pay.  The Minister should not go down in history as the man who destroyed the health service, who made private medicine and who abandoned the poor and those without resources to fend for themselves or simply to die.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally one would welcome any Supplementary Estimate <Col N="701" /> but it is doubtful whether one can welcome this Supplementary Estimate. Because the services have been hit so badly during the past three years the question now is: how much would it take to bring them back to the 1985-86 level? We have been told that our general hospitals are very costly to run.  I should mention at this juncture that we in the north Cork area are pleased that our acute general hospital is being retained. However, were it not for a judicial review in the High Court we would not have this general hospital.</P>
      <P>Are funds being provided in this Supplementary Estimate to develop out-patient services?  It is deplorable that very ill people are required to attend at out-patient clinics and have to queue for long periods.  Indeed, many people who are required to attend at outpatient clinics cannot afford to do so.  I believe this accounts for some of the numbers on the Minister's records who have not attended.  I would like the community welfare officers to carry out a survey to find out the number of people who have appointments to attend these clinics but cannot afford to do so.  I am aware that some people find themselves in this position.</P>
      <P>As I said, our acute general hospitals are costly to run.  As we can see it is not the nursing profession who have created this situation, and the stress and stain to which they are subject have been referred to.  The Minister referred to the GMS contract which we in The Workers' Party have been calling for for a number of years.  I fail to see why the Minister could not bring in the new contract or capitation system and why in excess of £25 million is being spent on the GMS at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the prescribing and dispensing of drugs.  Drugs and medical supplies account for a very high percentage of health expenditure. When we are going to have a national drugs formulary?  When will we put an end to the drug companies creaming off health funding?  As a result of the investigation carried out by the health board of which I am a member, some very interesting facts have emerged.  I hope the <Col N="702" /> Minister will take these into account when considering whether to establish a national drugs formulary.</P>
    <P>In relation to dental, ophthalmic and aural services to be provided under the Health Act, it must be stated very clearly that these services are being provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and it was never intended that these services would be provided in such a way.  There is a statutory obligation to provide those services.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the review of the common contract for consultants.  There ought to be a big saving arising out of this.  It is a scandal that in 1988, in a country where there are almost 250,000 people unemployed, some consultants were paid £40,000 by the health boards under the common contract and they were treating patients in their private clinics because there were no funds available to treat them within the public hospital system.  This must not continue and the common contract must be reviewed as quickly as possible to eliminate the scandal.  Such very generous terms must never again be given to the consultants.  I hope this Minister is the man who will take on the monolith of the medical profession who seem to do whatever they like.  The child health examinations of course are of immense importance and the service has been curtailed greatly in the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>The system of determining full eligibility under the health services means that the community welfare officers who should be in the front line advising and helping people seem to take great pride and satisfaction in refusing people who are marginally over the limit for full eligibility. People find that tax or PRSI is not deductible in determining eligibility, as eligibility is based on gross income without any consideration for the circumstances of a family who may be marginally over the limit.  There are many people who will go to the chemist but not to the doctor because they cannot afford to pay.  That situation must end.  The question is, will this Supplementary Estimate help?  I say it will not.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I referred to community <Col N="703" /> care in the health services.  I want to see community care being developed and community welfare officers treating people with respect and dignity.  They have not been doing that and in many cases, they have taken pride in refusing people because they believed that that was the thing to do while cuts were being made in the finances being provided for health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I agree with the Minister when he pays tribute to the calibre and dedication of the staff who maintained our health services in difficult circumstances in recent years.  When contributing to the debate last July I expressed the hope that the Minister would put energy into undoing the damage done to the health services in his first term of office.  I would like to think that this Supplementary Estimate and the publication of the Book of Estimates which we have seen this evening is making a start in that direction.  How significant a start that is can only be measured against the profile of suffering, frustration and queueing that exists in the community.  Listening to my colleagues, Deputies Sherlock, Howlin and Yates, I find that there is a large measure of agreement at least on this side of the House about what needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that we are here to debate a supplementary estimate in excess of £31 <Col N="704" /> million, whatever about it being to provide for an overspending, I am amazed at the reaction of Fine Gael when they say that they will vote against this Estimate, and expect us to believe that this is a normal situation.  Time after time, in different capacities I have been told by Fine Gael, including their present spokesman, that there was nothing wrong with the allocation made to health and that all we needed was a more skilful allocation of resources within that budget and a more skilful managerial service at hospital level.  It really takes the patrician arrogance of Deputy Yates to come into this House, having told the people for the last three years that plenty of money had been provided in the Estimate if it were only managed properly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and now that there is additional money being provided to say that they will vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of our position during the election: we promised £60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>During the election, yes. It does nothing for the health service or for politics that a major party released from the obligations they told us so patriotically were their responsibility from 1987 to earlier this year, come along now asking us to accept this <i>volte face</i> as if it were the natural order of things.  I am really upset at that kind of decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It does nothing for politics or for the health service.  The difficulty confronting the health service is about the things to which Deputy Yates referred, but it is also about funding.  A myth has grown up that we are spending too much on health, that we cannot afford it and so on.  We are spending 6.3 per cent of GNP on health whereas the average for OECD countries is 8 per cent.  We argued before the General Election that it would take an injection <Col N="705" /> of £80 million to tackle the extent of the queues and to provide a free GP service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has three minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That would bring spending on health to about 7.3 per cent of GNP.  Deputy Howlin outlined that taking the Supplementary Estimate together with what we already have, the allocation for 1989 is 5.9 per cent of GNP. Having regard to the demographic structure of this country, which is unique in western Europe, that money is not sufficient and the allocation tonight does not make it sufficient.  Even if it was an adequate cash injecton, a cash injection alone cannot tackle the structural problems that are inherent in the health services. I agree with the other Deputies when they say that this Minister has done more to reverse the concept of a comprehensive health service in little over two years than has been done since the sixties.  This has a lot to do with the Minister's explanation of his own waiting list figures, where he talks about the Temple Street experiment and what happened in the Midland Health Board.  The reason for those &ldquo;no shows&rdquo; is that in many cases people cannot afford it.  I know that to be a fact.  Also, many have been forced to go private because that is the only way of being assured of speedy access to the kind of care that is necessary.  That has been the cause of the acceleration of the two-tier health service under the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt at another time with the necessity to recast the common contract and to reform the VHI, two steps necessary to achieve social equity in the health service. I will not repeat that now because I do not have the time; but there is an opportunity now under the Gleeson review to tackle the common contract so that a major step forward is made whereby more consultants can be appointed though not necessarily at additional cost to the Exchequer because that can be funded at least in part by a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors, thus giving those <Col N="706" /> frustrated junior hospital doctors a reasonable prospect of career potential that they do not have at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to share my time with Deputies Quill and O'Connell. I rise to support this Supplementary Estimate and to pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister for Health, on being able to get Cabinet consensus to provide almost £33 million extra for the health services this year.  That is a mammoth achievement.</P>
      <P>The past year has seen a number of significant developments in the health services.  These include the approval by Government in July of additional funding of £15 million to address specific difficulties which had arisen in the acute hospital sector.  Other developments saw a radical overhaul of the general medical services, a new system of financial support for those on long-term and expensive medication and in more recent weeks the publication of the report of the Commission on Health Funding.</P>
      <P>For example, the accident and emergency services in Dublin have in recent months undergone a complete transformation with a return to sectoral organisation of these services.  The additional provision, which will continue into 1990, has made a major improvement in the general hospitals in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The operation of the general medical services has also seen major changes with the introduction from April last of the new contract for the vast majority of GMS doctors.  The new general medical services scheme is the most far reaching and radical change in the operation of the community care service since the choice of doctor scheme came into operation in 1972 and will have a major beneficial effect on patient care.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has indicated already the coming year will also see a revision of the operation of the drugs schemes so as to reduce the burden which is being carried by persons with a regular ongoing and continuous requirement for prescription medication for the treatment of long term conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> The recent publication of the report of the Commission on Health Funding will I hope generate considered and informed debate among health professionals and the public generally.  The report merits detailed examination and discussion touching as it does on the major issues facing the health services.</P>
    <P>The report's publication underlines just how crucial the next year will be for the services as the commission's findings are discussed.  I would like to move on now to a number of other important developments.</P>
    <P>In the short time since taking up duty as Minister of State at the Department of Health I have become aware of the need to achieve a more balanced pattern of care within our health and social services. Over the years we have perhaps, tended to devote a disproportionate share of our limited resources to the high profile, high technology areas.  We have tended to overlook those areas of our social services which do not attract highly vocal pressure groups but which nevertheless represent areas of very real need within our society. One such area is our child care service.</P>
    <P>Health boards can often have a most difficult task in ensuring the promotion of the welfare of a child in an individual case.  There is no simple division between the rights of parents and the rights of children.</P>
    <P>A parent's right to the custody of a child is matched by a child's right to the company and protection of a parent. Improper interference with one means improper interference with the other.</P>
    <P>There are occasions when the welfare of a child can only be protected by placing the child in the care of a health board, suspending rights which the parents and the child normally have in relation to each other.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised, therefore, that a consideration of the welfare of a child must take into account the totality of rights existing between the parents and the child.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to the Child Care Bill requires health boards, having taken all these factors into <Col N="708" /> account, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives power to the health boards to deliver child and family care support services in order to aid parents and prevent the placement of children into care.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the innovative use of this power by the health boards will result in an accelerated development and expansion of community based services and facilities geared specifically to the needs of children and families.</P>
    <P>These services will include more intensive social work support for families at risk; new counselling and advice services; home help and home-maker services; child guidance services; day fostering; family resource centres and special projects for the young homeless and other &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups.</P>
    <P>I am also very conscious that legislative reforms must also be accompanied by the allocation of the necessary resources in terms of manpower and facilities.  During the last year the Government, therefore, set aside a special sum of £4 million from the national lottery surplus available to the Minister for Education to fund a range of new services throughout the country specifically targeted at disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>Among the projects being funded through the health boards are a number of developments geared for groups particularly at risk such as the young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers.  Another area which has received priority attention from the Government was the need to improve our present services for abused children. I was particularly pleased that the Government were able to allocate the necessary funds to enable new units to be established at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals for the full multi-disciplinary assessment of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.  In addition, a special sum of £500,000 from the national lottery surplus to enable similar type services to be developed in the seven health board regions outside of Dublin was made available.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed <Col N="709" /> to ensuring that the appropriate level of further additional resources is allocated to the health boards so that the child care Bill when enacted by the Oireachtas can be implemented, in an orderly and effective manner, for the benefit of those in greatest need.  The Bill has now gone to an all-party Dáil committee, which will meet on Tuesday next, 21 November, for the first time.</P>
    <P>I look forward to working with that committee in eventually producing an excellent Bill.</P>
    <P>The report of the working party on services for the elderly, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> is a comprehensive review of policy and of services for the elderly which takes account of the medical and social development of recent years and the implications of future demographic trends for the provision of services.</P>
    <P>It points to the need for a coherent and co-ordinated approach by all those involved in helping the elderly.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that we must ensure that elderly people receive the service they need at the appropriate time so that no elderly person is admitted to institutional care unnecessarily.  As far as possible we must try to anticipate the needs of our expanding elderly population and develop the kind of services we would like to see in existence when we grow old.  The emphasis must continue to be placed on community care.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour to ensure that the elderly can lead active and fulfilling lives in their old age and live in the environment of their choice &mdash; their home. The report indicates the direction that must be taken and it indicates where resources should be invested in order to achieve its objectives.  The Government have accepted, in principle, the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>This House will be aware that the programme to provide immunisation against measles, mumps and rubella is currently in progress.  The third phase of the publicity campaign associated with the programme has now been launched.  To date, the uptake of the vaccine is in excess of 70 per cent, so that I am optimistic of <Col N="710" /> achieving the target coverage of 90 per cent by March 1990 among children 18 to 24 months.</P>
    <P>I would take this opportunity to appeal to parents to ensure that their children receive this important vaccine which is safe and free and available from family doctors.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, with the continued support of medical and health board staff, the professional bodies involved and the co-operation of parents, will achieve the targets we have set ourselves and eventually see the elimination of the diseases from our country.</P>
    <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 came into force in December last year.  As you will be aware this Act has as its objectives: to facilitate clinical research, and to protect those participating as volunteers in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>Since coming into operation, certain difficulties have come to light which have impeded the effective implementation of the Act as a whole.</P>
    <P>A small working party representative of those involved in clinical research and my Department was established to consider the issues and to make recommendations in relation to ways of overcoming the problems.  The recommendations contained in the report of the working party have now been considered and necessary amending legislation is in the course of drafting.  The Minister hopes to be in a position to introduce that amending legislation at an early date.</P>
    <P>In July, last an expert advisory committee was set up to advise both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture on matters relating to food and to make recommendations as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee are under the chairmanship of Dr. Fergus Hill, the regional public analyst attached to the Eastern Health Board and its membership represents a broad range of technical expertise in areas such as medicine, veterinary medicine, toxicology, microbiology, food science and food hygiene. The committee have the capability to deal effectively with the wide variety of issues on which they will be called on for <Col N="711" /> advice.  The main subject areas which the committee will address are microbiology and food hygiene, food additives and contaminants, food irradiation, radiation contamination of foods and food legislation.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly an increased public awareness of food hygiene and of all food-related matters such as the use of additives in food and food-borne illnesses. Unfortunately, comment on these important matters can sometimes be ill-informed.  The food safety advisory committee will ensure that we have the benefit of expert consideration and proper advice on these matters.</P>
    <P>This Government continue to be committed to the improvement of services for people with a mental handicap. However, some areas of weakness in the service still require to be tackled.  Basic services are still inadequate in some regions.  A better distribution of resources in line with local service needs is required.  To facilitate this objective regional co-ordinating committees are now operating in most health board areas.  Each of the committees include representatives of the health board, voluntary agencies and the Department of Health.  These committees are in the process of formulating a plan for the development of services for each region and to co-ordinate the provision of services.  I look forward to further progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Progress continues to be made in developing a community-based psychiatric service as outlined in the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>There has been a considerable expansion of community based facilities such as day hospitals, day centres, hostels and community residences.  At the end of 1988 there were 47 day centres and 32 day hospitals catering for some 7,500 attenders.  There were also 272 hostels and community residences in existence with 1,823 places.  The number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals continues to fall and there are now about 9,000 patients in our hospitals as compared with <Col N="712" /> 20,000 in 1958, a reduction of some 11,000 inpatients over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>In the past considerable efforts have been made at developing specific care programmes for the elderly and the mentally handicapped in psychiatric hospitals which are more appropriate to the needs of these categories of patients.</P>
    <P>In order to supplement the anti-smoking education and information programmes currently being conducted environmental controls over smoking in a variety of public places are now being put in place.  The regulations are being made under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and will apply to such places as public service buildings, hospitals, health centres, cinemas and schools.  The Department have completed a wide ranging consultation process and are currently considering a number of practical issues which have arisen before finalising the regulations.  It has become more and more noticeable that there is considerable support among the public, both smokers and non-smokers alike, for environmental controls over smoking, which will create an environment designed to prevent young persons in particular from starting to smoke and will encourage and assist smokers to quit.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the National Youth Council, the Department's health promotion unit are developing a drink awareness for youth programme which aims to equip young people with the information and skills to make responsible decisions in relation to alcohol use.</P>
    <P>Among the many activities taking place this year in the context of European Year of Information on Cancer is a training programme for teachers on the topic, being run jointly by the health promotion unit and the Irish Cancer Society.  Earlier in the year a major new anti-smoking campaign got under way with special elements targeted at young people.  I would like to pay a special and deserved tribute to the many and enthusiastic organisations like the Irish Cancer Society and many others for their enthusiastic commitment to their various fields of interest.  They broaden the public <Col N="713" /> interest in various health and other matters and make an immense contribution to many people around the country.  The reviews of the health services which the Minister for Health and I have given in the House this evening demonstrate the need for a fresh examination of the operation of the services to ensure that they continue to be delivered in the most efficient and equitable way.  In particular the recommendations of the Commission on health funding cover a whole spectrum of policy issues arising in the services. The consultation process on the report which the Minister has now embarked upon will add to an informed discussion on the major questions to be addressed. I think it is true to say that the process of review and consequential decision making will be the most fundamental since the passing and implementation of the Health Act almost 20 years ago.  In my view the health services are well equipped to meet the challenges facing us in the period ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss. Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me and I congratulate the Minister for Health for bringing in a Supplementary Estimate of this magnitude.  An injection of £32.9 million into the health services at this stage of the year demonstrates clearly a strong commitment on the part of this Government to bring to bear an improved and more comprehensive health service.  We are seeing here this evening a section of the joint programme for Government as worked out by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil being put in place.  Already £15 million <Col N="714" /> has been spent on improvement of the health services and that is beginning to bring about improvements on the ground.  We all can be pleased with that.</P>
      <P>However, there is a great deal of ground to be made up and I will make three points as briefly as I can.  First, still far too much money is being spent on the administration of the health services.  I urge the Minister to use all his energy in the years ahead to try to scale down on the amount of money spent on the administration of the health services and put that money to patient care where it is badly needed.</P>
      <P>Also I am disappointed to see we have to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of this size to service the revised GMS scheme.  I was given the clear impression when that scheme was introduced that a saving would occur.  That has not occured this year, and I hope the Minister will take every step open to him to ensure that it will be brought about next year and in subsequent years.  That money is badly needed and I know the Minister will work towards that.  Finally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand and I am grateful for the time I have been given.  I want to ask the Minister to work towards putting in place some proper pricing mechanism for drugs.  It is ludicrous that with inflation running in England as it is at the moment we have a 10 per cent differential between prices of drugs in England and prices of drugs here.  It makes no economic sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The moving of this Supplementary Estimate today has confirmed my deep rooted fears and suspicions that in the past few years under the harshest administration this country has ever known we are rapidly approaching and developing a two-tiered health system, one for the rich and affluent and one for the poor and downtrodden where people who, because of economic circumstances and, I emphasise, by no choice of their own, are neglected and relegated to the status of second class citizens, a country where public neo-natal services are virtually abolished.  We have had proof from the Labour spokesman this evening that the peri-natal mortality rate has risen in the last years, unheard of in a civilized country especially at present.  We have a country where school health services are grossly understaffed and under utilised.  Surely, prevention and early detection of illnesses, as the Minister knows as a general practitioner, should be the aim of a caring and efficient health service, but the Minister and his advisers obviously do not think so.  Cutbacks in real terms exist in this modern day health service.  The hospital system, despite what the Minister's hyped up PR machine says, is worse now than it was one year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six months ago approximately the Minister, and especially the Taoiseach, said on TV they did not realise there was a crisis in the health service.  Recently Mr. Patrick O'Neill, a paediatric surgeon and neuro-surgeon, with unique talent, unique experience and experience in the surgical management of tumours of the very young has fired what was in reality an in-hospital political row.  The Minister on the Adjournment last Wednesday night informed this House that there were surgeons fully trained with sufficient expertise, technique and know-how for the surgical management of these very young and unfortunate patients.  I tell the Minister his statement is untrue.  I have come into possession of a sworn affidavit <Col N="716" /> by a senior neuro-surgeon in Beaumont Hospital.  He says that the non-appointment of a permanent post, that is of paediatric neuro-surgeon, will cause major difficulties for certain paediatric patients of the hospital, notably in congenital deformities of the head, face and spine and surgery of the brain and spinal cord in infants and very young children.  Their particular needs cannot be fully met by him and he is unaware of experience over and above his in these fields on the part of his permanent consultant colleague.</P>
    <P>I am also in possession of in-hospital documents outlining four cases which deem life saving operations as a matter of urgency.  I am asking the Minister, what is going on in this hospital?  Who are his advisers?  As a matter of urgency, I ask him to have an investigative commission set up with wide ranging powers of evidence and to reinstate this man as a matter of urgency.  In conclusion, may I further state that all these services are now available for people who can afford to pay for them in the Mater Private Hospital.  This is a shocking condemnation of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we are as far away as ever from resolving the grave difficulties in the delivery of health care.  There is a sequence of accusations and denials, distorted statistics and a gap between reality and the Minister's perception from his office.  Earlier today at Question Time the Minister of State, in a derogatory tone, accused Deputy Yates of consulting with senior hospital consultants, hospital administrators, etc. as if this was something he should not have done.  Far from criticising this procedure I suggest that both the Minister and the Minister of State take a leaf from Deputy Yates' book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the election campaign the difficulties being experienced by people dependent on public health were aired again and again and became the central issue.  Few people, not even the Taoiseach, expected that health would dominate the campaign.  In response to this debate commitments were given that an allocation of £30 million would be made.  Why now, six months on, are we not feeling the positive effect of this funding?  The case has been well stated tonight that the damage done to the health service is so great that an injection of £30 million is not enough to reverse it.  There is very little easing of distress for a number of groups.  This amount of money is only a drop in the ocean and a more generous and a more imaginative approach is needed.  It is now a case of us having a paler shade of crisis.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the broad spectrum of spending but to confine my remarks to a number of areas.  What will be the level of spending on the health promotion unit this year?  We cannot stress enough the need for health education, to create a public awareness about the power people have to remain healthy and to influence their general well being. Is the health promotion unit getting any increase in funding this year or will it remain at £750,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of those who were very critical about the abolition of the Health Education Bureau and the subsuming of the bureau's role into the Department. This was a shortsighted move and was <Col N="718" /> surrounded with suspicion, a suspicion that has been well founded.  The Health Education Bureau did a good job taking all areas of health education into account. It is only when we look at the poor performance of the health promotion unit in the last two years that we realise how effective it was.  The health promotion unit operates with caution, without any muscle and is making little or no impact on the public consciousness with regard to health education.  Never before was there a greater need for health information and education for all ages, on such issues as diet, smoking, drinking, life style and particularly AIDS.  We need a new independent public health education forum.</P>
    <P>I question what spending will be done to build up a comprehensive corps of public health nurses.  In every report and policy document public health nurse and the need for a public health nursing team are dealt with, covering the need for child care, care of the aged, care of the handicapped and care of the terminally ill.  We see proposals for a better and bigger public health nursing corps all the time.  There is a fine tradition of public health nursing in Ireland and these services are in great need.  Spending on this service would reap great dividends.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission on health funding found that the present staffing levels are inadequate.  The home nursing service was judged by the commission to be of key importance in developing alternatives to in-patient care.  As the emphasis on the health service continues to put heavy reliance on communities to care for the old, the handicapped and those discharged early from hospital, it is vital that we regard as a fundamental need the development of our public health nursing service.  The NESC report No. 84 which deals with community care services states:</P>
    <P>The domiciliary development work of the public health nurse is particularly important in those rural areas which are outside the range of developmental and child welfare clinics; in these areas the public health nurse is the key <Col N="719" /> person in the community care service, in the detection of developmental delays and handicap during the pre-school period.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the role of the public health nurse is vital.  A good well trained and well funded service could provide important and cost effective community care in so far as nurses would have the confidence of and the information about families and would be in a position to identify problems at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I hope funding will be provided in these areas and in many other areas too.  We need to inject money into these services so that patients can afford to go back to hospitals.  Nobody wants the gaunt grim vision Deputy Yates painted.  We need to spend in many area of health and to look at the broad needs of health services in Ireland today.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who made a contribution.  While I would not have time to go into detail on all the contributions I will try to deal with as many as I can in the time available. Deputy Fennell was concerned about my knowledge and that of the Minister of State and said we should talk to more managers and people who are involved on the front line.  She need have no fears for either of us.  We both keep in close contact with what is happening in the service.  She also commented on the health promotion unit and said she is concerned about it.  I would like to ask her, and indeed other Deputies, what efforts they have made to acquaint themselves with what is happening in the health promotion unit because the feedback I am getting suggests it is very successful, much more successful than the Health Education Bureau ever was.  One of the reasons for this is that it has the Government clout behind it when it wants to do something.  The clean watch campaign on food hygiene was a major success.  The measles, mumps, rubella campaign was also a major success.  The <Col N="720" /> anti-smoking programme, the AIDS education programme and now the drink awareness programme, which is being presented is quite an achievement, plus all the leaflets that are available, special stands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was particularly interested in what Deputy Lee had to say.  He accused me of telling an untruth but started with telling one himself, claiming that the Taoiseach said he did not know there was a crisis in the health service.  The Taoiseach said no such thing; he never mentioned a crisis in the health service.  The crisis in the health service is in the imagination of people in Opposition.  Then Deputy Lee went on to say I had told an untruth during the Adjournment Debate last Wednesday night.</P>

I know it is difficult for the Minister, amidst her onerous duties, to attend so late in the House.</P>
      <P>There is a very large number of post-primary pupils attending two schools in Hospital, County Limerick.  I want to speak about the De La Salle Presentation School.  Originally the Presentation nuns had a convent school at Hospital catering for girls in the catchment area.  The De La Salle brothers had another school catering for boys.  The two schools amalgamated into one corporate unit &mdash; if I may use that expression &mdash; with one board of management, a principal and vice-principal, and are recognised by the Department of Education as one school. Even though the institutions amalgamated the actual accommodation is separated by half a mile because they are still located on two sites.  The classrooms on the two locations are located in 13 different positions.  As the House will appreciate, this causes grave hardship to pupils and teachers who must move, in all kinds of weather conditions, from one location to another.  Additionally the administration of the school, at so many different locations, in two different collections of pre-fabs, is a nightmare for administration and timetabling.  The buildings are in very bad condition.  There are three pre-fabs there over 24 years old, three pre-fabs over 21 years old, three pre-fabs over 17 years old, a prefab hall over 17 years old and two prefab halls over three years old.</P>
      <P>The Minister is expending a certain amount of money in keeping these in a condition in which classes can be conducted. There is an average of £3,000 per annum being spent on maintenance which appears to me to be so much money down the drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1973 the schools, which were then separate, catered for 370 pupils and, in the present school year, cater for 609 pupils.  There are 37 teachers in the school.  I do not think any workforce of <Col N="729" /> this size anywhere in the country has to work in such appalling conditions. Neither do I think any pupils in an institution of this size are subjected to these conditions.</P>
    <P>Fund-raising has been engaged in for a long time.  A sum of £350,000 has been accumulated which would meet any reasonable local contribution the Minister might request.  There is also a site adjacent to the De La Salle property being given free and there are six acres of playing fields attached.  The assembly hall at this location is of a reasonable quality.  Effectively what is required is a new school on this site using the existing assembly hall.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the schools which had been run separately by the Sisters and Brothers were amalgamated, and now there is one joint institution.  There are no specialist rooms in the schools.  There is no proper art room, woodwork room, mechanical drawing room, geography room, religion room, language laboratory or gymnasium. There is only one science room on each site, which are totally inadequate for 609 pupils.  Of course, the toilet and cloakroom facilities are inadequate as well.</P>
    <P>I thought some progress had been made in the Department of Education until I put down a question to the Minister on 24 October 1989.  I asked her in the first instance for a new school because the people in Hospital talk in terms of a new school rather than an extension.  The Minister said she had no plans to construct a new primary school at Hospital, County Limerick.  On the basis that I thought I may have asked a wrong question, I then asked her about an extension. While I got a more lengthy answer I am afraid it amounted to the same thing &mdash; the Minister has no plans to build an extension there either.</P>
    <P>However, in her reply the Minister referred to discussions on an amalgamation and preliminary discussions have taken place on an amalgamation of existing schools.  When one talks about existing schools one might be talking of the brothers and the nuns.  Their schools were amalgamated in 1973 so I presume <Col N="730" /> what the Minister has in mind is discussions with the authorities in the present amalgamated school, De La Salle Presentation School, and the authorities of the County Limerick VEC who run the vocational school in Hospital.  This is news to the authorities of the De La Salle Presentation School and to the parents of Hospital who thought there was no question of arrangements being made which would incorporate the technical school.  They were under the impression that with over 600 pupils in the school they had sufficient numbers to justify what they were looking for.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position here tonight.  Accommodation is necessary.  This is a very large catchment area and there is no real competition in post-primary education, in the sense one would have in a city.  It is not as if alternative post-primary schools are going to draw pupils from the catchment area; if anything extra pupils will come to the area.  From a political point of view, this area spans not only the constituency of East Limerick but also quite a large area of West Limerick and extends into South Tipperary.  Therefore, two counties and a large number of parents are involved.</P>
    <P>Parents in the area who did their part in collecting £350,000 &mdash; that money has been available for some time and the Minister is aware of this &mdash; feel very hurt because they were under the impression that the planning of a new school had gone as far as phase 3 or phase 4.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister to do a number of things.  First, will she clarify the position here tonight?  She should set a deadline for sorting things out and agreeing plans for the post-primary school at De La Salle Presentation School.  I would ask her to meet a delegation from the school authorities, the teaching staff and the parents at a very early date so that she can have a full and frank discussion with the people most concerned about this matter.  The children of the people who contributed to the post-primary school at Hospital have passed through the primary education cycle and the parents of children who are currently in the school feel their children will have passed through the education cycle before any new school is provided. Schools where planning started at a more recent date seem to have progressed while the project in Hospital seems to have stopped.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position, I should like her also to state very clearly if it is because she wants the vocational school to come in as part of the new school that no progress has been made.  Is she prepared to go ahead with either an extension or a new school for the De La Salle Presentation School and to allow the vocational school a separate identity?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He has been diligent in its pursuit, having asked to raise it five times.  I wanted to be in the House to reply to this debate, and I am glad to be here.  I will be very explicit in my reply.</P>
      <P>I have planned one school for Hospital. The number of pupils in the Presentation De La Salle school is 610 &mdash; naturally the Deputy's figure of 609 is just as good &mdash; and there are 221 pupils in the vocational school.  Those are present day enrolment figures and obviously &mdash; I have the percentages but there is no point going through them &mdash; the national drop in births which is already quite evident in primary schools will inevitably come into the post-primary sector.  Hospital is an ideal location for one school.  I make no secret in saying that there will be one school for Hospital, combining the Presentation De La Salle school and the vocational school.  To do anything else in the light of the numbers and the projections would be very wrong.  That school will be able to offer a very broad range of academic and technical subjects which is the current mix nowadays for young girls and boys.</P>
      <P>Co-education demands the development of the curriculum so that there will be a greater range of options open to young people.  Because of the skills they need nowadays, a broad curriculum is needed.  We are looking at all areas to see where we can combine the traditional vocational school and the traditional voluntary secondary school.  As evident from the numbers in the schools, ideally there should be one development in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the file on Hospital and I accept that the conditions under which the very diligent staff and managers, both past and present, are working are inadequate. I taught in prefabs in post-primary schools for 20 years and they are not satisfactory from the point of view of teachers or pupils.  I want the town of <Col N="733" /> Hospital to have one decent, good school.  That will be my aim and that is what we have planned.</P>
    <P>I have already arranged to meet with a deputation &mdash; I do not know the date, but I think it is next week &mdash; and naturally the Deputy will be informed when the meeting will be.  I will be very glad to meet with them and explain my position exactly.  Of course, this is not a new position; it was a policy of the last Government and the Government before that &mdash; the previous Coalition &mdash; to look critically at all planning particularly in the post-primary sector to see if one school could serve one area.</P>

The Deputy was a member of the Coalition Government for four years but he did not push to get rid of the prefabs in the schools in Hospital or make any great strides towards so doing.  The Deputy brought that comment on himself.  I am quite open on the matter.  Hospital deserves a decent school.  I will meet all the representative interests.  The people will come to a common consensus on the type of school they want.  The pupil catchment of the area is most adequately suited for one school.</P>

      <P>This is a matter to be decided on by the Department and the local community.  What happens when a decision is taken that the area is suitable for one school is that the Department and the community at large get together &mdash; not without trauma in some instances, but sometimes very easily &mdash; and decide what they will do.</P>
      <P>A meeting took place recently between my Department and the secondary school authorities to explore the possibilities for Hospital.  A meeting has been arranged with County Limerick Vocational Education Committee to discuss the development of a single school.  The possibility has already been floated with the secondary school authorities and a meeting has been arranged to meet with County Limerick VEC.  Arising from the discussions, a decision will be made as to how best to meet the long term needs of the catchment area.</P>
      <P>I am very aware from reading the files of the unsatisfactory situation in Hospital particularly in the secondary school.  To recap, an exploratory meeting has been held with the voluntary sector second level schools and a meeting has been arranged with the vocational sector.  I will be meeting a deputation &mdash; I do not know who will be there but obviously all the public representatives will be invited &mdash; and the parents and teachers and the matter will be decided from there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brian O'Shea gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject <Col N="735" /> matter of the decision of the banks to introduce charges on the handling of local authority accounts.  The matter is in order.  The Deputy has ten minutes to present his case and the Minister of State has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of bringing this very important matter before the House tonight.  I am glad to see that Deputy Connolly, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, is present.  From my experience in the Seanad, I know that Deputy Connolly has a genuine commitment to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am a member of two local authorities, Waterford County Council and Waterford City Council.  At present, we are in the throes of preparing the Estimates and striking a rate.  I was horrified to learn that the banks have taken a decision to phase in charges on the discharge of local authority accounts.  This must be seen against the background of the reductions of the rate support grant over the past three years, a nine per cent reduction followed by a 14 per cent reduction and a five per cent reduction.  In net terms, £110 million has been taken out of the local authority rate support grant in the past three years.  Jobs have been lost. There has been a huge curtailment of services.</P>
      <P>As I have said at the outset, the banks intend to phase in these charges.  I would estimate that the impact of these phased charges would be of the order of £1.5 million.  However, if the charges were to be implemented in full, the figure would be two and a half times that amount, bringing the total bank charges to somewhere in the region of £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the institutions that want to introduce these new charges.  It is estimated that the Bank of Ireland will make a profit of £180 million this year and that AIB will make a profit of £250 million. There has been always a special relationship between the local authorities and the banks, the banks acting as treasurer for the local authorities.  The banks get a <Col N="736" /> great deal of income by way of interest charges from the local authorities.  It must be said that there are no risks to the banks when they are dealing with local authorities, they are sure of being paid their money.  I suggest that in next year's budget the banks levy should be adjusted to cover the cost of these charges and that the local authorities should be reimbursed by that amount.  This increase in the bank levy should exceed any proposed increases by the Government.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have suffered but I am most concerned that the development and policing roles of local authorities have been very seriously undermined. The Department of the Environment send directives on what the local authorities should do to protect the Environment. Unfortunately, this is a farce because funds are not provided to police the implementation of the directives. Local authorities have neither the staff nor the facilities to carry out this role.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can make a huge impact on tourism but they are being stripped of the wherewithal to make an input.  For instance, our roads are getting worse.  At present levels of funding there is no possibility that a great number of our county roads would be resurfaced within 100 years.  We have reached the ridiculous.  The local authorities have become more committed to the protection of the environment but they cannot carry out their functions due to a lack of money.  Tourism and leisure are large growth areas within the EC. Despite the great potential for the development of tourism, we are not benefiting to any great extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I trust he will not stray too far from the subject matter he has raised with me &mdash; the introduction of charges on the handling of local authority accounts.  That is the nub of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was leading up to that. It is very short-sighted of the banks to attempt to remove very scarce resources from local authorities.  If local authorities <Col N="737" /> are allowed to develop the potential for tourism, this will bring more business to the area and increase revenue to the banks.  I believe the Minister must intervene with the banks.  I believe that the Minister would share my view that this is a totally unwarranted and unjust intrusion on local authorities.  The banks make large profits from the local authorities and they should not attempt to take very scarce resources away from them.  If the banks were put on notice that it is the Government's intention to increase the levy and that local authorities will be reimbursed from that extra levy, it will spell out clearly to the banks that this intrusion and this greedy effort to get extra resources from the starved finances of local authorities will not be tolerated by the Minister or by the Government.  I look to the Minister for determined and real action to prevent this terrible problem arising for local authorities.  For instance, I know one local authority in Carlow which will have to pay £20,000 in bank charges next year on the first stage of phasing in.  The chairman of that county council, Councillor Michael Meaney, made the very salient point recently that the AIB were in trouble with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  They were very glad to be bailed out by the State to the tune of £20 million.</P>
      <P>The banks have always been to the forefront in advising the Government and making very strong statements about cutting back on Government funding, but now they are attempting to take further from local authorities which have been starved of funds by the Government to the tune of £110 million in rate support grants in three years.  That is a horrendous reduction in local authority funding. In conclusion, I once again state that I absolutely deplore this decision.  I look to the Government, and in particular to the Minister for the Environment, to spell out clearly to the banks that they should desist from introducing charges on very lucrative local authority accounts.  The local authorities, with their meagre resources, should be allowed proceed with the excellent job they are doing in spite of all the restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter.  Local authorities have been exempt from bank charges since 1925. There has always been a special relationship between the banks and local authorities as clients.  No one in banking circles would deny that there is prestige attached to handling a local authority account.  That being so, I cannot understand why the banks want to introduce charges.  Deputies may recall when the health boards were brought into operation some years ago the bank managers and representatives from the major banks canvassed members for their accounts.  What has happened since then?</P>
      <P>It could cost local authorities between £1.5 million and £2 million if these charges are to be introduced.  That money has to come from the resources of the local authorities and I think we all know at this time that local authorities are hard pressed for cash.  I do not want to get into the financing of local authorities because the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to do so.  That debate is for another day.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about these proposed charges and I am glad to say that the County and City Managers' Association have taken up the matter with the bank concerned and are refusing to pay the charges.  One of the banks wanted to introduce these charges last July but following representations from the County and City Managers' Association they did not proceed with them.  I am now led to believe that another bank wants to introduce these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, it is a privilege for banks to handle the account of any local authority.  It is sure money and, that being so, I take a serious view of the matter. As the Deputy quite rightly pointed out, the banks are making substantial profits. As a business concern that is their prerogative and I accept that.  In any event, I remain convinced that local authorities are valued clients of the banks and their business is valuable in a wider sense attracting banking custom.  This value was fully appreciated almost 20 years ago <Col N="739" /> when the Associated Banks attempted unsuccessfully to introduce bank charges for local authority accounts.  I have no doubt that local authorities throughout the country which are now in the process of drawing up their expenditure estimates for 1990 will not welcome the prospect of having to curtail essential services any further in order to accommodate bank charges, and I cannot blame them for that.  My Department are fully aware of the position.  They fund 50 per cent of all local authority expenditure and everyone knows that money comes from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter this evening because it is a very important issue and one on which I am keeping a close eye.  Negotiations are taking place between the County and City Managers' Association and the banks, and the managers are keeping me informed of the position.  I do not want to say what further action can be taken <Col N="740" /> because, Deputies will appreciate, I would not like to pre-empt what the outcome will be.  The banks are handling millions of pounds for the councils and the taxpayers &mdash; all the money comes from the people.  I am now asking the banks to seriously rethink this matter because I take a serious view of it.</P>
    <P>When I get a further report on the negotiations between the County and City Managers' Association and the banks, the Minister and I will then decide what other action can be taken.  I hope the bank will use common understanding and they will leave matters as they are. They tried to introduce these charges 20 years ago and did not succeed, and I have no doubt their proposal will be resented on this occasion also.  In the long run I hope common understanding will prevail.</P>

      <P>The provision of eye and ear, nose and throat services is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In-patient eye and ear, nose and throat services are available free of charge to all hospital service card holders on the same basis as other in-patient services.  Under the Health Act, 1970, out-patient services are defined as excluding dental, ophthalmic or aural services and health boards are required to make dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and appliances available without charge only to medical card holders and to children referred from child health examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal provisions concerning dental, ophthalmic and aural services have been interpreted in some areas as meaning that hospital service card holders are liable to pay consultant fees for all out-patient ophthalmic and aural services.  In most of the country however, ophthalmic and aural services under the Health Act, 1970, are considered to refer to sight testing and screening for eye and ear defects only.  Thus consultants in these areas do not charge hospital service card holders for out-patient treatment of medical conditions relating to the eyes and ears.  I am aware that in Cork hospital <Col N="524" /> service card holders are charged for out-patient ENT services.  I consider that the differentiation under the Health Act, 1970, between ophthalmic and aural out-patient services and other specialist services is an anomaly which I am arranging to have reviewed.</P>

      <P>The provision of geriatric services in the Louth-Meath area is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board in the first <Col N="525" /> instance.  The primary reason for relocating the geriatric service at the Cottage Hospital is that St. Mary's is an old building which is no longer suitable for the accommodation of long stay geriatric patients and plans are underway to increase the bed complement at the Cottage Hospital by way of internal adaptations and the building of an extension to the hospital.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of psychiatric services in County Roscommon is primarily a matter for the Western Health Board. The Western Health Board have taken a decision to develop their psychiatric service in County Roscommon in accordance with the policy outlined in the report &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  This report sets out the steps necessary to develop a modern community based psychiatric service which will enable many people to <Col N="526" /> be treated without the necessity of being admitted to hospital.  This policy has been accepted by successive Governments as being the best way of developing a more caring and humane approach to the treatment of mental illness.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board's development plan involves the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at the County Hospital, Roscommon.  I have provided the necessary capital resources to enable this work to be undertaken.  The unit has recently been completed and will be opened as soon as possible.  This will enable people from County Roscommon who require in-patient treatment to be looked after in a general hospital setting and in a unit which has been built to the most modern standard available.  A range of back-up facilities such as supported hostels, day centres, workshops and community residences are being put in place in various locations throughout County Roscommon.  The provision of alternative facilities for a number of mainly elderly patients who are currently cared for in St. Patrick's Hospital is the subject of discussions between my Department and the Western Health Board.  These discussions have not yet been finalised but I can inform the Deputy that it is the Western Health Board's wish to provide improved facilities for these patients.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the reorganisation of the psychiatric services in County Roscommon is to bring about necessary improvements for those who need to use the service.  I appreciate that there may be some apprehension about the changes being introduced but I have no doubt that these concerns will be overcome when the various new facilities for patients which I have outlined are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>

The means only of the applicant and spouse, if any, is taken into account. Otherwise health boards are allowed discretion in the assessment of the means of individual applicants &mdash; but in general the Department of Social Welfare guidelines are used.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the different criteria which are used for the establishment of income in establishing entitlement to medical cards to those used by the Department of Social Welfare in establishing entitlement to small farmers assistance; and the reason small farmers who are entitled to assistance are subsequently denied medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The criterion for issue of medical cards is that the persons concerned are, in the opinion of the chief executive officers of the health boards, unable to arrange general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  While there are income guidelines to assist chief executive officers, the Deputy will appreciate that careful assessment is necessary in each individual case.  It is open to the chief executive officer to take into account the availability of capital, as well as income, in determining whether a person would <Col N="528" /> be able to arrange general practitioner services without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>The administration of small farmers assistance is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, I understand that, in accordance with statutory requirements, income from investments or other capital is taken into account and the capital itself disregarded in assessing means for the purpose of this assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Psychiatric services are being developed in this country in accordance with the policy set out in the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i>  The policy outlined in this report involves a major change from a centralised hospital service to a service based in the community.  The aim of this policy is to improve the quality of care in the psychiatric services and to enable as many people as possible receive treatment in their local community without the necessity for hospital admission.  The policy of changing our psychiatric service from an institutional to a community based service has been accepted by successive Governments as being the best way of improving services for the mentally ill.</P>
      <P>All of the health boards have drawn up plans for the implementation of the recommendation of <i>Planning for the Future</i> and considerable progress is being made in the provision of a range of facilities which are located in community settings. With the development of community based psychiatric services and advances in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, there is now less reliance on the institutional approach to the delivery of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> The changes which are taking place in the psychiatric service are reflected in the continuing reduction in the number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals.  Patients who had been cared for in hospital for many years have been given the skills required to enable them to live in the community.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that it is my policy to ensure that where psychiatric services are being reorganised, a comprehensive community orientated service is put in place.</P>

    <P>A total of 30,790 persons have been tested for the virus and, of this, 886 have tested positive.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's question on 11 May 1989 (Official Report, columns 2181-2186) all the indications are that over the next ten years, Ireland is heading into an epidemic situation with a projected doubling of cases of full-blown AIDS every nine months, which is likely to last for the next four to eight years.  This growth of cases assumes very little impact of intervention programmes such as the Outreach Programme or public information-education campaigns and assuming this rate of growth, by 1995 there could be as many as 12,240.  However, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate beyond that.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned also on that occasion, considerable progress has been made in combating the disease and assisting sufferers since the Government's AIDS strategy commenced in 1984.  The strategy has been developed in line with national and international requirements and recommendations and compares very favourably with strategies adopted in other countries.</P>

      <P>A sudden infant death is a great tragedy for the family and also for the community. A range of measures is being taken to offer support to those affected by sudden infant death syndrome.</P>
      <P>In view of the important role of the Irish sudden infant death association in this area, I have given a commitment of financial assistance early next year towards the costs of its printing information on various aspects of sudden infant death.  In that regard a request for a grant of approximately £6,000 is currently under consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> An annual grant of £1,000 is paid by the Eastern Health Board to the association to enable it to carry on its various activities, which includes counselling and supporting families affected.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have made arrangements whereby the former medical residence at the Richmond Hospital will be transferred to the Eastern Health Board, who in association with Dublin Corporation will provide accommodation in the building for this association and other groups as part of the Community Services Project, currently housed in premises provided by Dublin Corporation at Christchurch Place.</P>
    <P>Information on the incidence of sudden infant death is currently published by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly and annual basis in its Report on Vital Statistics and is widely available.</P>
    <P>Following a proposal from the scientific sub-committee of the Irish Sudden Death Syndrome Association, I have agreed to the establishment of a sudden infant death register which will provide additional epidemiological data.  I have arranged with the Central Statistics Office that certificates relating to all infant deaths occuring during the first and second year of life would be released to that committee subject, of course, to strict conditions of confidentiality.  The Central Statistics Office is at present extracting the relevant death certificates for the period October 1986 to date. These will provide information which when complete will enable the register to be established.</P>
    <P>The Health Research Board which is a statutory independent body established to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research, has allocated a sum of £15,000 this year to a research project at the Rotunda Hospital which will investigate the pathology of placenta associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</P>

      <P>There are indications that young persons (in particular young women) are starting to smoke in increasing numbers and this is of particular concern to me.  Section 2 of the Tobacco Health (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, enables me to make regulations to either prohibit or restrict smoking in a designated area or a designated facility.  My Department is currently preparing regulations under the Act.</P>
      <P>The regulations will include a provision for a prohibition on smoking in first and second level class rooms.  This measure is designated to create an exemplary environment for young people.  The regulations are in the final stages of drafting and I hope to be in a position to sign them very soon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 67 together.  As part of an urgent action programme embarked on by the Government, I allocated an additional £250,000 to Temple Street Hospital in order to significantly increase the level of service available there.  This included £50,000 to permit the treatment of an additional 170 ENT patients before the end of December who would otherwise have remained on the waiting list, together with £50,000 for ENT equipment.  In fact 200 cases have been dealt with and it is hoped to do a further 50 before the end of this year.  The remaining £150,000 has also allowed beds to be re-opened and an additional 250 patients to be treated.  The hospital regards the reduction of the waiting list for ENT as its immediate priority and I expect that significant progress can be made in regard to clearing the waiting list in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to explain that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the clinical decision of the consultant concerned and the hospital authority. <Col N="537" /> Non-urgent (elective) cases may be put on a waiting list to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly. I understand that the patient concerned is on the urgent waiting list for admission and that the hospital expect to admit him early in the New Year.  I would suggest to the Deputy that if the patient's condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to assess and then if necessary to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for individual health boards to apportion the funds available to them between the different services they provide as they see fit.  However, in view of the long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment that have built up over the years, the Government recently made a special allocation of funds to the Health boards in order to alleviate the situation. The North Eastern and Western Health Boards were each allocated £30,000 which will enable each board to complete courses of treatment for 50 of the top priority cases on its orthodontic waiting list.</P>

      <P>The provision of outpatient services at Limerick Regional Hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The position at present is that the health board are reviewing the existing outpatient appointment system with a view to reducing the delays.  I am confident that the efforts now being made by the board will succeed in resolving the problem.</P>
      <P>Since 1982 there has been a 40 per cent increase in attendances at outpatient clinics.  This is due to (i) increasing demand for services and (ii) the number of specialist clinics which have developed with the appointment of consultant staff who have special interests.</P>
      <P>A new patient administration system has been introduced recently.  A review of the existing out-patient appointment system is being undertaken at present prior to the introduction of a computerised outpatient module.  This review also includes an examination of the present structure of clinical staffing and their duties and the need for supervisory administration posts in the outpatients Department.</P>
      <P>In this context I should say that I have asked all health agencies to examine their procedures with a view to ensuring that the minimum hardship is experienced by patients.  I should add that a capital grant of £250,000 was approved some time ago for improvements to the outpatient and accident and emergency departments at Limerick Regional and that a further £119,000 was subsequently approved for day theatre equipment also at Limerick Regional.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I allocated an additional £800,000 to the Mid-Western Health Board last August for hospital services in the region, including a variety of projects at Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>

Child health examinations are provided in accordance with the Act for children under the age of six years; pupils attending a national school; and pupils attending a school which is not a national school where the governing body of that school makes a request to a health board to provide such examinations and where the health board, which has discretion in this regard, may by order provide child health examinations at that school.</P>

      <P>This year I succeeded in obtaining an increased allocation of intervention beef from the EC for distribution to the most needy welfare categories.  As a result it has been possible to extend the scheme substantially and some 120,000 people benefit under the 1989 arrangements compared with less than 50,000 in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quantity of beef available is strictly limited making it necessary to identify specific beneficiaries.  In consultation with the Department of Social Welfare those on long term unemployment assistance were identified as the welfare category in greatest need.  Small farmers, <Col N="553" /> being landholders, have certain resources placing them in a different category from the long term unemployed on the live register.</P>
    <P>The conditions of the free beef scheme, including the matter of eligibility, are reviewed each year.  For 1990 I will, of course, be seeking to extend the scheme even further.  The increase in the numbers eligible for this year's free beef scheme indicates the Government's clear commitment to expand the scheme to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and indeed statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  The acceptance or rejection of any type of risk is primarily a matter for each individual insurance company to decide in the light of their underwriting experience.  No obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of a particular risk or to quote at any particular premium.</P>
      <P>In 1987, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £32 million on their motor portfolios.  These losses have risen to £48 million in 1988.  Faced with losses of this magnitude over the past two years insurers have had no option but to increase their premiums in line with their claims' experience or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Guardian Royal Exchange have become more selective in the type of risk for which they are prepared to quote.  This more selective approach applies to new business from <Col N="557" /> male proposers but does not affect their existing policyholders or new female drivers. Additionally my information is that a number of companies are continuing to offer insurance cover to persons under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>However, cases of inability to get motor insurance cover can be dealt with under the declined cases agreement.  This is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Declined Cases Committee, established under the agreement, examines cases referred to it by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved. Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.</P>
    <P>The Government remain fully committed to improving the environment for insurance generally, and in this regard the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment are considering further initiatives regarding the operation of the courts and the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <P>Not all staff serving in the division of my Department which is to be decentralised want to go to Killarney.  These must be replaced by staff from other offices in Dublin and elsewhere who are seeking transfer to there.  The division performs essential work which must proceed without any interruption and to enable this to be done the release of staff and the &ldquo;transfer in&rdquo; of their replacements must take place on a phased basis. It is also essential that all staff transferring to Killarney receive the necessary experience and on the job training in this division in Dublin in advance of the actual transfer.  I am aware that these requirements may cause difficulties in the short-term for some of the staff concerned who have, however, the advantage that they are in the process of getting the transfer that they have applied for.  The arrangements I have outlined are essential if the decentralisation to Killarney is to be successfully implemented.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989, which came into effect on 13 November, 1989, the separate category of articulated vehicles &mdash; i.e. the old class H &mdash; has been abolished.  Applicants for driving tests for the old class H who already have a licence to drive a truck automatically become licensed to drive an articulated vehicle.  Those who hold a current provisional licence to drive an articulated vehicle or have held such a licence within the previous five years will be required to undergo a driving test for a truck and trailer.  Those who have not held such <Col N="566" /> a licence will be required to undergo, initially, a test for a truck only and subsequently a test for a truck and trailer.</P>

      <P>The power under Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 to grant permission to develop land includes power to permit the retention of structures.  An application for retention is considered by reference to the normal statutory criterion of proper planning and development. Permission for retention can be granted subject to such conditions as the relevant planning authority, or An Bord Pleanála, consider appropriate and without necessarily requiring compliance with conditions subject to which a previous permission was granted.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these provisions regarding retention, the Planning Acts also contain enforcement powers which may be used against developers where development is not carried out in conformity with a permission granted.  While I have no specific proposal to amend the law in the respect mentioned in the question, I will be looking generally at the adequacy of enforcement powers in the course of an overall review of planning legislation which I intend to initiate as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The listeria organism is present in the environment and between 5 per cent and 70 per cent of people carry listeria in their intestines, without any symptoms. However, the organism is capable of causing serious disease including septic abortion, newborn or adult septicaemia, meningitis or meningo-encephalitis.  In healthy individuals, the organism may produce influenza-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all.  The population most at risk are neonates, the old, the pregnant and those compromised by an underlying illness such as malignancy or alcoholism. Immuno-compromised people are also susceptible to infection.  For these groups, mortality rates can run from between 20 per cent to over 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>Nine cases of listeriosis occured in Ireland during the past three years.  Evidence from other countries indicates that listeriosis is primarily transmitted by food, but food was not identified as being the cause in the nine Irish cases.</P>
      <P>Outbreaks in other countries do not present a significant risk for this country but imports of vulnerable foods are monitored on a regular basis as a precautionary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Food Safety Advisory <Col N="574" /> Committee to examine the question of listeria, including what advice should be given to the public, and to make recommendations. I expect to have a report from the committee in the very near future and I will then make a further statement in the matter.</P>

This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the case of Scoil Mhuire there were 626 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus 18 assistants for the current school year, 1989-90.

      <P>Circular Letter M85/85, which issued to post-primary schools in October 1985 introduced the requirement that, with effect from the beginning of the 1986-87 school year, the intermediate certificate be of three years' duration and that the leaving certificate course be of two years in all schools.  That circular went on to say that &ldquo;in so far as the Senior Cycle is concerned practices <Col N="576" /> that result in a <i>de facto</i> three-year Leaving Certificate course will not be accepted e.g. having a repeat first year or having a two-year course to Ordinary Level followed by a third year at Higher Level or any other such arrangements&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with interested parties &mdash; management, teachers and parents &mdash; I decided earlier this year to introduce a degree of delegation to school authorities to allow repeat years for the current school year subject to compliance with criteria which I have now outlined in a further circular letter.  In addition any student may repeat the leaving certificate examination subject to the payment of the appropriate fee.</P>

      <P>(i) The award of pensions and other superannuation benefits in respect of national school teachers and secondary teachers is governed by statutory superannuation schemes made under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928.  Various amending schemes have been made over the years and a number of approved changes are currently being implemented administratively pending their incorporation into further amending schemes for approval by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Teaching service given outside of the State is not pensionable service for the purposes of the national school teachers' superannuation schemes or the secondary teachers' superannuation schemes and there are no proposals for changing this position.</P>
      <P>There are no reciprocal arrangements at present for transferring service between this country and other countries for superannuation purposes.  Any such arrangements proposed would have to be considered in the context of the public service generally.</P>
      <P>In the universities arrangements operate under which staff with service outside the country may, in certain circumstances, become members or retain their membership in the federated superannuation system for universities or the universities superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>(ii)  (a)  Under the national school teachers' superannuation schemes the minimum retirement age for a teacher to get immediate retirement pension and lump sum, other than a teacher who retires on grounds of disability, is, either</P>
      <P>(a)  55 years of age where the teacher has completed 35 years or more of pensionable service, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  60 years of age provided the <Col N="579" /> teacher has completed at least five years of pensionable service.</P>
    <P>(ii) (b)  Under the secondary teachers superannuation scheme the minimum retiring age for a teacher with immediate award of a retirement pension and lump sum, other than a teacher who retires on grounds of disability, is 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>(ii) (c)  Vocational teachers are recognised as officers for superannuation purposes under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 (Consolidation) Scheme, 1987, and local government (superannuation) (consolidation) scheme, 1986, and responsibility for the operation of the scheme rests with the Minister for the Environment.  The minimum retirement age for VEC teachers is 60 years.</P>
    <P>(ii) (d)  The minimum age for retirement on pension from the universities, excluding retirement on disability is 60 years with the exception of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and Trinity College where the age is 50 years.</P>

      <P>Ireland has concluded a number of Bilateral Road Transport Agreements with EC and non-EC states.  These provide for reciprocal access to road transport in the territory of the contracting parties to the agreements. Penalty clauses for breaches of the terms of the agreements are enforced by the competent authorities of each state.  The Gardaí, the Customs authorities and the transport officers of this Department are responsible for enforcement in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The agreements provide for reciprocal reporting procedures between the contracting parties of breaches of the agreements by visiting hauliers.  These offences can lead to withdrawal of permits to operate abroad.</P>
      <P>The measures needed to prevent and punish breaches of the law by foreign hauliers in Ireland are kept under constant review in my Department.  I am satisfied that the State's enforcement agencies are adequately enforcing the law in this regard.</P>
