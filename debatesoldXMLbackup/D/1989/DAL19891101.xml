    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he holds the view that the Taoiseach should participate in informal discussions at the European Council if these touch upon matters involving military security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's position in this area is set out in the Declaration of the Government of Ireland on Title III of the Single European Act.  It is not affected by informal discussions at European Council or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach that he is, therefore, prepared to take part in discussions in the informal/formal part of the Council meetings of the European Council on matters touching on military security, and does so on the basis he has just outlined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that but the Deputy is aware that the position of this Government and of the previous Government is that we accept that in Community affairs the economic aspect of security can be discussed.  With regard <Col N="978" /> to the European Council meetings, I think the Deputy is probably referring to the dinner that takes place in conjunction with the meetings of the European Council. It is well known that discussions at that dinner range far and wide and cover matters above and beyond Community affairs so that participating in informal discussions of any kind does not have any great significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from that that the Taoiseach experiences no inhibitions in discussing matters affecting military security at the dinner associated with the meetings of the European Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.  I am saying that the discussions at the dinner are quite informal and do not carry any particular significance.  Individual participants feel free to discuss, totally informally, matters which may be connected with the Community, but very often are not connected in any way with the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the topics covered in his discussions with President Mitterrand in Dublin on 20 October 1989; if any agreement was reached on joint measures to promote the proposed EC social charter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>President Mitterrand's visit here was part of a series of working visits by him to EC capitals for discussions on current issues under the French EC Presidency, with particular reference to the meeting in December of the European Council in Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice to reveal details of <Col N="979" /> discussions which take place at working visits of this kind.  I can, however, tell the House that we did discuss economic and monetary union and convergence, the social charter and other developments, both internally and externally, affecting or likely to affect the Community during the French and Irish Presidencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation specifically to the social charter, would the Taoiseach not agree that the Government are attempting to speak out of both sides of their mouths in saying that they support the idea of a social charter while, at the same time, seeking to ensure that the charter does not have any teeth, that it will not have any mandatory role in the various member states to ensure basic minimum rights for workers in the European Commuity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  Like many other countries in the Community we favour a social dimension to economic and monetary union and we totally subscribe to the principle of a social charter, but there are individual aspects of the social charter on which we have reservations and about which we want to be satisfied.  As my colleague the Minister for Labour said, we have no doubt that, as other countries, we will be able to reconcile our difficulties and find solutions to the problems that the draft charter might present for us.  As President Mitterrand said, the position of the individual member states at this time is one which has emerged over a long period of growth and development and evolution of practices and institutes.  There can be no question of putting the 12 member states into a strait-jacket in this regard but solutions have to be found in the case of individual member states who have built up different practices over the years. For instance, in our case we claim to have a better, more effective and more comprehensive system of free collective bargaining than many of the other member states and we want that taken into account when decisions are being taken.  It is purely a matter of discussion, <Col N="980" /> negotiation and finding solutions which are compatible with our system, traditions, attitudes and practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that there is a fundamental problem with regard to integration of the European Community where economic and monetary integration is obligatory on all states in various ways and will be imposed by various directives and regulations but in the area of the social dimension, of which the social charter is only one aspect, it would seem that Ireland, Britain, Portugal and Spain are seeking not to have a common social charter applied across Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  We fully subscribe to a common social charter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The charter will cover many aspects of the position of workers in the workplace &mdash; health, safety, conditions, vocational training and so on.  All these things have to be discussed and agreed between us in a significant and important social charter applicable right through Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's substantial reply and having regard to the fact that last Monday for the first time the Government's divisions to their detailed position on the social charter became known to the Irish public, would he not agree that the reason the Government are in principle in favour of the charter, and in detail opposed to it, is due to the internal divisions in the new Coalition Government, on the one hand with the Department of Industry and Commerce and on the other hand the Department of Labour?  If that is not the case &mdash; and I would invite him to so refute it &mdash; perhaps he would indicate how the Minister for Labour, as the incoming President of the Social Affairs Council, will be in a position over the next six months to give effective teeth to the charter, or does he believe it should remain forever simply an aspirational document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="981" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously has not been listening or taking account of what I said.  The position of the Government is absolutely clear.  In fact, before the Minister for Labour made any statement last Monday I, in a press interview which took place after President Mitterrand's visit, outlined quite clearly the position of the Government &mdash; that we very much favour a social charter and will work towards the achievement and the promulgation of such a social charter.  As a small country with an economy which is still in the process of development, we have problems and difficulties with certain areas, as has practically every other member state.  The practice of the Community on an occasion like this is to try to meet the difficulties which any particular proposal presents to any member state and in the end arrive at a good working agreement.  That is what is going to happen on this occasion.  There are no divisions in this Government on the matter.  I think the Deputy must be suffering from a thought retrospection process in regard to the Government of which he was a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the recent remark of the Taoiseach, may I ask if the full implementation of the social charter will, in his opinion, have any adverse effect on the competitiveness of Europe in international trade and if he has sought quantification of any such effects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult and fairly complex area.  From our point of view, the primary social requirement is the provision of employment.  We believe &mdash; and I think most Deputies in the House would agree &mdash; that the provision of an adequate level of sustainable viable employment is the solution to many of our social problems.  Therefore, we would have to look carefully at the provisions of the social charter to make sure that they did not inhibit our capacity to create employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other side of that fence, some commentators will point out that some of the member states which have the highest level of employment, at the same time have the most advanced social charters in operation.  It is a question that has to be very carefully teased out and a balance found.  That is our approach and that is fully understood by all the member states.  That is the approach, I think, of most member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach yet come to any conclusion on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to have finality on this question and proceed to deal with other questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer specifically to the Taoiseach's reference to free collective bargaining and the different practices in each country.  Presumably this is a reference to the rejection by the Minister for Labour of the concept of a legal minimum wage.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that the reference he is presumably making is to the joint labour committees which comprise in excess of 40,000 workers, many of whom are caught in the proverty trap?  All the studies on poverty show that low pay is as much a factor in poverty in many cases as is unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte, I did ask for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach whether, in the light of the ineffectiveness of the joint labour committees, the Government would consider the necessary establishment of a legal minimum wage, having regard to the fact that the joint labour committees require the consensus and agreement of employers, rates are set very low and enforced very badly and many people are caught in the low pay trap?  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's comments on the legal minimum wage and why the Government have apparently decided to rule it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is straying a long way from the original purpose of the question.  As I said, we will endeavour to ensure that when the social charter is finally completed it will be in conformity, as much as possible, with our practices, traditions and safeguards.  That will be our objective.  We want a social charter, but we want one with which we can live. The Deputy may know that in one area there is a legal minimum &mdash; in the case of the agricultural worker.  It is a complex situation but it is early days yet to say <Col N="984" /> what the final outcome of our discussions and negotiations will be.  We are approaching the matter in a co-operative and progressive spirit, one which is based on our wish to have a European Social Charter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach's information, the published position of the Federation of Irish Employers seems to be similar to that of the published position of the Irish Government.  They support the charter in principle but object to having it become a mandatory imposition on member states. Can the Taoiseach clarify if he will, at the end of the discussions and particulary at the summit in Strasbourg, support the implementation of the charter as a mandatory piece of law in all member states, whatever shape it may have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, the Taoiseach obviously took your request for brevity to heart.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a necessity to give MEPs a facility of reporting back to the <Col N="985" /> Dáil, given that 14 per cent of our 15 MEPs do not have any such facility?</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government that they consider the idea of members elected to the European Parliament being given the right of audience in this Parliament, naturally without the right to vote, and that at least one day a month be set aside to discuss matters which relate to and arise from European Parliament activities which have a direct bearing on what goes on in this House and on which there is very little communication at present, or indeed in the past?  That is not a new thing.  There is no such communication. This is a thought which I have expressed to the Taoiseach privately in the past: that there should be <i>ex officio</i> membership of the Dáil for elected members of the European Parliament and, going one step further, that Members of this House should be <i>ex officio</i> members of all the local authorities within their own constituencies without having to stand for election in order that there may be proper liaison.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he will request the Central Statistics Office to resume the work they were carrying out in supplying the unemployment figures on a monthly basis for each county; when the Government decision to cease providing this information was made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the Area of Residence Analysis of the Live Register which was prepared on a quarterly basis for previous years.  Since January of this year that analysis has been replaced with a new monthly analysis based on area of registration.  This change was one of those introduced following a general review of the set of live register analyses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new analysis gives totals of registrations in each county.  It has many other advantages by comparison with the former analysis, such as (1) it is linked to the end-of-month count of the live register; (2) it has a monthly rather than a quarterly frequency; (3) details for each <Col N="989" /> of the 129 local employment offices are published within ten working days of the reference date; and (4) separate details on persons under and over 25 years of age registering at each local office are published.</P>
    <P>The new monthly analysis provides, therefore, a more frequent, comprehensive and timely geographical analysis of the live register than was hitherto available.  A copy of the results for 29 September 1989, the latest date for which the figures are available, is in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the previous analysis was subject to many deficiencies.  For example, many towns had expanded well beyond their original legal boundaries and in these cases the data, referring as they did to only part of the built up town area, were not particularly useful and not completely accurate. Secondly, it was also difficult for the staff in the local employment offices to accurately locate residents' addresses relative to the legal boundaries of the town.  Notification of these changes has been made on a very frequent basis, dating back to November 1988.  They are still being notified in the respective areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the discussions he had with representatives of Merrell Dow, prior to their decision not to proceed with their proposed plant at Killeagh, County Cork; if he requested Merrell Dow to delay the construction of the plant; if he will outline the reasons given to him by Merrell Dow for not going ahead with the plant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Harney, and I met with senior executives of Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals Incorporated on 24 August 1989 to discuss the company's proposed manufacturing project at Killeagh, County Cork.  While it would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on the discussions, I can say that my main concern was to endeavour to allay the on-going disquiet among the various community groups involved about the proposed facility with a view to ensuring that the project would proceed without further disruption or delay.  I can also state categorically that at no stage during the talks did either my colleague or I request Merrell Dow to delay construction of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first week of September last, the company informed the Industrial <Col N="991" /> Development Authority of its decision not to proceed with the project because of the recent merger between the company and Marion Laboratories, Incorporated, a US pharmaceuticals company. This merger meant that the new combined US company, Marion Merrell Dow Incorporated, would not require the production capacity of the proposed Killeagh project.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may recall that at the time of this announcement, I publicly expressed disappointment at the company's decision. In addition, I expressed the Government's on-going support for further investment in the State by foreignbased companies in the sector concerned, subject to their agreement to operate to the highest environmental standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reply he has given, in which he indicated he did not request the company to defer a decision, is the most ambiguous and ambivalent reply ever given in this House to a question?  My question is a straightforward one.  Would he further agree, given that the application from the industry in question had been approved by the local authority concerned, Cork County Council, and subsequently on appeal to an Bord Pleanála on the advice of Eolas and University College, Cork, that it was inappropriate for the Minister of State to enter into the debate by way of visiting east Cork?  Did the Minister receive a report from the Minister of State, and if so, what are the contents of that report?  Would the Minister agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government made no such decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the retail electrical trade claims that they operate at a severe disadvantage in relation to the ESB because of the system of billing and accounts operated by the board; to the fact that electrical retailers do not have access to the system; if he considers that <Col N="995" /> these claims are valid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 34 and 92 together.  I have considered the case made by the Radio and Television Retailers' Association and others that the ESB's retailing activities in the electrical appliances sector give rise to unfair competition for other electrical appliance retailers.  In particular, I have considered suggestions that the ESB cross-subsidise their electrical appliance sales business, offer favourable credit terms and have an unfair advantage over their competitors in relation to their billing system.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to emphasise that it is perfectly legitimate for the ESB to be involved in appliance retailing under the provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
      <P>In relation to cross-subsidisation I am informed that the ESB's appliance sales business is operated on a normal commercial basis.  In relation to their credit terms I am informed that the ESB's average percentage rates on all appliances is approximately 24 per cent which is similar to that offered on hire purchase by other retailers.  These are, I understand, displayed on all merchandise in the ESB's showrooms.  Exceptional special promotions are undertaken at the request of, and funded by, suppliers where interest free credit is offered for particular goods if payment is made within a year.  Similar promotions are undertaken by other retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB's billing system undoubtedly facilitates the promotion of, and repayments in, their electrical appliances business, and in this regard gives the ESB an advantage not available to their competitors. While it is, of course, acceptable for any business to maximise its natural advantages, it must not do so, in particular, by availing unfairly of advantages it enjoys uniquely by virtue of being in a monopoly position.  In order to ensure that such is not occurring in this particular case, I have decided to ask the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to <Col N="996" /> carry out an investigation into this aspect of the ESB's involvement in the electrical appliances sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact, particularly in the Border area where the electrical retail trade has been under severe pressure for many years that the way ESB trading is heading will further endanger the livelihood of the small retail outlets in the Border areas, and in other parts of the country?  Would the Minister agree that there may be a tendency for the ESB to use the sale of electricity to subsidise the sale of electrical goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that electrical traders in the Border area are at a particular disadvantage because of the difference in the VAT rates on both sides of the Border and the present development does not help an already difficult situation for them.  I do not want to comment on whether this is subsidising the price of electricity or <i>vice versa</i>, but I am somewhat surprised that it had become the practice of the ESB in recent times to enter into the sale of brown goods as opposed to white goods.  For many years their justification for engaging in the sale of white goods was to promote the sale of electricity.  The same argument does not seem to apply in the sale of brown goods, many of which are minimal or negligible users of electricity.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the use of the ESB billing system to facilitate customer credit payments is an abuse of their monopoly position as a semi-State body?  Would the Minister accept that the 24 per cent profit margin is not the actual margin and that they are working in real terms on a 2 per cent or 3 per cent profit margin.  Would the <Col N="997" /> Minister further accept that social welfare officers end up giving money to people who cannot pay their ESB bill which include items purchased under an ESB credit purchase scheme?</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have answered it already in the main reply by saying that I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to carry out an investigation into that aspect to see whether there is an abuse of the monopoly position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of public bodies advancing money for the payment of electricity bills, I agree that if any element of that included the credit purchase of goods that appeared on an ESB bill then it certainly gives the ESB an unfair advantage because the same facility would presumably not be afforded in respect of bills that were due to private retailers.</P>

Would the Minister agree that it is an absolute disgrace that there is no paper-making facility in this country given the enormous amount of paper we and, in particular, this Government use, all of which must be imported?  It should be part of the development of a forestry plan to continue the process of pulpwood and paper-making facilities.</P>

A paper-mill would be downstream from that.  I do not know <Col N="1001" /> what the precise nature of the pulpwood plant will be because, of course, agreement has not yet been come to between the IDA and any of the three companies they are talking to at present.

With regard to the product to be produced by a third proposed plant, I do not yet know because it has not yet been decided who the promoters of the third plant will be.  As I said there are three companies, two Swedish and one American, talking actively about it to the IDA at present and presumably the product will be decided as a result of the successful outcome of those discussions.</P>

Following supplementaries from my colleague, Deputy Bruton, we were informed then that the Bill was with the draftsman's office and would be circulated without any delay.  Would the Minister not agree that there are many urgent matters hanging on the introduction of this legislation?

Regarding a date as to when it <Col N="1003" /> will be introduced in the Dáil, a number of other considerations have to go into that so I would not be in a position to give a date today.  I can only say that I will give as much priority as possible to the early introduction of the Bill.

      <P>I propose to take oral Questions Nos. 10 and 25 and priority Questions Nos. 37, 39 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>During the past five years, a specific ceiling applied in respect of export credit insurance for all products, including beef, exported to Iraq.  While this ceiling was increased on periodic occasions to reflect the expanding level of business opportunities available to Irish companies, cover was suspended in May, 1986 because of increasing repayment difficulties and the resultant delays that were beginning to arise for Irish exporters.  Cover remained suspended until May, 1987 when the then Minister for Industry and Commerce decided to reopen cover within a specified limit because of the significant potential of the market for Irish companies.</P>
      <P>Cover was again restricted in December 1988 because of the high level of payments which were then overdue from Iraq to Irish beef companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1987 liabilities amounting to <Col N="1007" /> £10.35 million were underwritten under the export credit insurance and finance schemes in respect of exports of beef to Iraq.  All payments in respect of these exports were received from Iraq.  Since 1987 liabilities amounting to £120 million were underwritten under the export credit insurance scheme in respect of exports of beef to Iraq.  The percentage of cover in 1987 and 1988 was either 70 per cent or 80 per cent depending on the credit period.  Bank guarantees involving a total exposure to the State of some £55.2 million were issued under the export credit finance scheme in respect of such exports.  This amount is included in the total maximum potential insurance liability of £120 million.</P>
    <P>For reasons of commercial confidentiality it has not been the practice to reveal information about individual companies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of recent decisions taken by me to void certain export credit insurance policies in respect of beef exports to Iraq.  The grounds on which these policies were voided are set out in my statement of 18 October 1989. In view of the importance of this matter I feel it is appropriate for me to read into the official record of the House the text of this statement.  The statement reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In response to a large number of enquiries from the media arising from reports in this morning's newspapers centred on the initiation of proceedings against me, I have decided in the interests of clarity, to confirm that, on 12th October last, proceedings in the High Court were instituted against me by a beef exporting company.  This action was initiated on foot of my decision to void certain export credit insurance policies in respect of exports of beef to Iraq, the background to which is as follows:</P>
    <P>Earlier this year my Department commenced an investigation into the discrepancies which had emerged as between official statistics for Irish beef exports to Iraq in respect of the years <Col N="1008" /> 1987 and 1988 and the levels of beef exports which had been declared for insurance purposes under the Government's Export Credit Insurance and Finance Schemes in respect of the same years.  The investigation was conducted in consultation with the Central Statistics Office, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the exporters concerned.</P>
    <P>The principal finding of the investigation has been that the discrepancies concerned arose mainly from the fact that approximately 38.4 per cent by volume, of the beef, the subject matter of certain insurance policies issued during the same period, was sourced outside the State, having been processed either in Northern Ireland or in Britain.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1953, the primary purpose of the Government's Export Credit Insurance Scheme is to promote Irish exports.  Policies of insurance issued under the scheme specifically provide for cover in respect of the export from Ireland of goods which are produced within the State.  Such a provision is present in all policies concerned with the export of Irish beef to Iraq.</P>
    <P>In the light of the findings of the Department's investigation, I consulted with the Attorney General.  I directed my Department on 11 October to instruct the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, as my agents in the administration of the Export Credit Insurance Scheme, to notify the companies concerned that specified policies are void and that no liability will be accepted by me in respect of them.</P>
    <P>If these legal proceedings against me are persisted in I propose to contest them vigorously.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the above that this is an extremely complex matter and one that has demanded careful assessment and a considerable level of consultation. This is especially true in relation to the <Col N="1009" /> legal dimensions.  My first and foremost task, therefore, was to take whatever action was both necessary and open to me in accordance with established insurance practice and convention.  This I have now done in a manner consisent with the requirements of law and in the light of the circumstances and facts of the case.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that my primary concern in this case has always been the protection of the Exchequer and I can assure the House that this will continue to be the case.  I am continuing my detailed consultation and consideration of the matter. In view of the fact that proceedings have been instituted in this case, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make any further comment which might be prejudicial to the course of future legal proceedings, whether civil or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reasons for the decision to allocate cover given for beef exports to Iraq in 1987, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce set out the situation in relation to this in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 9 on 3 May, 1989.</P>
    <P>The standard policy wording regarding sourcing of product was employed in the insurance policies in question.  This was further augmented by declarations to the effect that the beef to be supplied was or would be the produce of the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>No claims have been paid in respect of these beef exports under the export credit finance scheme and accordingly the question of recovering moneys does not arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am satisfied that at no stage prior to the issue of the insurance policies in question was my Department aware or given any reason to believe that a proportion of the beef to be exported and declared for insurance was or would be sourced outside the State.  Furthermore as far as I am concerned neither the then Minister nor the Government were so aware.  In this regard I would again emphasise that the companies concerned provided declarations to the effect that the beef was or would be the produce of the State.  Facts regarding sourcing of the beef only emerged as a consequence of <Col N="1010" /> the departmental investigation already referred to.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the limited time available for ordinary questions I propose to call the Members in the order in which their questions have appeared on the Order Paper and to move into priority question time to deal with the priority questions tabled on this subject matter.  I am calling Deputy Mervyn Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask two questions arising out of the Minister's reply.  First, does the question of fraud arise on these issues, and has any matter arising from that been referred to the Garda authorities for examination or investigation? If so, will the Minister give details of exactly what has been referred for consideration to the Garda authorities on the question of fraud?</P>
      <P>The second question is, if the Minister now stands over his own statement of May last when he pointed out that one particular firm had received 80 per cent of the total cover available for exports to Iraq and then said that the Government of the day had shown favouritism in giving such a volume of cover to one firm. Now that the Minister has taken office in the same Department does he stand over that statement that he made in May or does he wish to change it now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary, I have consulted the Attorney General on precisely that point.  I have taken his advice and I have followed that advice in the answer that I have given today.  For the benefit of the Deputy I will repeat the relevant part of my earlier answer and I will respect the Attorney General's advice not to go beyond it.  I think if the Deputy carefully considers the sentence I am going to read out again he will agree that it would not be appropriate for me to go beyond that.  It is this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that proceedings have been instituted in this case, I do not think it would be appropriate for <Col N="1011" /> me to make any further comment which might be prejudicial to the course of future legal proceedings, whether civil or otherwise.</P>
    <P>As far as the second part of the Deputy's supplementary is concerned, the figures I gave here in March or April of this year, that 80 per cent of the cover went to one company and 20 per cent to another, appear to me to be broadly correct but the actual figure may be 79 per cent.</P>

The Minister said that at the time no member of the Government, or his Department, was aware that the full contract for the supply of meat to Iraq could not be sourced solely in this country.  I should like to ask the Minister what the consequences are for export credit insurance if in the future an undertaking of a similar kind is given and the exporter in question finds that he or she cannot source all the meat here.  What will happen to the contract?  In relation to the export credit finance scheme will the Minister say if he intends pursuing the repayment of moneys that were obtained under this scheme if a claim has been made which turns out to be, in accordance with what the Minister has said, a fraudulent one?</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary questions, banks in Ireland advanced the sum of £55.2 million on foot of the export credit finance scheme in respect of meat that was contained in two policies, which I subsequently voided.  Because the amount of beef external to the Republic of Ireland, covered by those two policies, amounted to 38.4 per cent of all the beef insured, I think it is inevitable, that some of the advances that were made by the banks in respect of the finance guarantee scheme must have been made in respect of some beef, at least, that was external to the Republic of Ireland.  In relation to the second question which the Deputy raised that I should repudiate these policies when a claim is made &mdash; I presume he implies by that that I should not void them any earlier &mdash; the advice I had both from the insurers who act as my agents, from the Attorney General's Office and the Attorney General himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his earlier answer the Minister defended his position now as compared to the position he took as a Deputy in this House on 10 May on the basis that the figures are broadly correct. Frightening as the figures are in their scale, I suggest it is the analysis of who is responsible for this state of affairs that is at issue.  At that time the Minister said, as a Deputy in this House, that some people took actions that were deliberate and that they were as a result of Government and ministerial intervention.

May I ask the Taoiseach if we will have a decision on that? There are also committees dealing with women's affairs, crime, health, education and welfare, public expenditure and on non-commercial State bodies.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £107,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 December, 1989; for the salaries and expenses of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend to the House a Supplementary Estimate for the Civil Service Commission to cover the cost this year of initiating limited recruitment in certain grades.  As the House is aware, the embargo on the filling of vacancies in the Civil Service was introduced as one of several measures to contain the cost of the public service pay bill with the objective of bringing this category of expenditure into line with budgetary and economic realities.  While there has been a considerable improvement in the budgetary situation, largely as a result of <Col N="1151" /> such economies, I still consider it essential to maintain for a further period that policy of containment.  Accordingly, the embargo in the Civil Service will remain in place for the remainder of this year and for 1990.  Within this framework, however, I do foresee some limited scope for the filling of certain vacancies in the future where so doing would lead to benefits to the Exchequer which are immediate, significant and continuing and which cannot be otherwise attained.</P>
    <P>The number of posts that will be filled depends on the level of natural wastage among staff from now to the end of 1990. What I must emphasise is that there will be no question of systematically filling posts which have become vacant in recent years or of allowing current overall numbers to drift upwards.  In July 1981 the numbers serving in the Civil Service as distinct from the wider public service were over 32,000.  Since then, these numbers have been reduced to the more sustainable level of approximately 26,800.  It is my intention to reduce Civil Service numbers somewhat further to at least the levels that obtained in 1977 before the public service job creation programme of that time took effect.</P>
    <P>Further savings must be achieved, for the fact remains that, as a nation, we are still heavily in debt &mdash; our debt-GNP ratio is about twice the EC average.  This debate represents a major burden on the economy and the cost of servicing it is still taking up a huge amount of resources &mdash; over £2 billion in the current year or £40 a week for every worker in the country.  There can be no question, therefore, that the Government can now dispense with expenditure restraint and recommence with whole-scale recruitment into the Civil Service.  That would end all the good we have achieved. Realisation of our medium-term economic policy objectives &mdash; for a more competitive economy, good economic growth, lower interest rates, lower taxes and more jobs &mdash; requires control of expenditure and continuing economies with regard to the public sector wage bill. It must be emphasised, therefore that, as <Col N="1152" /> I have said, recruitment will only take place where it can be demonstrated that it will lead to benefits to the Exchequer which are immediate and continuing and which cannot be otherwise attained.</P>
    <P>I have accordingly arranged with the Civil Service Commission to initiate recruitment procedures with a view to establishing panels of qualified people so that appointments can be made to clerical, executive and graduate vacancies if required in 1990.</P>
    <P>Although most of the expenses involved in the holding of these competitions will arise in 1990, certain additional costs related to the announcing of competitions will arise in 1989.  The major portion of the additional expenditure required will be on advertising, printing and increased costs of accommodation for examinations arising from the competitions.  These items will increase expenditure from Subhead D of the Vote by £59,000.  A further £20,000 for Subhead C will be needed to cover the increased volume of postal and telecommunications activity now anticipated. The commission will also incur some additional staffing costs, which will increase Subhead A1 by £18,000, and travel and incidental costs will also rise by £10,000.  In order to proceed with the competitions, therefore, the Civil Service Commission will require additional funding of £107,000 in 1989, which will have to be met by a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>With these comments I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to thank the Minister for his informative statement.  The Fine Gael Party accept the Estimate and the explanation given by the Minister for the Estimate.  I presume the Minister, in the time allocated, will have a short time to reply and I would like to ask him a number of questions.  I do not need to praise the honesty and effectiveness of the Irish Civil Service.  It is something we, on all sides of the <Col N="1153" /> House, recognise.  It is true to say that the embargo has made life difficult for many of our excellent civil servants.  Certainly the public finances are now in a position whereby the Minister, while not removing the embargo, can have a more enlightened view towards its application and I understand he intends to do that.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, first of all, the estimated number of people who he envisages will be taken on in the Civil Service and in local authorities in 1990.  I understand he said the intention is to fill posts in accordance with natural wastage but I presume there is an estimate for that.  Secondly, the Minister said he wants to reduce the figures for the Civil Service as a whole from 26,800 at present to the 1977 figure.  Will he give the 1977 figure? I am sure the Minister realises that it was not simply job creation measures that increased the figure to 33,000.  A multiplicity of new programmes were also introduced.  It is not fair to the Civil Service at large to simply say we are going to bring the numbers back to the 1977 rate without taking into account the programmes which were in some instances created to make jobs for the civil servants but in other instances were legitimate programmes introduced as a matter of policy by a number of Governments.  I do not think it is sufficient to say that the number will be reduced to the 1977 level. The Minister has to justify the numbers he intends to employ by reference to the programmes undertaken by those civil servants.</P>

    <P>Thirdly, has the Minister a figure as to the complement of civil servants in each Department?  As I understand it, the embargo always operated on the basis that you could not hire to fill vacancies but that pre-supposed the fact that the vacancy existed and if the vacancy existed one was of the opinion that it would be filled at some stage.  If it is the Minister's intent to go back to the 1977 figures he must have a total figure in mind for the Civil Service as a whole but he also must have a figure in mind for each Government Department.  Consequently, it will not be possible any more in reply to a Dáil question to say there are so many <Col N="1154" /> unfilled vacancies because if they are unfilled someone intends filling them. Can the Minister give the figures for each Department under this new regime and also the number of positions at the different Civil Service grades which he intends filling?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister run a cost-benefit analysis on the early retirement scheme? Now that he is rehiring, it seems it is unlikely that some of the early retirement schemes that were introduced over the last two years will be of benefit whatsoever, taking into account the lump sum involved and the cost of paying it back in the years to come to the Central Bank, and also taking into account the cost of pensions and the cost of re-employment to fill vacancies which are in many instances because of the early retirement schemes right across the public service.  Has the Minister any plans to evaluate the cost-benefit of the early retirement scheme? As he knows, many of the Civil Service and public service unions would like to see early retirement schemes continued or reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any plan to hive off parts of the public service or the Civil Service and run them under semi-State organisations?  I am thinking in particular of a proposal by my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe.  The Land Registry is in a frightful mess at the moment.  Every Deputy in the country knows that because we get representations all the time.  It seems to make a lot more sense to take responsibility for the Land Registry from the Department of Justice and set up a semi-State organisation.  I would like the Minister's view on that.  Apart from simply reducing the numbers in the Civil Service to the 1977 level, has the Minister any intention of taking out segments of the Civil Service, as was done with An Post and An Bord Telecom, and setting them up as semi-State bodies?</P>
    <P>I know the time is very limited.  I would like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for being patient with me.  I have given the Minister a number of rapid fire questions.  I do not expect all the answers <Col N="1155" /> today but I am sure he will find an opportunity of answering them in the weeks to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Supplementary Estimate has been brought before the House in this form today highlights the very strange manner in which we are conducting our affairs in so far as the public service is concerned.  In the first instance, we set about organising early retirement schemes to reduce the numbers in the Civil Service and thereby paying out substantial amounts in capital sums.  Having paid that money and reduced Civil Service numbers we now find, a very short period later, that we are setting about recruiting again.  Did the Minister not think about these things in advance and plan accordingly?  I find that extremely strange.</P>
      <P>I and my party are totally unhappy with the embargo on Civil Service recruitment which is in no way diminished or assuaged by the rather pathetic indication given here of a very limited recruitment.  As the Minister said in his statement, there has been a very considerable improvement in the budgetary position.  We believe there is room now for a more appreciable recruitment in those areas of service which are so seriously and gravely in need.  I am not just talking about benefits to the Exchequer; I am talking about the needs of people for a health service, the fact that lives are put at risk and people continue to suffer pain because there are inadequate numbers in the health sections of the Civil Service and the fact that many children are not getting a proper education by reason of inadequate numbers of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One comes in here at the Order of Business every day and hears Deputies from all sides of the House constantly raising the question of the need for remedial teachers in certain schools but, of course, the answer is always the same. The embargo applies in a thoughtless manner.  What are these graduate teachers and health personnel doing?  They are making up the 35,000 or 40,000 a year who are emigrating.  The benefit of their <Col N="1156" /> expertise is lost to us.  Do not tell me we have not got the money to employ them. There are adequate resources to provide a proper health service and a proper education service for our people.  Of course, a change in policy is needed from the kind of policies advocated by this Government and their immediate predecessor. No doubt the advent of the Progressive Democrats will not help matters. What we need is a change of policy, for the Government to take a grip of the economy and get money from where they can to provide the proper services the people need.  The Minister is offering us nothing here with his modest suggestion. In limited fields he is going to take on more.  I do not mind that.  That is fine as far as it goes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the Land Registry and rightly so.  This is a service which not only pays for itself but makes a profit, Yet, it is starved of the resources it needs to carry out its business in a proper way.  I do not accept the idea that we should hive it off, as though that would change or improve anything.  That is not what is needed.  The staff there do a fine job with the resources available to them.  The Land Registry which makes a profit should be given the resources necessary to provide the service for which it is paid.</P>
    <P>In regard to the number of staff needed by the Revenue Commissioners, anybody in their right mind would know that no matter how many staff members one takes on, that office will show a profit. Why then did we have to wait until now to say that because the economy has improved, we will take on a certain number of extra people?  If we had taken them on last year they would have more than paid for themselves.  However, we set ourselves this hard and fast rule and put in place an embargo.  We did not say: What is needed?  What will show a profit? or what will we do?  We said that the number in 1981 was 32,000, that the number at present is 26,800 and that we want to get back to the 1977 figure and pay no attention to what this means in real and practical terms so far as the Exchequer is concerned.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient time to deal with the matter before us.  Although the Vote is being dispatched with such speed, this is nonetheless an important issue.  It highlights that the embargo which successive Governments have used as an excuse for not engaging in public service reform was always a very crude instrument.  The Minister has dealt with the embargo as if that was the only question at stake.  In fact, it is far more likely that we have been precipitated into this position as a result of the chickens coming home to roost under the early retirement/voluntary severance scheme in the public service as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what precisely the Minister intends in terms of the number of recruits in 1990.  My understanding is that people will be recruited within existing numbers.  This would seem to suggest that it will deal only with what the Minister refers to as the question of natural wastage. In fact not only has the early retirement/voluntary severance scheme proved to be counterproductive, in terms of the administration of the Civil Service and the public service, but it has also been economically wrong.  This is seen to be the case more every day.</P>
      <P>In the early days strong Government, in the Thatcherite mould, getting public expenditure under control and making cuts, impressed the money markets.  The result is that terrible gaps have been created in both the Civil Service and the public service.  Key personnel have left and they cannot be replaced.  People have also been given golden handshakes to ride off into the sunset and to set up businesses, sometimes in competition with elements of the public sector.  The key roles they performed cannot now be performed because the posts cannot be filled.  This is especially true in the case of senior professional and technical staff whose decisions are critical to the economic interests of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> At the lower end of the scale, typists are leaving the Civil Service because their pay is not commensurate with what they can receive in the private sector.  I ask the Minister to tell us what proportion of the appointments he has referred to will be outside the Civil Service proper? There are serious gaps in the public service which require attention.  I ask the Minister to tell us if they are being tackled now.  I also ask him to indicate if he has looked at the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on recruitment to the Civil Service and if any of the recommendations made in that report have been taken on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Vote.  I also welcome the loosening of the embargo.  It is important that the Civil Service is not alone efficient but be seen to be efficient and giving value for money.  In that sense the relaxation of the embargo is essential, but it carries with it an admission that the inducing of people out of both the Civil Service and the public service is a mistake and leads to gaps being created in the service which cannot be filled and proves to be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The role of the Civil Service Commission in setting up the procedures for recruitment in, for example, the local authorities needs to be examined.  There are critical shortages in several areas in local authorities.  To some extent we have seen a reversal of the practice in the Civil Service where technical personnel have left the service because they can do better in the private sector, and many frontline staff in the local authorities have been left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments in relation to the Supplementary Estimate.  I would like to deal very quickly with some of the points which have been raised.  Deputy Noonan referred to some matters which will require a little more work but we will be <Col N="1159" /> happy to communicate with him about the spread in numbers in various Departments. I am sure he will bear with us in that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the early retirement voluntary severance scheme, comments made by Deputy Rabbitte and others would seem to indicate that everybody thinks it was a huge mistake.  I totally reject that.  Far from it.  A cost benefit analysis of the early retirement scheme has been carried out.  I have not got definite information as yet but it certainly looks at this stage as if it was a worth-while exercise.  Let us put this matter into perspective.  Total staff in the Civil Service in 1981 numbered 32,000.  In 1977, the number was 26,000 approximately. Today the number is 26,800. Therefore, the figure is down about 5,200 or about 16 per cent of the total. One thousand one hundred people availed of the early retirement scheme in the Civil Service &mdash; not the wider public service &mdash; at a total cost of £26 million, leaving a saving of £19 million per annum.  How could anyone in this House seriously suggest, as has been done by some speakers, that it was one big mistake?</P>
      <P>Secondly, those in the Civil Service who availed of the early retirement scheme were over 50 years of age and they were not replaced.  What brought down the numbers to today's figure was the Government decision of March 1987 to not alone continue to fill one post in three but not to recruit replacements for those who retired.  We should not run away with the idea that it was a big mistake.  As I said, there were only 1,100 retirements from the Civil Service and each officer was over 50 years of age.  I think someone's perspective is badly out of line with the reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with the Civil Service, as this is the area of recruitment, but the wider public service is a different story.  I will give some of the figures: in 1981 in the total public <Col N="1160" /> service, including the Civil Service, there were 212,600 but by 1989 the number was down to 198,000, down about 14,600.  On an initial cost analysis and without going into detail, the scheme is quite clearly not only paying for itself but paying for itself quite fast.</P>
      <P>What is involved in the present recruitment is not a replacement for those on early retirement but if you had listened carefully to the speech, it would have been clear to you that recruitment is at the lower grades and that in this case we are recruiting at the first entry grades.  In no circumstances can this recruitment be attributed to replacements for those who left on early retirement.  As I have said, I have approached the matter in a pragmatic way.  People will be replaced where such replacement can be of genuine benefit to the Exchequer on a continual basis. In fact, one sector of the Civil Service got extra staff this year on a return of a 29:1 basis.  One would be absolutely foolish not to move in a situation where there is such a benefit to be got for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan raised the question of the Land Registry.  I accept that there are real problems in the Land Registry which are being examined between my Department and the Department of Justice. The question of who should be the final guarantor of title to property in this country is in my view a matter which should remain with the State.</P>
      <P>Those are the basic points I wanted to make.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Taylor say on behalf of the Labour Party that he would not welcome even limited recruitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My apologies, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I was delayed by <Col N="1162" /> reason of being on a deputation to the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I am not going to make a big issue of this amendment which relates to the Title of the Bill.  In Part II of the Bill, sections 3 to 9 deal extensively with the welfare of children so I think it only fitting that the Title of the Bill would encompass the full scope of its direction and not give the impression that it deals exclusively with control, care and supervision proceedings purely for children at risk.  We want to be more positive about the Bill and put it in the context that it will set forward standards <i>vis-à-vis</i> both family care and alternative care for children.  The present Title is limited.  The 1985 Bill produced by the former Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond, was called the Child Care and Protection Bill.  I would consider the Title, The Child Care and Welfare Bill, to be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>This is the first of 100 amendments in my name.  I do not wish to obstruct the passage of the Bill nor to make very lengthy contributions on each of the amendments but I would ask the Minister in return to give a commitment on Report Stage to be flexible and open in regard to amendments put forward by all sides of the House so that we can have as harmonious a passage of this Bill as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unusual that the first amendment should be an amendment to the Title of the Bill.  Because the Bill was so long in gestation and is of such importance, and because there are so many interested groups watching its progress, we have to be careful as to how we present it.</P>
      <P>For many years, we have been looking at the question of reforming, in a comprehensive way, our laws relating to children's welfare.  For that reason, there is some merit in being positive in the way we start off the job we are embarking on today.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Title of the Bill as proposed by Mr. Barry Desmond initially was changed to the Title that is now before us, whether it was simply for change sake, but there is a continuity in the three Bills, the 1985 and the 1987 <Col N="1163" /> Bills published in my own name and this one.  We are seeking to regulate and protect children in a very narrow way but, in an all-encompassing way, to seek to better the state of children and improve their welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Adding one word to a prepared Bill should not be a matter of major debate.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.  I would prefer the title, Child Care and Welfare Bill, rather than Child Care and Protection Bill.  We are talking about welfare over a very broad area.</P>
      <P>When we look at the history of this Bill, at how far back it goes in terms of reports, commissions, proposals, Private Members' Bills, etc., we cannot feel too happy.  This Bill is long overdue.  I do not wish to labour that point.  I did not speak on Second Stage, as I have just come back to the Dáil, and I do not intend to make a Second Stage type speech but I would like to put in context the background to this very important Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the original task force report dealt with care over a very broad area.  I have great hope for the Bill in this Minister's hands but let us look at the time it has taken to bring the Bill &mdash; from the time the task force were set up in 1974.  I will read the terms of reference of the Task Force on Child Care Services into the record: (1) to make recommendations on the extension and improvement of services for deprived children and children at risk; (2) to prepare a new Children's Bill updating and modernising the law in relation to children; (3) to make recommendations on the administrative reforms that may be necessary to give effect to proposals at 1 and 2 above.  The terms of reference of this task force which brought out an interim report in 1975 and the main report in 1980 are as valid today as then. It is now 1989 when we are coming to grips and tackling the problems.  I hope the Minister, in his approach, will be very open and generous and be prepared to listen carefully to amendments from this side and to consider them on their merit. <Col N="1164" /> There has been a great deal of consultation with interested groups, with organisations and units working with children and in child care.  I consider that we are bringing forward the very vest proposals in the interests of children.  We must bear in mind that this legislation should be absolutely child centred.  It has to be positive in terms of what is needed for children and not necessarily looking at how we can punish parents or put sanctions on them.  The Bill has to be positive in the context of children's needs.  Central to all our discussions has to be the recognition that the greatest problems against children are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy Howlin that the title being given to this Bill is not being done for the sake of change, far from it.  The expression &ldquo;child care&rdquo; is widely used and well understood.  For example, some years ago there was the task force on child care services and also the Status of Children Bill.  In this Bill reference is made to child care advisory committees.  Even Deputy Yates in some of his amendments refers to child care authorities.  We want to give a clear identity to this Bill as a child care Bill.  The word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; has many connotations and broad meanings and we do not want to mix up the Bill with any other Bill pertaining to children.  I think Deputy Yates in one or two of his other amendments wished to include the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; and I shall be as generous as I can in relation to those.  We want to ensure the integrity, specificity and identity of the Bill and consequently I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this point but I think there was a consensus that what is being sought was not unreasonable and Deputy Howlin rightly referred to his Bill of 1987. The first section of the Explanatory Memorandum to that Bill states that the purpose of the Bill is to promote the welfare of children, especially children who are at risk from a variety of causes. If at the end of the day what we want in each community care area, county and city are childcare centres to which children can be referred, from which teams <Col N="1166" /> can operate, and a clear vision of the care and welfare services children need, I would not have thought it unreasonable to seek the inclusion of this word in the title of the Bill.

That does not mean Deputy Sherlock is precluded from referring to what is in his amendment when we are discussing the section.</P>

      <P>Having ruled out of order an amendment which merely asks that following the enactment of the Bill it should be brought into effect within 12 months and stating that such an amendment is out of order on the grounds that it would be a charge on the Exchequer means only one thing to my simple way of thinking, that is, the Minister and the Government have no intention of bringing in the Bill.</P>

      <P>What the amendment proposed would interfere with the Minister's discretion in the matter of when he introduces the Bill. One cannot do that in an amendment. Secondly, there is the question of a potential charge on the Exchequer and I would ask Deputy Sherlock to accept that.  It gives me no pleasure to say that and I only say it because it is required of me under Standing Orders.  If the Deputy looks at Standing Orders he will see that that is the case.  The Deputy is entitled to proceed now to discuss the amendment. He can comment on his disappointment, if he so desires, but he will not get any further reply from me on it.  The Chair does what it is obliged to do and at times explains why, although it is not required of it, and I hope the Deputy now accepts that what I say is the exact and true position.</P>

      <P>As pointed out by a previous speaker this legislation has been awaited in the State since 1974 and to put in a condition in an amendment which provides that it would be brought into effect within 12 months of being enacted should be considered to be reasonable in view of the fact that there is such a demand for the Bill.  I merely want to make the point, which creates a great suspicion in my mind, that the Health Mental Service Act, 1981, which was enacted in this House has not been brought into effect, as was indicated in reply to a question in May.  Many other Bills have been enacted here which have not been brought into effect.  Rejecting the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan and myself because it seeks to have this Bill brought into effect within 12 months is a clear indication of the policy of passing Bills in this House and <Col N="1168" /> leaving them on the shelf.  That is what is going to happen to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 1, which is the Short Title and Commencement, let me take up what has been said by Deputy Sherlock.  This is a unique Bill which covers an area that has been neglected for 80 years &mdash; since the Children Act 1908 when we consider that there has been 20 years of debate going further back than instanced by Deputy Sherlock to the Tuairim Committee Report of 1966, through the Kennedy report of 1970 to the then Minister for Education, through the task force on child care services set up by a predecessor of mine, Labour TD for Wexford, Brendan Corish, which reported in 1981, and when we consider that this area has been the subject of two previous Bills already alluded to &mdash; one presented by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Barry Desmond and the other in my own name in 1987 &mdash; it is not unreasonable that there would be some need for an assurance that this Bill will come into operation as speedily as possible.  It is in the hands of the Minister now replying to simply state the Government's intentions in this regard.  A simple assurance that the Bill will be brought into operation in three months, six months or 12 months would, I am quite sure, satisfy all Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with the last two speakers.  If this amendment had been in order we would have supported it.  If it is any consolation to Deputy Sherlock, I too received a letter containing a whole series of amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;relating to the setting up of child care authorities, national children's trusts, etc. all of which are liquidated at the stroke of a pen.  This is extremely irritating and I hope whoever made this decision will be aware of the annoyance that is felt on the Opposition Benches because of this rule.  It seems to be interpreted in a very rigid way because <Col N="1169" /> in some cases we are clearly talking about redeployment or representatives in some cases, which I will come to later, and puts Opposition Deputies in a strait-jacket.</P>
      <P>Dealing specifically with section 1 I believe the Minister and the Government have no credibility.  We have the Kennedy report since 1970.  Because of a series of events, we had the change of Government in 1981-82, and that was a period when little or no legislation was passed.  There was no good reason the last Government should not have enacted this legislation in 1987.  The Taoiseach often sat where the Minister of State is now sitting and gave commitments that this would be taken before the summer recess but it was not taken, and that was after consideration, due process and all the messing we had on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Depending on the Minister's reply, I feel this is serious enough for us to challenge a vote on section 1.  We should get a commitment from the Minister as to what the operation date would be.  Nearly all the groups we met &mdash; organisations directly involved in child care facilities, health personnel and so on &mdash; are totally frustrated by the delays.  Some would even compromise the finer points of detail in the Bill if it meant the passing of this legislation could be expedited; but all this will count for nothing if we do not have some commitment and some operation date.  While it may be out of order for us to specify an operation date, I understand it is not out of order for the Minister of State to table an amendment with a definite charge on the Exchequer. As a measure of the Government's good faith, I ask the Minister to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage with a definite unambiguous commencement date, because it is more than 80 years since we had the last child care legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's credibility is very poor.  No later than tomorrow, I understand, the Supreme Court is to give a further detailed judgment which raises a question mark over every child taken into care by the health boards, and the legality of the procedures under which that was <Col N="1170" /> done.  I would have thought that in those circumstances the Minister would give a commitment.  If he does not we will have no redress but to oppose this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I feel very disappointed that there are no promises as to commencement in this section.  It is a very bad start to the debate.  If there is no commencement provision this begs the question as to whether any money is to be voted to implement the necessary new provisions in this legislation.  This Bill is aimed at bringing the social agencies dealing with children, the health boards and a number of other agencies, out of the stone age and into something that resembles the civilised democratic treatment of children.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister look at what was done in the Status of Children Bill.  There amendments were brought in and changes were made willingly by me as Minister, and there were commencement dates and proposals in regard to what needed to be done after the passing of the Bill.  Of course, there will be commitments which will cost money.  That is the whole point.  It is about time we allocated real funds to child care services. Surely provision can be made in the Estimates for next year.  I do not think the Government should be allowed to slide out of that.  We have had very good notice of this Bill and we know the provisions in it.  If estimates are needed there are plenty of people prepared to send them in.  This is a fundamental aspect of this Bill and I would ask the Minister to come forward with some proposals on it.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the rules of court, which is an important aspect to legislation.  As we know, the last Private Members' Bill on judicial separation was passed six months ago and there are still no rules of court to enable it to be put into effect.  This is a fundamental area and we should have some commitment from the Minister on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me interrupt Deputy Garland.  The Office of the Ceann Comhairle adjudicates on amendments in respect of their appropriateness under Standing Orders.  The Minister has nothing to do with it, but the Deputy will learn.  We appreciate that all new Deputies do not take Standing Orders for private reading; perhaps they should.  You will appreciate that any amendment, under any Government, that can be interpreted as a potential charge is automatically ruled out of order by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but there is a saving clause here which says that &ldquo;unless a motion postponing the coming into effect of any part or section has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. That gives the Minister an opportunity, if the funds are not there, to bring a motion before the House to further delay the implementation of the Bill.  That surely seems reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that neither I, my colleague the Minister for Health, nor the Government want to delay this Bill one moment.  We want this Bill enacted as quickly as possible but we must do so in a reasonable, practical and rational manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said the Minister and the Government had no credibility.  As far as I am concerned, what happened in the past happened.  I am in this job a very short time but I believe I have credibility and I take no responsibility for any decisions taken in the past.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave a firm commitment in this House that the Child Care Bill would be brought forward and on the first day back he gave a commitment to Deputy De Rossa that it would be introduced this week.  Parents, children and the courts are waiting for the Bill. We should be pleased to have an opportunity to debate its provisions in a reasonable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas it will be an enabling <Col N="1172" /> device for decisions to be taken.  It will be a clear indicator of what needs to be done in the area of child care.  I should like to outline the background to the legal position pertaining to the Bill and to ask Members to consider what happens when other Bills are passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is not usual to set a deadline for the implementation of provisions of a Bill.  Given the scale and complexity of the Bill it is not realistic to think that all sections can be brought into effect within 12 months of its enactment, no matter how desirable that may be.  I am aware that some of the amendments have been ruled out of order and I regret that as much as any Member.  I would like to have had an opportunity of debating the merits of those amendments with Members but I bow to the superior wisdom of the senior officer of the House and accept the decision made by him.</P>
    <P>In many ways the work of my Department, and the health boards, will only begin when the Bill is enacted.  When they are clear on its final shape and contents a huge amount of planning and organising will be required to bring the Bill into effect.  For example, all the social workers and other relevant staff will have to be briefed on the new legal procedures in relation to the placement of children in care and they will have to familiarise themselves with the different types of orders and procedures that the Bill creates. It may also be necessary to recruit additional social work staff in view of the additional demands that the Bill imposes on health boards.  Deputy Fennell made an important point in regard to the rules of court and the regulations that would have to be introduced.  New regulations will have to be drafted in relation to the placement of children in foster care and in residential care.  There will also be a need for new regulations before Part VI dealing with the supervision of pre-school services can be brought into force.  New regulations will also be required in relation to the inspection of children's residential centres under Part VIII.  It will also be necessary for new rules of court to be made by the appropriate judicial authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Members will understand that when the Bill is passed by both Houses and signed by the President the officials of my Department, liaising with officials of the Department of Justice, will draft the new regulations and that court officers will draft the new judicial regulations.  That will take some time.  It would be dangerous for us to put any time limit on this work.  We must ensure that we have the best possible legislation and that the rules and regulations are interpreted in the most positive way possible.  I appeal to Members to be reasonable and not to press the issue.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister's excuses can be described as anything else.  I cannot understand how the Minister can hold the view that it will take 12 months to brief social workers.  I have been advised by social workers about these issues.  They have told me that they do not know what to do when confronted with such problems.  They are waiting anxiously for legislation so that they can do their job properly.  It will not take 12 months to brief social workers. All they want is the legislation to back their decisions.  The Minister has not given us any grounds to support his argument. I do not think we are being unreasonable in requesting a starting date.  If the Minister means business he will name a date.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response and we will be pressing him on this issue.  If the Minister had consulted with social workers and others who have been calling for this legislation he would understand their position.  Having read the report of the task force they are aware of what will be expected of them under the Bill.  I do not think it will take 12 months to consult with them.  I put it to the Minister that <Col N="1174" /> even if the Bill is passed speedily by this House it will be the middle of next year before it is sent for signature by the President. The Minister has said that consultations will take about 12 months after it has been signed and in that event we are talking about the middle of 1992 before the legislation will be in place.</P>

      <P>I listened with growing dismay to what the Minister of State had to say.  If we are to have a division of opinion on the first section we will be falling at the first hurdle.  I do not think there is a shred of substance in the reasons given by him as to why he cannot give a commitment on the commencement date.  The Minister told us that planning was required but the Department have been planning this Bill for 20 years.  The Minister told us that it will be necessary to brief certain people but the people involved could brief the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>They could and have briefed me.  They have been clamouring for this Bill for 20 years.  They have inundated us all with comments on every line of the Bill.  They do not need to be briefed. Certainly, they do not need 12 months to be briefed on its provisions.  I am fearful that the real reason the Minister is refusing to announce a commencement date is that he does not have the money or a commitment from the Government to provide the necessary finance to put into place the various provisions in the Bill.  This section is fundamental and it is important that the Minister should give a commitment in regard to it.  This side of the House will <Col N="1175" /> give the Minister every latitude and support in regard to the Bill.  We are seeking a commitment from him that within a given number of months after the enactment of the Bill its provisions will be brought into effect.</P>
      <P>I am suprised that the Minister has run a mile from that in his contribution.  I regard this as the most important Bill introduced in the House since I was elected a Member.  I appeal to the Minister to tell us that the necessary resources will be provided and to announce a commencement date.  He must do so if he is to retain the confidence of Members.  The Government should indicate that they are serious about the provisions of the Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to announce a commencement date today he should give an undertaking to give a date on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health is not present to deal with the Bill.  Without any disrespect to the Minister of State, I view his absence as an indication of a lack of concern by the Government for the Bill.  His predecessor, Deputy Desmond, pioneered the Bill.  The Minister of State will be unpopular with his Chief Whip, the Assistant Government Chief Whip, Deputy Browne, and others if Fianna Fáil and PD Deputies have to be brought in regularly during the course of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.  Every time his officials hand him a script he reads it out but he should use his own discretion.  A very good case has been made about the urgency of this matter. The Opposition are prepared to consider an alternative deadline to 12 months but the Minister did not give us any date. Instead, we heard a load of waffle about planning, consultations, redirection and <Col N="1176" /> so on.  His attitude is unacceptable.  If one or two sections will cause a problem in regard to time the Minister should adopt the suggestions put forward by Deputy Sherlock.  The Government could bring forward a motion postponing implementation of one or two provisions if they so desire and allow the main thrust of the Bill to go ahead.  We are throwing the baby out with the bath water and, quite frankly, I think the Minister's excuses are lame and spurious.  It is regrettable, on a Bill that has the wholehearted support of this House which we are anxious to expedite, that at the first opportunity the Minister is not prepared to give any commitment about resources or any commitment about implementation in this decade.  It is unacceptable and unless the Minister can give a commitment in his final summary on this section we will be voting against it.</P>

The Minister stated in his previous contribution that it would be dangerous of us to put a time limit on this Bill.  I put it to the Minister that the reverse is the truth.  It would be dangerous and irresponsible of us to allow this Bill to be enacted open-endedly with provisions that are lauded by this House but which may never be put into place.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify a number of things at the outset and in particular in relation to what Deputy Yates has said that the Minister for Health is not here to take this Bill.  Unlike when the Deputy's Government was in office, the Ministers of State in this Government have a role to play.  By decision and by statutory instrument the Government have allocated certain responsibilities in the Department of Health to me to act in that position.  I have responsibility to take this Child Care Bill through this House, through the Seanad and then to see to its implementation.</P>

In the context of what we are talking about the Minister of State can put in whatever sections will come into effect six months after the passing of this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief point of order in relation to it.  I understand that the grounds for that decision were that it would involve a potential charge on the Revenue.  I deliberately framed that amendment so that it would not involve a potential charge on the Revenue.  The basis of all the prepatatory work on this Bill, the 1970 Kennedy report and so on, was that the big weakness in Irish child care services was that the Departments of Education, Health and Justice were not interconnected. I was seeking to redeploy representatives of the Departments of Education and Justice into the workings of the health board which would not involve an additional charge.  However, I will confine my remarks to the section in general, if that is agreeable with the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine, Deputy.  I should say for the information of the Deputy and the House in respect of not merely the Deputy's amendment but other amendments which have been ruled out of order on the grounds that they involve a potential charge on the Revenue, that these amendments which are ruled out of order either proposed the setting up new bodies, authorities or <Col N="1183" /> schemes which would obviously create a potential charge or impose additional statutory functions or mandatory obligations, including the time limit for the commencement of the Act, on the health boards which are 80 per cent funded by the Exchequer and consequently there would be a potential charge on the Revenue. This explanation is merely for clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to differ. Amendment No. 4 and the other amendments deal with foster care.  In amendment No. 4 I put down the definition of foster parent in order to raise this issue because as I understand it there is no definition of &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; in law.  I would like clarification from the Minister of State as to the definition of &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; under law at present.  It is agreed across the board that after the family home, the next most desirable form of alternative care is alternative family surroundings which provide emotional support, homeliness and togetherness as opposed to what an institutional or residential centre would provide.  It is the practice of many health boards to engage foster resource groups and foster parents to cater for children who have been the subject of care orders and legal proceedings by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking to establish rights for foster parents so that their role is fully recognised under law and I am seeking to amend section 29 to define the circumstances whereby children can be taken out of the care of foster parents.  If a health board suddenly decide to remove children from foster parents, the foster parents should have the right of appeal. It is all right to remove children where the contract has ended or where the child is no longer subject to a care order, but there have been cases where, for no reason, the health boards have removed children from foster parents.  There should be some appeal mechanism there. Where there has been a long period of foster care, for instance, some years, surely the foster parents should have the right to adopt the child.  I would like those <Col N="1184" /> rights to be set out.  I would also like foster parents in certain circumstances to have a right to free legal aid.</P>
    <P>I have had detailed discussions, as I am sure other Deputies have, with the Irish Foster Care Association who have made a detailed submission to the Department on this Bill.  I think it is generally recognised by social workers that the area of foster resource groups is the key growth area for deprived children who cannot have a family background of their own for whatever reason.  I would ask the Minister first to clarify the present legal position of foster parents and, secondly, to meet these subsequent amendments and changes to section 29.  Section 29 of the original Bill sets out the circumstances surrounding the removal of children from foster care or residential care.  In many cases there would be an emotional attachment to stepbrothers, stepsisters, the new found parents and so on.  These emotional bonds are very important and it is absolutely vital that we make legal provision for those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important area and I look forward to the comments of the Minister regarding the current legal position pertaining to it.  Many children are placed in foster care at a very young age and for many of them in their formative years they recognise their foster parents as their only parents. Obviously the bonding between the foster parents and the child is such that there should be some very clearly defined mechanism if the health board remove the child from foster care.  There must be in natural justice some right of appeal for the foster parents to the health board in circumstances where there is not mutual agreement.  I have other comments to make, not only on the section but in relation to this area, but first I am anxious to give the Minister a chance to elaborate on his thinking and that of the Department in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on Child Care Services, in their final report, devoted a considerable amount of time <Col N="1185" /> to the whole area of children who need foster care, the social work services in foster care and recruitment, selection and remuneration of foster parents.  It indicates that there has been a time-honoured recognition that there are some families who can cater for children other than their own, who have a great degree of love and affection for and a general commitment to children and who are willing to open their doors and give the best kind of care outside the child's own family to children who need it.  Foster parents have been the poor relations in the whole child care area.  We should recognise them as a very valuable and natural family resource that should be used to a far greater degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments put forward by Deputy Yates, particularly amendment No. 148 which provides for the right of appeal against an order of the health board whenever the board would seek to remove a child from the care of the foster parents.  The position of foster parents needs much closer attention under the Bill.  When foster parents are caring for a child, the child should not be interfered with except in exceptional circumstances equal to those that might exist if a health board were making an effort to remove a child from the natural parents.  The rights of foster parents should be recognised fully, if not given an equal status with those of natural parents, particularly where a relationship has developed between the child and the parents.  For that reason the concept of an appeal against the decision obviously should exist in law and that amendment must be supported.  I would like to hear more from Deputy Yates or others who support the concept as to how one would establish that right of appeal, how it would be put in place, at what level within the board would it be heard and who would have the right of audience in those proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the idea that legal aid should be made available to foster parents where they are perhaps unwittingly, or certainly through no fault of <Col N="1186" /> their own, drawn into these types of situations where they must protest, appeal or litigate in respect of their rights with regard to the care of their children.  Similar amendments by The Workers' Party to different areas of the Bill relating to the provision of legal aid &mdash; because not only the foster parents but the children also are affected in these situations &mdash; have been ruled out of order by the Chair by reason of the potential charge they may represent on the Exchequer.  Nonetheless, that does not get us away from the fact that this is an issue we should address generally during the course of this Bill as regards what the State proposes to do in terms of providing additional resources to the Legal Aid Board to enable them to give meaningful effect to this legislation.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the amendments which are eminently sensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to these five amendments I would say that the existing law in relation to foster care is set out in the Boarding out of Children Regulations, 1983.  These regulations set out the respective rights and responsibilities of health boards and foster parents and will be updated when this Bill is passed into law.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; is not used in the Bill as published and the only purpose of this amendment is to facilitate later amendments to section 29 from Deputy Yates which relate to the circumstances in which children may be removed from foster care by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 enables a health board to remove children whom they have placed in foster care or residential care and requires them to do so if so directed by the Minister.  I do not expect that this ministerial power would be used often; however, it might prove useful if the Minister received complaints about the care of a child and his inquiries indicated that it would be in the child's interests to be removed.  Section 29 (3) requires a person having care of a child to deliver up the child when requested to do so by a health <Col N="1187" /> board and provides that it would be an offence to refuse or fail to do so.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons a health board may need to remove a child from foster care; it may be to re-unite him with his parents or to remove him to a more appropriate placement.  It is also possible that a child might be unhappy with particular foster parents or that they might be neglecting him.  In most cases, I would expect that foster parents would readily co-operate with such removals; however, a health board must have the power to remove a child even if their co-operation is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that this is not a new provision.  Under section 56 of the Health Act, 1953, a health board can remove a child against the wishes of foster parents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates made a point with regard to free legal aid and expressed the desire that all foster parents should have recourse to it.  So far as I am aware &mdash; and there are eminent law people here &mdash; it is a matter for the courts to decide who should qualify for free legal aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Deputy went on too long.  Deputy McCartan mentioned the right of appeal and asked when would there be appeal and how. There is a number of sections in the Bill dealing with appeals.  I suggest that what Deputy Yates proposes in these amendments may have come a little early.  We can still debate section 29 when we come to that section, after having dealt with the other sections.  I cannot accept these amendments, as proposed, and I would respectfully suggest that we debate section 29 when we come to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some <Col N="1188" /> interest to what the Minister of State had to say.  One is loath to make to much of a meal out of this Bill in trying to deal with some of the major defects in it for fear that it may never see the light of day and never be enacted.  We faced a problem such as this with a previous measure in this House in 1985.  I am afraid that the Minister of State's comments clearly indicate a lack of any real understanding of the point Deputy Yates was making in the context of the amendments he has tabled.  First, for the Minister of State's information, where a foster parent wishes to retain custody of the child and where court proceedings are necessary, that foster parent can only get legal help or free legal aid if such help is extended to the foster parent by a Government law centre.  As we all know, the law centres at present are understaffed and overworked.  Some of them are taking no new clients and in Dublin I think there is a waiting list of three months in the context of seeking legal help.  They are not geared to catering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were you, I would talk to the Minister for Justice and ask him to arrange the opening of a law centre where it is needed.  There is a serious point about section 29; we are taking the amendments now, but it is not addressed by the Bill.  It is as follows.  There may be circumstances where a child is placed with foster parents by a health board and may be with foster parents for a lengthy period of time but the health board may reach a decision, on the basis of whatever social workers' assessments have been <Col N="1189" /> carried out, that the child should be returned to its natural parent or perhaps moved on to some other foster parent or set of foster parents.  The original foster parents might legitimately take the view that it is in the interests of the welfare of the child that that child remain with them.</P>
      <P>Health boards are not perfect in everything they do.  Social workers do not always assess situations correctly.  Foster parents who come to the conclusion that it is in the interests of the child that the child remains with them should not be criminalised by our law if they refuse to immediately comply with a request from the health board to hand over a child who has been with them for an extended period of time.  It is my recollection that the Children Bill, which came before this House in 1985, although seriously defective in a number of ways, sought to provide certain rights for foster parents in these circumstances but the rights were more than simply rights for foster parents, they were designed to protect the welfare of children.  Because the draftsman of the original Bill which came before this House made a mess of it, the Department seem to have taken the easy way out and have simply dropped sections which they could not draft properly. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foster parents who believe it is in the interests of the welfare of the child that that child remain with them following receipt of a request from the health board, could, under the current law, if they so wish, bring an application to the High Court to have a child made a ward of court and use the wardship jurisdiction of the court to seek to retain custody. The court would adjudicate on the issue on the basis of what is in the interests of the welfare of the child.  However, it would be adjudicating in very strange circumstances, in circumstances where the foster parents found themselves properly before the High Court but could at the same time under this section be prosecuted before the District Court for having committed a criminal offence by failing to comply with the direction of a health board.  That is an appalling mess <Col N="1190" /> of a section dealing with a serious issue with regard to the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>Foster parents who believe that it is in the interests of the welfare of the child that that child remain with them should not be faced with the legal expense of a High Court wardship application.  There is an alternative mechanism which could be used.  We could introduce a section into this Bill or accept the amendments tabled by my colleague, Deputy Yates. If the Minister of State does not want to accept those amendments there is another way of doing it and that would be to amend section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to extend to a foster parent as it should be defined by this Bill &mdash; we should define what we mean by a foster parent &mdash; the right to make application under that Act to the District Court or the Circuit Court, if necessary, for an order to retain custody of the child in circumstances where a health board wish to remove a child from them.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of instances this problem will not arise.  There can either be short term or long term foster care but in the majority of instances involving short term care the foster parents will only be too happy to know that the child can be properly handed back to its natural parents and no conflict will arise between the foster parents and the health board. In many instances where a child has been placed in long term foster care the child will remain in long term foster care but in some instances it may be possible to return a child to its natural parents or parent.  In those circumstances the possibility of conflict arises a little bit more.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases of children, placed in foster care but subsequently returned to their natural parents on judgments of social workers, who have been physically abused by the parent or parents to whom they were returned.  On occasion, social workers get it wrong.  There were two instances in 1981, early 1982, where children died at the hands of their parents because health boards failed to act and take them into care when they should have.  That was a scandal and I said so at the time but we did not make as much <Col N="1191" /> of it as other countries have done when similar incidents have occurred.  No commission was appointed to report.  I recall, in a very difficult Question Time in 1982 with the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Woods, who was then Minister for Health, trying to force the Government to publish a report on what went wrong in both those cases.</P>
    <P>Occasionally health boards and social workers get it wrong.  Occasionally, foster parents may get it right.  There will be cases under this legislation as there have been under the existing legislation when foster parents acting in good faith in the interests of the welfare of the child may form a view that the health board have got it seriously wrong and that it is in the interests of the welfare of the child that they retain custody of the child.  This Bill provides no mechanism for dealing with that.  It criminalises the behaviour of foster parents who seek to protect the welfare of the child in such circumstances and creates a peculiar legal dilemma in the event of they bringing wardship proceedings. It is a dilemma which should not arise.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister of State, if he will not accept my colleague's, Deputy Yates', amendment to look very seriously at providing additional provisions to section 29 to deal with this particular area in the context of foster care.  If we do not, having waited since 1908 to produce substantive legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confining myself solely to the issues which arise under Deputy Yates's amendments which apparently the Minister of State is not prepared to accept in the context of the discussion we are having.  I am doing so, rather than waiting until Report Stage, because we will not deal with section 29 in detail today.  Possibly we will come back to it next week or at a later stage.  I invite the Minister of State, if he is not prepared to accept the amendments which Deputy Yates has tabled, to consider bringing forward amendments at this stage, on Committee Stage, so that when we do reach section 29, we can take them.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will not accept the Deputy Yates's amendments I invite him to consider putting forward Committee Stage amendments at an early date so that when we reach section 29 we can take them.  The dilemma I am raising here can be dealt with by the insertion of an additional section which could quite properly be tabled before we reach section 29.  This new section could quite properly deal with the dilemma of the criminal proceedings that are envisaged and provide a mechanism to allow foster parents to properly bring an application under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  That could solve this problem which is worth solving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken from 1908 until now to bring this Bill before the House and there is a possibility that it may take another 80 years to amend this legislation, if we get it wrong this time.  Let us do a proper job.  This legislation has the good will of all sides of the House.  We will come to various sections in which a number of Members on different sides will raise similar points.  They are not just technical points but are important in protecting the welfare of children.  All of us are concerned that if we do not get the legislation right now we will not be able to put it right until the next century, because of the poor record of this House in <Col N="1193" /> reforming legislation in this area.  I exhort the Minister to look very seriously at the points I have been making.  It is not a party political point but a practical point relating to the welfare of children, the manner in which our fosterage and our children laws work in practice and the type of problems that are thrown up in practice and that people acting in good faith as foster parents may have to confront.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some points arising out of the Minister of State's reply.  Deputy Shatter referred to the Child Care Protection Act, 1985, and I now refer to sections 12 and 13 of that Act which deal with regulations on private foster care and the subsequent removal from private foster care.  This Act sets out the circumstances whereby such a removal would take place, that is, any premises or environment that would be detrimental, or would be likely to be detrimental, to the child, or any person who would be unfit to care for the child, or any person who, by reason of ill health, age or infirmity or other causes, is incapable of undertaking this care. There, detailed provisions were laid out, but now a similar section, section 29, simply says where a health board has placed a child in residential or in foster care they may at any time remove the child from the centre or from the care of any person with whom he was so placed under such an arrangement.  There is no right of appeal, no second guessing or anything.  If some social worker suddenly decided to change the situation it can be changed overnight and the child could be taken out of care.  Even more alarming is that the courts would not adjudicate on the removal from private care.  Section 29 states the health board may, if so required by the Minister, remove the child from the custody of the person with whom he was so placed.  What would the Minister know about the situation?  Quite frankly, I cannot understand the reason for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the regulations related to the 1983 regulations and if it was thought fit by the Department in 1985 to pursue a Bill with <Col N="1194" /> contents relating to foster care, why are they being dropped in 1989 when there is no subsequent change in the 1983 regulations? From a policy point of view, as far as I am concerned, it is an absolute priority that if alternative care to the natural parents is required, the next best is a family environment with other parents.  I have met foster parents and members of their organisations and I know of children who have been reared by foster parents &mdash; I know it is not right to generalise &mdash; but in the vast majority of cases those children live very happy and fulfilling lives in a family environment which they had not enjoyed previously and which certainly would not be open to them in a residential centre.  As far as I am concerned this is a priority. Not to have a definition of foster parents is a fundamental weakness in this Bill. As things stand, under section 29 children can be removed from the care of foster parents or from residential care but the earlier legislation set out in detail what circumstances would justify their removal.  That has been dropped.  Moreover, there is no jurisdiction for the court to decide whether there should be a removal from care and it is left to the Minister to decide.  We are seeking in amendment No. 148 to have a clearly defined procedure on removal from care. If that subequently means regulations are to be put in place for children who come in and out of foster care, so be it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the further issues I raised, the rights of adoption for foster parents, if after a period of fosterage they would have the right of adoption.  Has any consideration been given to this issue?  The Minister did not allude to this in his reply.  Unless we set out a clear right to free legal aid, at best, whether in the west or in Dublin, it will only be available in theory and not in practice.  I am disappointed that the Minister has essentially dismissed all these arguments, relied on the 1983 regulations and given no legal protection whatsoever to foster parents in view of the extensive growth of fosterage in this country and child divisions in the health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The Eastern Health Board have advised me that they have a clear preference for fostering as a form of alternative care.  Perhaps, as Deputy Shatter has stated, the actual drafting poses major difficulties but that is not a legitimate excuse.  I will be pressing if not the definition then amendment No. 148 at least and most likely the other amendments also.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give some commitment to introduce an amendment on Report Stage that would define the rights and limitations of those rights, of foster parents after a given period, or whatever is deemed to be fair, so that foster parents would know where they stand.  Once that provision is there, it will be possible for the health boards to deal with the matter accordingly.  One of the things we will come across time and time again in this Bill is the appalling lack of uniformity in child care services across the country.  The type of service you get very much depends on what part of the country you live.  Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we put in place mechanisms that will allow health boards to expand foster resource groups.  I believe this issue should not be evaded or avoided but should be confronted and legislated for.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that I strongly support the amendment and I think a very clear and cogent case has been put forward which has yet to be responded to in any adequate way by the Minister.  In relation to the amendment specifically before us, may I ask the Chair what would be the consequences of it being dropped in relation to subsequent amendments regarding foster care?</P>
      <P>Would the omission of the term &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; from the definition section have any consequential impact on including it subsequently in the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Chair.  Each amendment is dealt with as it appears on the Order Paper.  I thought the Deputy was going to inquire about the situation in <Col N="1196" /> respect of amendments Nos. 145, 146, 147 and 148.  They will be formally moved when we reach the appropriate section.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  What I am seeking by way of information from your good self, Sir, relates to the definition section of the Bill which is what we are dealing with.  If this definition is omitted from the definition section will it have any consequences for bringing up the further amendments in the name of Deputy Yates, amendments No. 145, 146, 147 and 148, when we reach section 29?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a further question.  Can the Chair assure us that should the amendment we are currently dealing with not be moved or should the section be moved and defeated, it would not mean consequently that the Chair would automatically rule out the moving of amendments Nos. 145, 146, 147 and 148?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the fact that they are taken together for discussion does not necessarily preclude that situation.  When we reach the amendments on section 29 the House will be advised that a discussion has already taken place but that will not prevent the Deputy in whose name the amendment appears of formally moving that amendment. Those amendments have not been moved; we can only have a discussion on one amendment at any time.  The amendment which has been moved is amendment No. 4.  For discussion purposes other amendments have been taken with it but they will be moved separately when they are reached on section 29.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I think <Col N="1197" /> the point Deputy Howlin is making &mdash; and this arises out of the Minister of State's reply &mdash; is that amendment No. 4 is consequential on putting amendments Nos. 145 to 148 into effect.  In other words, I could not move amendments Nos. 145 to 148 without amendment No. 4 standing.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at amendment No. 145 and assume it is negatived, then amendment No. 146 cannot be moved because what amendment No. 146 refers to would be no longer in the Bill.  That apart, nothing else in any other amendment would be affected in respect of the rejection of the amendment we have discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House but amendments Nos. 147 and 148 include the words &ldquo;foster parents&rdquo;.  The fact that there is no legal definition of a foster parent in the Bill does not preclude me from moving those amendments. Who is a foster parent?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Therefore, I think the interests of the Deputy and of the children concerned are well provided for in the Standing Orders as we have them here.  I would suggest that if we have exhausted discussion on <Col N="1198" /> amendments Nos. 4, 145, 146, 147 and 148 we should proceed with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We are far from concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank Deputy Shatter for his information on the free legal aid situation.  I would again make the point that what we have in section 29 is more or less a reenactment of section 56 of the 1953 Health Act.  Health boards have not been removing children arbitrarily from foster parents and I do not believe they are likely to begin to do so now.  Children are removed from foster parents only when the health board, having considered all the facts, are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child to do so.  As I said, health boards must have this power when and where it is necessary.</P>
      <P>A number of points were raised about adoption, particularly by Deputy Yates, and the rights of foster parents to adopt. This issue does not arise under this Bill. The Adoption Act which was introduced last year gives particular rights to foster parents to adopt children in certain circumstances. Deputy Shatter would be able to assure the House and, I am sure, Deputy Yates, that it is very difficult to go any further than this.  We will be discussing a fairly similar situation in relation to section 27.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, we will also deal with the matter under section 29.  I want to assure Deputies that before we reach section 29 I will look at this matter again in the light of the very sincere and broad contributions which have been made.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I do not believe the definition here should be inserted in the Bill at this stage.  It is too wide as it stands and could give rise to difficulties.  For example, the definition as proposed in the amendment, makes no reference to children being cared for on behalf of health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us a definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a commitment <Col N="1199" /> that I will examine this proposal in great detail and I hope I will be able to bring forward a definition for section 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister has said &mdash; I should like to get this absolutely clear in my mind before we move on &mdash; that there is no objection in principle to the Minister defining in this legislation a recognition of the concept of a foster parent?  I had to step out of the Chamber for a moment and I had not taken on board the full impact of what the Minister had said but the initial response he gave, that it was inappropriate and there were regulations elsewhere which would help to deal with the matter, seems to be rather weak.</P>
      <P>All the sections in Part V which deal with fosterage have been very carefully drafted so as not to use the words &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo;.  They refer to children being placed in foster care and premises provided for the purposes of foster care. Nowhere in the Bill is there an acknowledgement or use of the words &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo;.  I suspect there is more to what the Minister is trying to avoid then he is prepared to admit.  Perhaps it comes back to the need to address section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, to which Deputy Shatter has already referred.  I suspect there is a reluctance on the Minister's part to move towards recognising an equality of importance, in many instances, of the natural parent with the foster parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason &mdash; I want to get this clear before we depart from the debate on the definition section &mdash; I want to know the Minister's objection to the concept of foster parent being introduced into the Bill.  Even if we were to do the ridiculous and not provide in any legislative form in the subsequent sections for a role or function of foster parents what is wrong with defining a foster parent?  It is most innocuous.  Deputy Yates' definition of a foster parent is to be found in any other basic definition.  I do not wish to take away from his amendment.  I believe there is something far more fundamentally suspicious in what the Minister <Col N="1200" /> is attempting to avoid in hoping that we will not adopt a definition of foster parent or introduce the concept of a parent known as a &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a query with the Minister on which he might enlighten me.  The Minister said that adoption had to do only with section 29. Of course it might have and the Minister might clarify something which somewhat puzzles me in regard to the way in which this section will operate if foster parents do not have the right to make application to the courts to obtain custody and if their refusal to return a child amounts to criminal conduct.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me as to what would happen in the following situation.  Let us assume a child has been living with foster parents for 15 months and the foster parents use the mechanism of the Adoption Act, 1988, to seek to adopt that child and after they commence that process the health board social worker comes along and says &ldquo;the health board have decided that your child should now be returned to the original parents&rdquo; the foster parents say &ldquo;no, we are using the process of the 1988 Act; we want to adopt the child&rdquo;.  Can the Minister clarify for me how that conflict is resolved?  Are those parents liable to criminal prosecution on summary conviction to a fine of £250 in those circumstances? What is the connection between the operation of the Adoption Act 1988 and this section if that sort of problem comes up?</P>

I want to reassure Deputy McCartan that there is nothing latent or concealed in the definition of foster parents, but the vagueness of the amendment tabled by Deputy Yates &mdash; and I appreciate his sincerity in tabling it &mdash; could lead to difficulties.  In view of the contributions of all the Deputies here I have given an assurance that we will have another look at it, and I hope to come back with a clear definition for section 29.  That is as far as I can go, and I think I am going a fair distance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the point again, lest it has been lost. Section 29 makes no reference to a foster parent <i>per se</i>.  It talks about the child who is in foster care or who is in care under these sections.  It is the marrying of the two words &ldquo;foster&rdquo; and &ldquo;parent&rdquo; that I believe should be done.  Is there any reservation in principle on the Minister's part about the introduction and defining of that concept in Part V of the Act when we arrive at it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

We <Col N="1202" /> will evaluate in detail, report back and give the House the best available information, and we are confident we will have the Deputies' wise counsel to help us.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister of State has said, I will not at this stage press amendment No. 4 in my name.  I will say that just looking at sections 27 and 29 is not adequate.  Just to define a foster parent, as I have attempted to do, is not all I am getting at.  I am looking to set a legal framework within which foster parents seem to be moving, after a lengthy period, towards the type of rights that Deputy McCartan was talking about, almost equal rights with natural parents.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request when one considers that to all intents and purposes, when one takes away the law and the detail, that that child might well want the protection of that new family environment in which to live out the rest of his life.  I will not press the amendment at this stage, but we are accepting the good faith of the Minister that he will make a genuine attempt on Report Stage to pursue this.</P>

This means that the various provisions of the Bill in relation to the care and protection of children will apply to children adopted under foreign adoption orders which are recognised here in the same manner as they apply to children adopted under our domestic legislation.  The opportunity is also being taken to change the reference in the Bill to the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, to read Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1988.  This is necessary following the passage of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987, and its enactment as the Adoption Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I think this is the second attempt by the Minister to get the definition right.  I think he still has not got it right because he is using the term &ldquo;surviving parent&rdquo; implying that the family started off with two parents.  There are one parent households, either unmarried women with children or deserted <Col N="1204" /> husbands or deserted wives.  It is therefore important to cover a lone parent in that definition.  Will the Minister consider that, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I wish to raise on this.  That is, that it has come to my attention that barring orders, as an example of protection, are not available on equal terms to children born outside wedlock where there is a common law spouse.  My question therefore in relation to the definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is whether the Minister is satisfied with the definition here.  If we were to make subsequent amendments in this Bill in relation to removing offending adults by way of barring orders &mdash; we have some amendments down here &mdash; as opposed to taking the child into care and out of the family situation, would this apply to unmarried couples?  I am told that in the case of a man who is living with the mother but is not married to her and who may not be the father of the children and is brutalising or beating up those children, a barring order cannot be obtained.  That is a defect in the present law.  I would like the Minister's view on whether this definition covers that type of situation where there is a common law spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would satisfy my curiosity.  The definition of parents asserts that we are including within that definition parents of a child adopted outside the State and whose adoption is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State and that &ldquo;parents&rdquo; mean the adopter or adopters or the surviving adopter.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me as to the circumstances where we currently recognise adoptions that take place outside the State, just so that we know exactly to whom this definition applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Yates is correct but I am not sure.  In regard to amendment No. 5 I should like to state that I am aware that the present position here with regard to the recognition of adoption orders and decrees made abroad is somewhat unclear.  There are <Col N="1205" /> no statutory rules or provisions governing the recognition of such orders.  In the absence of legislation I am advised that the matter is governed by common law and that an adoption effected abroad is entitled to recognition here if the adopters were domiciled in the country where the adoption was made at the time of its making.  I understand that this was the approach applied in the High Court by Mr. Justice McKenzie in a case stated by the Adoption Board involving an adoption order made in England.  I accept, however, that it would be desirable to introduce a greater degree of certainty in this area by specifying in legislation the circumstances in which adoptions made abroad would be recognised here.  That was one of the main recommendations in the report of the review committee on adoption services.  This is not an easy area in which to legislate involving as it does complex questions of private international law.  It is because of its complexity that the Law Reform Commission have undertaken a study of the matter and recently published a report on foreign adoption decrees.  My Department are at present studying their report and the question of new legislation in relation to foreign adoptions will be considered in the light of the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, in response to Deputy Garland, that there is no agreed definition in law as to what constitutes a lone parent.  Is it a widow or a widower, a deserted father or a deserted mother, a single mother or a divorced person? The Deputy's amendment provides no clue as to what he intends and the amendment could not be accepted on that basis alone.  I should like to make the point that parents have rights in natural law, in statute and under the Constitution whether they are married, single or divorced and whether they are living together or separated.  In performing their functions under the Bill, particularly in relation to taking children into care, health boards will have to be careful in regard to the rights of the parents involved, regardless of their marital or other status.  I hope that deals with the <Col N="1206" /> concern raised by the Deputy.  I regret that I do not propose to accept his amendment and I urge the House to accept the amendment I have put forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members have stated, there is a need to include a definition of parent to take account of a parent living alone with children.  I am particularly concerned about unmarried mothers.  At present unmarried mothers are discriminated against in the context of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  An unmarried mother in my constituency who has two children and is in receipt of an unmaried mother's allowance lives in a house provided by the county council.  The father of the children broke into that house on a number of occasions and beat up her and the children.  We have heard a lot of talk in the debate on this Bill about the welfare of children and the need to prevent violence against children, but that woman is not in a position to obtain a barring order from the court, unlike a married mother.  That poses problems in relation to the Bill if we are anxious to extend protection to all children.  We must ensure that a mother, whether married or not, is in a position to obtain a barring order against a person who is likely to cause violence.  It is not always the father of the child who causes the violence; it may be another man with whom that woman is having a relationship. The Minister should address this problem and, if necessary, extend the definition of parent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise but I will respond to the points raised by the Deputy.  Common law spouses are not covered by the definition.  However, in appropriate sections of the Bill we refer to the parent or person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> to cover the problems raised by <Col N="1207" /> the Deputy.  Deputies Shatter and Fennell raised questions about barring orders.  In that respect we are dealing with family law and they cannot be covered in the Bill.  I appreciate, as the Deputy said, that this is a serious matter particularly where children suffer.  This is a difficult problem and it is a matter for the Minister for Justice to amend the family law Act to take account of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case because the family law we are discussing is based on marriage.  Between 22 and 30 women each fortnight go the District Court Clerk seeking barring orders but they cannot get them because they are outside the scope of the legislation.  It is not good enough to leave such people without protection.  Generally speaking, they are poor women who cannot afford to pay for legal advice and for whom free legal aid is not of much use because of the time involved in getting approval for it.  The only option open to them is to obtain a court injunction.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the State took away the allowance paid to that woman because she was alleged to be co-habiting with the man whom she could not remove from the house.  Her unmarried mother's allowance was stopped and as a result the children were penalised.  We must deal with that dilemma.  The Department of Social Welfare should take cognisance of her position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's definition of a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.  However, I disagree with him fundamentally on the other points I have raised.  It is not the job of the Minister for Justice to deal with the problems I raised.  I am aware that mothers who have had their children taken into care by a health board are deeply unhappy at the loss of their children.  The sole reason for taking their children into care was because their father was an alcoholic or had beaten them up.  The health board adopted the wrong approach in taking <Col N="1208" /> them into care.  It would have been preferable had they removed the offending adult and left the children with their mother.  I do not accept that in dealing with what is the most major reform for 80 years in the area of child care legislation we should say that such problems cannot be catered for.  Our number one priority where abuse is involved should be to remove offending adults and, where possible, permit the children to live with their mother.  We will not be opposing the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to let the Minister's statement pass without making a comment on it because in my view it exposes a fundamental flaw in the Government's approach to this.  We have had what I would describe as decompartmental thinking in regard to this legislation.  We have had rigid barriers laid down that certain matters fall within the bailiwick of the Department of Health, that something else falls within the bailiwick of the Department of Education and something else within the bailiwick of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The issue Deputies Yates and Fennell raise is important.  The Minister's response is that that is a family law problem, that it is a matter for the Department of Justice.  I tell the Minister that to anyone outside this House the taking of children into care, the beating of children or the sexual assault of children are family law problems.  Such behaviour can be categorised in a number of other ways but it is as much a family law problem in the legal sense as is the beating of a wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be a matter of accident whether as a result of a child being beaten the health board bring a care application, or a mother brings a barring application to have the father who has been beating the child put out of the house, but overall what is wrong with this legislation is that it is the child who is being assaulted is being taken out of a home.  Because the demarcation lines between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health are being preserved it is apparently not possible for the Department of <Col N="1209" /> Health to include anything in this legislation or to accept amendments tabled by Deputy Yates to introduce some aspects of the Protection of Spouses and Children Act, 1981 into operating in the context of the Child Care Bill.  I find that appalling and I urge the Minister to talk to his colleague in the Department of Justice to see whether it is possible without offending his ministerial sensitivities or sensibilities to accept some of the amendments which are designed to extend to the courts under this Bill the possibility of barring from the home the parent who beats his child and allowing the child to live in the home with the other parent rather than always having to take the child out of the home.  There is no rationale in saying you cannot address that because that is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), to delete lines 27 to 29.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to delete the definition of &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; and discontinue the use of this term altogether.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; originated in the Children Act, 1908 and was a place where a child could be kept on foot of a &ldquo;place of safety order&rdquo; until such time as the court reached a decision as to whether he should be placed in care on a long term basis.  It is defined at section 131 of the 1908 Act as follows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; means any workhouse or police station, or any hospital, surgery, or any other suitable place, the occupier of which is willing temporarily to receive an infant, child or young person.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, section 11 of the Bill provides for the replacement of the place of safety order by a new system of emergency care orders.  As a result, it no longer makes sense to continue to use the old terminology &mdash; indeed to do so might lead to confusion.  I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that it would be best to dispense with the use of the term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to provide a substitute term for &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo;.  Instead I propose that a child who is the subject of an emergency care order would be placed in the care of the health board and that it would be for the board to decide exactly where and how the child is to be accommodated. The advantage of this is that a <Col N="1211" /> health board would in no way be restricted by a definition in the Bill but could avail of whatever form of accommodation seemed to best suit the needs of the individual child concerned at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of section 13, No. 71, is consequential on the deletion of the definition of place of safety.  It is proposed that each health board would be required to ensure the provision of &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo; for the purposes of this Part of the Bill, leaving it to each board to decide on the exact arrangements and type of accommodation to be used.  For example, it might place a child in a children's residential centre, an assessment unit, or hospital or in foster care depending on the needs of the particular child.  Overall, I think this more flexible approach will be better for the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I might mention that there are some references to &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; in sections 10 and 11 but it is my intention that these will be deleted as part of more substantive amendments of those sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 6 in the name of the Minister meets the content of amendment No. 9 which I was seeking to make, which was to eliminate the role of a Garda station as a place of safety to which children could be brought in an emergency.  I know, and the Minister will know having been in the OPW, the state of some Garda stations across the country, that they leave a great deal to be desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority, especially in rural areas, so of all places to bring a child they are the most unsuitable.  About the only basic facilities some of these premises have are cells.  Therefore, I am anxious that that provision be removed. Secondly I am aware of some of the circumstances that can arise in relation to sexual abuse whereby children would be removed from the home.  I understand from experts in the field that there is <Col N="1212" /> often a huge sense of guilt involved for the young person that could involve him or her coming forward to the authorities to say he or she had been abused, or confirming the suspicions of a social worker and so on.  To bring a criminal element into the proceedings can only make those guilt feelings even worse. Therefore, I consider a Garda station in this context wholly inappropriate.</P>
      <P>In meeting the amendments to that effect the Minister has gone even further in abolishing the term &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo;. That has been replaced by &ldquo;a suitable number of places of safety&rdquo;, which is now deleted, and changed to &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo;. The Minister said it would be left to each of the health boards to determine in their own respective way what that would be.  In my view that is disastrous.  Often the child care facilities available within the eight regions vary enormously depending on the interest and enthusiasm of health board staff and the board members.  Some very conservative, senior health board personnel say this child abuse problem is totally exaggerated and overrated.  Others are consistently dealing with the problems. Look at the statistics of cases taken between health boards.  They bear no relationship to population.  Therefore, the Minister in moving amendment No. 6 should consider on Report Stage bringing in enabling legislation to allow regulations to be put in place after the passage of this legislation to determine what minimum standards of accommodation would meet the definition of &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo;. I accept the Minister's amendment as it seeks to move in a direction which I would support.  I ask him to consider making regulations so that there would be uniform understanding and guidelines for each health board, which are sadly lacking, in all aspects of child care, and to set out exactly what are minimum suitable accommodation standards. In fact, the Minister read them out so it would not be too big a job to draft them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various stages in this Bill whereby intervention is <Col N="1213" /> allowed to protect children at risk.  The first level of intervention is provided in section 10, so that children may be taken into a place of safety if they fall within the definitions encompassed in the section.  It is a crucial element that there should be a power to bring children out of danger. The corollary of that is that there must be some place for them to go.  When a child is at risk in an immediate sense, obviously there are not many options open to the Garda Síochána or to the health board at that time.  I am concerned that the Minister would simply eradicate the definition of &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; and leave it to the health boards to define. Does he propose to require the health boards to conform to specific suitable accommodation or will it be up to the health boards to define what is suitable? As often happens in relation to the implementation of other Acts of the Oireachtas, will different health boards take the term &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo; to mean different things and will there be a variance in the quality and type of suitable accommodation that is provided as between the different health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect that is causing me concern.  I do not think it would be desirable to take very young children and move them a long distance geographically from their home environment. If there is to be, say, suitable accommodation so defined in each health board area &mdash; one of a kind to cover a geographical area as envisaged under the Health Act, 1970, it would mean that children would be moved great distances. To add to the trauma of being under attack or being vulnerable in their own home they would be carted off many miles from the surroundings with which they are familiar.  We have to address this area very carefully.  I would hope that the Minister would respond to what I am saying by requiring, by regulation, each health board to establish suitable places of safety; that he would define &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo;, if that is the phrase he prefers, in clear terms so that there would be a high standard uniformly throughout the country, that there would not be one single &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo; for <Col N="1214" /> each health board region, and that the child could be looked after, if the health board decide, in his immediate vicinity. The simple abolition of this section certainly takes away the fears we would all have about a young child being brought into a Garda station.  I would be concerned that, in cutting off the whole branch, we might be left open in this area.  I would welcome the Minister's elucidation on exactly what is his intention in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that there would be places available, for instance, at weekends when a crisis can arise because of alcoholism and other stresses. What provision would there be for the child who is abused at that point?  It is generally believed to make good sense if you are removing a child to a place where they will be frightened, certainly in the case of hospital, that a parent goes with them.  We will not presume that both parents will be the villains of the case. Where a child has to be removed because of its environment two things are important, first, the provision of a care centre at weekends when health boards do not work and, secondly, that the mother, if she can, should go with the child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in removing the place of safety order provision is taking a correct step.  I am disturbed at the way in which this Bill has failed to take into account a lot of the model work which has been done in this area; much of it has been done in England in the context of a variety of different commissions of investigation.  Everything we are doing in this Bill &mdash; and I have already mentioned the fact that barring orders are not applicable &mdash; is based on taking the child out of the home and placing the child somewhere.  The place of safety order provision, which the Minister is now deleting from the Bill, has been used by some health boards in the country under the 1908 Act for what I would describe as a pre-emptive strike on parents in some instances.  In many cases it is being correctly used to provide protection for children where it is needed <Col N="1215" /> but, in some instances, it is being used in a different way.  In some instances it is being used by health boards where there has been a suspicion that a child might be at risk but there has been no firm view that the child is at risk.  The place of safety mechanism has been used to take a child out of the care of its parents and to get the child into a medical assessment situation where, for example, an investigation could be conducted to ascertain whether a child had or had not been sexually abused.  We have had instances in Ireland of some health boards getting place of safety orders and ferrying children to the Rotunda Clinic for investigation to ascertain whether an allegation of child sexual abuse, or a suspicion of it, would stand up.  Much work is being done in this area and Deputy Yates referred to the worries and fears of children in Garda stations. We welcome the removal of this reference from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Children taken out of the care of their parents by social workers whom they do not know are often terrified by what is happening to them.  There are different types of child abuse.  Much of the abuse we talk about is by parents, be it physical, sexual or other types of abuse.  Another type of abuse can be inflicted by a health board or a social worker who wrongly jumps to a conclusion that a child is at risk and takes the child away from their family.  In removing this section from the Bill I would urge the Minister to consider introducing on Report Stage an additional section.  To deal with a situation where there is a suspicion that a child is being illtreated &mdash; but there is no certainty about it &mdash; and the health board require a mechanism to investigate the situation, an investigation should not always require the removal of a child from the home of the parents as the place of safety order provision requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The English commission which investigated the death of a child called Kimberley Carlisle proposed a new type of order in the area of child care which would call on parents of a child suspected of being ill-treated or neglected to take a child to the local health clinic.  The idea <Col N="1216" /> behind the proposal is to have a child medically examined or developmentally assessed without removing the child from the custody of the parents.  There is no provision in this Bill that allows a court to make an order or, which allows a health board to, for example, serve a notice on parents insisting that they make a child available for medical examination or for a developmental assessment.  As the Bill is drafted that can only be done following an emergency care order or another type of order as the Bill provides.  If it is perceived that there is a need for children to be medically examined, health boards are now regularly having children medically examined after getting place of safety orders and this Bill envisages they will do so after getting an emergency care order. We will discuss that in detail when we deal with it.</P>
    <P>Surely it is perceived that when there is a need to have a child medically examined it cannot always be necessary to take the child out of the care of the parents by way of court order or by a garda, as the Bill provides, in an emergency? Surely we could introduce a provision whereby a social worker could serve a notice on a parent that he or she wishes the child to be made available for examination or assessment and that where a social worker does so, bona fide acting in the best interests of the child, there then be imposed an obligation on the parents to co-operate.  If the parents fail to co-operate the social worker could then resort to a court order to require the parents to make the child available.  I am suggesting that the Minister now recognises that the &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; provision should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to recognise that where, for proper reasons, a health board suspect that a child is being abused but are not certain, there should be some lesser mechanism available to them instead of the draconian one of removing the child from the family.  There should be a mechanism to allow the health board to require a parent or parents to make a child available for assessment and medical examination while the child continues <Col N="1217" /> to live within the family home.  If the health board get it wrong the child will not suffer the trauma of being removed &mdash; which is possible under the Bill &mdash; for up to eight days or possibly longer while the medical examination is being carried out.  This would prevent the child being removed from its mother, father, sisters, brothers and the entire extended family. I am raising this in the context of the Minister deleting the &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; provision in the Bill and bringing forward an amendment of this nature which would greatly assist the health boards and social workers attached to them working in the child care area to comply with the obligation which will now be imposed on health boards by the Bill.</P>

      <P>Nowadays most children are placed in short-term foster care rather than in an institution when situations like this occur.  Deputy Yates, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Shatter referred to the quality of accommodation. In section 12 we propose to impose an obligation on the health boards to provide proper accommodation and when we come to that section we will have an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said the health boards are disastrous in relation to deciding on accommodation.  They are the professionals in this field and they are statutorily obliged to provide medical and other care under the Bill.  They are answerable to the Minister who, in turn, is answerable to the House.  Members of the Oireachtas have the opportunity of raising any matter and they will get a response from the Minister.  We will be happy to lay down guidelines for health boards <i>vis-à-vis</i> accommodation.  As I said, we will discuss that in section 12.</P>

The implementation of any legislation is beyond the scope of this House; it is up to the executives in the health agencies to ensure that it is implemented.  I will not press the point more strongly but I ask the Minister to consider regulations to set out minimum standards because if the health boards take the view that they can board out people temporarily, the accommodation may not be up to the standard we desire.</P>

Section 10 provides for a child who has been identified as being at risk to be summarily removed from that risk without reference to a warrant and to bring him or her to a place of safety. The Minister intends to abolish the notion of a &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; and talked about suitable accommodation.  I am interested in the wellbeing of that vulnerable child.  The Minister referred to section 13 requiring health boards to make arrangements but it is a single sentence section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want an undertaking from the Minister that where a child in a rural area is identified as being at risk there will be facilities in the immediate environment for that child to be taken in and protected. I am not clear in relation to the health boards deciding what constitutes suitable accommodation and I ask the Minister to assure the House that the health boards will be required to provide accommodation which is suitable in <Col N="1219" /> which to place children who are immediately vulnerable or at risk as envisaged in section 10.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 in my name was ruled out of order because it was a potential charge on the Exchequer. However, I have been advised that I can discuss it on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My biggest criticism of the Bill is the way the State propose to deal with child care services.  Ever since the Kennedy report was published in 1980 &mdash; a task force report on child care services &mdash; the central, key and fundamental recommendation of the report, which is considered the bible or the genesis of this legislation, was that the biggest weakness in the State apparatus in dealing with child care services was that each Department compartmentalised child care problems and did different things in their own separate ways.  This was to the long-term detriment of children.  I am referring to the Department of Education, to schools attendance officers and the primary and secondary school system.  I am referring to the Department of Health with the <Col N="1220" /> health boards and the child care services and I am referring to the Department of Justice and the juvenile justice system.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that this legislation should include the provision of new child care authorities.  The Government have decided to tack the implementation of this Bill as an &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; item to an already over-burdened health board structure. Because of the duties of the health boards at the moment, they are too busy to be able to give detailed attention to child care services which are the Cinderella of health board activites.  There is no evidence to suggest that just because the legal framework has changed, the health boards will find resources overnight. They cannot even find resources to cover areas for which they are statutorily obliged to provide, such as the dental services.</P>
    <P>The biggest weakness in this legislation is the failure to set up, as recommended in the Kennedy report, a child care service involving representatives of the Departments of Education, Justice and Health to provide at regional level, a child care service.  We are opposing this section because we know the health boards are not the adequate structure to monitor this.</P>
    <P>There is no role within the health boards to cover vital aspects of children at risk.  School attendance officers for instance are not mentioned in this Bill and they are vital in relation to early detection of children at risk.  Are school attendance officers to be made redundant or is their role to be duplicated and triplicated by the work of the health boards? Tragically, the poorest families and the children at greatest risk involved in crime are the subject of juvenile justice.  It is wrong to compartmentalise different aspects of child care.  To say, as we said earlier, that removing offending adults is a matter for the Department of Justice is a fundamentally wrong approach to children at risk.  A child is not interested in which Department helps him.  He is interested in immediacy of service and a comprehensive integrated service.  In <Col N="1221" /> order to obtain value for money and co-ordination of services, we should have a comprehensive child care division in the Department of Health embracing youth services, working with the National Children's Council, which would have independent research and would monitor and execute the services at regional and local level through child care authorities.  I would like to know why the Minister has totally disregarded this suggestion.</P>

      <P>That does not stop the Minister. I will not repeat my arguments although I will reiterate that this would not involve money because the health boards would spend the money anyway. This is a case of liaison and integrated services.  I very much regret that when for the first time in 80 or 90 years we legislate for this area we have missed a golden opportunity to bring the Departments together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the case made by our spokesperson.  He identified two major flaws.  The one we are discussing now is the failure to establish child care authorities.  There has been a total failure to transfer responsibility from the Departments of Justice and Education to the Department of Health and this means that this Bill is inadequate leaving the services fragmented and undirected. I have an intimate knowledge of this area, having spent a little time in the Department.  In 1981-82 when this Bill was being considered first, it was planned to present a comprehensive Bill.  We saw that there were difficulties but that they could have been overcome.  There were proposals to transfer powers from the various Departments to the Department of Health.  This is the third Bill to come into this House and each time a Bill has come in, the area of activity has been reduced so that we now have an absolutely minimal Bill.  The failure to provide a child care authority is one of the things which makes this Bill so flawed.  It is <Col N="1222" /> ludicrous to tack on to an incredibly over-burdened community care service the wide range of additional responsibilities we are proposing in this Bill.  The Minister could not be serious about tackling the problem.  He could not expect the community care services which have been described by our spokesperson as the Cinderella of the health services to take on a major role which should involve them co-ordinating all the voluntary agencies and the statutory agencies in each local area.  Is the Minister aware that in some counties a single social worker operates?  How will a single social worker take on these additional responsibilities? It is not realistic.  By tagging these responsibilities on to the health board services, the Minister will get the credit for having done something but the substance will not be there.  The services provided need radical transformation and it is unbelievable that existing services will be able to give any meaningful substance to the intent of this Bill.  All of the major organisations involved in child care have agreed that for a proposal of this nature a separate structure is required.  It would have been more feasible if the Government had taken on board the substantive reformed proposals that Fine Gael proposed for the health services, which would have seen the health board system administering the local services, with a child care authority fitting in with its own local programme manager.  I support the proposal that we in Fine Gael oppose this section and I ask the Minister at this late stage to reconsider his decision and perhaps come back to us on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the Chair's concern with focusing in on the section in front of us.  This section defines the terms, the building blocks of the Bill we will debate at some length in the future.  Unfortunately, a fundamental cornerstone is missing from those building blocks and that is what the various speakers so far have been trying to allude to.  I had an amendment down but unfortunately it has been ruled out of order because it would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  All the caring agencies, all the submissions we got and all the independent inquiries I have alluded to already have indicated one over-riding need &mdash; to have a national co-ordinating structure for children's policy whereby the various agencies could interact. If there is one single weakness in the Bill it is the lack of a child care authority envisaged since the task force report of 1981.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  The huge body of pressure, all the caring agencies that are dealing directly with this problem, the independent bodies set up by previous Ministers for Health to look into the whole area of child care and the provision of support services for children, have uniformly recommended the establishment of this authority.  Would the Minister not indicate to us now that he will reconsider that matter and come back with his own amendment subsequently?</P>
      <P>We have been negligent in the way we have handled this whole area of legislation for up to 80 years.  In all progressive countries there is a body of legislation and a Minister for the Child &mdash; I would put that as an idea to this Government &mdash; to co-ordinate that body of progressive legislation and there are resources available at local level to support the family and the child, but all these things seem to be lacking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We react to issues in a haphazard way. This Bill was supposed to be a considered overall view after 20 years of reports and debate and, as another speaker has said, three blueprints of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow this Bill to be enacted in a flawed way without a co-ordinating national children's council <Col N="1224" /> that would oversee the interaction of all the agencies and individuals, both voluntarily and statutory, involved in the provision of care services and the legislation not only in the Department of Health but in other areas that relate to, affect and impact on the child.</P>

      <P>From my experience as a teacher, and indeed as a public representative, I think this amendment has a lot to commend it.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the concept of this debate.  We are here to put in place new legislation and to try to ensure that there are institutions that will make the Bill effective and meaningful.  We are wasting our time if we do not follow up legislation with structures.  All the institutions and associations for children stated that the structures in this area are not adequate.  You have to look no further than the courts system to realise how many different agencies came into being and are effective in terms of the courts.</P>
      <P>We need a children's court but that is a debate for another day.  I support the need for local children's councils which primarily would have the needs of children at heart.  They could be promotional and play a planning role at local level.  I honestly do not see how the proposals in this Bill will be put into effect if there are not special councils with a particular role in regard to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept the commitment of the Deputies but I cannot understand the attitude that we can have a plethora of bodies, councils, committees and structures to deal with all health and child care matters.  I accept there is a need for better co-ordination between, on the one hand, my Department and the Departments of Education and Justice and, on the other hand, the health boards and the educational services, particularly the special schools and the probation and welfare services. <Col N="1225" /> However, I do not believe that what is proposed would be of much advantage in this regard.</P>
      <P>At national level there is already regular contact between the three Departments and the three Ministers involved. At present, for example, the three Departments are engaged in discussions on the problems of young offenders.  At a local level the child care advisory committees which we propose to establish under section 5 would provide a forum for all those involved in providing child care services to get together and to agree on policies and priorities.  The committees will make an important contribution to the co-ordination and development of the child services and I see no merit or advantage in elaborate structures.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Yates proposes would be to divorce the child care services from the mainstream of the community care services operated by the health boards and Deputy Flaherty agrees with this.  I fail to see how such a development could be in the interests of the child care services or the community care services generally. It would only serve to isolate the child care services and hinder co-ordination and co-operation between the professional staff on the ground.  My strategy is to develop the child care services within the overall framework of the health board community care structures.  This approach has the advantage of facilitating close integration between the different aspects of the health and social services. I firmly believe that this is the correct approach and is in the best interests of all the children of our country.  It also gives Deputies the opportunity, as I have said already, to question the Minister for Health on any given matter or any local problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty stated that there are counties with only a single social worker. This I refute in its entirety.  In the child care area there are about 350 social workers and about 150 social workers in other areas.  To say that there are counties with only one social worker is absolutely ridiculous and I refute it in its entirety.  What we propose will ensure <Col N="1226" /> that the professionals are in constant touch with the position and that the health boards who have statutory responsibility for administering the health services and now the child care services, have the best professional structures to do so.  They have adequate local representation, representatives of the various organisations, elected representatives and professional bodies.  We propose to set up the child care advisory services in the regions of the health board areas and I think this is the road to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome what the Minister said about the local advisory committees, I think he misses the point in relation to the national co-ordination I feel is required.  In the Child (Care and protection) Bill, 1987, published in my name, I specifically put in a section &mdash; Part XI &mdash; in response to the pressure and body of opinion of those on the front line of delivery of these services.  I defined in that Bill what the National Children's Council should do, their functions, role and composition.  The Minister has indicated that there is <i>ad hoc</i> working co-operation between individual Ministers and Departments on specific items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is required is a statutory authority rather than sections of Departments meeting among themselves. Certainly there should be representatives from each of the Departments the Minister has mentioned, but also from all the other voluntary and statutory bodies involved in the provision of child care, who would monitor legislation, make recommendations in terms of legislation and promote positively child welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is about definitions.  What we all hoped would come about with this legislation was not only a protection of the child who is at risk which any civilised society must afford, but more fundamentally the progressive promotion of the interests of children who are human <Col N="1227" /> beings in their own right.  It seems that the Minister has missed this opportunity. He seems to be happy to insert a mechanism to protect children from being abused, either physically or sexually, but is not prepared to encompass the notion that children have rights of their own, that they need a statutory agency to promote and define those rights clearly, to promote their welfare on an ongoing basis, and who would be involved in correlating the work of various Government Departments, identifying community needs and agencies who work in the community, and in deciding on how their work could be dovetailed.  This is a simple request.  I ask the Minister of State to accept what is not only my plea but that of all the caring agencies during the past 20 years, since the time Brendan Corish established the task force on child care services.  I appeal to the Minister of State to think again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key points they make in that submission is that this Bill amounts to a rejection by the Government of the 1980 report of their own task force.  They state that the report of the task force was forthright in isolating the inadequacy of current planning policy on services and resources and provided a clear and comprehensive blueprint against which services should develop.  It suggested that there was a need for the establishment of an interdepartmental committee comprising of representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice and an independent children council.  It is not clear if the Minister of State is prepared to give a commitment to appoint a separate programme manager, within the health board structure, for child care services.  If the Minister of State is committed to ensuring that child care services will not be dealt with at 4.50 p.m. at a monthly meeting when all other life and death matters are taken and if he has any scrap of sincerity he will give a commitment to appoint a separate programme manager for child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> The Minister of State referred to the professionals who work in the field.  I was interested in that.  He may be aware of the Campaign for the Care of Deprived Children which is an umbrella body for all the different interest groups in the child care area and which comprises employees of his own Department, through the health board structure, and representatives of outside voluntary agencies.  These people are experts and deal with this problem every day.  They insist that the only step we can take is to establish a child care authority.  They point out that one of the persistent criticisms of the child care system is that there are three Government Departments, the Departments of Health, Education and Justice, responsible for providing care for children in need.  The consequences of this are that responsibility for planning and policy on services for children is divided between these three Departments. They further point out that it is particularly evident in the instance of the provision of residential care for children where different Departments and agencies have conflicting plans and priorities within the same location.  Currently there are three separate statutory social work agencies who work with multi-problem families, where there is a need for remedial education, where there is the involvement of the juvenile justice system and where there are abuse or violence related problems.  How can a Minister of State say that this is a reasonable or a sensible way to proceed?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State read the NESC report on community care services in which they make the most damning indictment of the lack of integration of the services for children under the present structure?  Yet, the Minister of State sails on disregarding all the advice of the experts and the recommendations of all the reports and task forces and claims there is no problem.  I cannot understand how the Minister of State and the Government can be so isolated from the consensus and agreement which exists among all the experts in this critical area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Let me give another example to highlight the Minister of State's unfortunate lack of knowledge in this area.  It is nonsensical, and this shows how out of touch he is with reality, for him to boast that the community care services can cope with their present work-load, not to speak of this additional work-load.  The reality is that come the month of August public health nurses are so restricted in terms of mileage that they cannot go and visit old people.  They also have to ration pads for incontinent patients.  How to provide essential child care facilities with combined teams in referral centres?  It just will not happen.  It is a joke.  The present community care structures for which there is just one programme manager, cannot cope with the existing work-load. There is a plethora of reports in the Minister of State's Department &mdash;&ldquo;Care of the Aged&rdquo; is just one &mdash; which indicate that they cannot meet the basic needs of elderly people.  We are not essentially dealing with a child care problem, we are dealing with a child care problem.  Failure to grasp this fundamental point shows that the Government are going through the motions of providing the bare essentials of what will get through in terms of legal reform.  They have no tangible commitment to this area.  They have no new ideas or no new structures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We were assailed from all sides by the Opposition for introducing extra layers of bureaucracy into an administrative procedure.  Deputy Howlin and Deputy Yates are now making the same argument which they had railed against in the debate on that Bill just before the last general election. There is certain merit in what they are saying, and I do not deny that, but we have to guard against a situation where the existing structures which we are trying to better and the new structures we are creating are not bogged down in a morass of bureaucracy.  We have to be very careful about that.  I accept the need for co-ordination and nobody on this side of the House is saying that we do not need co-ordination.  We are trying to improve the situation.  We are creating new structures and trying to provide the backup to ensure that those structures work.</P>
      <P>No social legislation is going to solve all the problems but we are trying to make a start to solve some very serious problems.  Everybody on this side of the House recognises that this is a problem area in which there are fundamental and deep problems.  Within the limits of the resources available, the Government are making a start in trying to solve those problems.  I commend the Minister for bringing the legislation before the Dáil. It is a genuine start and shows a genuine concern on the part of the Government. We will not solve all the problems but we have to be very careful that we do not create an extra layer of bureaucracy that will hinder us in moving towards a solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reassure the Deputy that this side of the House has no interest in creating additional layers of bureaucracy.  What we are suggesting is a separate programme head under the existing structures that will ensure that the child care services will be adequately looked after.  We are extremely concerned that what will happen as a result of the proposals today is that without the addition of a single extra penny or a staff member to take up these additional functions this Government will have made a token gesture, on paper at least, towards reforming the child care services.  There will be legal improvements as a result of the Bill, if nothing else, unless the Minister rethinks his total approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued with my assertion of one social worker per county and threw back at me the national figure of 300 social workers being involved in child care.  The figure I have is 288, which is not very different from the Minister's figure, but let the Minister divide that figure between 26 counties and one is talking about ten to 12 social workers.  In the urban areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make my point. Most of those are stationed in the urban areas.  The net effect on the ground and this has been reported to me by social workers and voluntary agents &mdash; is that in many areas outside the cities there is only one social worker trying to spread his resources throughout the whole county because there is most need in the urban area.  If the Minister looked at this more closely he would realise the extent of the resources crisis.  I defend my presentation as an indication of how serious the resources crisis is at the moment.  It is totally unacceptable that we are tagging on these additional responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part II, section 3, one of the major functions of health boards is to develop preventive programmes and services. This is a vital area and all the research has indicated that it is effective.  Ireland <Col N="1234" /> by international and European standards is at the infancy stage of child care services. The structures being set up are totally inadequate. Dr. Ann McKenna produced a report in the past 12 months which indicated that of all the EC countries our child care services were under-developed when compared with the other member states.  We have a huge problem.  The structures being set up are inadequate to ensure that the problem will be tackled, and that is why we are objecting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions of the Deputies but I am not convinced of the need to establish a national children's council, particularly in the light of the continuing constraints on the public finances.  Before agreeing to set up a new organisation to be funded by the Exchequer, the Government would have to be satisfied that there is a pressing need for it and that the work envisaged for it could not be undertaken by any existing State agency.  The main role envisaged by those who advocate such a council is providing advice to the Minister and health boards on child care policy. The child care area has been the subject of numerous reports, studies and investigations in recent years and this has been alluded to by many speakers this afternoon.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that there is a broad consensus on what needs to be done.  The real difficulty is getting sufficient resources to bring about all the changes and improvements that are necessary.  I do not believe that the establishment of a national children's council would help to resolve this difficulty.  On the contrary the operational expenses of a council would only divert resources from the front line services into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to what Deputy Yates had to say and methinks that he protests too much about the commitment of this Government, because when we look back over most of this decade and the previous decade, we <Col N="1235" /> see that his was the main party in Government looking after the health services.  It took the present Minister and the previous Government to structure the health services, to bring about efficiency and rationalisation and the prioritising of resources.  This has been done and will continue to be done by this Minister under the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also talks about having a special programme manager for child care services.  This is bordering on hypocrisy. He spoke about abolishing all the health boards and replacing them with a national health board, An Bord Sláinte, and yet the Deputy wants us to give a commitment that we will provide in each health board a new programme manager for child care services.  The Deputy suggested that I was sailing on and ignoring the advice of experts.  I am dealing with experts every day and take advice from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite confident that we have the best brains in the Department of Health and in the health boards to deal with this situation.  I see no reason that a good programme manager, with a good director of community care and sufficient resources cannot do the job.  I gave a commitment before Deputy Flaherty came in that we would provide the resources and look at the staff needs in the child care area.  That is why we requested the House not to impose a deadline on the implementation and enactment of the Bill.  There is no point saying you would abolish the health boards while at the same time saying you want an extra programme manager.  That does not prove any point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not opposed in principle to the establishment of some form of consultative and advisory body in the child care area.  If the financial situation were to improve and the need for it were to be more clearly established, I could avail of powers which I have under the health Acts to appoint consultative bodies to establish a national advisory body on <Col N="1236" /> child care.  This is the legal basis for other bodies such as the National Council for the Aged to which Deputy Yates referred.  However for the reasons I have mentioned, I would not be disposed at this stage to making provision for a national children's council in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Depressing.  I do not expect that I will be in a position to change the Minister's mind in view of what he has said.  He has made it quite clear how committed this Government are to the child care area.  First, they are not prepared to give any indication of when they will introduce the contents of this legislation. The Minister has made it abundantly clear that he is not going to appoint a programme manager in any health board area to deal with child care services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sad day for at least 2 per cent of the children who are at risk and who depend on statutory services to meet their requirements.  I have put forward an alternative structure, child care authorities, which would involve the Department of Education, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health.  This would give the Department of Health a very strong child care division which could respond to the ISPCC, those who campaign for the care of deprived children, all the experts and the Kennedy report of 1980. I will not repeat all the arguments; they are clear and succinct.  Even if we lose all of those arguments, it seems it is not even getting any recognition within the community care service structure which is too over-burdened to give child care any special attention.  This Bill is being so diluted now in its potential implementation that it is not being taken seriously. The appointment of a programme manager for a health board the size of the <Col N="1237" /> Eastern Health Board or the Southern Health Board is the very minimum we must do to ensure that the proper priority is given to this area.  Deputy Sherlock is a member of a health board and he will tell us that by the time the members of that board are finished at their meetings discussing the general hospital programme, the special hospital programme, the development of the GMS and the geographical and staff problems of different hospitals, child care services have to depend on a special meeting once every quarter.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with advisory committees. Today I had an amendment which would have given terms of reference to child care advisory committees ruled out of order.  These committees are totally token in the way they are designed in this section.  They are not an answer; they are just a talking shop which will produce paper.  They do not have any executive decision-making role whatever, so that proposal falls short.  I do not wish to delay the House.  I believe there is total and fundamental disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on this matter and I am happy to proceed with a vote.</P>

      <P>I want to make one final comment on the section.  I have made my case and I do not intend repeating it. I am dismayed at the response of the Minister of State in relation to the national children's council which was included in the Bill published in 1987 under my name.  The concept was not opposed at the time by the Fianna Fáil Party.  As I have said, there is not a single caring agency who have not advocated this concept and no cogent reason has been put forward by the Minister tonight why he would not accept and enact the concept.  I am dismayed at the Minister's response.  We have debated almost two sections of this Bill and two mortal blows have been levelled by the Minister of State at the whole concept of this Bill which as I have said repeatedly has been so long in formation and so long awaited not only by the children who will benefit <Col N="1238" /> but by all those whose lives are devoted to the care and protection of children.</P>

First, as my colleague, the Minister of State, pointed out, it does not have to be written into legislation to establish such a council. They can be established at any time.</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the Deputies' attention to the fact that when their Government were in power they brought forward the Child Care and Protection Bill and there was no provision in it for a national children's council.

    <P>What I am addressing is a core issue which, as I have said, has been articulated by every caring agency, health worker and virtually everybody involved in the provision of child care services and included in every submission I got for the establishment of a national children's <Col N="1240" /> council.  That is why the Labour Party included that concept in their Bill which was published in 1987.  That concept was defined in Part XI of that Bill in specific and clear terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come into the House and said something very peculiar, that there is no need for a statutory basis on which to set up the council.  The Minister is either in favour of a national children's council or he is not.  If he is in favour of it under the terms I have articulated here tonight then it should be statutorily provided for.  The notion that the council could be enacted <i>ad hoc</i> at some time in the future and it might be provided is an insult to those people who want it and is a very ham-fisted way of providing for legislation to co-ordinate child care services. We have been waiting for this legislation for 80 years and the Minister should not demean it now by saying we can provide, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, agencies of such paramount importance.</P>

      <P>In page 6, lines 18 to 34, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In the performance of this function, a health board shall&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  A health board shall, in addition to any other function assigned to it under this Act or any other enactment, provide child care and family support services, and may provide and maintain premises and make such other provision as it considers necessary or desirable for such purposes, subject to any general directions given by the Minister under section 52.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 3 is one of the most important provisions of the Bill.  It places a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and also gives them new and expanded powers to provide child care and family support services.  The main purpose of this amendment is to insert a new paragraph requiring health boards, in carrying out their duty under this section, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>To accommodate this change, subsection (2) as it stands is being split into two subsections.  I am also availing of the opportunity to make a number of technical changes.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (2) provides that, in carrying out their statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, health boards must take certain steps and comply with certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The first of these steps is contained in subsection 2 (a) which requires health boards to seek out children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (b) (i) contains the new provision concerning the paramountcy of the welfare of the child.  It provides that health boards, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, shall, in the discharge of their functions regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  This is as a clear declaration that the primary objective of health boards is to promote the welfare of the child.  The effect of this to make explicit what has always been implicit.  The entire <i>raison d'etre</i> of health boards in providing child care services is to serve the best interests of the child and this statutory provision will reinforce that.</P>
      <P>Health boards can often have a most difficult task in promoting the welfare of a child in an individual case.  There is no simple division between the rights of parents and the rights of children.  They are often two sides of the same coin.  A parent's right to the custody of a child is matched by a child's right to the company and protection of a parent.  Improper interference with one means improper interference with the other.  Any consideration of the welfare of a child must take into account the totality of rights existing between the parents and the child.  Regard must also be had to the duties of parents, with these being measured against parents' behaviour in any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> This amendment requires health boards, having taken all these factors into account, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. While the rights of parents and children in relation to each other must be respected, a health board, in any case where it believes that the welfare of a child can only be protected by the removal of the child into the care of a health board, will have to take proper steps in accordance with the provisions of this Bill to ensure that the child's welfare is protected.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) (ii) repeats the provision that was in the old subsection (2) (d) requiring the health board in so far as is practicable to have regard to the wishes of the child.  The proviso is to take account of situations where it would not be practicable to consult the child, for example, where there was an immediate threat to his safety or wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) repeats a provision in the existing subsection requiring health boards to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family. What this means is that where a child is not receiving adequate care or protection, the health board will generally be expected to assist the family so that the child can remain at home.  Only in exceptional cases, where this has failed or where there is a serious threat to the child should the child be taken into care.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) requires health boards to provide child care and family support services and enables them to provide and maintain premises and to make such other provision as they consider necessary for that purpose.  I have deliberately not attempted to spell out the types of services which might be provided.  This is to give health boards maximum flexibility in responding to the differing needs in their areas and to ensure that there is no obstacle to the development of new services to cater for the needs which might emerge in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the main purpose of the Minister's amendment is to ensure <Col N="1246" /> that the first and paramount consideration before a court should be the welfare of the child.  I welcome that and I have a number of amendments down to that effect.  I would like to raise some queries with the Minister in relation to the wording he has put forward, particularly regarding the constitutional position.  Where there is a conflict between the rights and welfare of children on the one hand and the parental rights to custody on the other, under the Constitution which rights are superior? Articles 41 and 42 confer parents &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; with regard to the education of their children; Article 42 confers similar rights on children.  However, these latter rights seem less important and less qualified for constitutional protection than the rights of parents in the context of a married couple.  This matter has come up in two court cases and I would like to know if the Minister's amendment is constitutional arising out of these cases.</P>
      <P>The first is the Supreme Court decision of March 1985 in the case of MC and MC and KC and AC <i>v</i>.  An Bord Uchtála.  I would like to quote from the unanimous verdict of the Supreme Court: &ldquo;The State cannot supplant the role of parents in providing for the infant the rights to be educated conferred on it by Article 42.1.&rdquo;  Effectively I am advised that this case showed that the court could not constitutionally decide the issue of a custody contest solely on the basis of what course of action is in the best interest of the child's welfare.  If one interprets this judgment it seems it is not constitutionally permissible, especially in respect of legitimate children &mdash; that is within the married couple context &mdash; to regard the child's welfare as the paramount consideration, as the Minister now proposes to do.  In a further case in the Supreme Court of 22 June 1977, J. <i>v.</i> D, it seems the right of children are subservient to the inalienable, imprescriptible and paramount rights of the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there have been cases of potential constitutional proceedings to challenge the constitutionality of the 1908 <Col N="1247" /> Children Act that currently exists in this context.  These were not heard for fear of this Act being constitutionally infirm, with the cases being settled by agreement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that as a first step in clarifying and establishing unambiguous rights for children as to their welfare being the most important issue in any conflict, the best way to have done this would have been through the Preamble &mdash; I have down amendment No. 199 at the end of the Bill, because nowhere in any law are the rights of children set out. I do not profess to be a lawyer; this is advice I have received.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify whether it is intended that this Bill will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court, under Article 26 of the Constitution to test its constitutionality or if the Government have such a procedure in mind in view of these clear questions. Also, I would like to hear if any consideration has been given to a constitutional referendum or a proposed amendment in this regard.  That is the first issue I wish to raise on amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>I have some amendments to the Minister's amendment.  I will quote, as I did last week, section 67 of the 1970 Health Act which provides: &ldquo;A health board shall provide optical, oral and dental services for eligible patients&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; does not mean very much.  If you are an old age pensioner looking for dentures it means nothing as there is no service.  While they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provide it, they are not providing it.  The Minister has set out the purpose of this Bill in terms of the functions and operation of the health boards in the proposed section 3 (2) providing that: &ldquo;In the performance of this function a health board shall&rdquo; and goes on to say &ldquo;take such steps&rdquo; and so on.  My first amendment is after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;be under a statutory duty&rdquo; to perform the different functions.  I am trying to assert on behalf of this House a greater obligation upon health boards to do the work we are asking them to do. Given the experience of the 1970 Health <Col N="1248" /> Act &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not strong enough to ensure enforcement and implementation.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13 seeks to provide after the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; that the health boards would also&rdquo; co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its areas.&rdquo;  We have already referred to the different roles of the Departments of Justice and Education and I feel as a minimum there should be an obligation on the health board to have up to date information of the childrens' needs within an area, be they recreational, related to housing or crime, or whatever.  There is a need to co-ordinate all the relevant information.  The health boards have not been charged with that function.  I was quite intrigued to hear the Minister say they had not set out in this legislation a whole series of things the health boards should do, because they wanted to give them &ldquo;maximum flexibility&rdquo;. Once this legislation is passed we will have no control over it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What we pass to give the health boards maximum flexibility might be considered by them as minimal terms with which they would be obliged to comply.  Maximum flexibility might turn out to be the exact opposite to what we have in mind because we have not specified those functions we want the health boards to carry out.  In that regard I take the opposite view to the Minister &mdash; if you want health boards to do something you should set it out.</P>
      <P>My amendments Nos. 4 and 5 to amendment No. 13 are vital if we want to give practical expression to making the child's interest of paramount concern and the first concern.  My amendment No. 4 is to insert a paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) inform children of their right to be consulted prior to any action or change in their circumstance and allow for a child to initiate a review of their circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a circumstance where children are under the care of the health board in <Col N="1249" /> one guise or another, in residential care, foster care or any other form of care or perhaps are the subject of a supervision order, and the child would have a clear right to be asked: &ldquo;What do you want in this situation?&rdquo; Too often we presuppose what children want; we do not ask them what they want.  That should be set out as I suggest, and there should be an obligation on the social workers to consult children before they move them from one centre to another or from one carer to another, or before they release them out of the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 5 to amendment No. 13 arises out of what happened in the United Kingdom, for instance, Cleveland, and other cases where there has been a feeling among parents and other interested parties that the health board have been over-zealous and over-enthusiastic in putting children in care.  It is important, therefore, that for any outside or subsequent investigation of a child's case history the request of the child would be documented, so that there could be no subsequent cover up or ambiguity about it.  In summary I have a major constitutional question about the Minister's amendment.  I support it in terms of what it sets out to do.  It matches my own desires in this area but I feel that in general terms both the original section 3 and the Minister's proposed amendment, do not set out in sufficient detail some aspects of the protection of children in terms of permanent concern.  In other words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>History will tell.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the very serious concern being expressed by the people of north Meath about the future of the 260 jobs at the Zenith Electronics factory in Kells.  Zenith came to Kells in the wake of the Westinghouse Corporation closure in 1983 and at that time promised many well paid and secure jobs for the years ahead for the people of Meath.  Zenith were regarded in Kells then as a very important step in the development of securing a major European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent cause for concern arises from three factors.  First, the sale of part of the production line to Groupe Bull, the American multinational, <Col N="1251" /> whereas the official line from the plant states that they have only one production line at present.  The information available to me suggests that the factory for quite some time only has had one production line.  Naturally this has led to rumour and counter rumour within the plant itself and generally in the county.  Secondly, it is my information that no raw material has entered the factory for a considerable period.  Thirdly, the annual stocktaking which would normally take place at the end of the year is to take place very shortly.  I would like to ask the Minister if he will give assurances that he has briefed himself on the current situation, that all possible steps are being taken to protect and secure the 260 jobs in the factory and that the taxpayers' investment in the plant is also being protected. I would welcome assurances from the Minister to the House that such is the case.</P>
    <P>I would also inform the Minister that it is only four months since the official opening took place at this plant.  With my colleague and, I am sure, the other Deputies from the constitutency, I would be very concerned that something might happen in regard to this plant in so far as employment there is concerned.  We are not wishing that it would happen; we are only hoping that the jobs that I have mentioned are secure because we are in an area where jobs are hard to come by and have been very hard to come by for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of the overall plant.  He had occasion at one time to visit it himself when it was under different management.  I hope he can give the assurances I seek from him tonight. The people of Kells and the surrounding areas who are depending on this plant for a living will welcome such assurances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the concern expressed by Deputy Farrelly in regard to this matter of an industry in his native town.  I am advised that this is a profitable plant, that the Irish plant continues to be profitable for its owners.  I hope that any concerns <Col N="1252" /> there at this time will be allayed in the light of the fact that it is, to my knowledge, a profitable enterprise and should continue as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the micro-computer business of the Zenith Corporation of the United States is the subject of a proposed buy-out by Groupe Bull of France.  This purchase, however, will not include Zenith's Irish operation at Kells.  Zenith have a second operation in Ireland in the form of a distribution centre in Santry with associated facilities and which employs 14 people.  This facility will be included in the sale to Groupe Bull.  Under the proposed sale arrangements it is intended that the product produced at Kells will be the subject of a separate agreement between Bull and Zenith US under which Bull will purchase the Kells product for a minimum of 18 months from the date of the sale.  It would, of course, be my hope that they would continue to do so afterwards as well, that they would not confine the purchases simply to a period of 18 months.  Of course the Zenith plant at Kells has many customers apart from Bull.  These include IBM, Wang, Siemens and others of that calibre.  I know of no reason that would not continue.</P>
      <P>Zenith Ireland is a very fine company with a strong technological base and a management that has always been firmly committed to the development of its Irish operation.  The company were established in Kells in 1983.  In spite of the fact that there was an official opening, as Deputy Farrelly said, only a few months ago &mdash; that may have been for electoral purposes or some other extraneous reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it has had some considerable success.  During that time it has achieved commendable results in all its key target areas such as employment, productivity, marketing and R and D.  It produces top quality products and has <Col N="1253" /> a high reputation with a variety of customers who are world class companies of the kind I mentioned.  Naturally, I am concerned that the long term viability of the factory at Kells should be preserved and for this reason I have asked the IDA to maintain the closest of contact with all parties concerned in the proposed buy-out deal and to take every practicable step to ensure the continued viability of the Kells operation.  I have also asked them to report all significant developments to me as they occur so as to enable me to decide the most appropriate course of action to take.</P>
      <P>The proposed purchase by Groupe Bull will be put to a meeting of the stockholders of Zenith in the United States on 14 December next.  I understand that Deputy Farrelly submitted a Private Notice Question today in this regard. While I can appreciate his concern and the concern of the people employed at this factory, I would ask that the concern not be exaggerated lest it create greater difficulties for the company than those which may exist now or in the future.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe that it would be the end of the Zenith operation and I do not think we should destabilise the company by suggesting that there is any imminent danger of that.  They employ 272 people which is well above the target they originally set themselves.  They have been a very successful company and, because of the ability of their management and workforce, I hope they will get through this situation where a different part of the Zenith company is being taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to again emphasise that the plant at Kells is not part of the proposed takeover by Bull.  The matter has only come to notice within relatively recent times; an announcement was made in October of Bull's intention to buy part of Zenith and the IDA have been closely monitoring the matter since.  Obviously we will know better after the stockholders' meeting on 14 December but, in the <Col N="1254" /> meantime, I urge people not to be unduly concerned because I hope and expect that the close monitoring by the IDA of the matter will avoid any undesirable result from the point of view of the company in Kells.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite delighted that Deputy Currie was there. The main issue I want to raise is the seriousness of the intent of the Government in relation to keeping the line open. The Taoiseach gave an undertaking some months ago in the House in response to a question of mine that everything possible would be done to ensure that the Dublin-Belfast railway line was kept open and would not be closed by the Provisional IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That commitment was put to the test at the weekend when a bomb threat was <Col N="1255" /> made on the southern side of the Border which was aimed at stopping the peace train returning from Belfast.  My complaint is not in relation to the Garda &mdash; or indeed the Army &mdash; who clearly put their lives at risk every day in facing the Provisionals, the UVF and other gangs in the Border area.  I am concerned at the delay which occurred between the time the bomb threat was reported, which I am told was 3 o'clock, and the time the search of the line started, which I understand was sometime between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Sunday.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it takes time to check a line and I am not complaining about the length of time it took once the search started because it has to be done very carefully and nobody wants to put the lives of the Garda or Army at risk in rushing a job like that.  However, the length of time it took for the search to start needs serious questioning because there were no adequate contingency plans to act swiftly and smartly to check the line.  The main way to guarantee that this line is kept open is to ensure that delays to trains on the line are reduced to a minimum and the sooner lines are declared free of bombs, the sooner trains can travel on them again.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is the first time there was a bomb threat in relation to the line south of the Border.  Nevertheless, based on the Taoiseach's commitment here some time ago, the Minister should indicate the detail of what exactly happened when the threat was received and what steps were taken subsequently.  He should also indicate that the Army will be put on a footing to ensure that the rail line is kept open to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to shift the blame for the closure of the line from the Provisional IRA because they clearly are the people causing the disruption to the line. They are threatening the lives of the people travelling on the trains, the lives of the workers and the livelihood of the hundreds &mdash; if not thousands &mdash; of people whose jobs depend on the goods which are brought back and forward, North and <Col N="1256" /> South, on these trains.  The further arrogance of the IRA was demonstrated in a newspaper report this morning in which they complained that a report they had telephoned about a bomb on the line had been ignored.  They were concerned that civilian lives would be put at risk.  That is the utmost arrogance from people who have no mandate whatsoever to place bombs on lines, to murder a six months old baby in Germany, to slaughter bandsmen in Deal and to shoot, maim and kill members of the RUC and UDR or indeed civilians in Northern Ireland.  As far as I am concerned, there are no accidents in so far as the Provisional IRA are concerned.  They have no right to kill anybody or to destroy the link between Dublin-Belfast or Belfast-Dublin.  It is an indication of their hypocrisy &mdash; if not their stupidity &mdash; that they attack the one tangible link between North and South which unites people in their travels to shop or visit friends and relatives.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure, in so far as it is humanly possible that our Garda and Army are geared to the point where disruption on the line and the threat to lives is reduced to a minimum.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy De Rossa for giving me some of his time; I intend giving most of it to Deputy McGahon who is so closely associated with the railway line and the area where the most disruption takes place.  I endorse what Deputy De Rossa said.  In talking about the contingency plans we must not ignore two issues: the deliberate disruption and the contempt of the IRA for the people of Ireland, North and South, while they claim to have some support from both communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people North and <Col N="1257" /> South who must clear the lines and risk their lives doing so.  I hope the Minister will assure us in his reply that the contingency plans of the Garda and the Army will match those of the Army and RUC in Northern Ireland.  During our stop-over we realised the effort that is put in on a daily or weekly basis to deal with the contemptible work of the IRA by the staff of the Northern Ireland railway and everybody concerned with safety on the northern side.  We, as citizens of Ireland who happened to be on that side of the Border that night, were kept safe and decisions made were based on the need to keep us safe.  If the IRA intend to continue disrupting and showing contempt for the ordinary people here, we hope guarantees will be given in relation to the safety of people so that we can travel to and from the North without breaking that communication, and that delays will be of the shortest possible duration so that people are encouraged to keep up the link.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague Deputy Barnes and in particular my unlikely comrade for a day and a night, Deputy De Rossa.  It was a pleasure to take part in the peace train project with Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Gilmore and, of course, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy from a railway town, which has had a railway facility for 100 years and has provided gainful employment, I want to add my voice of protest in denouncing the Provisional IRA, the people who specialise in baby killing, that evil murderous group, for their incomprehensible campaign against this railway line which has served as a link between Dublin and Belfast for over 100 years. No rationale can excuse their campaign which I believe is at the behest of some hauliers who will pay increasing road tax in the years ahead.  Taxes cannot be taken from the occasional railway traveller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when was the bomb report received?  My evidence was that it was received at 2.58 p.m. in Dundalk. I do not cast aspersions on either the Garda or the Irish Army whom I support, but I am concerned that there <Col N="1258" /> was no contingency plan for an operation such as this.  There was a delay of 18 hours in solving the problem and although I accept that the search could not be carried on at night, I submit that a delay of 18 hours after a bomb threat is not acceptable.  If such an incident occurs again I hope that there will not be such a delay.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister why soldiers based in Monaghan town were used when Dundalk has an Army barracks.  I am sure that contributed to the 18 hour delay.  The delay was unnecessary and the Minister should ensure that such a delay will not recur.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to ensuring that the line is kept open.  I congratulate Northern Ireland Railways and CIE for their forebearance and courage in keeping this line open, but if these attacks continue, it will be uneconomically viable to keep that line open.  There are 500 jobs at risk in addition to the loss of business from the 600,000 people who come into the State every year as tourists, business people or people on educational courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that all Members will join with me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the attacks which have taken place on the Dublin to Belfast line over the past year or so.  These attacks began on 16 December last when a device was detonated on the railway line north of the Border.  They have continued on a regular basis since then by the placing of actual devices on the line or by the making of hoax telephone calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace train last Saturday was a demonstration by members of both communities North and South of their abhorrence for these reprehensible attacks by the Provisional IRA, attacks which have endangered the lives of civilian passengers as well as threatening the jobs of some 400 persons working either with Iarnróid Éireann or Northern Ireland Railways.  The peace train itself was disrupted as a result of a hoax telephone call and the effect was that the train was held up at Portadown.  In fact, the railway <Col N="1259" /> companies, North and South, have been forced to close the line each day since Saturday as a result of such calls.  As we speak, I understand that the line is again closed because a device, which has yet to be examined by the explosive experts, has been discovered on the northern side.</P>
    <P>The Deputies asked specifically about the contingency plans which the Garda and the Army have to deal with possible bombs on the southern side of the railway line.  I can assure the Deputies and the House that appropriate measures are in place to deal with any such situation if it arises.  As the Deputies will appreciate, to go into the specifics of such measures would defeat the purpose for which the plans are prepared in the first place.  The Garda authorities have assured me they are satisfied that the necessary steps to deal with such a situation can be taken with the assistance of the appropriate Army experts in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Deputy De Rossa, accompanied by Deputy McGahon, called to Dundalk Garda station last Saturday night and complained about what he saw as a delay in carrying out a search of the line in response to the call that there was a bomb.  There was no question of an 18 hour delay as mentioned by Deputy McGahon.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that some of the media have left at this stage, but I would emphasise that there was no such delay as 18 hours before action was taken.  What happened was that late that afternoon a search was carried out.</P>
    <P>I would inform the Deputies who were on the train, the House and the general public, that all the bridges between Dundalk and the Border were checked on Saturday but CIE asked the Garda and Army to check the whole line and not just the bridges which had been checked on Saturday evening before darkness fell. Due to darkness falling, the search was postponed until Sunday morning when the search resumed at about 9.40 a.m. The line was cleared at about 2 p.m. on Sunday.  The Garda and the Army had to <Col N="1260" /> check each yard of that line from Dundalk to the Border and not just the bridges.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, due regard must be had in carrying out a search to ensure that lives will not be put at risk by a hurried reopening.  In addition, there is a risk to those involved in the search itself and I would remind the House that an explosives officer on the northern side was injured when a device exploded on 17 February during a clearance operation.  It is essential that any search be carried out under safe and proper conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by asking what those who are carrying out this campaign against the railway line hope to achieve by it.  They seem to be bent upon trying to close down a link which brings passengers and freight to and from both parts of our island and is of social and economic importance.  It is difficult to understand how such pointless, divisive action can be reconciled with the aim of unifying and bringing together the people of this island.  I appeal to those concerned to stop their senseless activities, and I know that all sides of the House will join me in this appeal.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that this matter has been discussed by the Anglo-Irish Conference at their recent meetings.  It is a matter of deep concern to the Government and will continue to be treated with the utmost seriousness because we see the importance of this link between Dublin and Belfast.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies who were on the peace train that when the Garda received the report in Dundalk, the bridges were searched before dark.  The risk was still there.  The Garda and the Army had also been asked to search the lines.  That was what caused the delay.  When the Deputies consider this they will appreciate the seriousness with which this matter is being treated by the Government, the Garda, the Army, Iarnróid Éireann and the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 November 1989.</P>

      <P>The interim report of the Fair Trade Commission following their inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor fuels recommended changes in the formula used for calculating the prices of petrol and autodiesel.  The commission recommended that the basic product price used should be mid-Platts FOB instead of the mean of the Platts CIF for North West Europe, that an allowance for freight from the United Kingdom should be included and that a new conversion rate from tonnes to litres should be used to take account of the reduction of lead in petrol.  I accepted these recommendations and they were implemented early in September last as part of the monthly price review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The commission were unable to agree on the need for a premium for small purchases nor could they agree on the increases needed in wholesalers' and retailers' margins.  In these circumstances I deferred a decision on these matters pending further study and the final report of the commission which is expected to make far-reaching recommendations to create greater price competition and end price control.  Pending consideration of this final report I cannot indicate whether price control on petrol and autodiesel will be retained.</P>
    <P>The only evidence supplied by my Department to the inquiry was information on the control formula.  This is set out in paragraph 2.6 and Table 1 of the report, which is available in the Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the science and technology development programme is to develop Ireland's technological base and to transfer new technology to industry.  The programme received an increased allocation in 1989 to cater for the expansion of existing programmes and to allow a number of new initiatives to be developed.  The increases concerned, in many instances, were in line with the recommendations of independent institutions which have called for increased resource allocation in this area. These institutions include NESC, the OECD and the CII.</P>
      <P>In 1989, the following schemes were either initiated or expanded on foot of the increased budgetary allocation: 1.  The establishment of centres of excellence in biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology (AMT), and Optoelectronics; 2. A pilot project to investigate a commercially viable method of treating pig slurry in the Lough Sheelin region; 3. A programme to upgrade the facilities for the mouldmaking industry at Sligo RTC; 4. The higher education industry linkages programme which develops closer linkages between industry, the universities and the RTCs, by funding joint collaborative projects and by subsidising the placement of technically qualified graduates in indigenous companies; 5. The technology audit programme to assess the technical capabilities and limitations of small and medium size companies and advise on their improvement.  The cost of these audits is being subventive by the S &amp; T development programme in order to make them available to a wider range of companies; 6. The technology development programme for the south-east region (SERTEC).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion of the science and technology development programme in 1989 <Col N="1023" /> considerably increased the level of technical assistance available to industry.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not necessarily accept all of the views put forward by the OECD in their recently published economic survey as appropriate to a small open economy such as Ireland.  I am, however, pleased that the OECD confirms the very favourable economic environment created by <Col N="1024" /> recent Government policy and that it projects a steady expansion of output and employment.</P>
    <P>It has generally been accepted that there should be a shift in State support away from fixed assets.  Such a shift is indeed taking place and is expected to continue as increased resources are devoted to management development, marketing and science and technology. The aim of industrial policy is to ensure that the form and level of the various support mechanisms are appropriate to the particular needs of the different sectors of industry.  The shift away from fixed assets will be more pronounced in the indigenous sector where State support is increasingly concentrated on the areas mentioned above.  Ireland is not a natural location for high labour-intensive projects which will tend to locate in regions with the lowest labour costs.  Overseas firms will therefore tend to be more capital-intensive and support will inevitably be concentrated on the cost of such assets.  However, the cost of such support is directly measured against the number and quality of the people employed.</P>
    <P>The overseas owned industry located here already provides in excess of 80,000 jobs in this country and the Government attaches great importance to the continuance of their overseas promotion activities as a source for increased employment.  This requires the maintenance of an attractive package of incentives but this is not at the expense of the many initiatives and programmes designed to support the growth of indigenous industry.  The OECD survey has acknowledged the major changes introduced in recent years to achieve greater value for money and the moves to more market-oriented assistance.</P>
    <P>The expenditures in Ireland of the foreign owned manufacturing sector represent an extremely important and growing market for indigenous Irish industry.  The Irish Economy Expenditure Survey 1983-1987 undertaken by the IDA, which is referred to in the OECD survey, shows that in excess of £3,000 million was spent in this country by our overseas sector on wages, raw <Col N="1025" /> materials and services during 1987. Of this figure £956 million was estimated to have been spent on raw materials/components and £932 million on services.  I accept that the linkage impact of their activities is less than that of the Irish owned sector but the purchases of the latter reflect heavily the high agricultural inputs of the food industry. The IDA survey shows that if the food sector is excluded, the domestic purchases of our foreign owned sector of raw materials/components and services on a per employee basis is actually greater than those of the Irish owned sector. Domestic purchases by the foreign owned sector have increased substantially in recent years as a result of initiatives such as the national linkage programme.  The OECD report has noted that &ldquo;the rapid increase in Irish exports since 1986 has so far not entailed any corresponding acceleration in import growth, suggesting an improvement in the ability of domestic producers to supply intermediate inputs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no immediate plans to make major changes in the incentives available for industrial development, but these matters are constantly under examination and scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Irish Goods Council is to provide marketing advice and assistance to small and medium sized Irish firms selling on the Irish market.  The services delivered by the council form part of the State's overall effort to develop the capability of our indigenous industry, both in terms of its capacity to meet overseas competition in the domestic market and as a preparation <Col N="1026" /> for ventures into export markets.  Traditionally, the council has delivered its support by way of sectoral trade promotions, marketing support services and industrial sub-contract services.</P>
      <P>The council has also operated a marketplace programme under which sales and marketing graduates are placed with Irish firms which otherwise could not afford to employ them.</P>
      <P>In 1989, additional resources were provided to the Irish Goods Council to enable it to expand its efforts to develop the marketing capability of Irish firms trading on the home market.  A new in-company marketing development programme was introduced with the threefold objective of: (a) alerting firms to the opportunities and requirements of the domestic market, through a series of information workshops; (b) providing a marketing consultancy service to selected firms which demonstrate a capacity to pursue new business opportunities; and (c) assisting selected firms with the cost of appointing a marketing executive as part of a marketing development initiative.</P>
      <P>The intention is to further intensify activity in this area in the coming years. I am satisfied that with the addition of the new measures I have referred to, the range of support services now in place represents an appropriate and adequate response to the needs of industry at this time.  It should be remembered at all times that the primary responsibility for the development and expansion of firms lies with the firms themselves.  Nonetheless, I am, of course, anxious that the State's delivery of support services to industry generally should be as efficient and effective as possible.  I am, therefore, looking at our current arrangements to see whether perhaps some real improvements could be made.</P>

      <P>Twelve trading houses have been licensed to date, of which ten are based in Dublin, one in Blarney, County Cork and one in New Ross, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>As the scheme is still at an early stage of development, the first licences having been issued in April 1988, the Deputy will appreciate that it is very difficult at this stage to give any firm indication as to how the trading houses are performing. Like all business concerns, they need time to get their operations off the ground.  In addition, the business of export marketing, which is the sole purpose of all the trading houses, takes considerable time to initiate and consolidate. From a survey of the operations of licensed trading houses carried out in April-May of this year, it emerged that while some companies had commenced selling operations, some were still finalising market research.  Those which had commenced operations expressed confidence in their future development prospects.</P>
      <P>I should add that while trading houses have an important role to play in the development of exports from our small and medium sized enterprises, I do not regard them as a panacea to the general problem of marketing weakness which affects the majority of our SMEs.  Ideally every Irish firm should aspire towards the development of an in-house marketing capability.  However, the reality is that many of our smaller firms lack the resources to undertake such development and for these the trading house represents a useful route for securing opportunities on export markets and I would encourage such firms to consider strongly this possibility.</P>

      <P>The general procedures <Col N="1030" /> for ensuring that the amount for which goods are insured reflect the actual value of goods exported are applied by the Insuranced Corporation of Ireland when claims arise under a policy.  In accordance with normal insurance practice before such a claim is paid the exporter must demonstrate that he has complied fully with the terms and conditions of his insurance policy and, in particular, that the amount being claimed is properly owing by the overseas buyer.  Detailed documentary evidence in relation to shipment, origin, value owing and quality must be submitted by an exporter in support of a claim.</P>
      <P>In no case can insurance cover apply in respect of amounts which exceed the actual value of goods sold, nor does insurance generally apply in respect of export sales that do not in fact take place.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied therefore that the procedures for assessing insurance liabilities carried out by ICI and my Department are sufficiently rigorous.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that, within the resources available, adequate scientific and technological assistance is available to Irish industry.</P>
      <P>There have been three strategic moves in relation to this matter.  The Office of Science and Technology was established in March 1987.  Secondly a special science and technology development programme budget, which in the current year is over £12 million, has been created.  Thirdly the Science and Technology Act, 1987, provided for the merger of the two main State bodies dealing with this area &mdash; the IIRS and the NBST.  The objective of the merger was to ensure the most coherent provision of services to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> The science and technology development programmes contain a number of new initiatives of particular relevance to small industry.  Many of these follow the recommendations of the 1987 OECD report on innovation policy in Ireland. They include a placement scheme for science and engineering graduates in small companies and a technology audit service to small and medium sized companies. These programmes, in conjunction with the technical assistance provided by Eolas, the product development and training grants available through the IDA, and the increased availability of services from the private sector and from the third level education sector, provide a significant source of scientific and technological services to industry.</P>

      <P>Section 61 of the Insurance Act, 1989, empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce, where he considers it necessary in the public interest, and following consultation with the insurance industry and consumer representatives to prescribe codes of conduct to be observed by insurers in relation to duty of disclosure and warranties on the part of prospective or actual policyholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is at present having discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation, which is the representative body for the majority of insurers operating here.  The federation are prepared to adopt a code of practice in respect of duty of disclosure and warranties.  To this end, they are preparing a document, modelled <Col N="1032" /> on the voluntary code adopted by the Association of British Insurers, which will be completed and submitted to my Department in the near future.  This document will be the basis of further discussions with the insurance industry. Consultations will also take place with representatives of insurance intermediaries and, of course, consumer interests.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's confident expectation that an acceptable voluntary code of practice, which would be adhered to by all insurers, will emerge from the current discussions.</P>
    <P>While I am anxious that codes of practice in the industry be implemented as soon as possible, I am also concerned that those codes achieved the maximum protection for the consumer in so far, of course, as that protection does not unfairly prejudice insurers' interests.  The issues, therefore, need to be thoroughly examined, before any code, whether voluntary or statutory, is put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts Act, which abolished juries in personal injury cases has been in operation since October 1988. The objective of the changeover to trial before a judge sitting alone was to bring greater consistency and predictability into the award of damages in such cases. It was also hoped that there would be a more even and perhaps fairer application of the principles of the law of tort and that greater account would be taken of the impact of contributory negligence.</P>
      <P>The limited evidence available to date has led to speculation that, in a number of cases heard by judges sitting alone, award levels may have risen, particularly with regard to certain types of injury. However, the limited number of these cases and the fact that 40 per cent of them have been appealed to the Supreme Court, clearly emphasises that it is, as yet, too early to draw definite conclusions about the impact of the Courts Act on the level of awards.  Indeed, at the time of the passing of the legislation, it was expected that it would be some considerable time before a pattern would emerge on award levels.  The result of the appeals to the Supreme Court will, of course, provide some further indication of possible trends in the level of awards. I would add that the vast majority of personal injury cases do not proceed to a verdict in the High Court but are disposed of by way of settlement or withdrawal. Clearly it may be some time yet before it will be possible to draw conclusions on how settlements are being affected by the level of awards by the court.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to improving the environment for liability insurance, and the Ministers for Justice and the Environment are considering further initiatives regarding the operation of the courts and the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must, of course, stress that the rates for motor insurance are determined by the claims experience of underwriters &mdash;<Col N="1034" /> both frequency of claims and levels of awards.  Despite claims experience which has not improved, and indeed may be worsening especially in terms of the number of claims, many motorists are now paying less in real terms for their insurance than they were two years ago. As Minister for Industry and Commerce it is my intention to ensure that should the claims experience of underwriters of motor insurance improve, whether on foot of the Courts Act, 1988, or any other Government initiatives, appriopriate benefits will be passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>Membership of the EC has already increased the competitive environment in which industry operates through the removal of the various tariff barriers and this has been reflected in the major restructuring of industry which has already taken place.  While the completion of the internal market will undoubtedly bring increased competition for Irish industry it will equally create positive opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC, in its detailed examination of Ireland's prospects in the European Community, took the view that the longrun benefits of market completion are likely to be unevenly distributed.  It recommended that scale and innovation should be important elements in Ireland's industrial policy.  The industrial development agencies are already focused on these aspects, which are fully reflected in the industry programme, which has been <Col N="1035" /> prepared by my Department and submitted to the EC for Structural Fund support.  Particular emphasis is being placed on developing the management, marketing and technological capability of firms with resources devoted to these aspects doubling by 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two programmes, in particular, which have an important role to play in helping companies meet the challenges and opportunities of the Single Market.  The company development programme is designed to assist and encourage companies to take a strategic view of their development potential, market prospects and the appropriate developmental strategy to adopt to achieve an effective market presence.  Two hundred companies have already been assisted under this programme.  Many companies are being assisted under the programme a second time as they reach a further stage in their development.  The national linkage programme is helping to develop a core of top-class Irish supply companies which can initially meet the purchasing requirements of the multinational companies located in Ireland and subsequently develop a real export presence. Seventy companies are being actively worked with under the programme.  Both of these programmes are notable in that they operate on an inter-agency basis with the specialised skills of all of the State support agencies made available to individual firms.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that the overriding priority is to build up our own indigenous industry and the vast bulk of State resources are devoted to this end.  Nevertheless, I believe that our overseas owned manufacturing sector is a vital and permanent part of our economy, directly employing over 80,000 people and spending a total of over £3 billion in 1988 in the Irish economy.  The overseas sector has brought improved management practice and skills to Ireland and has introduced us to new technologies and has helped compensate somewhat for the weaknesses of our indigenous industrial base.  The advent of 1992 is opening up <Col N="1036" /> new opportunities for overseas investment in Ireland as EFTA, US, Japanese and other Far-Eastern firms are positioning themselves for the reality of the Single European Market.  I believe that we are particularly well placed to capture a disproportionate share of that mobile investment as is evidenced by major recent project announcements such as INTEL and MOTOROLA from the US and BROTHER and FUJITSU ISOTEC from Japan.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the performance of industry over the past two and a half years has been good with manufacturing investment, output and exports booming with a net growth in manufacturing employment.  The success of the recent past makes clear that the most important contribution which the Government can make to the successful development of industry is the creation of a competitive and stable environment.  This has been achieved, and will only be maintained, with the support of the social partners.</P>
    <P>Ireland has in place probably one of the most sophisticated and comprehensive support packages in the world for the development of industry with the form and level of support geared to the particular requirements of the different sectors of industry.  We have a competitive economy with low inflation and low interest rates, an attractive corporate tax regime, the availability of a highly skilled workforce, a comprehensive range of financial support mechanisms and a range of professionally staffed State support agencies.</P>
    <P>I have no immediate plans to propose major changes in the incentives available for industrial development.  I have arranged for my Department to fully examine the key industrial policy issues in the context of the second triennial review of industrial performance which is due for publication early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that price control was removed by the Government in January 1986.  Since then motor insurers are required only to notify my Department of alterations in their rates.  The sanction by me of increases in motor insurance premiums referred to by the Deputy does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>My primary and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies, including motor insurers, maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. I must, therefore, respect the right of motor insurance firms to make their own underwriting decisions, including the setting of motor insurance premia, in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of insurance rates indicates that despite the recent increases the Deputy refers to, many motorists are now paying less for their insurance than they were in 1987, mainly because of increased competition in the market.  However, I am aware that underwriters' losses have been increasing.  Unless there is an improvement in the underwriting experience one cannot expect overall reductions in rates for motor insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> The price of motor insurance in this country, as indeed in any other market, is substantially dependent on the frequency and level of claims.  Unless and until the claims experience in Ireland matches that obtaining in other EC countries there will be divergences between motor insurance premiums in Ireland and those applying in other member states of the EC.</P>
    <P>Let me add that the Government are committed to improving the environment for motor insurance and it is my intention to ensure that should the claims experience of underwriters of motor insurance improve, appropriate benefits will be passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The numbers of private households in each county at the 1986 Census of Population, together with a disaggregation by type of housing unit, are shown in Table A.  Housing units may contain more than one private household and the precise number of housing units involved is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Table B gives details in respect of housing units which were vacant or from which the occupiers were absent on census night.  The details have been compiled on the basis of an analysis of the background working documents used by the enumerators at the census.  When delivering the census forms prior to the census the enumerators were required to note whether a dwelling was vacant or whether the occupants were likely to be absent on census night.  In the case of vacant dwellings an indication was required as to whether, in the opinion of <Col N="1043" /> the enumerator, the dwelling was habitable or not.  The purpose of this task was to ensure as complete an enumeration as possible since the enumerator was required to return to all these dwellings to verify the position when the census forms were being collected.</P>
    <P>The first three columns of Table B <Col N="1044" /> relate to housing units described by the enumerators as being &ldquo;habitable&rdquo;, while the final two columns relate to housing units being renovated or newly under construction but not yet habitable on census night.  Not included in the table are details of housing units in a dilapidated or vandalised condition, unfit for habitation.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Finance Act, 1986, provides for the repayment of deposit interest retention tax deducted from persons aged 65 years or over who would not otherwise be liable to tax on the relevant interest.  However, the legislation specifically provides that such payment may be made only at the end of the income tax year.  Such a provision is necessary as the Revenue Commissioners would be in a position to determine the amount of tax due to be refunded only when all details of a tax-payer's income and allowances are available. For the same reason a system of interim refunds would not be practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 to 69, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In November 1987, the Government announced their approval in principle to the establishment of a national archaeological park in the Boyne Valley.  The purpose of such a park is to ensure the preservation of the archaeological remains and their environmental setting while at the same time providing facilities for visitors to apreciate the monuments.</P>
      <P>The proposals evolved from the recommendations of a committee which included the Professor of Archaeology, University College, Dublin, and representatives of Meath County Council, the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>A specialist planning and landscape consultant was engaged to assist the committee. Among the consultant's recommendations were:</P>
      <P>&mdash;The delineation of the core area which will form the archaeological park together with a surrounding buffer zone.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The provision of a central visitor centre, car parking etc.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The rationalisation of visitor access and circulation, including the provision of an internal transportation system.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The registration of the core area under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
      <P>These recommendations were accepted in principle.  The consultant also outlined a number of management options, which are under consideration.  No definitive plans for the park have yet been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A public presentation of the broad concept of the park was made in Slane on 12 June 1989 and an invitation issued to all interested parties to submit their views. Consultation has taken place in the meanwhile with a local liaison committee and with many individual residents and landowners. This process will continue as further details of the development evolve. <Col N="1056" /> A more detailed outline of the overall scheme will be made available to the public in due course.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to acquire a site for the visitor centre and it is hoped to achieve this by agreement rather than by the use of compulsory powers.  Negotiations are taking place with the owners of a number of possible sites.  Until a particular site is acquired it is not possible to give an outline of pedestrian or vehicular access.</P>
    <P>A progress report has been given to the National Monuments Advisory Council and consultations with the local authority will also take place.  The normal consultation process with the planning authority will take place in respect of building development.</P>
    <P>No specific public walkways are being planned at present but when this issue arises consideration will be given to any implications this may have for agriculture. It is envisaged that, on payment of an entrance charge, visitors will have admission to the visitor centre and other State property and the use of a transportation system.</P>
    <P>The description of the area as an archaeological park confers no new powers on the authorities involved nor imposes any new restrictions on traditional farming or commercial activities. The registration of the area as an Archaeological Area under section 5 of the National Monuments Act, 1987, as recommended by the consultant would confer on the commissioners the right to be consulted in relation to any proposed works in the registered area.</P>

      <P>The optimum number of marinas cannot be decided in the abstract but will have to take account of the development of the market and other relevant factors. The Department of the Marine are pursuing a policy of facilitating private investment in marinas and will encourage those initiatives which can enhance Ireland's tourism and leisure facilities.  It will support any organisation which is prepared to raise the level of investment required and to devote the time and effort necessary for the development of marinas at suitable locations.  Due to other development priorities the Department is unable at present to provide direct financial assistance towards the construction of marinas.</P>

      <i>Less-favoured Areas</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the cattle headage scheme which applies in the most severely handicapped areas grants of £70 each are available on the first eight beef cows, and £66 on the next 22.  The maximum grant payable is £2,012 on 30 cows.  Under the beef cow scheme which applies in the less severely handicapped areas, beef cows <Col N="1063" /> can qualify for grants of £70 each on the first eight cows, and £66 on the next 20. The maximum grant payable is £1,880 on 28 cows.</P>
    <P>
      <i>All Areas</i>
    </P>
    <P>The EC Suckler Cow Scheme, which applies to the entire country, is worth £52.43 per cow per year and there is no limit on the number of cows which can qualify in any herd.  A special beef premium of £34.96 per animal is payable on male animals over nine months of age, throughout the whole country.  This premium is payable once in an animal's lifetime and there is a limit of 90 animals per farmer per year.  These grants should underpin further expansion in the suckler herd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive range of information on trade and marketing issues is available to industry in both the services and manufacturing sectors.</P>
      <P>In the case of overseas markets, the primary source of such information is Córas Tráchtála whose market information centre contains the largest collection of trade and market information available in Ireland.  This centre offers exporters and potential exporters direct on-line access to quality data which is vital for firms planning initiatives in overseas markets.  The value of this service to industry is reflected in the fact that almost 18,000 inquiries/searches were conducted at the centre in 1988.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council has available a comprehensive data-base of trade and marketing information relating to the domestic market and this information is freely available to service and manufacturing firms.  In 1988, the Irish Goods Council processed 6,200 inquiries from manufacturing and service firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above services, which provide essential basic data ranging from trading conditions in specific markets to identified opportunities in product sectors, both Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council issue &ldquo;Guide to Industry&rdquo;<Col N="1070" /> booklets, which focus on specific areas of opportunity for Irish firms.  Both agencies also arrange regular seminars and workshops to advise firms of trade and marketing developments.</P>
    <P>I regard the availability of these information services as an essential element in the State's support for industry and would encourage Irish industry to make full use of them.</P>

Conditions of employment and collective agreements would also cover these types of leave <Col N="1072" /> situations as well as leave in a wide variety of specific circumstances (e.g. sick leave, study leave).</P>
      <P>As regards leave for employees elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the legislation establishing most State-sponsored bodies makes specific provision for this type of leave.

Implementation of this regulation is under consideration at present and European Commission agreement to the details of the scheme will be necessary before it could come into operation.  As the legal basis for payment of the premium was only laid down on 18 June 1989, payment could not be made retrospective to farmers who planted before that date.</P>

      <P>An assessment of the coal resources in the Irish coalfield areas, including the Leinster coalfield, was carried out in 1982 by consultants engaged by my Department.

    <P>I would not consider a further assessment of the coalfield appropriate in the circumstances that the information provided by the 1982 assessment on the nature and extent of the coal resources <Col N="1074" /> there still holds good except in so far as it may be supplemented by information deriving from work conducted under the exploration licences issued in recent years.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions No. 101 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>At present a prescribed relative allowance may be paid as an increase in pension to an incapacitated pensioner who is being looked after by a prescribed relative. The amount of the allowance is £28 per week.  To qualify for the allowance the pensioner must require full-time care and attention and except for the prescribed relative be living alone, or only with children under age 18 or handicapped people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> Payment of an increased level of allowance to persons looking after elderly or sick relatives, and extending the scope of the allowance would involve a significant change in present arrangements.  I am well aware of the value of the work of people looking after elderly or incapacitated persons.  As a first step in improving the present arrangements I will be making provision in the near future by regulations to enable, under prescribed conditons, the existing allowance to be paid directly to the carer rather than to the pensioner.  Future improvements in the scheme will be brought forward as resources permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension at the rate of £29.10 plus £3.70 living alone allowance from 17 June 1988 based on a means assessment of £23.63 a week.</P>
      <P>She applied for an increase in her rate of old age non-contributory pension on 21 June 1989 and following re-investigation it was decided that she is entitled to a reduced rate pension of £22 plus £3.90 living alone allowance from 22 September 1989.  The reduced rate of pension is based on increased means of £33.03 per week, which include maintenance payments from her spouse.</P>
      <P>In view of the Deputy's statement that maintenance payments have ceased, the case has been referred to the social welfare officer for re-investigation.  When investigations are completed a decision will be made and the pensioner will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The correct amount of benefit has now been issued to the person concerned. Originally he had been certified as fit to resume work from 25 September 1989 but subsequently submitted a further medical certificate which indicated that his illness had continued up to 30 September 1989.  Payment was made in respect of the period 26 to 30 September inclusive on the basis of this further certificate. Inquiries were necessary to establish whether he had in fact resumed work on 25 September 1989.  These inquiries confirmed that he did not work on that day and a cheque for £8.40 in respect of that day was issued to him on 27 October 1989.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that there is no application pending in the Land Registry under the folio number quoted by the Deputy.  There is, however, an application pending for the issue of a duplicate land certificate made on 10 August, 1984 by a solicitor acting for one of the persons mentioned in the details supplied by the Deputy.  By letter dated 7 September, 1984 the registry informed the solicitor of the requirements necessary for the issue of a duplicate land certificate.  In May, 1988 the applicant's solicitor sought confirmation that the original land certificate had not been retained in the registry.  Following searches, it was confirmed to the solicitor on 19 July, 1988 that the original land certificate had not been retained in the registry.  On 17 May, 1989 the applicant's solicitor lodged an affidavit and the appropriate fee for the issue of a duplicate land certificate.  The registry indicated to the solicitor on 1 June, 1989 that further requirements were necessary.  To date a reply has not been received in the registry.</P>

    <P>Details of the average sentence served in such cases and, consequently, the estimated cost to the State of each such committal are not readily available and their <Col N="1089" /> compilation would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  I can inform the Deputy, however, that the number of people in custody at any given time for non-payment of fines would represent only about 1 per cent of the total number in custody, which indicates that the sentences imposed in such cases are relatively short. It should also be borne in mind that a significant number of offenders committed for non-payment of fines obtain their release after a short time through payment of the amounts due.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are obliged to carry out monitoring for the purposes of performing their functions under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, for ensuring that relevant air quality standards established by way of regulations made under the Act are being complied with, and for the implementation of EC exchange of information decisions.</P>
      <P>A circular letter which issued to local authorities in October 1987 gave general advice regarding the monitoring of air quality standards and included a direction under section 54 of the Act by the Minister for the Environment requiring certain local authorities to monitor for specific pollutants at specified locations within their functional areas.  In addition, certain local authorities maintain other monitoring stations on a voluntary basis. The location of existing local authority air quality monitoring stations is given in the table attached.</P>
      <P>Standard measurement techniques are employed as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) Suspended particulates and Sulphur Dioxide - as described in British Standards Institution publication BS 1747 (Parts II and III): 1969, corrected as appropriate to provide a satisfactory correlation with the provisions of Council Directive 80/779/EEC;</P>
      <P>(b) Lead &mdash; in accordance with the criteria outlined in the Annex to Council directive 82/203/EEC; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> (c) Nitrogen Dioxide &mdash; in accordance with Annex IV of Council Directive 85/203/EEC (ISO Standard DIS 7996).</P>
    <P>It is not feasible to provide all recorded <Col N="1098" /> readings for each station over the last three years.  However, a summary report on monitoring results is being prepared and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the An Foras Forbartha report of December 1986, on <i>Water Quality in Ireland &mdash; The Current Position</i> which was published in two parts.  Part One, which gives a general assessment of water quality, also contains information on the methods of assessment used, the distance between sampling locations and the factors taken into account when selecting such locations. Part Two contains river quality data which is reproduced for individual sampling locations in respect of biological water quality ratings, supplemented in many cases by physico-chemical data. The report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data on which the report is based was generated by monitoring undertaken <Col N="1101" /> by An Foras Forbartha, the regional water laboratories at Castlebar, Kilkenny and Monaghan and by various local authorities. The AFF monitoring programme is being continued by the ERU and it is intended that similar reports will be published at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>In addition to this work, local authorities undertake a range of monitoring in relation to their water pollution control functions generally.  The monitoring programmes, including the location of sampling points, are determined by the local authorities and specific information on them is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>The health boards have been asked to prepare plans to implement the recommendations of the report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>.  These <Col N="1111" /> plans will form the basis for improving services for the elderly in coming years. Some recommendations of the report, particularly those concerning improved co-ordination of services, can be implemented without additional resources.  Others will be implemented as resources permit.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Years Ahead</i> made recommendations about the need to update the current legislation governing nursing homes.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, 1989, which implements these recommendations was circulated to the Dáil recently.  Second Stage of the Bill will be taken shortly.</P>

      <P>The Government have welcomed the commission's report as a most valuable contribution to the continuing debate on health care.  In view of the complexity of the issues involved, I am now consulting with key organisations and interests in the health sector on the implications of the commission's recommendations before formulating proposals for Government.</P>
      <P>The following is the Government press statement which was issued on publication of the commission's report and dated 11 October 1989:</P>
      <P>The Government welcome the Report of the Commission on Funding of the Health Services which is published today. The report contains a very comprehensive and detailed analysis of the problems and challenges posed by the objective of providing adequate health services for the population.  The report stresses the achievements and high standards which characterises the Irish health care system.  It points out, however, that it shares the problems experienced by health services in all developed countries: the difficulty of providing access to necessary health care within the limit of resources which the community can afford.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the report of the commission is a most valuable contribution to what will be a continuing debate on these issues.  The Government will be considering the recommendations in the light of their likely impact on the quality of patient care.  The criteria for assessing health policy options must be patient centred having regard to all of the elements that make for high quality patient care.  Policy options must also be assessed in the context of the resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health will now commence a consultation process with the <Col N="1113" /> key organisations and groups involved in the health care sector with a view to establishing their views on the implications of the commission's recommendations. The Minister will, following that consultation, bring proposals before the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government wish to acknowledge the major contributions which the commission, under the chairmanship of Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien, have made to the development of health policy in Ireland.  The analysis and the careful weighing of options contained in the report will be of assistance to the Minister and the Government as it undoubtedly will be for the organisations and groups who will now be consulted about future policy directions.  The Government wish to record their deep appreciation to the members of the commission for the care and consideration with which they have prepared this major Report.</P>

    <P>In regard to secondary schools, one of the conditions attaching to the payment of grants towards the building of recognised secondary schools is that the school site shall be vested in trustees, who are required to give a formal <Col N="1121" /> undertaking regarding the continuation and maintenance of the buildings as a secondary school.</P>
    <P>Capital grants payable in respect of national schools which are vested in trustees are secured by virtue of the fact that the Minister for Education is a party to the lease.  National schools' authorities would be unable to dispose of a property without the consent of the Minister for Education of the day.  Such consent would not be forthcoming without agreement being reached on an appropriate refund to my Department in respect of capital grants paid.</P>
    <P>In relation to non-vested national schools capital grants are sanctioned only when the chairperson of the board of management accepts in writing that a refund of the unexpired value of the grant is payable to my Department in the event of the school ceasing its function within a specified period.</P>
    <P>The information sought in relation to the amount of money awarded by the State to religious orders engaged in education is not readily available in my Department's records in the format requested by the Deputy.  As its compilation would involve the deployment of staff from more urgent duties, the authorisation of such deployment would not be warranted in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Transport Act, 1986 all forms of authorisation for road haulage including road freight certificates were revoked as from 30 September 1988 and replaced by a new type of authorisation namely a road freight carrier's licence.  No record of an application by the person named for such a licence can be traced in my Department but in view of the Deputy's question an application form has now been sent to him.</P>
