      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if there has been an increase in the cost of passports; when this increase was introduced; and the reason neither he nor the Minister for Finance made an announcement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the cost of obtaining a ten year passport; and the additional annual <Col N="802" /> income which will be obtained by the recent increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will account for the present increase from £30 to £35 in the price of an Irish passport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The fee for the ten year passport was increased from £30 to £35 with effect from 1 January 1989.  The increase in the fee was given effect by an amendment to the diplomatic and consular fees orders. A copy of the amended order was presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 December and press announcements relating to the order appeared in the national press on 23 December.</P>
      <P>This is the first increase in passport fees for six years.  It represents an increase of 16 per cent and is considerably less than the increase in the consumer price index and in public service costs for the same period.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the increases will give rise to additional income of £850,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is almost £1 million. Would you agree, a Cheann Comhairle, that a better way to put it would be to say that that is three times the amount the Government are giving as an increase to the emigrants in the UK?  They have given an extra £250,000 for 1988-89 and they are taking it back before the emigrants go at all in the price of passports by collecting three times the amount on the cost of passports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there are no passports as far as the UK is concerned. Second, the last increase in passport fees <Col N="803" /> was an increase of 100 per cent introduced by the Deputy's Government in 1983.  This increase amounts to 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the increase given to the emigrants movement in the UK is being got back by an increase in the cost of passports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has made any progress in setting up a framework for talks with the Unionists outside, but parallel to the Anglo-Irish Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have repeatedly made clear their desire to engage, without preconditions, in dialogue with Unionist representatives and, as the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach has on a number of occasions publicly invited the Unionist leadership to meet with him.  As the Taoiseach said in the House on 1 February last, the Government will be glad to inform the House as soon as there are any positive developments to report in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My specific question was if the Minister had made any progress in setting up a framework for such talks. Am I to understand that no such progress has been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an ongoing framework in the form of an invitation to dialogue to Unionist representatives or anybody else who may wish to have political dialogue with the Taoiseach or the <Col N="804" /> Government, and the Taoiseach has publicly invited Unionist leadership along those lines on several occasions.  I do not see what can be done further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council is meeting today.  Has any consideration been given to the proposal put forward by the Progressive Democrats that the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council be used as a framework for such talks outside of the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That framework or any framework outside the Conference and the Agreement is open to the talks I mentioned.  The Deputy is aware of that. As long as the Conference and the Agreement continue to function and to subsist any other discussions outside that Conference framework are welcomed by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will outline his response to the statement issued by the Embassy of the Republic of Turkey on 19 January 1989 which was circulated to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas as a summary of points made by the Under Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey (details supplied) to Ambassadors of EC countries accredited in Turkey; and if he will make a statement on the very serious allegations against Amnesty International contained in the statement; and if he considers involvement on the human rights situation in Turkey as a necessary precondition for consideration of the application by Turkey for membership of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement to which the Deputy refers and of the Amnesty International reports on which the official of the Turkish Foreign Ministry was commenting.  I note that the statement repeats previous assurances of the Turkish Government that it is their policy to implement western standards in <Col N="805" /> the human rights field and I welcome this. I would add, however, that in our view Amnesty International is a widely respected organisation and we believe that its reports should be treated accordingly.</P>
      <P>We and our partners in the European Community give close attention to the human rights situation in Turkey and the authorities there are well aware of this. We expect them to live up to the commitments they have freely accepted under international legal instruments of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.  The Turkish Government realise that continuing reports of human rights violations are contrary to Turkey's interests, expecially in the context of its application for membership of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply for which I am grateful, may I ask him if he noted in particular the suggestion by the Turkish Government and their ambassador that Amnesty International was being manipulated by circles who were opposing entry?  May I further ask the Minister if he is concerned that between 1984 and 1988 in Turkey, 2,127 journalises were tried before 1,400 courts?  May I finally ask him, in view of correspondence I have had with his Department in the past &mdash; I covered a military tribunal in 1983 where there were 259 death sentences &mdash; if he is concerned that Turkey is proceeding with its application to the European Community while at the same time there are 700 prisoners currently under sentence of death and 5,300 before military tribunals?</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy and the House but I am constrained by the time factor involved in dealing with priority questions, the House will be aware of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which should be answered and is contained in the last sentence of my reply.  The Turkish Government realise that continuing reports of human rights violations are <Col N="806" /> contrary to Turkey's interests, especially in the context of its application for membership of the European Community. That is very clear and indicative and makes quite plain what I mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be a very brief question, Deputy.  There are two more Questions nominated for priority to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of which I got a very short answer.  I wish to ask a simple question.  Will the matters I referred to &mdash; in the Irish attitude to the Turkish application &mdash; be required to be rectified before Ireland will support Turkey's application, yes or no?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that continuing reports of human rights violations are not helpful to Turkey's interests in their application for membership of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the results of the renewal of the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be put before Dáil Éireann now that the period stipulated in column 1177 of the Dáil debate of 13 December 1988 is approaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the review provided for in Article 11 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is a review of the working of the Conference and not a renewal of the working of the Agreement.  The Deputy will be aware that the Agreement itself does not specify any definite period for completion of the review.  The period mentioned during Question Time on 13 December 1988, to which he refers, was intended to be of an indicative nature only.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Conference on 8 February we had an extensive exchange of views on work in progress at official level on the review and we gave directions on the early completion of this work.  I would anticipate finalisation of the review in approximately two months' time.  However, it is not possible to forecast a precise date at this stage.  When work on the review has been completed, I shall certainly ensure that the Dáil is fully informed of the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the misprint in the question; it is probably due to my handwriting.  Similarly, in Question No. 45 there is also a misprint, again no doubt due to my handwriting.  Does the Minister not agree that he said on 13 December in this House that the review of the workings of the Agreement would be completed by end February or early <Col N="808" /> March, two months from that time?  He is now saying on 21 February that it will take another two months.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way it has gone, I am not going to deny I said that. I gave it as an indicative date.  To use my own phraseology, the kind of deadline we had in mind was 1 March.  I agree the completion date will be a little later &mdash; two months later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are doing is reviewing the workings of the Agreement; the whole Agreement is not being reviewed. I am a little concerned that the Minister and his co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference are taking so long with what I think is quite minor work, unless there is an enormous number of submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly. there are a substantial number of submissions.  Secondly, we devoted a considerable amount of time of the recent Conference to a discussion of this matter.  Thirdly, we parted from the meeting on the basis that a firm decision was taken to devise the drafting so we will have a first draft at the next meeting.  Lastly, and this is very important, the door is still open for further representations on the part of very responsible groups within the island as a whole.  We are giving time to them and we understand there will be submissions from them currently or in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that he is embarking on a dangerous course if he thinks that by not concluding the review of the workings of the Agreement he is going to entice the Unionist parties to the table, especially as we are coming up to a very sensitive period in the North of Ireland with the forthcoming elections?</P>

      <P>It is important to emphasise why it will only be a draft at the next meeting.  This is also a matter of important politics and there must be a political as well as an administration input.  I am concerned that the way be cleared before the next meeting to examine the final draft, to have a further look at it from the political point of view and consider the position in regard to establishing structures in the future that will improve matters on a continuing and substantial basis within the two parts of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been <Col N="810" /> drawn to a report stating that the United States Department of Defense has conclusive proof that the arms shipment captured on the <i>Eksund</i> came from Libya; whether this proof has been conveyed to the Irish Government; and, if not, if he will request such proof from the United States Department of Defense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a State Department report or fact sheet of 7 January 1989 which stated that there is conclusive evidence that the <i>Eksund</i> shipment originated in Libya.  We asked the American authorities through our embassy in Washington if the reported evidence could be made available.  I understand that the US authorities in reply pointed to the case which is at present before the French courts.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate in these circumstances to comment further on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that my colleague, the Minister for Justice said in the Dáil on 14 December 1988 &mdash; column 1597-1598 of the Official Report &mdash; that the Garda are carrying out investigations into the source of the arms found on the <i>Eksund</i> and these investigations are still ongoing.</P>

The American State Department take the view that as the matter is before the French courts that is the place to give any relevant information they have on the subject.  Any inquiries about this matter and about what evidence will be brought to bear in the matter should be directed to the French Government.

      <P>As the Minister knows I have been questioning him about the supply of arms and explosives from Libya for a number of months now.  In fact it is over a year.  Does he not think, in view of the circumstantial evidence and the reply he got from the French Government and the American Government, it is time for him to directly approach the Libyan Government and tell them we do not want explosives or arms sent to an organisation in this country whose avowed aim is to destroy this country, North and South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the Libyans were informed immediately after the apprehension of the <i>Eksund</i> of the serious view we take of any country which supplies arms to the IRA.  We have made that point of view known to the Libyan Government on several occasions and we have acted on it. A joint trade commission, which was to have taken place in November 1986, was postponed and has not yet been held following the seizure of the <i>Eksund.</i> I want to repeat that the American authorities are firmly of the view that this is now a matter for the French authorities.  It is <Col N="812" /> the French, not the Americans, who have the evidence and they see it as a matter for the French authorities and the French courts how they use whatever information or evidence they may have of an intelligence or other kind.  That is the view taken by the State Department and also expressed by the French authorities. The matter rests there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I met Dr. Eugene Makhlouf, PLO representative for Sweden with responsibility also for Ireland, on 10 February. The meeting gave me an opportunity to hear at first hand the views of one who was closely involved in the sequence of events which culminated in the US decision of 14 December to initiate a substantive dialogue with the PLO after a 15-year ban.  Dr. Makhlouf explained the Palestine National Council decisions of 15 November 1988 and outlined the steps taken by the PLO towards advancing the peace process.  In our exchange of views, I outlined recent developments in the approach of the Twelve, notably their commitment to work for the convening of an international peace conference under UN auspices as the most constructive way forward.</P>
      <P>In relation to the PLO, the member states of the European Community, since the Venice Declaration of June 1980, have held the view that the Palestinian people and the PLO must be associated with any negotiations for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict.  Ireland, for its part, has recognised the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people.  International acceptance of that role has been very significantly enhanced since the Palestinian National Council decisions of 15 November, as is evidenced by the unprecedented level of support, including that of the Twelve, for General Assembly Resolution 43/176 on the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East.  This resolution explicitly includes the PLO as a participant in the conference on an equal footing with all other parties to the conflict and with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  As I have already said, Ireland, along with her partners in the Twelve, is committed to work for the early convening of an international conference on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that Mr. Arafat visited Madrid for a meeting on 27 January with the Troika of Foreign <Col N="816" /> Ministers of Greece, Spain and France who represent the Community on this particular matter.  This was a significant development in Twelve policy.  The possibility of my meeting Mr. Arafat in a Troika or Presidency capacity was mentioned in discusion with Dr. Makhlouf but the question does not arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>The criteria in international law applicable to recognition of States are not yet met in this case, but I wish to reaffirm the statement I made in this House on 13 December 1988.  The Government consider that in the context of a negotiated settlement, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determinatin includes their right to an independent State.  It is our hope that the Palestinian State proclaimed on 15 November 1988 will, in the context of a negotiated settlement, become an entity to which Ireland can extend formal legal recognition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, have the Twelve adopted any attitude to Mr. Edouard Shevardnadze's initiative now in train to establish an international conference under UN auspices? Have approaches been made to the Twelve to deal with this matter under the EPC or, alternatively, has the Russian ambassador here or the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs contacted the Government with a view to securing support for the initiative underway?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most forward initiative that has been taken by the Community is that it has established a Troika of Foreign Ministers which includes the Foreign Ministers from Spain, which holds the Presidency at present, Greece, the previous holder of the office of Presidency, and France, the next country to hold the office of Presidency.  The three Foreign Ministers are now engaged in regular, almost daily, exchanges with all the countries in the Middle East.  Apart from the countries directly involved, they have regular exchanges with the countries indirectly involved, and Israel, the United States and the Soviet Union.  The <Col N="817" /> Troika, representing the Community, is recognised as what one might call the honest broker in the situation seeking to achieve the international conference I have mentioned, that Israel and the PLO and all the other parties who should be at the conference are present, and that the Agenda proceeds on a mutual basis or recognition of Israel's right to her borders and the Palestinians right to a defined homeland that can be translated into a State which will get international recognition.</P>

The Community through the EPC process has discussed this matter on numerous occasions over the past six months; I have been there and have taken an active part in the discussions and I am conveying direct to the Dáil what has happened.  The Community Troika &mdash; and Ireland will be represented on it during the second half of this year &mdash; is the acknowledged player/broker in seeking to achieve the international conference. They are in touch with Soviet Union, with Mr. Shevardnadze, the American Government and all other countries closer to the scene.</P>

      <P>The United Nations will <Col N="818" /> eventually convene the conference.  We have a certian order established and I thought I put it plainly.  The Community will seek by these talks to reach a stage where an international conference can be held.  At that stage it will be held under the auspices of the United Nations but in these early stages of very delicate and sensitive negotiations the United Nations as such are not directly involved although, of course, they are indirectly involved to a major extent and they will convene the conference ultimately.</P>

He was concerned that the very generous steps which the Palestine National Council have taken to move forward may be lost if some pressure is not exerted on those States that are blocking progress at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assured Dr. Makhlouf, and he accepts it, that we were concerned about the early calling of a conference. This is important, but you must have all the players in place before you have the conference.  Dr. Makhlouf expressed very deep regard for and emphasised the fact that the EC had taken on the role of broker.  Indeed, I met Dr. Makhlouf two weeks ago and a week ago the Troika was taking action along the lines I had mentioned to him.  Over the past week they have been in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and they reported back to us yesterday in Brussels.  This work is going on all the time.  Naturally Dr. Makhlouf is anxious, and I respect him for that, to secure a conference as soon as possible.  I share that view, and I hope the American Government above all is equally seized of <Col N="819" /> the importance of just that.  I am hopeful that the new American Administration will adopt a more forward-looking attitude because they have great influence in this area, in particular <i>vis-á-vis</i> Israel.  I believe that this U.S. Administration will be far more forward-looking in its approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a delegated process by the EPC and it is used in occasions like this to act as an honest broker.  It is not the first time this process has been used.  The Troika comprises of the Foreign Ministers from the sitting Presidency, the previous holder, and the next holder.  In this case it is Greece, Spain and France that are involved and from 1 July onwards Spain, France and ourselves will be involved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take it that at all stages there will be incorporated in the speeches remarks repudiating violence as a means of attaining the achievements we all desire in this island and that this will be a consistent theme in every speech made.  Indeed, I am very gratified by the success that has attended this Government's efforts in this regard.  A very large segment of public opinion in America now say that our step-by-step democratic approach is the only approach to solving the Northern problems. That is the thinking within the traditional Irish-American vote.  They now appreciate that political dialogue will achieve a lot more results.  Even among the most extreme Irish-Americans there is a growing realisation of the utter futility of the violence that has been condemned by sucessive Governments in the US and elsewhere.  By way of information, the parade which I will attend in Toronto is being run by a committee which is represented equally by what one might call green and orange opinion.  The traditional Northern emigrant to Toronto has now been supplemented by emigration from the south of Ireland.  The Irish community there is very strong and equally represents both traditions of this island. The two traditions from this island can come together in Toronto to celebrate St. Patrick's Day on a bi-partisan basis.</P>

I am worried that a member of the Government will sit on a reviewing stand in New York and will make speeches <Col N="822" /> about violence perhaps but, at the same time, will review a parade consisting in part of people whose aim it is to support violence.  Will the Minister not agree with me that it is desirable at this stage that the Irish Government should signal clearly to the organisers of this parade that Irish Ministerial involvement is contingent on a decision not to include such people in a march pass before a Minister of our Government?</P>

      <P>My Department have taken the matter up with the US Embassy <Col N="823" /> in Dublin and we have been assured that it is not US immigration policy to refuse holiday visas to unemployed Irish citizens. I am advised, however, that the relevant section of US law places on non-immigrant visa applicants the burden of overcoming a presumption that they are immigrants.  In this connection I understand that before the US Embassy can grant holiday visas it is required under US law to ensure that the applicant has demonstrated compelling family, social, economic or other ties in Ireland which will oblige the individual to return here after a temporary stay in the US.  If the US authorities are not satisfied on this count they are obliged to refuse the visa application.  This rule is applied to all Irish citizens irrespective of their employment status.</P>

Will the Minister undertake to raise this matter with the American authorities to ensure that the law is applied in a more flexible manner?

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The Minister will appreciate that the conditions under which democratic political parties have to operate in Northern Ireland are quite grim, that by and large politicians do not have access to resources such as the larger parties in this House have and that it is important to enhance the activities of the democratic parties in the North, to give some assistance, financial or otherwise, to them in pursuing their democratic objectives.

      <P>There is a procedure for financial assistance to parties elected to Westminister, parties of either two MPs or one MP with at least 150,000 votes at the preceding general election.  They are entitled to financial assistance for the conduct of parliamentary business.  As the Deputy is aware, the SDLP are an obvious case and may be beneficiaries under that procedure.  None of the political parties with whom I have had dialogue, primarily the SDLP, has approached me in this matter.  There are various good reasons why they might not approve of funding from us.  They have <Col N="825" /> their own political process to engage in. I have nothing but admiration for the manner in which the SDLP over the years have performed within the financial constraints that exist but they have never suggested that I should do what the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Community Treaties and the Single European Act, Ireland has committed itself to pursue common or closely co-ordinated policies with its partners in the Community.  Therefore, at the Vienna meeting of the Conference on Security <Col N="826" /> and Co-operation in Europe, Ireland participated in co-ordination among the members of the European Community in all relevant areas covered by European political co-operation or under Community competence.  For the same reason, Ireland participates in Twelve co-operation in the CSCE process generally where issues within Twelve or Community competence arise.  It would be inconsistent with this commitment to commit ourselves to co-ordination in another group.  At the same time, we maintain close informal contacts with the delegations of the neutral and non-aligned States, which permit us to work together in pursuing the many objectives which we share in the CSCE process.</P>

      <P>There has always been particularly close association with that group within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe who, as the Deputy knows, recently reached successful conclusions in Vienna.  We have had regular discussions and talks and relations are excellent between Ireland and these members.  We are regarded by them as a bridge, as it were, between their point of view and the Community point of view or the views of certain member countries within the Community which may not be as strongly committed towards <i>détente</i> as the neutral and non-aligned countries.  As a member of the Community and as a country we have had excellent relations with Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Eastern European countries as well but that does not in any way take from our basic membership of the European Political Co-operation system within the Community.  We have been a help within the EPC process in advancing the cause of other countries which are also concerned about peace in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All that area is under discussion at present.  Indeed both the Austrian Foreign Minister and the Hungarian Foreign Minister will come here within the next few months with a view to putting their point of view on this matter before us.  What the Deputy raised will be part of the discussion, but no conclusions have been reached.  The first aim within the Community is to achieve the 1992 targets and subsequently the question of enlargement of membership will come into focus.  In the meantime very real talks are going on between all these countries and the Community. Indeed, President Delors has emphasised that the EFTA countries in particular should get themselves into a state of economic and social readiness for entry whenever it is appropriate to do so.  That is the general scenario at present.  I am against a narrow, inward looking Europe and I am very much in favour &mdash; and I think this would be the Irish consensus &mdash; of broadening the European Community. However, that raises problems of the kind mentioned in regard to Austria and its position with regard to neutrality and the State Treaty with the Soviet Union.  There are a number of aspects of that kind which have to be overcome and they are being debated at present.</P>

That is the position at present but it is too soon to come to any final decision.  All I am saying is that dialogue will proceed during the current year and the Austrian Foreign Minister in particular is engaged on a very heavy schedule of visits to various capitals, both in Eastern and Western Europe, with a view to furthering the Austrian position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts provided in official development assistance for the years 1987 to date are as follows: 1987, £39.1 million; 1988, £32.8 million; and 1989, £33.7 million.  The figure for 1988 is provisional and the 1989 figure is an estimate.  The 1988 figure represented a reduction of £6.3 million on the 1987 figure.  The 1989 estimate represents an increase of £900,000 on the 1988 figure.</P>
      <P>The best estimate for voluntary contributions made through non-governmental organisations in 1987 was £16.25 million.  Figures for 1988 and 1989 are not available yet.

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for being here to answer this question because very often there is a problem getting information about development aid from a Minister of State who does not have direct Cabinet <Col N="829" /> accountability for decisions.  Will the Minister confirm that it is a fundamental plank of the Government's approach that the poor should be protected?  With regard to decisions on social welfare, some minimal protection has been afforded to those who are on social welfare and there has been at least a guarantee that increases will remain in line with inflation.  In that context, how can the Minister explain the decimation of our aid programme over and above the average level of cutback in any other Government Department in the past two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to point out that while there was a token sum of £1,000 in the Estimates this year and last year for disaster and famine tragedies, in fact £1 million was spent during the past 12 months under that heading out of lottery funds.  As long as we can use lottery funds for that purpose I see no reason why we should not do so.  Concern and GOAL, the main recipients of Government aid in this respect, have done excellent work in areas struck by disaster and famine.  The are willing to take this money from lottery funds; they have no objection to this.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there was a reduction last year in the Estimate and we have put the process into reverse this year to some extent.  In our first budget on coming into office, as part of the general pruning exercise that has successfully taken place, we reduced the amount under the heading referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the global figures given by the Minister, there has been a very radical cut of £26 million over those two years in the bilateral aid programme, aid directed to the very poorest of the poor.  In that context how can the Minister with any credibility assert that his Government have any commitment at all to honouring our UN target?  Can he offer any explanation other than, first, a lack of commitment on the part of the Government in general and, second, failure on his own part to put the case adequately?  This programme, more than any other, has been cut and <Col N="830" /> would the Minister give an indication of rapid rehabilitation in the coming years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we are due some credit for so pruning the exercise that we did not have any significant reduction in the actual allocation of aid moneys.  We had the cut in that budget, as I have said, but it was possible to meet all our commitments up to and including last year out of EC allocations.  That was some achievement in view of the cuts made.  We found that there was unnecessary expenditure here and there.  This year we have an increased amount allocated to nearly £1 million.  That is in the Estimate alone, apart from what we might give on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis towards disaster and famine relief.  I hope that the improvement in the national economy will justify progressively increasing the allocation under this heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has provided some humanitarian assistance in the past to the people of Cambodia and Vietnam, both through non-governmental organisations and through the appropriate United Nations agencies.  It is in principle willing to do so again.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia has now lasted for over a decade in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law.  In these circumstances the European Community does not provide reconstruction and development aid to Vietnam, or to a Cambodia which is so occupied.  It should, however, be noted that, although official European Community assistance is not provided to the Vietnamese Government or to the Heng Samrin regime, the Community continues to provide various forms of humanitarian and emergency assistance to the people of Cambodia and Vietnam.  The Community remains open to providing, when necessary, humanitarian and emergency assistance to the people of those countries and we of course would contribute to this through our membership of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988, the total value of Community <Col N="832" /> assistance in relation to Cambodia was over six MECU and over 2.5 MECU in relation to Vietnam.  In respect of Cambodia, 3.2 MECU was given for Cambodian refugees on the Thai/Cambodia border and 2.8 MECU was given for various projects in Cambodia operated by non-governmental organisations.  In respect of Vietnam, the Community assistance was in the form of cereals and other foods given via other agencies or as emergency assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Deputy on channeling aid through reputable organisations of the kind mentioned by her.  Particularly in places like Cambodia and Vietnam, on the question of getting contact with any Government or administrative authority to pass on aid there is great difficulty.  We have always operated in that part of the world through non-governmental organisations and rightly so.  I shall examine possibilities of improving that operation through the bodies referred to by the Deputy, bodies that are very active there, such as Concern and Trócaire.</P>

If the Vietnamese had not intervened in Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge would be still annihilating the population there.  Would the Minister indicate what percentage of the EC aid that has gone to these two countries has been provided by this country?

We have given funds in these areas, rightly, through non-governmental agencies or through international organisations such as UNICEF or the Community itself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before answering the question I would like to say that I take it the Deputy is referring to the legislation entitled the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts, 1978 and 1987. As the Deputy will see from the title, it applies only to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government avail of every opportunity to convey their views on the substance and the operation of this Act, and this would include informing Lord Colville of these views.  The matter was also discussed at the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 8 February in the context of improving relations between the Community and the security forces, particularly in relation to the handling of complaints and police accompaniment of UDR and army patrols likely to come into contact with members of the public.  In accordance with normal practice, I do not intend to go into the detail of these discussions. I can say, however, that among other aspects of the legislation, the Government expressed views on the method for certifying charges for trial by the Diplock Courts, the range of scheduled offences, statutory protection for persons in custody, the rules on confession evidence and the exercise of the powers of entry and search.</P>
      <P>The content of any legislation which might follow this Act which is due to expire in 1992 is a matter for the British Government and Parliament.  As I have said, the British Government are aware of our strong views on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the action his Department have taken at national level and also in respect of each diplomatic mission abroad, to promote State agencies and private consultancies on overseas consultancy opportunities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Col N="836" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the emphasis placed by the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> on the promotion of overseas consultancy opportunities the Department of Foreigh Affairs are giving a high priority to their work in this area.</P>
      <P>They do so through their general foreign earnings promotion work at headquarters and in missions abroad, including missions to international organisations, through the bilateral aid programme and through their access to information on multilaterally funded projects. In this context, they monitor opportunites open to Irish firms for consultancy work, bring these to the attention of interested bodies and, where necessary, advise on the preparation of submissions or lobbies on behalf of Irish applicants.  Missions abroad work closely with State bodies active in the consultancies area in relation to information, contacts and follow-up.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable to set out in detail the involvement of each mission abroad in the promotion of overseas consultancies. Certain missions, for example the embassy at Washington and the Permanent Representation at Brussels which are in a position to deal directly with the major international lending agencies play a key role in relation to information, contacts and follow-up.</P>
      <P>Those missions which are accredited to developing countries (for example, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran) also play an important role both with regard to the processing of contracts and also in the provision of practical assistance on the spot.  In the case of missions in developed free market countries, the fact that the structures in the private sector are already well developed tends to reduce the extent of embassy involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw particular attention to the bilateral aid programme which has employed a wide range of Irish consultants to carry out projects in developing countries.  Major international agencies have been impressed by the effective and relevant work done by such consultants under the bilateral aid programme and this has been helpful to the <Col N="837" /> Irish entities in seeking further overseas consultancy opportunities.</P>
    <P>The promotion of overseas consultancies is also included on all appropriate occasions in the course of high level inter-Governmental exchanges. Such exchanges may take place in the framework of joint commissions with other countries or in the course of bilateral visits.  It is our intention to continue to avail of such opportunities to the full.</P>

It is really an ongoing, two-way process of information and contact at home and in the embassy of the country where the opportunities may be.</P>

Deputy Bell asked what action the Minister's Department had taken to assist these developments.  Can the Minister defend the cut of £26 million over the past two years in that area?  If he did not adequately respond on humanitarian grounds, perhaps on narrow commercial grounds he might be willing to admit the folly of these cutbacks?</P>

The Committee of Selection is a procedure whereby the parties nominate people to committees.  There is a Fianna Fáil vacancy on a particular committee and the Committee of Selection report purports to fill that vacancy, nothing more.  As far as the Government and I are concerned, this committee should sit and do its business.  It has full authority and capacity to look into and investigate any matters it wishes.  All we are concerned with in the Committee of Selection report, in accordance with time honoured, unassailable precedent, is the filling of a vacancy on a committee so that it may proceed to do its work.

      <P>The Committee of Selection have done the job they were set up to do, and I have no quarrel with them. They must, of course, be allowed to carry out their function properly in the context of the various changes that are required. The reason we did not agree to this matter being taken without debate is that there were a number of aspects of the replacement of Deputy Liam Lawlor on the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies that I believe should be looked at by this House.  They will, I understand, be looked at by the joint committee itself during the course of the afternoon and in that respect, a Cheann Comhairle, my colleagues on that committee will be proposing that in so far as the committee are concerned with discussing the affairs of the Irish Sugar Company, they should continue to do so under the guidance of the vice-chairman of the committee, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, until that issue has been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the issue itself, we have the position where the chairman of that committee felt it incumbent on him to resign, I would like to know from the Taoiseach what part he played in that and what the background to it was.  As I said earlier, I put down two questions both of which were ruled out of order on the grounds that the Taoiseach had no responsibility in the matter.  The fact of the matter is that as far as press reports go it appears that the Taoiseach intervened in the matter on 16 February and Deputy Lawlor immediately resigned from the committee.  I would like to know <Col N="922" /> from the Taoiseach what considerations led him to speak to Deputy Lawlor about the matter and what considerations brought them both to the conclusion that Deputy Lawlor should resign.</P>
    <P>The history of the affair might go back further than this, but as far as the rest of us know, it began on 17 November last when, according to the information that has been made public, the chairman of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta wrote to the committee.  Some reports suggest that what the chairman sent to the committee was a confidential document. Other reports &mdash; and I think these are the accurate ones &mdash; say that what the chairman sent to the committee was a series of replies to questions that had been raised by the committee during a discussion with officers of the company. It appears also that the chairman asked that the matter be handled with sensitivity so that the replies would not become a political football.  Some reports suggest that the chairman asked that the matter be treated as confidential.  Whatever about that, and I have not seen the actual correspondence, it seems also that the chairman of the Sugar Company separately wrote to the clerk of the committee and suggested that the clerk check with the chairman of the committee on whether the information should be circulated to the press.  The then chairman says he told the clerk of the committee not to circulate the information when it was received on 18 November and that, to my mind, is the first extraordinary or unusual event in all this.  The then chairman also said that he had not seen the documentation in question.  My question is, if he had not seen it how could he decide that it should not be circulated? What grounds were there for not circulating it other than a request by the chairman of the Sugar Company, and was that request to be taken on its own without any reference to the chairman or any other member of the committee as sufficient reason not to circulate to the committee information that the committee itself had asked for and that the committee was bound to get at some stage anyway, or did the then chairman <Col N="923" /> of the committee know what was in it and, if so, what view did he form of it?</P>
    <P>It transpired subsequently, in a statement from Deputy Lawlor on 15 February, that the document was available to committee members in the clerk's office. When I first read that I came to the conclusion, and I think it is a fairly reasonable one, that he had taken some steps to inform the members of the committee at the time the documentation was received that while it was not being circulated they could consult it in the office of the clerk, a curious enough procedure but one that one could envisage.</P>
    <P>Now it seems that that was not the case because the members were not even told of the existence of the documentation until 7 February and therefore they could not have been told that the documentation was available for them to refer to until that particular date.  On 17 January of this year the chairman of a company of which Deputy Lawlor is a director wrote to the chairman of the Sugar Company expressing an interest in acquiring part or all of the operation of the company. Deputy Lawlor at that stage apparently did not feel that he was obliged to declare an interest or to step down because it was not for another ten days that he took any action of that kind.  The question must arise did the Deputy know anything in the meantime?  If so, what did he know?  Did he acquire information or knowledge about the contents of the document of 17 November last during that time, and if so, what did he do with it?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to credit, without any supporting statement from the other side of the House, that he did not know, first, what was in the documentation sent by the Sugar Company and, second, that the company of which he was a director had expressed an interest in acquiring another company.  This is not just a normal commercial acquisition.  It has become a very large player in the food sector, expressing an interest in acquiring some or all of a major semi-State corporation.  It is all the more difficult, without some supporting statement from elsewhere, to credit that <Col N="924" /> he had not that information when we reflect that Deputy Lawlor has apparently a very central role in that firm of which he is a director.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that he played a very forward role indeed in the acquisition by that company of Bailieboro Co-op. Members are also in a position to know that he played a very central role in the activities of that company in Tuam.  I am led to believe that Members of the House have personal knowledge of the fact that Deputy Lawlor was seen in Thurles in recent times.  Therefore he was playing, as I have said, a fairly central or forward role in the activities of that company of which he is a director.  In those circumstances it is hard to credit, without some fairly solid and convincing evidence, that he would not have known of the expression of interest by that company in taking over some or all of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>The matter is even more complicated because, as I have said, the Taoiseach appears to be involved, in that it has been reported that on 16 February the Taoiseach interviewed Deputy Lawlor and it was after that interview that Deputy Lawlor resigned.  There is a clear link between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the whole affair in that it appears that part of the reason for the expression of interest by this company arose from the mishandling by the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the whole question relating to the position of the Thurles sugar factory.  Indeed there is the overall question of the direction that is being taken by the food industry in this country and action that can be taken to reinforce that industry and put it in a position where it can be a valid player on European and world markets in 1992, which is, I know, part of the concern underlying the debate that is going on at present.</P>
    <P>All of those points need to be teased out and the House is entitled to have information on them.  The only way in which we can apparently get information about this is by having a debate on what is otherwise an innocuous and fairly routine report from the Committee of Selection. <Col N="925" /> Had the Taoiseach been agreeable to answering the questions that I put down to him we possibly need not have had this debate although it is probably a better way of getting information than the process of following up with supplementary questions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to know why the Taoiseach decided to plead no responsibility when he is so directly involved.  Does the Taoiseach believe there is something here that should not be revealed and, if so, what is it?  On the contrary, does he take the view that there is nothing to be revealed, that there is nothing untoward, and if that is the case why did he apparently advise Deputy Lawlor to resign?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is a rather serious one.  In trying to summarise it one should start by drawing attention to remarks made, and not denied, by Deputy Lawlor last week.  Deputy Lawlor, in an interview with a member of the staff of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 February, said he had never seen a document from the Sugar Company and did not know of its existence.  The following day <i>The Irish Times,</i> after apparently questioning him further as a result of inquiries they had made, stated that he had told <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday night that he had never seen a document from the Irish Sugar Company and did not know of its existence.  The previous day, however, he agreed that he had known of the existence of the document but he insisted that he did not see it and had not been aware of its contents.  In correspondence, which has been published, from the chairman of the Irish Sugar Company to Deputy Lawlor in his capacity as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, he said: &ldquo;The company will be forwarding today or tomorrow to the clerk of your committee a report&rdquo;.  He said the nature of it was very sensitive and that Deputy Lawlor would have to satisfy himself as to whether or not it should be circulated to the members of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the events that happened it was not circulated to the members of the committee. No doubt the clerk ascertained <Col N="926" /> the advice of the chairman on this matter because he would have been aware that the chairman of the Sugar Company had written to Deputy Lawlor.  Deputy Lawlor therefore, in considering what instruction he should give to the clerk of the committee, would have had to take account of the contents of the report that was sent to him by the Sugar Company. Therefore, in spite of what he told <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday last, Deputy Lawlor firstly knew that such a report existed and, secondly, it seems he knew the contents of it because he could not have acted as he subsequently did unless he knew the contents.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter and one that has serious consequences not just for Deputy Lawlor personally if this is the position, as it appears to be, but for the committee concerned, for the House and also for the semi-State body which is involved.  The reason, as is well known, that the chairman of the Sugar Company was apprehensive about the matter was that he was aware it was a matter of public record that Deputy Lawlor was also a director of a company called Food Industries plc which had an interest apparently in the possibility of the acquisition of the Sugar Company or part of it or, more specifically, part of the Sugar Company's beet quota which was, it seems, of special interest to them.  How many members of the Government knew in November of the existence of the interest of Food Industries plc is not clear but the suggestion has been made that at least one senior member of the Government was alerted to that interest.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday of last week Deputy Lawlor is quoted in the newspapers as saying that no conflict of interest arose and therefore he had no intention of resigning as chairman of the committee. On Thursday, following a very brief visit to the Taoiseach's office, he announced his intention to resign.  In the circumstances and since apparently the indication of his total change of mind on this matter followed immediately on his visit to the Taoiseach, the House and the country are entitled to the Taoiseach's <Col N="927" /> observations on the matter and what view he formed in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been silent in respect of this whole matter since it started.  An end should be put to that silence and this debate here today is an ideal opportunity for him to put his views on the matter on the record of this House and to make them available to the country generally.  It is, of course, perfectly legitimate for Deputy Lawlor, as a Member of this House, to be a director of a company like Food Industries plc.  I do not think anybody objects to that but it is questionable whether he should be a director of a company like that and at the same time either hold office as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies or, in particular, hold the chairmanship of that body.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that for some time apparently Food Industries plc, which is the holding company of a number of other companies involved in different aspects of agri business here, have had an interest in the Sugar Company. They have apparently corresponded with them and have had meetings with them.  On the face of it, it seems that there was a considerable conflict of interest or, at the very least, a potential conflict of interest.  Because of the circumstances the onus is very much on Deputy Lawlor to prove to this House and the public generally that that in fact did not arise.  He needs to give a detailed explanation of that.  The explanations he has given up to now in newspapers, and which have been contradicted by himself in some cases the day afterwards, have by any standards certainly not been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is a well known fact, and I saw this adverted to in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday written by Mr. Jim Dunne, their senior finance editor, that Food Industries plc and its subsidiary companies are beginning to play a very dominant role in Irish agriculture and in Irish agri business.  The argument made in that article &mdash; and it is one with which I find myself in agreement &mdash; is that <Col N="928" /> because of the dominance of the role of that public company, its subsidiaries and associated companies, there is an obligation on them to be less secretive about their affairs than has been the case up to now.  The obligation to be less secretive is particularly apposite in this instance where a Member of this House and the chairman of the only committee here who deal directly and solely with commercial State-sponsored bodies is such chairman and at the same time a director of the main board of Food Industries plc.</P>
    <P>A great many questions have been raised on this whole matter and they have not been answered.  There is a duty on Deputy Lawlor to answer the obvious questions that have arisen and which have been asked throughout the country over the past week.  However, there is a duty on more than just Deputy Lawlor, there is a duty on the Taoiseach and on the Minister for Agriculture and Food because his role in regard to the Sugar Company and their plans over the last few months is something that has not been clarified either.  That requires clarification. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, in particular, was first alerted to the possibility of a conflict of interest in this matter as far back as 26 November last when a question was put down to him by Deputy Pat O'Malley calling the Minister's attention to Deputy Lawlor's directorship of Food Industries plc and his chairmanship of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, asking for his views on any possible difficulties that might arise in relation to that and if he had any discussions with anybody arising out of that matter.  Therefore, the Government have been on notice since the date on which that question was put down which, presumably, would have been four or five days before the date on which the question was answered here.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to go back to see what was done in respect of matters of this kind in the past when there were involved major unresolved questions of fact regarding the credibility of Members of this House.  I have found that usually <Col N="929" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or, in one instance, the Committee of Public Accounts sought to set up an appropriate inquiry.  In some instances the matters were thought serious enough to have a High Court judge involved in conducting the inquiry.  In one instance which, on the face of it, seemed a great deal less important than this particular matter, no fewer than three High Court judges were commissioned by the Government of the day and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to hold an investigation into the matter concerned. It seems that some form of formal investigation should now be undertaken to look at all aspects of this matter and that the investigation should not be confined solely to what may now, for all I know, be in progress, a system of questioning of Deputy Lawlor by some of his former colleagues on the particular committee.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, should make clear to us, what form of inquiry it is proposed to hold and if it will be a judicial inquiry in some fashion because it seems that it will be necessary to take evidence on oath in this matter due to the conflict of evidence that has so far come to light.  It is in everybody's interest that the concerns which are widely felt throughout the country in relation to this matter would be resolved as quickly as possible and, therefore, that the arrangements for the holding of a sworn inquiry into it would be announced in the course of this debate either by the Ceann Comhairle or by somebody on behalf of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is perhaps the first occasion on which I can concur with all Deputies on the Opposition on the virtues, so to speak, of a minority Government because without that virtue today we would not be conducting this comment on the report of the Committee of Selection.  The first and essential point to be made in relation to this matter is that it would not have come to the attention of any Deputy in the House had it not <Col N="930" /> been for a question raised by Deputy Liam Kavanagh at a meeting of the committee. He has assured me that his suspicions came when an IFA spokesperson at the meeting indicated surprise that the committee were not aware of certain fundamental information relating to the Sugar Company.  To his amazement it was only then, when he asked specifically about this information, that the document was produced.  That was in February and that is extraordinary.  We owe Deputy Kavanagh, who is a very quiet but effective operator, a particular debt of gratitude for the work he has done on this matter.</P>
      <P>The second and fundamental point to be made before this House is, that contrary to the assertion by Deputy Lawlor, this document, supplied by the Sugar Company in confidence and clearly headed to be a document of the strictest of confidence, is not an <i>ad hoc</i> series of replies to an <i>ad hoc</i> series of questions by the committee.  It is now common knowledge that the document is a composite analysis of the totality of the operations of the Irish Sugar Company and their subsidiaries from 1988-89 right through, year by year, to 1992-93.  That is the essential point.  This document contains the sugar company's profit projections for every year &mdash; an analysis of stock and cash flow, borrowings, debtors and creditors, the values of subsidiaries and interest on borrowings.  As we now understand, this document is a composite overview based on two options &mdash; Thurles in or Thurles out, and the profit available to the company in 1992-93.  The document, presumably prepared internally in the Irish Sugar Company, is of inestimable value to any competitor, and more particularly to any inside or outside trader, parliamentary or otherwise. Without it, it is difficult to see how one could have a view of the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual that such documents are given to the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I served on the committee for a number of years and on many occasions we received such documents, but they were always treated in <Col N="931" /> an appropriate manner.  I have not the slightest doubt about the integrity of Mr. Chris O'Brien, the secretary of this committee, prior to his retirement under the now extinct voluntary retirement scheme.  We must put on record that his retirement has absolutely nothing to do with the work of the committee.  The committee chairman was alerted by the chairman of the Irish Sugar Company on 19 or 20 November 1988 &mdash; I only got a fleeting glance of the letter on television &mdash; about the unique sensitivity of the composite document available to him sent to the secretary of the committee for the information of the committee, by a Mr. Martin under separate cover.</P>
    <P>If it had been merely a series of generalised replies to questions raised by the committee to the Irish Sugar Company, one could see some point in the observations of Deputy Lawlor.  But the situation is otherwise and a fundamental problem arises.  The company in question, Food Industries, and Mr. Laurence Goodman have expressed a direct interest in taking over all or part of the sugar company.  I understand that Mr. Goodman and his colleagues have been in Leinster House meeting the leaders of the various parties conveying his interest in this matter.  Arising from this, and long before this issue arose, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, wrote to the Taoiseach expressing grave concern about the prospects of privatisation of the Sugar Company.  At that time, Deputy Spring knew nothing of this matter. Indeed, I knew nothing of it and I assume the Taoiseach knew nothing of it either. There was the extraordinary coincidence of events and dates and but for the fortuitous question by Deputy Kavanagh at a committee meeting, it would not have come to light that a non-executive director of that company &mdash; namely, Deputy Liam Lawlor who was the then chairman of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; was involved in the affair, at whatever level we are not quite sure yet, but presumably it will come out.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I find that the criticisms and questions raised by us are legitimate. <Col N="932" /> It is not a question of personalising or disputing the integrity of individual Deputies; it is a function of this House that we must have answers to questions of this nature.  I want to emphasise that we should have a Standing Order similar to that in the House of Commons which would apply to that committee in particular &mdash; it could equally apply to the Joint Committee on EC Secondary Legislation, and God only knows the kind of sensitive data we will receive between now and 1992 in relation to tax harmonisation from the Department of Finance, the Community or in representations that will be made by individual companies.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the House of Commons has a Standing Order in relation to committees of the House of Commons. The clerk of the committee on receiving a document is obliged to immediately transmit that document to each member of the committee and if I recall the Standing Order correctly, the words used are &ldquo;unaltered in any way.&rdquo; They cannot be edited and all the documents must be sent to each Member.  We do not have a Standing Order that requires the clerk, of an Oireachtas committee to send documents immediately to each Member of that committee.  In our framework, the clerk of the committee operates at the behest of the chairman or at the behest of a formal committee meeting where he would receive a direction.</P>
    <P>We had the extraordinary situation today where the clerk of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies tried earlier this afternoon &mdash; I presume at the request of the Government Whip &mdash; to cancel this meeting and to postpone it until next week, for some reason or another.</P>

      <P>All I know is that the Labour Whip came to me at 3.20 p.m. and told me so, but Deputy Kavanagh said no.  He said that the meeting had been called for 4 p.m. and the meeting was going ahead.  He also said it had been agreed at the last meeting that he was to <Col N="933" /> be in the Chair for the next meeting.  As the House knows, constitutionally he is acting on behalf of the Dáil, as the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would act in this House, and I presume he is conducting the business of the committee now.  There appears, and I am sorry to have to say this, to be some concerted effort to have Deputy Kavanagh removed from the Chair but I do not think he can be removed under the Standing Orders of this House because at the last meeting he was appointed to preside over this meeting today and in due course a Motion will be put down, four days' notice will be given and the appointment of a chairman will take place at the next meeting.</P>
      <P>Finally, should it come to this, we need to have a tribunal established.  Deputies have no great love of tribunal proceedings but if one cannot get to the bottom of the matter, a formal tribunal under the Tribunals Act should be established because, as we well know, the Joint Committee can meet, anybody can refuse to appear before it in effect but if a tribunal were to meet to hear evidence, it could compel the interested parties to give evidence, and the whole truth and nothing but the truth would be known. Therefore, on behalf of my party leader in particular who was removed from the House last week for raising this matter, I hope all this material will come out at the meeting of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 20 years I have been asking for a declaration of interests by members and only after considerable pressure on the local authorities and when I was chairman of Dublin County Council did we bring it in.  There is a sort of declaration now in some local authorities whereby property interests are recorded but in this House it should be a fundamental Standing Order of the House that when we come in we declare all our interests, our membership of particular organisations, our financial dealings with organisations and so on.  It is not enough for a Deputy to simply come into the House and say that he is a non-executive director of company X.  It is in the <Col N="934" /> interests of our integrity that there should be a statutory requirement for declaration of interests.  That would meet many of the problems and many of the issues that will inevitably arise in the future work of this committee.  Accordingly, the Taoiseach should explain to us what exactly Deputy Lawlor has been up to in terms of his resignation from the committee and his resignation as chairman of the committee.  That information is essential to this House if we are to get to the bottom of this matter.</P>

It is quite interesting that despite the public concern about an issue that had been aired in the newspapers and in the media it has been found almost impossible to raise it here in the House up to this point, that one Deputy was expelled from the House last week in an attempt to raise the matter, that various questions were ruled out of order on the matter and that it is only by the combined strength of the Opposition Deputies in the House that it has been possible to have any airing of the issue on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of trying Deputy Lawlor on the floor of this House.  It is not the function of this Dáil to attempt to do that, so I will not talk about the various reports of what he said or did not say and of what he did or did not do.  I put down a motion to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges asking for an inquiry to be instigated into the issue.  I have asked the committee to look as a matter of urgency at the question of a register of commercial interests.  Perhaps Deputy Lawlor inadvertently stumbled into this mess, although I honestly find it difficult to accept that, given the acknowledged competence of Deputy Lawlor in business matters.  Nonetheless, the House should agree that some form of inquiry should be instituted as it is clear that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to be answered.  The committee should at least agree to set in train an inquiry into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The more important issue which may be lost sight of because of the specifics of the case surrounding Deputy Lawlor is the question of a register of commercial interests by Deputies.  There is not any suggestion that Deputies as a rule will attempt to abuse their position but it is essential that the Deputies be above suspicion, that the public at large can have confidence that the work of this Dáil is carried out fairly and above board.  That can only be done seriously if the electorate generally understand that when an issue comes up which may have a bearing on the commercial interests of a Deputy, the Deputy's interest is on record and that whatever may be said by the Deputy can then be judged in the light of the public knowledge of the Deputy's interest.</P>
    <P>It is not a good idea that Deputy Lawlor should be tried on the floor of this House.  I would urge, therefore, that in order to allay public concern and the concern of Deputies, that the motion which I have tabled to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be agreed to and that an early meeting of that committee should be called to deal with it.  Another Deputy said, and I agree, that the matter cannot be fully resolved by the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I do not know the full membership of that committee but it would be in everybody's interests if at this point they declared whatever commercial interests they may have in relation to outside businesses.</P>
    <P>It is important to re-establish the credibility of Deputies generally by pursuing as quickly as possible the issue of a mandatory register of interests.  Before I sit down, I refer back to a question I put to the Minister for Finance on 31 January when the Minister quite bluntly said he had no intention of introducing such a register.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the position and to move quickly on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House overlong, but a few points remain to be made prior to what I understand will be a reply by the Taoiseach.  It has <Col N="936" /> been suggested in the press, and repeated by a number of people who should know better, that some Members of this House were actuated by constituency jealousy or malice in the manner in which they conducted themsleves in relation to this matter.  It is as well to put on the record how untrue that is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pat O'Malley who is by coincidence a member of the same committee came into the possession of information, which was not difficult to come into possession of, it is fair to say, prior to 21 November 1988, to the effect that there was an intention on the part of Food Industries plc at least to investigate, and certainly to pursue with some degree of enthusiasm, the possibility of an acquisition of all or part of the assets including the sugar quota of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  That information came into his possession and at that time the record shows the committee in question were investigating the circumstances of that company, its viability, its future plans. In that context they had already made demands to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to explain to the committee the problems they were facing, their intentions in relation to how these problems might be resolved and to indicate what future plans they had for the disposal of some or all of the assets and the closure of some or all of their facilities.  These issues were raised and it was in reply to them that the document, the subject matter of this discussion to some extent, came into being.  They were raised at a meeting with the Sugar Company at Thurles, I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley did not seek to sensationalise the matter, to make any cheap points arising from the matter, draw the attention of the media to the issue or to make any points which could have embarrassed Deputy Lawlor on a constituency basis.  The Deputy's behaviour has been exemplary and has been a model for all people in this House.  He put down a Written Question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food which did not, because of the rules of this House, refer specifically to Deputy Lawlor but to a person in respect of whom details had <Col N="937" /> been supplied and asked the Minister if he was aware of the potential conflict of interest.  The Minister replied to that written question on 26 November 1988. It is of some significance that at that juncture a member of the Government was aware that Deputy O'Malley was worried about a potential conflict of interest and that he had time to consider the issue and, I suggest, bring it to the attention of the Taoiseach if he saw any conflict in the matter.  We do not know what happened at Cabinet level.  We do not know what the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, sought to do with the situation which had been brought to his attention by Deputy O'Malley, but that there was a conflict of interest there can be no doubt and that Deputy O'Malley had in the gentlest possible way brought it to the attention of a Minister who has responsibility for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is also very clear.  The Minister who is a member of a Cabinet with collective responsibility was at that time put in possession of enough information and, I suggest, motivation to raise the issue with Deputy Lawlor and bring to his attention the anomalous position in which he then was.  That happened in November 1988.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor has not contributed to this debate thus far &mdash; and perhaps he is elucidating his version of events elsewhere, or perhaps he wants to reserve his position &mdash; but he has, as Deputy O'Malley, the leader of my party, pointed out, put on record some at least vestigial account of his involvement in this matter.  One thing I think deserves special regard by Members of this House when they are viewing this matter and its significance is his statement that the question of the Sugar Company or the acquisition of any part of that company was never considered at any board meeting of Food Industries plc.  That is a matter within the exclusively private knowledge of that board but if it is the case &mdash; I suggest it must be the case and is true &mdash; that the company were at some level actively investigating that possibility and if it was not discussed at the board <Col N="938" /> meeting, then it was discussed somewhere else.  The well measured truth which tells the darker untruth would be served in this matter by saying that it was never discussed at a board meeting.  It must have been discussed at some level if it existed at all as a project in the minds of the directors.  The information this House is entitled to get, when a disingenuous bland statement of that kind is made in public that it was never discussed at the board of Food Industries plc, is where it was discussed, who was actively pursuing it and if Deputy Lawlor was party to those discussions.  Those are the issues which have to be resolved, and a half smokescreen to the effect that it was not discussed at a board meeting does not suffice in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the matter was discussed at any level outside the board, inside the board, by a sub-committee of the directors of that company or the executives of that company, then it must be the case that what the company would clearly want to know in relation to the affairs of the Sugar Company were their plans, the problems they had encountered, their dealings with the IFA, their intentions in relation to their sugar quota and the difficulties they were experiencing in relation to their capitalisation, profitability and maintenance of their various plants.  Those were very significant issues which arose in the context of any attempt to pursue the issue of acquiring any part of that company or indulging in a joint venture with them.</P>
    <P>It follows from that that sensitive information which would be of assistance to that board would by any standards be something which the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann would be most keen to keep secret from a potential rival in the food industry and a potential negotiating party in terms of first, any joint venture, or, second, any acquisition of their assets. It is an inescapable and logical conclusion from the fact that Food Industries plc were pursuing actively the question of a joint venture or an acquisition of part or all of the Irish Sugar Company that a conflict of interest of fairly substantial <Col N="939" /> proportions would arise between a director on their board and if that person also came into confidential information in relation to the policies and problems being encountered by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  There is no escaping that conflict of interest and there is no point in saying in public through the media or to this House here today that there was not a conflict of interest: there was a clear and unambiguous conflict of interest.  The attitude of the Sugar Company in particular in relation to the letters they sent when they enclosed that information to the clerk of the committee in question clearly underlined that they regarded the information as sensitive and, therefore, asked for it to be treated in confidence. If one gives information in confidence to a member of a board of directors of a company which might mount a hostile take-over of your company, might seek to purchase some of your assets, would know your negotiating position and bargaining position and the strength of it in relation to any negotiations, a conflict of interest would necessarily arise and there is no point in sweeping under the carpet the conflict of interest which did actually arise.</P>
    <P>As I have said that conflict of interest was apparent to anyone from the outside who viewed that situation and if it was sufficiently apparent to Deputy Pat O'Malley to encourage him to write to the Minister and draw it to his attention it must have been equally apparent to the Minister when he contemplated Deputy O'Malley's question that the conflict of interest was a real one and, I suggest, it must have also been apparent to Deputy Lawlor that he was in a position of major conflict of interest.  I should stress that this House and the committee of which Deputy Lawlor was until today a member are not in any sense empowered to try Deputy Lawlor or adjudicate on his moral qualities or whatever and it would be very wrong for us to attempt to do that but he has described himself as a &ldquo;non-executive director&rdquo; of that company and I can only echo what Deputy Dukes said in relation to that adjective <Col N="940" /> which he applied to himself by saying that there is a huge question mark as to what that meant.  As I understand it, Deputy Lawlor devotes a substantial amount of his time to furthering the interests of that company and he put a considerable amount of time and effort, on what basis of remuneration we do now know, into the Bailieboro acquisition and made efforts which no non-executive director would normally make on behalf of a public limited company in these circumstances. To suggest that he was simply a non-executive director, an honorary member of the board, is simply deceiving us again; he was not that and it is wrong to suggest that he was.</P>
    <P>The letters which were sent to Deputy Lawlor on 17 September 1988 and to the clerk, Mr. O'Brien, on 18 November 1988 deserve some close scrutiny because the letter to Deputy Lawlor indicates that the items covered included an update of the effect on the group, that is, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, of continued production in Thurles; historic capital investment in individual factories; numbers, age and structure of the Thurles workforce and negotiations with the IFA. The letter went on to say that, as had been the practice, the company were willing to co-operate with the committee and supply fully the information they required but on that occasion, however, they had to be mindful of the sensitivity of the Thurles issue and they were concerned that the information being forwarded might mistakingly be perceived and used to political advantage.  It also said that the information forwarded on the Thurles update was put before the company's board meeting on 17 November and the consideration of the document by the board should not be misinterpreted.  The only decision by the board relating to Thurles was taken in November 1987.  That letter showed clearly that the board had devoted some considerable time to deciding what kind of response they were to make to the committee's inquiries made at Thurles prior to the date of that letter.</P>
    <P>I am informed, and believe, that at a meeting of the board of directors of <Col N="941" /> Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann prior to 18 November the advisability of releasing the document to the committee of the Oireachtas was discussed at some considerable length and that reservations were expressed by board members &mdash; some of whom are the Minister for Agriculture and Food's nominees, it must be remembered &mdash; regarding a potential threat to confidentiality that might arise if the document were forwarded to the committee.  I am also informed, and the matter has been raised by Deputy O'Malley yet again in a disallowed private notice question today, that Deputy Lawlor's role was discussed at that meeting, that members of the Sugar Company board stated their awareness at that meeting of an interest on the part of Food Industries plc in acquiring some or all of the assets of the Irish Sugar Company, and that the matter was finally put to a vote of the board of directors as to whether the particular material should be released to the committee, of which Deputy Lawlor was chairman.</P>
    <P>If it is correct, that again shows that in the minds of the members of the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, some of whom are ministerial appointees, the conflict of interests to which Deputy O'Malley had pointed in his question to the Minister was alive issue and clear enough to people closely involved at that time.  The question then arises in those circumstances as to why it was not apparent to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and, if it was apparent to him, why he did not consult the Taoiseach and, in those circumstances, why the Taoiseach did not immediately warn off Deputy Lawlor and tell him that he was, in effect, riding two horses in different directions, that he should decide to stick with one or other but make his position very clear very quickly and put himself, if that were possible at the time, beyond reproach.</P>
    <P>The statements made by Deputy Lawlor to the press seem to have suffered from a degree of variability.  That point has been made before and I shall not now dwell on it, except to say that if the matter was put before Deputy Lawlor by the clerk of the committee, as the Chairman <Col N="942" /> of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann requested him to do, as to how the document should be treated, it defies belief that he could make a decision as to how the document should be treated without acquainting himself of its contents.  It would be most wrong of him to suggest that nothing should be done about it for three months without acquainting himself in some shape or form as to what was contained in the document.  It would be equally wrong of him to arrive at a view as to whether it should be circulated unless he knew substantially what was contained in that document.  The important matter is that when the Chairman of the Sugar Company wrote to Mr. O'Brien on 18 November he specifically said:</P>
    <P>Please note that our Chairman has written to Deputy Lawlor, Chairman of your Committee, about the information contained in this update.  You should contact your Chairman about this, prior to any circulation of the enclosed document.</P>
    <P>Unless we are to believe that no such contact was made for some reason, it follows that contact was made and that instructions were obtained from the chairman of that committee as to how that letter should be treated.  It follows again from that, that unless Deputy Lawlor made a decision as to how the document should be treated in complete ignorance of its contents and nature, we must put a question mark over his statement to the public that he was totally unaware of the contents of the document. It follows, as night follows day, that he either made a decision blindfolded as to what was the appropriate way to deal with a document, the contents of which he was unaware of, or alternativley, that he has again been incorrect, or that his memory had deceived him, to put the most favourable complexion on it, as to what his state of knowledge was in relation to that document.</P>
    <P>All this arises out of, and the debate is centred on, a report from the Committee of Selection and there is no motion before this House now in relation to this set of circumstances.  Therefore, this debate is <Col N="943" /> bound, as were many other debates in this House, to be inconclusive.  The first lesson that we can learn is that this House should debate matters which are of relevance to it and of importance nationally and should not conduct itself on the basis that every newspaper and every barstool is a location of discussion on issues but this House is silent on matters of substantial public importance.</P>
    <P>Secondly, also of significance, is that in the nature of things the State is engaged in a major reassessment of its portfolio investments in the semi-State area.  It is of the utmost importance that if the State is to deal with those semi-State bodies fairly and properly and secure their co-operation, high standards should apply in relation to the manner in which the State, through the Oireachtas, conducts itself.  When the board of directors of a semi-State company, some of whom are ministerial appointees, find themselves having to vote on the question of whether they disclose information to a committee of this House and find themselves discussing the actual composition and potential conflict of interests of members of that committee as an issue in whether they should co-operate fully with a committee of this House, it is a sad day.  It undermines the authority of the House in particular and the whole process of reasonable relations between the Parliament of this country and the semi-State industrial sector.</P>
    <P>More than that, people have called in public for the establishment of a register of interests.  With the greatest of respect to these, as to whether that is a good idea &mdash; and I believe it to be a good idea &mdash; it is completely irrelevant to what is happening in this circumstance.  Nobody had any doubt as to the interests Deputy Lawlor had.  It was a matter of public record and wide notoriety in this House that he held the particular directorship which brought about this conflict of interests.  Absence of a register of interests was not relevant to the circumstances. There is a wider issue, one which must be addressed in a way which is much more complex than putting down <Col N="944" /> a register of interests of Members of this House.  It was a wider issue of a duty, expressed or implied, to divulge a conflict of interests and, most particularly, to refrain from involvement in an area where that conflict of interests was bound to have an effect.  I say expressed or implied because there does not seem to be in this House an expressed code of conduct in these matters.  There is, I think, an implied code of conduct which can be followed in this regard by any Deputy at his or her peril.  That is unacceptable. There should be clear guidelines. In this case any Deputy who was in doubt as to a potential conflict of interests could have had reference to such a clear set of guidelines and would immediately have been aware that the doubts raised by Deputy O'Malley in this question and those raised by the Sugar Company directors in their deliberations as to how they should deal with that committee gave rise to a conflict of interests which demanded immediate disengagement by Deputy Lawlor, not disengagement three months later when the matter came tumbling out in a slightly accidental fashion.  It is not a question of a register of interests, desirable though that may be.  It goes much deeper than that.  There is an enforceable rule in this House and one which every semi-State body and every member of the public knows operates in this House, that one can deal with an institution of State without any reservations that one's dealings are tainted by a conflict of interests on the part of those with whom you are dealing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach doubtless, in his reply to this debate, will deal with the last issue which ought to be addressed, which is, that once the question put down by Deputy O'Malley came to the attention of the Minister, it was the Minister's duty to tell the Taoiseach that a member of the Opposition had put to him a potential conflict of interests and that the Minister would like the Taoiseach's advice as to how he should deal with that matter. The Minister for Agriculture and Food should have informed the Taoiseach of the potential conflict of interests and if he did not, this House is due an explanation from <Col N="945" /> him and from the Taoiseach as to why that was not done.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did become aware at a later time of the issues around which this debate centres.  It seems that Deputy Lawlor initially took the view that no conflict of interest had arisen and that the matter was maliciously generated, although the record shows clearly it was not.  He believed that in the circumstances his membership of the committee was not affected and that his continued chairmanship of it did not come into question.  When the Taoiseach was acquainted with the circumstances, did he send for Deputy Lawlor, put to him the conflict of interest and ask for his explanation, or was it merely a matter of Deputy Lawlor's seeking the paternal advice of the Taoiseach as to what he should do next?  Before his chat with the Taoiseach Deputy Lawlor was undoubtedly of one mind and saw the matter completely in one light, but after it he saw it in a different light.  The House is entitled to know whether Deputy Lawlor sought the advice of the Taoiseach or the Taoiseach summoned Deputy Lawlor to give him a strict instruction to resign his chairmanship and membership of that committee.</P>
    <P>The company in question is a very substantial one, whose economic power is very great indeed.  It is a company which has a dominant role in one of our dominant businesses.  It has grown dramatically in power and influence and other bodies, including RTE, have seen the speed with which it can react to any questioning of the propriety of its activities. It is a powerful company, staffed and directed by powerful men.  They are influential people and it is no secret in this House that they seek to use their influence in the interests of the company in a rigorous and robust manner.  In those circumstances in particular, it is of the utmost importance that a clear dividing line be writ large between those who exercise on the part of the people a function in relation to the examination, supervision and control of the semi-State sector and those who serve the private <Col N="946" /> capital interests of the company in question.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to Members of this House having directorships of a company or private interests but it is of the greatest importance when those interests come into conflict with public duties as Members of this House, members of the Government or members of committees of this House, that the public have absolute confidence that a strict code of conduct will automatically come into play and that somebody who finds himself in a position of ambiguity will immediately seek advice from a capable adviser and receive appropriate advice in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to note the conflict of interest pointed our privately and in a gentlemanly fashion by Deputy O'Malley last November raises serious questions in the mind of every observer as to whether it was thought then, as it was thought prior to this debate, that the matter could simply be swept under the carpet.  The Government tried to avoid a debate on this issue.  Although the majority of Members of the House wanted to debate the issue, the Government said there would be no debate.  Why was that attitude taken in regard to a matter of public importance, which it undoubtedly was since it ended with the resignation of the chairman of one of the committees of the House?  Why was an attempt made effectively to stifle debate on the matter? This is a piece of a greater pattern.  I do not want to elaborate now because it would be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>The attitude shown by the Government in relation to the power and duty of this House is echoing the attitude shown by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Burke, as to the comparative legislative roles of the Government and the House.  This House is one of the great institutions of State. It is not here to be trampled down by the executive of the day.  It is entitled to debate issues which it wants to debate and not to have its desires thwarted by Standing Orders, however conscientiously they are carried out by the <Col N="947" /> Chair &mdash; as I accept that they are &mdash; or by the will of a minority who happen to support the Government of the day.  The House has a wider interest and the public has a greater interest in securing adherence to proper standards of behaviour.</P>
    <P>If this debate had not occurred this afternoon, this House would have failed yet again in its duty to vindicate its own standards, membership and procedures. It would have done so yet again at the behest of a Government who seem to value those things in a very small measure. The manner in which this debate was treated by the Government, the manner in which they attempted to prevent it, the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, failed to take the very gentlemanly hint by Deputy O'Malley that there was something awry and failed to secure proper action by the Taoiseach over a period of months &mdash; all these things are part of a piece and show low standards in high places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the entire House awaits with interest the Taoiseach's response, I should like to put a very succinct question now that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has joined us. Regarding Deputy Pat O'Malley's parliamentary question on 26 November last, what discussions did the Minister for Agriculture and Food have with the Taoiseach and Deputy Lawlor regarding a possible conflict of interests before he answered that parliamentary question?  I suggest that both the Minister and the Taoiseach are culpable if the Minister did discuss the issue with the Taoiseach and no action was taken to resolve the matter and prevent a possible conflict of interests arising.  If the Minister discussed it with the Taoiseach, action should have been taken.  Since it was not, both must stand culpable.  If the Minister did not discuss the matter with the Taoiseach, I accuse the Minister for Agriculture and Food of a gross dereliction of duty.  He cannot have it both ways.  Perhaps there is more than one issue of conflict of interests involved as the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, appears not to know whether he is <Col N="948" /> coming or going in relation to the entire issue of Thurles, which is, of course, in his own constituency.  I await with interest, as do all Members, the response of the Taoiseach on this very important issue.</P>

      <P>I want first to mention the report with which we are dealing.  It is a report from a Committee of Selection. This is a time-honoured device for dealing with appointments to committees on the basis of agreement and procedures. As far as we can ascertain, the last time a report of this kind was debated was in 1935 and there has been a fairly powerful corpus of precedent built up in regard to the Committee of Selection.  As far as I and the Government are concerned, we were simply dealing with a routine procedural matter of a person resigning from a committee and the normal mechanism being availed of to appoint somebody else in his place.  There was nothing more than that involved.</P>

      <P>The majority in the House have decided that the report should be debated and so be it.  I just register that point.  It is a breach of the time-honoured tradition of dealing with these matters on an agreed basis between parties.  I regret that it happened but presumably the House will, in due course, recover from it and no great damage will have been done.  I want to make the position of the Government party clear.  We were nominating a replacement on this committee and that is why we brought the report before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points have been raised by different Deputies but I will not deal with them all because it is not appropriate for me &mdash; although some Deputies have done so while others have not &mdash; to go into the merits of this matter.  I want to suggest how they should be dealt with. I think it was a Progressive Democrats <Col N="949" /> Deputy who talked about secrecy in this matter and the House not being permitted to debate the activities &mdash; or non-activities &mdash; of Deputy Lawlor.  I recall in the last Dáil that a junior Minister of the Fine Gael Party was removed from office by the then Taoiseach and we never got an opportunity in this House to debate the matter.  We were in Opposition and we sought to have the matter raised here but we were prevented by the rules of the House from doing so.</P>

      <P>We accepted the ruling and the matter never came before the House.  Let us try to keep a sense of proportion and balance about these matters. There is a booklet of rulings of the Chair which all Deputies have &mdash; or at least to which they should have access &mdash; which specifically states that Members must not allege that another Member is guilty of a criminal or unlawful act or reflect on his character or personal honour.  That would very much circumscribe this House in dealing with matters of this kind.  Therefore, it is well established that a matter of this kind cannot effectively be satisfactorily dealt with on the Floor of this House as we are not in a position here to have papers brought before us to be examined in detail, witnesses examined and so on.  A discussion of this sort is a totally inappropriate way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say that the matter should not be raised in this House and I want to make two statements of fact.  I was not aware of any suggestion &mdash; and the Chief Whip assures me the same is true in his case &mdash; of any postponement of the committee this evening.  It is not my business nor that of the Chief Whip to seek a postponement this evening of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  Nor indeed &mdash; and this may not be so clear &mdash; was I approached by any of the Leaders of the other parties to have a debate on this matter in the House.  Leaders of parties <Col N="950" /> have many ways of seeking to have matters raised on the Floor of this House and I assure the House and the public that, so far as I was concerned, there was no suggestion put to me for a debate on this matter on the Floor of the House.

      <P>I did not interrupt any Member.  There was a reference to a question put down by Deputy Pat O'Malley to the Minister for Agriculture and Food last November.  It has been suggested that Deputy Pat O'Malley indicated to the Minister for Agriculture and Food at that time that there was a danger of a conflict of interests.  I do not think that can in any way be read into what happened.  I have the text of the question here, it was a written one and, therefore, not followed up by supplementaries.</P>
      <P>In the question Deputy P. O'Malley asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he had any discussions or negotiations with representatives of a company (details supplied) regarding a possible takeover by that company of one of the three Siúicre Éireann sugar processing plants on condition that part of the Irish sugar quota would be made available to that company and if he would make a statement on the matter.  That is a very straight forward, specific question and the reply of the Minister for Agriculture and Food was that he had had no such discussions or negotiations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will mention another aspect of this matter because of the suggestion that <Col N="952" /> there is a cloak of secrecy about all this. Deputy Desmond mentioned it, he is absolutely right because my information is that one of the companies in question, Food Industries, at &mdash; I am not sure what level, probably the highest &mdash; took it on themselves to hold discussions with parties in this House about this very matter, that they were received by a very strong delegation of the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party.  I cannot say whether they were received by the Progressive Democrats, but I assume that they were.  The Progressive Democrats can confirm whether they were or not.

      <P>It is my view, and I think it is the view of every sensible Member of this House that the right way to proceed is for that committee to go about this matter and to investigate it fully and in complete detail.  We will all give the committee whatever assistance they need.  If they find that their terms of reference, as I read them out, are not adequate for them to do this job, they can always come back to this House and we can expand those terms of reference to enable them to deal with this matter. <Col N="956" /> When that committee have gone as far with this matter as they possibly can, we would expect them to reach a satisfactory conclusion and they will report to this House.  This House can then, and I make the point that this was always our intention, debate the report of that committee because we would then have facts on which to found our debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not within the terms of reference of the committee. They cannot inquire into the conduct of their former secretary who has already retired.</P>

That report can come before this House and we can have a full debate on it.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter which Deputy De Rossa has adverted to. If it is felt by that committee, or indeed by this House, that the matter should be further investigated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that is also open to this House.  Both these committees are there to serve the purposes of this House in matters of this sort.  As far as I am concerned, that is the proper way to proceed.  We cannot conduct the sort of inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the joint committee in their investigations recommend <Col N="957" /> that a tribunal of inquiry be set up, that is something this House can then deal with.  There is no difficulty or argument about that.  I want to persuade the House to deal with this matter in an orderly procedural way.  This committee is seized of the issue and it is a matter for the committee in the first instance to deal with it, to investigate it as fully, thoroughly and completely as possible, have access to all possible information they require and if they need expanded terms of reference, we can give them. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is also available to Members or parties to bring matters before it and these two committees have, I believe, the capacity to do a complete and thorough investigation of this issue, and when they have done so their reports can be considered by this House and any further action considered necessary can be taken.  I want to assure the Deputy that now the matter has arisen in this way, it is my wish and the wish of my colleagues that the fullest possible information about it be disclosed to this House and to the general public.</P>
      <P>One other question was raised about Deputy Lawlor's resignation from the committee and my role in that matter.  I could, if I wished, say to the House that is a matter confidential between Deputy Lawlor as a member of my party and myself, but I do not propose to do that.  When I became aware of the difficulties that had arisen and of the suggestions that were being made I asked Deputy Lawlor to come to see me, which he did.  I explained to him that there was a danger that the committee would not be in a position to carry out their function in regard to this and other matters impartially, objectively, in a non-political way if he were to remain a member of the committee.  I want to assure the House that, with no hesitation whatsoever, he immediately said to me he would resign from the committee.  That was exactly the conversation that took place; that was what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt I was not in a position to decide on Deputy Lawlor's behaviour, activities <Col N="958" /> or lack of activities.  That is a matter for himself, a matter which he must explain first of all, in my view, to that committee, perhaps to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if that is considered necessary, and ultimately to this House.  That is a matter for himself.  I had not the information.  I was in no position to make any worth-while judgment about his behaviour, but I could see from the way the matter was developing that it could prevent that committee from doing their job in regard to this matter.  I put these points to him, and he immediately accepted them and indicated to me his intention to resign from the committee.</P>
    <P>I accept that the matter warrants the most thorough and and complete examination and investigation, and I suggest to the House that the right way to deal with it is to have this committee now proceed with their work in an impartial, objective, non-political way, decide exactly what happened and what the truth of the matter is, ascertain if any culpability attaches to anybody, report to this House and we can take our decision after that.</P>

      <P>If he had any sense the Minister for Agriculture and Food would keep his peace at this stage because, as the Taoiseach said, the dogs in the street know Deputy Lawlor was and is a director of that company, Food Industries plc. The dogs in the street and the Minister for Agriculture and Food should have known that fact last November.  For the information of the Taoiseach, in case he is in any doubt, the discussions to which he referred between directors of Food Industries plc and my party took place in this House on 31 January and I understand further discussions took place either on that day or on the following day.  I mention that date only because that was two days before the managing director of Food Industries plc was quoted in the public press as having confirmed that the company wished to take a majority shareholding in the Irish Sugar Company and that was two clear weeks at least before the date on which Deputy Lawlor came to the conclusion, following the Taoiseach's remarks, that he did.  I note the Taoiseach has agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I assure the Taoiseach that in so far as members of my party are concerned, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies will carry out an investigation of the kind the Taoiseach has suggested and I look forward to full co-operation from members of all other parties in this House, including the Taoiseach's party, in that investigation, and I look forward to what that committee report back to this House.  I want it to be made clear that whenever that report comes back to this House it will be fully debated.  Finally, let me say that perhaps the Taoiseach could have served his own ends better in the interests of the House had he, instead of trying to stop this debate here this afternoon, made the statement he has just made now before the matter arose in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of this debate I was endeavouring to stitch into the record of the House the importance of this industry to my constituency and, in particular, my county.  This debate affords me an opportunity to outline the way forward, as I see it, for the board given the new powers being granted them and which have been welcomed by all those involved with the board.</P>
      <P>I have some comments which the Minister might consider between now and the preparation of amendments for Committee Stage.  For example, the duties of the board were set out in the provisions of section 17 of the 1946 Act and their powers in section 20, the powers and duties taken together being described as their functions.  The view has been advanced that the provisions of section 20 are controlled by those of section 17 of the Principal Act for example, the power of the board to erect buildings and enter into contracts are limited to the core business of peat and peat products. One of the provisions of this Bill is to extend the remit of the board with regard to engineering and building works beyond that of merely peat and peat products.  This is being done by the insertion of a new section 20 (i) in the 1946 Act.  I content that, at the same time, the provisions of section 17 of the Principal Act should be extended to make it clear that the remit of the board is extended under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the drafting stages of this Bill I understand that Bord na Móna made a submission to the Department of Energy requesting an addition to section 17 of the 1946 Act in the following terms: &ldquo;to allow it to do all such other things which, in the opinion of the board, are calculated to facilitate the proper carrying on of the business of the board&rdquo;.  That wording was taken directly from section 13 of the CIE Transport Act, 1950.  I note that that <Col N="964" /> proposal is not included in the provisions of this Bill.  I should like the Minister to take another look at it and ascertain whether that would not allow the board the necessary flexibility which is the intent of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 deal with the possible establishment of sub-boards in the future.  I should like to make a few comments about those provisions as they stand.  Under the provisions of section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1946 &mdash; the Principal Act &mdash; the board have power already to delegate functions to employees.  It is to be noted that, in the case of subsidiary companies formed by CIE under the provisions of the Transport (Re-Organisation of CIE) Act, 1986 employees have been appointed directors of those sub-boards.  Therefore, it is fair to ask the question why the same facility is not being made available under the provisions of this Bill allowing for the possible appointment of employees as directors of sub-boards, as is the case with the appointment of worker-directors to the main board.  The original proposals of Bord na Móna &mdash; seeking the amendment of the 1946 Act which culminated in the publication of this Bill &mdash; proposed sub-committees rather than sub-boards. The trade union movement has been concerned that the introduction of sub-boards may facilitate not merely the division of Bord na Móna into three separate operations under the main board but that the board could be divided into three separate ones.  Given the nature and potential of the business &mdash; as they embark on their rationalisation programme &mdash; that would be a retrograde step.  It was a recommendation of the internal plan of Bord na Móna that any rationalisation should take place under the umbrella of the main board rather than have three or four separate entities at some time in the future.  Therefore, the establishment of sub-boards must be examined very carefully.  One would have thought that the delegation of functions involved could have been done adequately and effectively through present management structures.  There is the possibility that this could lead to a <Col N="965" /> costly bureaucratic exercise with a new layer of top managerial posts not warranted. While I do not expect the Minister to delete the provision we should hear from him on Committee Stage in more detail precisely what is the intention behind the proposed establishment of sub-boards and to what extent it is intended to delegate powers to them.  It must be remembered that there will be major policy decisions taken in the near future.</P>
    <P>When drafting this type of legislation in the future there should be some guidelines issued as to the amount of delegation intended.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate somewhat on this aspect either when replying to this debate or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I note also that ministerial consent is required under the provisions of section 3.  If the provisions allow for the establishment of such sub-boards, I do not understand why ministerial consent is required.  Since we are keen on giving greater flexibility and commercial impetus to the board the less ministerial control there is involved the better, with the important proviso that any major policy changes or ones which would involve financial commitment over and above an agreed figure would require not only the consent of the Minister for Energy but also the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I agree that that should be the case.  In relation to any proposed administrative changes within the board's operations I honestly do not think that ministerial consent in as planned a form as put forward in section 3 would be required.</P>
    <P>The legislation also brings about a very necessary amendment to the original Act by allowing Bord na Móna to get involved in operations outside the State, and that is to be welcomed when one considers the transition in Bord na Móna from being a production-led company to being a market-led company.  In its efforts to find new peat products with added value and export potential, it is desirable that the board should have the power to involve itself in joint ventures and commercial operations outside the State and is not <Col N="966" /> restricted to the small market within the State that has been its remit up to now.</P>
    <P>When the board engages in the core business of peat and peat products, this should not be subject to ministerial consent inside or outside the State.  In the last couple of weeks Bord na Móna acquired another company for a fairly good price, if financial reports in the papers are to be believed.  This has the potential of providing a necessary distribution network for Bord na Móna to launch their products, particularly horticultural peat moss, into the continental market.  That is an example of what can be done without the need for correspondence between Bord na Móna head office and the Department of Energy.  It was a strictly commercial operation, a management decision, which should not require this arid constraint of ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>While the power to market turf and turf products is not subject to ministerial consent, it appears that all contracts, hire purchase schemes, even promotions, displays or exhibitions outside the State are made subject to the consent of two Ministers. Promotions, displays and contracts are an essential part of marketing, so there would seem to be a contradiction between sections 4 and 7 of the Bill.  A marketing manager has been appointed by the board; changes have been brought about and the image of the board's products, whatever about the image of the board itself, has substantially improved since the appointment of the marketing manager.  It is totally unnecessary for a semi-State company with a projected turnover of £180 million in a few years' time to have to get the consent of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance in relation to any displays or exhibitions in countries where they are trying to aggressively market their products. This would be regarded as unnecessary in the private sector.  We are trying to commercialise our semi-State bodies and give them an image so that they can compete in the open market, so ministerial consent in that context is quite unnecessary.  I understand the Department of Energy have acknowledged the point and are prepared to give the board <Col N="967" /> a suitable letter, but a letter such as that is no substitute for correcting matters in the Bill and the fewer letters we have flying about the better.  We have had too many letters and too much paperwork in the past.</P>
    <P>Before I get into the wider area of where Bord na Móna are going.  I would like to make a point in relation to cutaway bogs which are dealt with in section 7 (3) and (4).  The Government have made the decision that forestry is to be dealt with by An Bord Coillte which has been set up and is in operation.  The issue of the cutaway bogs is a very important one which I will go into in some more detail later on when speaking about the implications of these changes for my own constituency, particularly my own county of Offaly.  It is to be regretted that the final report of the interdepartmental committee on cutaway bogs has not been published and made available to Bord na Móna.  It has not been made available to public representatives like myself who represent the area, although we have a general idea of what is in it, and I see no reason we should not all know exactly what is in it.  It makes provision for a multi-option strategy which will involve forestry in so far as about 60 per cent of the cutaway bog would be suitable for forestry and, subsequently, amenity purposes, tourist facilities like artificial lakes and so on, horticulture and grassland which has proved to be the best agricultural use to which it can be put.  In section 7 (4) as drafted there is an effective power of veto by An Bord Coillte in relation to what Bord na Móna can do with cutaway bogs.  The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>After the formation and registration of the company referred to in section 9 (1) of the Forestry Act, 1988, the Board shall, not less than twelve months prior to any exercise in the State by it of the power conferred by paragraph (j) of subsection (1) of this section in relation to a cut-away bog, give notice in writing so to do to the company and, if the company before the expiry of the period of twelve <Col N="968" /> months subsequent to the service of the notice, gives notice to the Board that the company requires or may require such bog then the Board shall not so exercise that power.</P>
    <P>An Bord Coillte do not even have to say that they want it, just that they might want it at some stage.  Such an area obviously would be an area that Bord na Móna might want to do something with, and they can be vetoed by An Bord Coillte who may say that Bord na Móna cannot certainly do something with it because An Bord Coillte might want to do something with it later on, and that could be ten years down the line.  That is not acceptable to me or to many of the people I represent.  I have made my views know privately to the Minister and I think he sees a certain validity in the case I have put.  Let us remember that 60 per cent of the total cutaway bog will be accepted as being the proper preserve of An Bord Coillte for forestry purposes.  I hope and expect there will be an amendment to that subsection which will leave us with a different arrangement in relation to disputed areas of bog which may be suitable for forestry or for some other more productive purpose.  Some arbitration proceeding should be initiated, perhaps with the final decision being taken by the Minister for Energy who, given overwhelming evidence that the land need not be used for forestry but could be used for some other productive purpose, would allow Bord na Móna to develop it as they see fit.  That would be a reasonable arrangement.  I do not see why another semi-State body should have absolute veto, without a right of appeal to the Minister or anybody else, to decide what is to be done with it.</P>
    <P>While we all want to see this new fledgling forestry company up and running, I do not think this track record when under the Department of Forestry, was such that we should give them a final say over what will happen to certain areas of cut-away bog they might be interested in. That is an unqualified power of veto that is unacceptable and totally unnecessary at the end of the day given the fact that <Col N="969" /> Bord na Móna accept that 60 per cent of their cutaway bog will be suitable to An Bord Coillte anyway.  If the percentage of cutaway bog increased to 65 or 70 per cent I would not like to see that 10 per cent residue being left idle on the basis that An Bord Coillte might use it if the other 60 per cent was damaged by a forest fire.  The Minister understands my reservations and I hope he will be able to come up with some amendment.  Otherwise we will debate it again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 9 relates to remuneration and conditions of employment.  The Explanatory Memorandum refers to this as a standard provision.  Yet it must be noted that there is no such provision in legislation dealing with CIE, the ESB, An Post, Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann.  The ESB were given a new Act in 1988 and CIE were given a new Act in 1986.  It is fair to say that Bord na Móna have, in the main, observed Government directives relating to remuneration and conditions of employment and I do not think this provision is necessary.  As far as I can ascertain, only An Bord Gáis and Irish Steel have similar provisions in their legislation.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply, or on Committee Stage, would explain why it is necessary to include section 9 in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms from the opposite side when this Bill was last debated in the Dáil was that it did not open up all the issues which affect Bord na Móna at present and the major decisions that are being taken and will have to be taken in the future to ensure their long-term viability and their continued presence and influence in the midlands' economy where they have such an extensive remit. It has to be pointed out that this Bill has been sought by Bord na Móna for some considerable time.  It allows them the commercial flexibility they require to move progressively into a very highly competitive energy market, and hopefully we will see them survive and prosper in that new competitive environment both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>The Government are to be congratulated on the introduction of this Bill. <Col N="970" /> We can have, as I have outlined in the past 20 minutes, some reservations about certain drafting aspects and certain sections of the Bill, but they can be overcome on Committee Stage.  I do not think anybody would find fault with the principle of the Bill and the need to impose that principle on the company as soon as possible.  All these new powers and the new opportunities they will hopefully give to the board are of limited value if the board do not get their financial structure right to enable them to compete with the various enterprises involved in the solid fuel market.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna owe about £166 million. As of March 1988, that comprised of Exchequer borrowings of £25 million at fixed rates; European Investment Bank loans totalling £31 million repayable by annuity; long-term bank loans totalling £86 million at floating rates and short-term bank loans totalling £22 million, again at floating rates.  In relation to the European Investment Bank loans, it is only fair to say that successive Governments have been culpable &mdash; perhaps that is too strong a word &mdash; but they certainly have been slightly avaricious in that the 3 per cent interest subsidy rebate that is due upon payment of interest charges on those loans, is being retained by the Exchequer.  It is not right that Bord na Móna should have to make this type of interest repayment, totalling almost £20 million a year, regardless of hail, rain or shine and regardless of their levels of profitability.  The interest subsidy that is recoupable, having paid the interest on the loan, should go back to the company who are hard pressed to pay the loan in the first place and not to Government Exchequer coffers as has happened under successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Given the rationalisation that is taking place and the sacrifices that are being made, and will continue to be made, the Government of the day, no matter what Government, could give concrete support to the company when experiencing difficulties by accepting that that 3 per cent interest subsidy be repayable to Bord na Móna and not to anybody else. It is not fair that Bord na Móna do not <Col N="971" /> get that benefit.  In one year the interest subsidy was of the order of £923,000, a sizeable sum which would have been better employed by the board given that they had to make the interest payment regardless of their ability to do so, and unfortunately that has been the case in the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to carefully monitor the efforts being made to bring about a much better debt management within the company.  I hope the negotiations that will take place with the Department of Finance to facilitate the better management of that debt will not be blocked by a tunnel vision approach of some officials in that Department who may not be very sympathetic in allowing the board to come to some new arrangement in relation to the repayment of Exchequer loans by the company.  I accept that in present financial circumstances nobody is on a free lunch any more and that the Government have to work within very tight fiscal targets. Given the contribution this company have made to the midlands economy, some consideration should be given in the future to see if the Government of the day could invest, on behalf of the taxpayer, some equity in this company.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the main reasons Bord na Móna are experiencing difficulty is that they have not been able to take equity in the company.  Because of the energy policy being promoted in 1973-74 to forge ahead with a new third development programme to borrow money in the private sector, to fund new development and new exploitation of bog, to increase our capacity in the peat fire burning stations, to ensure that we would not be as dependent as we had been at that time on oil as a result of the first oil crisis in 1973-74, the company did that and the energy market has since changed.  The assumptions which were made no longer apply and the board found themselves having to repay that money, and they will have to continue repaying it.</P>
    <P>Because it is such a weather dependent industry, regardless of whether it was profit making in any particular year, they <Col N="972" /> could not say as would be the case with shareholders in a private company that they were not giving out a dividend this year, because they had a bad year.  The company's financial base was so structured that they have to make those interest repayments regardless of profitability levels.  In the late seventies and early eighties at a time of high interest rates, they were paying 14 per cent or 15 per cent interest on loans.  If you use that analogy in a private company, it is equivalent to the sort of dividend that could not be paid by Goodmans or Smurfits no matter how profitable they were.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that happens to semi-State companies which are financed under an Act of the Oireachtas.  When a company gets into difficulty great efforts are made by some to portray what was a flagship of the semi-State sector in terms of its contribution to the Irish economy, as some sort of lame duck which can now be disposed of or wound up to meet the repayments that fall due, without putting into context where the financial problem arose and the limitations placed on a major semi-State company like Bord na Móna, as distinct from a burgeoning company in the private sector which seeks to expand by calling in capital and extending its shareholdings and issuing new share capital.</P>
    <P>Having put that in context the present and the future position of Bord na Móna depends very much on whether they can get their raw material, basically the milled peat, down to a competitive cost which, in turn, can make their briquettes more competitive and their price to the ESB more competitive given that the ESB now have Moneypoint on stream.  I have heard this mentioned by Opposition spokespersons on Second Stage, and particularly by the Progressive Democrats: when we talk about the cost handicap of peat as a fuel for electricity generation purposes, it is well to remember that it was strategically important that we had that facility in the seventies when we had the oil crisis.  It is strategically important to have it at all times, regardless of whether we have a very competitive energy market, given the <Col N="973" /> fluctuations that can occur in coal, oil, or anything else.  More importantly than that, we have built up around it in the midlands economy, and particularly in County Offaly, a level of prosperity.</P>
    <P>Let it be remembered by those who seek to impose a rationalisation of Board na Móna, simply on economic criteria that there would be no consultants' report on Bord na Móna were it not for the fact that in the forties a Fianna Fáil Government felt they had a social obligation to set up Bord na Móna in an area where no private enterprise would go and to provide employment as that great company have done.  When we talk about planning permissions and the need to have an environmental impact assessment carried out &mdash; if it is only for a pig plant &mdash; will we get a Government consultants' report based on strictly economic criteria, but we will not have a social impact assessment on a whole strength of country from Birr to Clonsast in my own county.  I can name villages and towns which are totally dependent on the wage packets paid by that company.  That is my concern.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned, in our rationalisation proposals, we might lose sight of the human resources which have built up that company and which would go to waste if we are not prepared to look at the overall picture.  When those of the right in this Parliament &mdash; I heard them on this debate before Christmas &mdash; talk about the need for viability and for exclusively commercial criteria, they should remember that the point they are making would not arise but for the fact that a social obligation was identified and through the efforts of the men and women in that company an enormous contribution to the economy and to this country has been made over the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>While we accept that rationalisation is necessary and anyone who is prepared or interested in analysing the problems and trying to secure the long term viability of Bord na Móna sees rationalisation as necessary, it is not the antithesis of that to say that Bord na Móna's socio-economic role must be recognised in my county and <Col N="974" /> in the midlands economy and that the maximisation of secure employment is something that can continue within the board, and which can continue to support communities, too numerous to mention, if it is allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>The need to continue to supply the ESB power stations with milled peat, regardless of what would be regarded as a cost handicap, is not simply strategic either.  If one looks at the cost of electricity &mdash; we all agree that it is the policy of the Government to reduce the cost of electricity &mdash; one must remember that the stations fired by milled peat account for only about 11 per cent of total generating capacity in the ESB.  Therefore, if we are talking about reductions in electricity prices by rationalising our electricity industry we do not have to do it at the total annihilation of our peat industry because the latter industry accounts for only 11 per cent of total generating capacity.  The company that provides the raw material for one tenth of total generating capacity should not feel the full brunt of any rationalisation that is required to bring down electricity prices.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from a Confederation of Irish Industry Newsletter, Volume 49, No. 23, of 25 October 1988, a survey of electricity prices in EC countries which showed that Irish industrial electricity charges continue to decline. The newsletter states that changes:</P>
    <P>have taken place in industrial electricity prices per kW hour, nominated in a common currency, the ECU, between 1st January 1986 and 1st January 1988.  During this period electricity prices in Ireland for small industrial users have reduced from 117.5 per cent of the EC average to 107.7 per cent of the EC average at 1st January 1988.  This does not take into account the further reduction of 5 per cent incident to the 1988 Budget.  Charges for medium industrial users reduced from 119.8 per cent of the European average in 1986 to the European average at 1st January 1988.  For larger industrial users Irish industrial electricity prices have fallen from 125.8 <Col N="975" /> per cent of the EC average in January 1986 to 99.3 per cent of the average at 1st January 1988.</P>
    <P>Again that did not take into account the further reduction of 5 per cent in the 1988 budget.  When the argument is put forward, as has been put obliquely by some Opposition Members in their Second Stage contributions that, of course, it is necessary to rationalise Bord na Móna simply on the premise that the cost of electricity generation is far too high, that is not the full story because Bord na Móna only contribute to one tenth of the total ESB capacity and in any event we are seeing a reduction in the cost of electricity <i>vis-á-vis</i> our competitors in the EC as we approach the completion of the internal market.  This is not a reason simpliciter that one should talk about reducing the milled peat quotas to fire the peat burning stations.</P>
    <P>However, one has to accept that the necessity for constant supply to the ESB has to be a high priority with Bord na Móna.  A high quality product is required to retain a competitive contract to the ESB.  The proposals put forward by management to change the system of stockpiling from PECO system to HAKU system starting with 10 per cent this year is, according to them, the sort of system which will enhance quality and ensure that all peat milled is recoverable and saleable.  Because the new system has a 30 per cent increase on the PECO system is terms of the amount of peat that can be gathered in the same area of bog, management believe that this will ensure that targets can be met and that a constant supply can be guaranteed.  We have had very bad weather in the past few years during the production season.  In 1985 there was only 37 per cent production as a result of the disastrous weather. In 1986, the weather was not much better but we had a fairly good autumn and this brought production up to 77 per cent, in 1987 production was at 102 per cent while in 1988 it was back down to 60 per cent.  The introduction of new peat technologies within the production <Col N="976" /> capacity of the board is something we must agree needs to be looked at.  I think it is now the case, given the discussions that are taking place, that the trade union movement will accept the introduction of new technology without seeking to impose a precondition that the new technologies cannot be countenanced at all. I think it is accepted by the unions that the introduction of such a system meets with no objection in principle but that the real problem arises when it is proposed to put it out on contract.</P>
    <P>The level of voluntary redundancies in Bord na Móna, totalling 1,200, is something that we very much regret but when one considers the figures for the 1986 production season, for example, that out of a total expenditure of £88.369 million, over £61 million related to wages and salaries, and wage overheads and that this constituted 70 per cent of the total cost of production in that year, it is quite clear that when talking about reducing necessary costs this means reducing wage cost and by implication wages.  There is a need to look at this.  Thankfully all those who have left Bord na Móna have done so on a voluntary basis rather than being forced to take compulsory redundancy. Having said that, those who are left, work in a direct labour system.</P>
    <P>Management propose to convert the direct labour system to a contract system progressively over five years, starting with 10 per cent this year, moving up another 20 per cent next year to 100 per cent in five years time.  The new system is regarded as a more flexible approach. This ethos is necessary in order to cut costs and get the necessary quality and level of production up.  I can see that, over a period with a change in the work-place and the change in attitude, that such a system would be ultimately beneficial but such a change in the absence of a job replacement policy would result in major socio-economic problems for County Offaly.  There is no question about that.  A job reduction policy has already been put in place, and in the absence of a job replacement policy one can see major problems.</P>
    <P>This also brings into play the role of a <Col N="977" /> semi-State company.  We have seen in well publicised examples, where fewer jobs have been shed, an obligation being put on the semi-State company concerned to seek out job replacement proposals before proceeding with rationalisation that was not of the magnitude I am talking about in Bord na Móna.  That is the proper thing to do.  In areas which did not span four or five counties but three or four townlands, we have seen a semi-State company find replacement industries or at least have assurances that they are being set up before proceeding with the job reduction policy.  I have to say as a humble backbencher that, given the fact that Bord na Móna constitute 33? per cent of the jobs in the manufacturing sector in County Offaly, and that we have lost 700 jobs already as a result of the voluntary redundancy programme, with possibly more to come if the transfer to the contract system is to go ahead, it will be necessary for the Government to have a job replacement policy.  The Fianna Fáil organisation in County Offaly will want Government intervention to be seen to bring about a change.  They will want to know that it is not simply a job reduction policy but a job replacement policy.  I am simply putting the cards of the Fianna Fáil organisation in my county on the table, as they have asked me to.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) (Amendment) Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the observations of Deputy Michael D. Higgins on the Order of Business today, it was not Fine Gael's wish that anyone should be taken short in responding to this measure.  When we decided upon it, I took steps to inform the Minister and the spokesmen on Education in the other parties of its contents and I indicated why we were not in a <Col N="978" /> position to have it published, that being that the judicial separation Bill does not complete its passage through the House until Thursday morning.  The measure is a very straightforward one.  This is a very short Bill and no one can have been disadvantaged in any way in responding to it.</P>
    <P>Although one might think that the Dáil should exercise a particular responsibility in relation to the State sector of the educational system, it is just about 18 months since we had a debate in this House on that sector.  It has been a very difficult and traumatic 18 months for that sector.  At a time when the number of students in the public sector post-primary schools and colleges was increasing, the sector has been the victim of cutbacks that have seen the loss of subject choice for students, the elimination of ex-quota posts, the loss of replacement teachers, a curtailment in guidance and remedial services, increased class sizes and now the delayed inevitability of a number of smaller schools facing closure.  All that has been going on while support for the vocational sector in terms of the vocational preparation and training programme being withdrawn, has been reduced as allowances were cut.</P>
    <P>The core of that sector since its foundation has been that it should be free and non-selective and that it should be comprehensive in the sense that it should address both the practical skill needs and the educational intellectual needs of the students.  Fired by that philosophical base, the schools have seen themselves as having a particular role in responding to the needs of the disadvantaged.  That remains the case.  A great number of students in public sector schools come from families with no background in post-primary education.  Very many of them come from the least affluent sections of society.  One might have thought that those involved in that sector of education, because of that sense of mission they enjoyed, could have expected sympathy and understanding but that was not forthcoming. Instead, just about every school in the country has had decreases in staff <Col N="979" /> numbers and part-time teachers, in the availability of materials and has suffered the elimination of subject choices, of pass or honour options, the erosion of guidance provisions and remedial provisions and a decrease in the class day and in the class week.</P>
    <P>The effect of all that has been to give rise to a crisis of morale in the teaching profession.  The almost 10,000 teachers employed in that sector have seen their working conditions deteriorate as they see their sector crumbling around them. It is incumbent on this House to address that crisis of morale.  One obvious way would be to ensure that adequate resources are made available.  Unfortunately Standing Orders constrain Opposition Parties in advocating increased expenditure.  That constraint, however, does not leave us powerless, because the question of resources is by no means the only area where reform is required.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to address that crisis of morale in one limited but specific way in seeking to remove from the teaching profession one long-standing irritant. The Bill seeks to assert and vindicate the professional status of the vocational school teacher.  That is what is central to this Bill, because at the core of the Bill is an anxiety to vindicate the profession and to establish beyond doubt the right of the profession to carry on free from the actuality or the perception of political influence or control.  Those two possibilities are significant.  This evening we had at times a difficult and acrimonious debate that essentially related to the question of seeing to it that there should be no apparent conflict of interest.  It is not part of my task in moving this Bill on behalf of Fine Gael to cast any aspersions on any vocational educational committee in relation to how they discharge their duties.  However, I have had drawn to my attention a number of specific instances that have caused me concern.  Even in the couple of days since this Bill became public knowledge I have had contacts from several parts of the country from people drawing my attention to what they <Col N="980" /> saw as anomalies or improprieties.  My objective is not to cast judgment but simply to say that temptation should not be put in people's way.</P>
    <P>The issues with which this Bill seeks to grapple have a long and distinguished pedigree, because even before the emergence of the newly independent State, some of the leading figures in Irish nationalism had criticised the methods of appointment to the British Civil Service and the British-influenced, British-controlled system of local authorities in Ireland.  Arthur Griffith, for example, addressing a Sinn Féin Ard Fheis as far back as 1905 in the Rotunda said:</P>
    <P>The Poor Law Boards for Ireland employ about 4,000 officials, the Urban Councils must employ at least 2,000 more.  Here we have the materials for the foundation of a National Civil Service.  At the present moment their appointment is determined on the majority of cases more by the amount of personal influence they can wield with the members of the Board under which they seek appointment than by any other consideration. The question of efficiency is often, though not always, a secondary consideration. It is evident such a state of affairs tends both to the impairing of efficient administration in our local government and to a lowering of the moral standard that should prevail in the conduct of our public bodies....</P>
    <P>For the haphazard method of selecting the local officials in Ireland at present let us substitute an ordered one.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to adopt that statement of principle as my own in moving this Bill.  Indeed, it was a theme to which Arthur Griffith was to return more than once.  Writing on that subject in his work on rebuilding the nation he said:</P>
    <P>It is decreed that a National Civil Service embracing the employees of all public bodies shall be established. None who is not corrupt will fail to welcome this decree.</P>
    <P>In the very earliest years of the State the old system was carried over.  It was a <Col N="981" /> system that gave rise to some controversy to the extent I understand, that at least two members of local authorities found themselves charged with various offences under the public corruption legislation and I understand that jail sentences were imposed.  At a very early stage in the history of the new State the aspirations of the leaders of nationalist Ireland in that regard were taken on board.  In 1924, for example, the Civil Service Commission was established.  They sought to free from political influence appointments to the Civil Service and it is a measure of the success of that legislation that over I do not know how many charges of Government the independence, objectivity and impartiality of the Civil Service has never been called into question. However, that legislation was limited in scope because it dealt only with the narrow Civil Service and excluded from its application the local authorities. That was not universally popular and I noted that as the debate was going through the House requests, suggestions and proposals were put that its scope should be broadened to include local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats might be interested to know, for example, it was a particular concern of Eoin MacNeill that the Civil Service Commission would be capable of performing the same functions for local authorities as they were entrusted with for central Government but the Civil Service Commissioners at the time were reluctant to take on a wider role and their remit was confined to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A degree of unease and anxiety persisted and that was taken on board in 1926 with the enactment of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  That Act prescribed that all appointments by a local authority should be made on the basis of a recommendation from the Public Appointments Commission. Section 2 (1) (b) of the 1926 Act provided that the Act would apply to every office and every employment &ldquo;not being an office or employment as a teacher&rdquo;.  That is a very curious exception.  I have not been able to discover what the thinking <Col N="982" /> on that exclusion was in 1926 but the theme arose again four years later when the House addressed the seminal Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the exclusion of the teaching profession and of appointments within the VEC system from the general principle of Public Appointments Commission control was raised.  This was touched on several occasions during the course of that debate and it emerges quite clearly, if now rather anachronistically, just what the thinking was; it is clear that at that time it was believed that teachers in the vocational sector were not in a true sense professionals, that they were analogous to tradesmen or manual employees and that the method of appointment should reflect that relationship rather than follow the path which was laid down for every other professional appointment in the public service.</P>
    <P>Whatever the truth may have been in 1930, that clearly is manifest nonsense today and there can be no logical distinction any further from excluding the teaching profession from the standards we set for every other appointment in the public sector.  In the past when the case for reform was put &mdash; and this has been a long standing demand of the teaching profession &mdash; the answer they sometimes got has been rather like St. Paul making it holy but not yet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very well informed on this matter.  I think the attitude has been that it had merit but that now was not the time to do it. Specifically, the argument has been put in the past was that it was not feasible to do it because the number of appointments that would come to be made in the teaching sector would impose impossible burdens on the Local Appointments Commission.  Clearly that is not the case any more and is not, both for reasons of public expenditure and demographic changes, likely to be the case in the future.  Therefore, there can be no objection in priniciple to putting teachers on the same footing as everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the effect been of the failure to put teachers on the same basis as everybody else?  Because the selection boards who make the appointments are not professionally qualified, it is very difficult for appointments to be made purely on the basis of merit.  It also means that all appointments in the system are open to the possibility of politcal interference, and the voting system almost invites political interference and political influence. We have the curious situation that appointments may be made by a board where no professionally qualified interviewers make the decisions.  There will, of course, be advisers present, but they are present as advisers and the actual decision-making may be made entirely by people other than those who are professionally qualified.  Different approaches are taken by different VECs. For example, it is the practice of some <Col N="984" /> VECs &mdash; though I think a minority &mdash; to state in their applications that canvassing will disqualify a person but it seems to be a practice of a majority not to state it and leave the expectation that it is open season for canvassing.</P>
    <P>A system such as that which now applies is unlikely to attract the best people because some of them at least must wonder whether their applications will be treated in an entirely objective manner.  At present &mdash; and this fails to accord with the standards of natural justice we would normally apply &mdash; there is no system of appeal for an aggrieved teacher.  Of course, the application form states the minimum qualifications for eligibility to enter a competition, but nowhere is it made public what factors will influence the decision making body so that no one is in a position to say: &ldquo;It seems I have the necessary qualifications and therefore, this is a position for which I can apply with some confidence&rdquo;.  As a matter of practice &mdash; and many Members of the House have served on vocational education committees at one stage or another &mdash; candidates are required to lobby and canvass, and one cannot believe that that is other than distressing and degrading for them both professionally and personally.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons it is hardly surprising that over very many years the teaching profession have expressed their disquiet and unhappiness.  That disquite and unhappiness has intensified in recent times.  The system was always wrong in principle but its potential for creating injustice is greater now than in the past. It is greater now simply because vacancies are fewer and to that extent vacancies are more precious.  The effect of that is twofold.  First, it increases the temptation to take into consideration factors other than objective merit.  If an interview board know that is the only appointment they are likely to be making that year or for a number of years and somebody has approached them on the basis of being a local boy and if they know that if they say no there may be no second opportunity, the temptation to respond to such an approach is all the greater.  Equally, if <Col N="985" /> people respond to such an approach, the injustice to the other applicants who went before the interview board is all the greater.  No longer is it a case that these can say with resignation that somebody else had the inside track but that there would be another vacancy and what is the difference.  Now, failure to have their application considered on its merits may mean that they are condemned to a lengthy period without a full time appointment.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to accept the principle that we should introduce an element of impartial objectivity into the selection process.  I have proposed that the teaching profession be put on the same basis as every other profession in the State when it comes to public appointments and that appointments would be a matter for the Local Appointments Commission. How it would progress from there I have an open mind on and I am prepared to listen to suggestions.  I can see that people may want to limit the scope, that there may be quite understandable reasons for excluding, for example, temporary positions where perhaps only a small number of teaching hours are involved, or replacements in the case of maternity leave or other leave of short duration.  If that is an issue that worries the Minister or any other Member of the House, it is a subject to which I would be delighted to return on Committee Stage with an entirely open mind.</P>
    <P>There may be Members of the House who will ask for an opportunity for parents or for the principal of the school to have a say and the answer is that I would be happy to consider on Committee Stage how we could give effect to such an approach.  I am simply telling the House tonight that we are open to the principle of impartial, objective selection, giving teachers the same standard of fairness that we give to every other profession within the State.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, I said that it was designed to address the question of low morale within the system and to introduce a limited but worthwhile reform.  I do not pretend for one moment <Col N="986" /> that it represents the full extent of what is required in the vocational education area.  What I do say is that what an Opposition party are capable of doing in their legislation is necessarily limited, both by reason of practice and by reason of the Standing Orders of the House.  It is not feasible for an Opposition party to attempt to restructure the entire vocational education system.  In those circumstances, it seems to us proper to set ourselves more modest ambitions and address specific reforms that we are capable of taking on board.  We will be happy, and eager indeed, to see this reform discussed in the context of the need for wider reform in the Vocational Education Act.</P>
    <P>Again, if people come forward and say that what they would like to see happen on Committee Stage is that other necessary reforms be incorporated in the Bill, and that the thrust of the Bill should be broadened, that is something also that we would be happy to take on board.  When in Government we addressed the question of the need to look at the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  We did so, not on the basis of abandoning an Act that has served the State well, has certainly worn its years well and is a tribute to the distinguished Kerry educationalist who introduced it, John Marcus O'Sullivan, but on the basis that any changes we have in mind should be embedded in that Act and be seen as a natural development from it.  We thought long and hard on that issue when in Government and presented some proposals for public debate in the form of a Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education: Serving the Community.</i> Whether considered by way of amendment to this Bill, or by way of alternative legislation, that agenda remains relevant today.  That agenda, as this Bill does, addresses the question of morale within the sector.  I said that it would have to be embedded in the spirit of the Vocational Education Act of 1980. That means democratic, local control. That was provided for in the local education committees we proposed.  We addressed the tension and difficulties that exist at the moment in some parts of the <Col N="987" /> country between the public sector schools and voluntary secondary schools.  We presented proposals designed to see to it that the two wings of the sector would work in greater harmony.  That, too, was designed to address the question of morale within the sector.  That case remains as relevant today as when the Green Paper was published.</P>
    <P>We addressed the particular difficulties of the regional technical colleges in that Green Paper, again not on the basis of disparaging the efforts of the vocational education committees.  Indeed, what we were really doing was paying a tribute to them.  They presided successfully over the regional technical colleges.  We were, however, saying that they had been so successful that the colleges were now ready to enjoy a substantial degree of autonomy but that we still believed they should remain regional in character and that there still be provided the role for the local education committees as we conceived them or, be pending their creation, of the vocational education committees. We believed that there was a need to enhance the opportunity for the regional technical colleges to forge ever closer links with business, industry and agriculture in their areas.  We believe that that was best done by giving them the autonomy and freedom to do that for themselves.  We saw the particular need for movement in the case of the Dublin Institute for Technology Colleges which have achieved such a status that it seems entirely appropriate that they should have an independent statutory base.</P>
    <P>All these issues remain relevant and material.  We would be anxious to see all of them addressed.  Whether that is to be done in alternative legislation or by way of amendment to this legislation remains to be seen.  We are satisfied that this Bill represents a worthwhile, if modest, reform and that it tackles an area that has consistently given rise to disquiet, an area where that disquiet is growing of recent times.  It sets out to establish a principle that public appointments in this State should be seen to be free of political influence and control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> I mentioned earlier some of the history as to how teachers got themselves excluded.  Professor F. S. L. Lyons, writing in <i>Ireland since the Famine</i> on the establishment of the Civil Service Commission and Public Appointments Commission, suggested that the establishment of those two commissions was essential to the creation of a young and healthy democracy because it removed crucial appointments from the political spoils system.  For much of the history of this State we have had a situation where just about every appointment other than rate collectors and vocational teachers has been outside the system of political influence.  In recent times even the rate collectors have been removed.  Only one system of appointment is now perceived as capable of being influenced on the basis of political inclination, lobbying and stroking.  I refer to the appointment of teachers in the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>In fairness to members of vocational education committees and to people who seek appointments in their schools, we owe it to them to change that system.  Any modern system of administration would indicate that it is proper to distinguish between the policy-making function of a committee and the interviewing and appointment of individual candidates. We owe it to individual teachers to assert and vindicate their professional status.  It is a modest and overdue reform and I ask the House to support it.</P>

      <P>This power is vested in vocational education committees under section 23 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Section 23 of the Act states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, every vocational education committee shall appoint a chief executive officer and such other officers and servants as it shall from time to time think necessary for the due performance of its powers and duties under this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The numbers, qualifications, salaries or remuneration, and appointment of all officers shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every vocational education committee shall take from its chief executive officer and any other of its officers who receives or pays money on its behalf such security as may be directed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  A vocational education committee may dismiss any servant of such committee and, with the approval of <Col N="990" /> the Minister, remove any officer of such committee.</P>
    <P>(5)  A vocational education committee shall be deemed to be a local authority within the meaning of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), and for that purpose the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in that Act shall in relation to a vocational education committee mean the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Vocational Education Act, which has served us so well, the practice has been that the chief executive officer appointed to each vocational education committee is a person recommended by the Commissioners for Local Appointments.  The committees may appoint one of their officers in an acting capacity &mdash; several are in such a capacity at present &mdash; while the office of chief executive officer is vacant, but the permanent filling of such office requires the recommendation of a person by the Commissioners for Local Appointments.</P>
    <P>Aside from chief executive officers, vocational education committees appoint teachers, including principals of schools, education officers including adult education organisers, administrative and clerical staff, and caretakers and maintenance personnel for their various schools and premises.  In addition they appoint teachers to posts of responsibility and to posts as vice-principal in schools.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees which have, within their committee's area, a regional technical or other vocational education college, appoint to such colleges, principals, teaching staff of various grades including supervisory grades, administrative and office staff, technical support staff and such maintenance and other staff as are required.</P>
    <P>Teaching posts under vocational education committees, from the time of passing of the Act were filled directly by the vocational education committees concerned, subject to the rules and procedures set out by the Minister for Education in Memorandum V7.  While <Col N="991" /> there was a number of exceptions, the normal process of filling a teaching post was by direct application to the committee which then decided through their normal voting procedures which of the candidates was to be appointed.  The appointment was subject to ministerial sanction, but such sanction was withheld only in the event of the candidate not being fully qualified for the post or otherwise where there was evident administrative irregularity in the making of an appointment.</P>
    <P>This position continued until 1967, when the then Minister for Education, Donagh O'Malley, following consultation, issued personally a letter to the chairman of each vocational education committee outlining a procedure which was to be followed in the appointment of vocational teachers.  This procedure envisaged the establishment of two selection boards, one for the whole time class III appointments and for teaching posts carrying allowances of less than £280 per annum, the second for posts carrying allowances of over £280 per annum and for all posts as higher technological teacher grade III and for all appointments to posts carrying inclusive salaries above that level.</P>
    <P>The first or general selection board consisted of five members, four named members of the committee and one officer of the Department of Education to be nominated by the Minister.  The board was to act for one year from 1 April 1967 and was to be assisted by the chief executive officer as a non-voting adviser and by such other non-voting advisers as it might desire in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The second or central selection board was one of seven members, four nominated members of the vocational education committee, one representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and two officers of the Department nominated by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In outlining the proposed procedure in his letter, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> It is envisaged that Vocational Education Committees, having adopted the procedure outlined above, should not find it necessary to proceed in full committee to duplicate the work of the selction boards and that in the normal way they should make their appointments in accordance with the selection of the Boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated that it was his intention &ldquo;that this procedure be adopted by all Vocational Education Committees and that proposed appointments, after its adoption, will be approved only in accordance with its provisions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The foregoing procedure was adopted by the VECs and put into effect.  It was continued beyond the trial period and incorporated into Memorandum V7 as an appendix to that document.  Selection boards generally adopted the practice of interviewing all qualified candidates as an aid to selection, except where excessive numbers of candidates were involved.  In this latter case selection boards met to implement short-listing procedures on the basis of information contained in application forms.  The procedure outlined in Minister O'Malley's letter of 7 March, 1967 continued without change until March 1979 when circular No. 16/79 was issued to VECs advising them of &ldquo;Revised Selection Procedures for Appointment of Teachers in second-level Vocational Schools&rdquo;.  This circular stated the Minister's belief &ldquo;that short of a completely radical alteration in the method of selection which is not practicable at the present time, the existing procedures have functioned with reasonable success&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While not departing fundamentally from the lines on which selection boards had hitherto discharged their functions, the circular went on to propose some practical amendments as a means of removing difficulties and providing for a desirable degree of uniformity.  The principal changes amounted to: (i) reduction of the number of members in the central selection board from seven to five &mdash; giving a revised board of three VEC members, one IVEA and one officer of <Col N="993" /> the Department; (ii) provision for a minimum composition of each board &mdash; two VEC members and one officer of the Department; (iii) various provisions with regard to non-voting advisers and substitute VEC and IVEA members; and (iv) some procedural matters of board operation and definiton of function with regard to general and central selection boards.</P>
    <P>The system of selection and proposal for appointment outlined in C.L. 16/79 is that currently in operation for second level vocational schools and for colleges, other than regional technical colleges, operated under vocational education committees.  In the case of regional technical colleges, under the provisions of C.L. 29/69 each parent VEC appointed a board of management, as a sub-committe of the VEC, under section 21 (1) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The board are responsible for running the regional technical college and report back to the parent VEC for confirmation of its acts.  The original boards of management consisted of seven members comprising: One member of the VEC of the area in which the college is situated; one selection from agricultural interests; one CEO of the VEC of area in which the college is situated; one principal of the RTC; one nominee of ICTU; one nominee of local chamber of commerce; and one nominee of the Minister who will be an official of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the boards of management were extended to incorporate nominees of neighbouring vocational education committees and, subject to a maximum of 12 members, were advised where possible to provide for representation of the industrial sector, an elected representative of the teachers in each college and a representative of ICTU.  Up to 1979 boards of management generally also acted as selection boards for teaching posts in the RTCs.  In October 1979, the Department, in a letter to the then President of the I.V.E.A., stated:</P>
    <P>In the matter of the composition of the Selection Board for teaching <Col N="994" /> appointments in each Regional Technical College, other than in an appointment to the post of Principal, the Minister is of the view that the total number of members of the Board of Management nominated for this purpose should not exceed <i>five.</i> The Minister would see the Selection Board consisting of the Chief Executive Officer of the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; Committee, three other members of the Board of Management, at least one of whom should be a member of a V.E.C. and the Minister's nominee.</P>
    <P>As in the case of all other actions by the board of management the appointment of teachers is referred back to the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; VEC for ratification and though there is an &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; that this process should be automatic, the position is not in any way as explicit as that stated in the historic letter of 7 March 1967.</P>
    <P>Apart from teachers and teacher-related appointments (e.g. education officer, adult education organiser etc.) other appointments to administrative and office staff, technical support staff, maintenance staff, and the appointment of &ldquo;servants&rdquo; generally are made by VECs directly in accordance with general agreements to cover section 23 of the Act and the Department have not been involved in the setting out, or in the operation, of selection procedures.</P>
    <P>A consideration governing the appointment of teachers to VECs is the number of appointments to be made.  In the second level sector there are approximately 5,000 teachers and the number of appointments made annually is in the order of 350.  I am coming to Deputy Birmingham's point.  Appointments of existing staff to posts of responsibility would be additional to the above.  In the RTCs and VEC colleges sector there are approximately 2,000 full-time teachers and an allocation of some 300,000 part-time hours.  Some 200 appointments were made for the year 1984-85 but are being made at a rate of about 30 to 40 per annum at present due to financial and other circumstances.  As the RTCs are of recent establishment staff generally are <Col N="995" /> about mid-career and the replacement requirement is not very high.</P>
    <P>While these numbers are not excessive it must be remembered that the posts cover very broad ranges of study with hundreds of different post specifications and qualifications requirements.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the foregoing that explicit selection systems exist for vocational teachers both in schools and in regional and other colleges under the control of VECs.  While any selection system is open to abuse the presence of the Minister's nominee on all selection boards gives a transparency to their work and on the whole the impression is that the system works satisfactorily.  While there is a selection system outlined for posts in primary schools, it does not provide for involvement by a nominee of the Minister.  Secondary schools are free to select their own teachers with or without a selection procedure.  In community and comprehensive schools selection of teachers is a responsibility of the boards of management.</P>
    <P>The centralisation of selection procedures for VEC teachers under the Commissioners for Local Appointments would be contrary to the devolution of authority to the appropriate operational level.  Furthermore, the number and variety of appointments could, if centralised, cause undue delay.</P>
    <P>While certain types of appointments &mdash; notably of a planning, advisory or administrative kind &mdash; can generally await &ldquo;due process&rdquo;, it is essential that teaching appointments are filled quickly as pupils cannot be left unattended or without instruction.</P>
    <P>The selection procedures and appointment processes outlined are a component of the general management procedures of VEC schools and colleges and of the interaction of the Department of Education with these procedures.  The isolation of selection procedures from the general management functions and the centralisation of these procedures is likely to add to the administrative costs of the system although it would not be possible, without a detailed analysis, to <Col N="996" /> say by how much they would be increased.</P>
    <P>The selection-appointment process is seen nowadays more as an interactive process, where the selection board, in addition to assessing a candidate's suitability for the job, are also involved in supplying the candidate with information regarding the post and its demands.  The matter of &ldquo;mutual suitability&rdquo;, that is, candidate to job and job to candidate, is frequently in question.  Selection of this nature requires detailed knowledge of the post, its duties and the environment in which they are performed.  The further removed the selection is from the operation of the system, the more difficult it is to carry out on the above basis.</P>
    <P>My Department are now preparing legislation which would reorganise vocational education committees in respect of a number of such committees, their composition and their functional area.  Preparations are also in train for legislative proposals which would give greater autonomy to the boards of regional technical colleges and would review the governing structures of other VEC colleges while maintaining them under the general aegis of VECs.  The question of selection and appointments procedures as outlined in this Bill could, therefore, fall for review in the course of preparation of these proposals.  I should like to say to Deputy Birmingham that, in the formulation of the legislation, I would certainly be prepared to consider the very important and relevant question which he raised tonight.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that these objectives are to ensure that the selection of teachers for posts under vocational education committees is fair and is seen to be fair and that it results in the selection of the best candidates for the post.  It is also important that the background which I outlined has shown that Ministers for Education and vocational education committees and their representatives have been working together over the years to bring about these objectives.  The major breakthrough was in the O'Malley letter of 7 March 1967 and actions since then have been based on that pioneering <Col N="997" /> initiative.  VECs have been co-operative in adopting and putting into effect revised selection arrangements.  However, we must consider whether these are now as good as they can be, whether improvements are necessary and, if so, how best they may be put into effect or whether the shift of authority proposed in the draft Bill under consideration is warranted or likely to lead to a more equitable and effective selection procedure.  I welcome Deputy Birmingham's points and they will appeal to anyone who has an interest in educational matters.  The proposals in the draft Bill will be considered rigorously and actively by me in the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the regional technical colleges and the colleges forming the Dublin Institute of Technology are concerned, I am at present having legislation prepared to give them a clearly defined basis.  They are at present operating under the 1930 Vocational Education Act which, because of its origins in and orientation towards second level education, is inappropriate to third level colleges in the way they must operate today.</P>
    <P>First, as I have said on a number of occasions, the colleges have a vital role to play in economic development at regional level, not only by supplying required skilled manpower but through linkages with industry in research and development.  I intend to make specific enabling provision in the proposed legislation for such activities from which the colleges are effectively precluded in their present status.  They carry out research and development with great enthusiasm and vigour often not knowing how far they can push out the parameters of the Act or how soundly based are their operations in these fields.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to 1969 and recalled the set up of regional colleges.  Having served for a number of years on a board of management, I was chairperson of the board of management in my home town for so many years, I am aware of the innovative nature of the regional colleges. From the very beginning they took the bit between their teeth, and here I speak of all the regional colleges around <Col N="998" /> the country.  While it was intended originally that they would serve their regions, they do so and will continue to do so in a personal and intimate way, they galloped ahead and have gone from offering certificate to diploma to university courses in many cases.  They have taken to research and development in a very broad and active way and have seen fit to participate in all of the various programmes being promoted by Europe at third level, such as the Erasmus, Comett and Sprite programmes and all the other quaintly and I suppose aptly titled programmes.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges and the DIT colleges have been to the fore in seizing opportunities to take advantage of available funding to carry out further infrastructural development and they have done so, as I said, in a very active way within their communities in the process interacting with industry, agriculture and the social partners and in a wider way with all of the professional interests.  The debate tonight and in the nights ahead of us will help to focus our minds on the very important developments which are needed in these areas.</P>
    <P>The recent report on the provision of technological education in Ireland, produced by a committee chaired by the very eminent Mr. Hardiman, led to the proposal by the Government that the two NIHEs be given independent university status.  Little reference has been made to the other provisions contained in that report relating to the regional technical colleges and the DIT.  That is for another day.  As I said, we are presently in the process of preparing legislative proposals in two areas: first, the Vocational Education Act aimed at amalgamating various VECs and, second, legislation to give regional technical colleges and the DIT the right to use their research and development to put themselves on a very firm footing and to enable them to fulfil their very fine potential for increasing economic development throughout the country given that we are now approaching 1992 and the need for regions to establish development agencies of their own. The regional colleges can certainly fulfil the role of development agencies to an <Col N="999" /> enormous extent.  Let me add that much has already been achieved in this area despite the constraints.  I wish to ensure, however, that the colleges have the authority and the encouragement, correctly and legislatively based, to intensify and expand their efforts.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the colleges as with any institution at this level, need greater scope and autonomy to manage their own affairs.  What I have in mind is to encourage a partnership between the colleges, the vocational education committees and the Department of Education under which, within agreed budgets and operational plans and policies, the colleges would manage and be accountable for their own day to day affairs, free from undue restraints.  I see this as very important if colleges are to in a position to respond effectively to new and varied demands but equally they will need such scope as they will be responsible for ensuring that agreed operational plans are implemented within the agreed budgets. The approval process, therefore, operating through the vocational education committees and the Department would stress strategies, plans and budgets to provide the framework within which the colleges would be permitted and required to operate.  I would anticipate then a more dynamic and effective relationship to develop between all parties concerned under these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham raised some points which I would like briefly to refer to.  At the outset he stressed that it was not his intention to point the finger at the VEC selection process or at any VEC who had engaged in their rightful task of teacher selection.  He later, advertently or inadvertently, referred to the need for public accountability in such appointments. I am sure he would agree as would all Members of the House that the VECs are held publicly accountable in that their meetings are open to the press.  It is their own business as to whether they attend but certainly these meetings are open to the press.  Outside of Dublin the activities of the various VECs are reported very <Col N="1000" /> extensively.  Appointments come up for ratification at a monthly meeting or at least at a statutory meeting and the proceedings are publicly recorded and noted. In this way the issue of public accountability is very much evident.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the point Deputy Birmingham is getting at in referring to the professional appointees but I should point out that all of us in this House have come through the democratic process. We put ourselves up for election and the people saw fit to send us here.  It should be far from any of us to decry the democratic process through which people are appointed to the VEC committees which are subcommittees of county councils. Some committees have appointed teacher, parent or student representatives or representatives of other outside interests.  These are non-elective. In the main most of the men and women who are members of the vocational education committees have come through a public voting procedure, the ballot box. This certainly amounts to public accountability and is the democratic process at work.</P>
    <P>I just want to put my own thoughts on the record.  I have always thought that anyone who goes for election, be it to a local urban council right up to the highest office in the land, is exercising a very noble option.  When teaching young people and at political meetings I have often said that it is very easy to decry the democratic process.  As we all know various pressures combine to denigrate the work of elected persons.  At the same time a person who goes forward for election puts himself or herself in front of the population at large.  They knock on doors and invite responses.  They go to the ballot box and are vulnerable.  Therefore I think we should espouse and guard the democratic process in all of our doings.</P>
    <P>The Bill as presented to us tonight is an interesting one which will lead to very wide debate on the whole procedures as outlined by Deputy Birmingham and myself.  Such a debate is to be welcomed. We have very little occasion for what one might call proper full debate on relevant <Col N="1001" /> subjects, and this is one.  I intend to be here tonight, tomorrow and next Tuesday and Wednesday listening to all the points put forward relevant to the Bill and to the wider issues which can be expanded throughout the debate.  I will be taking careful notes and in the preparation of our own legislation within the Department of Education we will be reviewing and paying particular attention to the points which have been put before the House here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have no quarrel with the aims and objectives of this Bill.  We support any measure that guarantees that in respect of all applicants for VEC posts, be they new posts or posts by way of promotion, interviews are carried out in the most fair, correct and professional manner possible. We also support any measure that would put teachers on a par with engineers, accountants, clerks and other such people seeking public appointment. Teachers are professional people and there is no good reason they should not be interviewed in a professional manner by persons with a professional qualification to carry out such interviews.  The present position when elected politicians make up the majority of members on an interview board is fraught with danger.  I am going no further than that and I want to put on record here that I am a member of a VEC.  I have sat on many an interview board and I can say categorically that any appointment made in that VEC area was made purely of the merit, capability and suitability of the applicant, on the basis of matching the best applicant to the post available at the time the vacancy occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have heard stories from other parts of the country that would make your hair stand on end.  There is no place in an enlightened modern democracy for such stories.  It is said there is no smoke without fire.  While I have not seen the fire, I am not prepared to ignore the smoke.  Any system that gives rise to these stories must be changed in fairness to the system as well as to the applicants and the education system in general.  The <Col N="1002" /> only way I see that we can guarantee protection to every teacher in the vocational sector is to put new applicants on a par with applicants for public appointments, as I have said.</P>
    <P>Having pledged my support, I am a little disappointed that this Bill is so narrowly focused.  Ordinarily, I would welcome very much any Private Members' time that allows a debate on education. Seldom in this House do we get an opportunity to debate educational issues at all. In more than 12 months there has been no debate at all on education except for the brief period that each spokesperson gets on the budget debate.  Each spokesperson gets just 15 minutes to raise issues and make points in relation to education. That has been the only time and the only scope provided in the last 12 months to debate issues educational, except for emergency measures like adjournment debates.  There have been adjournment debates on education, and there is Question Time which leaves very little scope for real, open two way dialogue.  Usually Question Time becomes an answer time and, while the Minister has great scope to put her points on paper and say what she has to say, I am afraid the questioners get very little scope to make their points.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed that this Bill was circulated so late.  It did not leave a great deal of time to Opposition spokespersons to frame a very considered or extensive response. That is a pity since we get so little time to debate education.  Secondly, it is a great pity the Bill is so narrowly focused. I see no material in this Bill for any kind of controversy.  What it advocates is <Col N="1003" /> essentially right and I have no great quarrel about it, but there are other issues directly related to vocational education that ought to be debated when we get an opportunity of this nature.  For example, the question of the amalgamation of VECs seems to be lost sight of.  That is a pity.  That issue was raised in the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education: Serving Community Needs</i> published in 1985.  It is as relevant to education today as it was then, but in the intervening time we have had very little debate of any kind on the issues raised in that Green Paper.  Deputy Hussey who introduced that paper and put a great deal of work and thought into it must feel at this stage that a good deal of her work is going to waste.  However, in relation to the same proposals the present Minister since taking office proposed that the number of VECs would be reduced.  Her proposal was that the numbers would be reduced from 38 to 20.  That proposal seems to be equally put in cold storage.</P>

      <P>It certainly is not in a microwave if it is cooking.  Speaking on that issue in the Dáil on 9 March last, almost 12 months ago, the Minister said in response to a point I made and I quote from the Official Report of 9 March 1988, column 2290:</P>
      <P>The question of the amalgamation of VECs was also referred to in the amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  It is highly appropriate in my opinion that this question should be addressed....</P>
      <P>that is what the Minister said almost 12 months ago.  In response to the question &ldquo;When?&rdquo;, the Minister replied:</P>
      <P>That is a very logical question.  I hope that the legislation will be ready for the term after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She did not say which Easter she had in mind but we are on the home straight to <Col N="1004" /> another Easter and the proposed legislation is still in the oven.  Therefore, I ask her please to turn up the thermostat and bring the legislation before the House. That sort of work is overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I go on to quote from the Minister's speech on the same occasion when she said with great conviction:</P>
      <P>The amalgamation therefore, of a number of VECs is designed to create a more efficient and cost-effective system and to enable the VECs to provide a better service to the public in their areas.</P>
      <P>That is a very fine sentiment, but I say to the Minister that delay is a very deadly form of denial.  If she is so convinced of the benefits of that amalgamation it seems a great pity that so much time, indeed another academic year, has been lost.</P>
      <P>Our educational system is subjected to intense pressure at present.  Schools and their authorities are being called on to respond to a whole range of demands from dozens of different sources.  Teachers are subjected to the most severe pressure to produce ever better results at a time when they are battling against a range of adverse circumstances.  Therefore, any legislative measure that would render the system more effective or efficient or that would raise the morale of teachers should not be deferred.</P>
      <P>The Bill's sponsor said that he felt the old system of interviewing and appointment had led to low morale among teachers. I am certain he did not say that lightly and that there is a strong element of truth in that assertion.  That being the case there is an obligation on the Minister to eliminate that factor.  Heaven knows teachers have sufficient to contend with without also having to contend with something that could be remedied if only the requisite legislative initiative were taken and followed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point also to the problems <Col N="1005" /> encounteed by teachers nowadays <i>vis-á-vis</i> discipline in the classroom.  Most teachers will tell you that these are problems on a scale not encountered in our day, occasioned by factors totally beyond their control and, to a large extent, ours too.  Whatever their source, there is an obligation on us to offset their worst repercussions.  That is a very real obligation which must not be ignored.</P>
    <P>We are calling on teachers to implement new courses in classrooms, new syllabi, additional languages, a whole range of new subjects.  We are asking teachers to improve their skills with very little in-service training, this at a time when so many pressures are causing them extreme difficulty.  We must not ignore any legislative provision that would help raise their morale or better equip them to cope with these demands and deadlines.  I am quite sure that the Bill sponsored by Deputy Birmingham constitutes such an answer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham said that the present system of appointments constituted a barrier or deterrent to some people applying for posts.  This may be true in certain areas in that they may feel that, from the start, they have not a chance.  Therefore, rather than be rejected, they will apply for posts elsewhere, perhaps in the voluntary secondary schools or others.  If that is the case, that is indeed serious.  I am quite sure Deputy Birmingham did not make that assertion without having done his homework and research.  If the present system of appointments keeps the best qualified and motivated people from the vocational sector, then that is the strongest argument that can be advanced for its revision.</P>
    <P>Talking about other reforms that ought to be effected without delay the Minister referred to the position of the RTCs.  I agree entirely with her comments in that respect.  I am certain the Minister has clearly in mind the necessary legislative provisions.  I would appeal to her to bring the required Bill before the House as soon as possible.  It must be remembered that the third level colleges are coping with enormously changed circumstances. <Col N="1006" /> We must not place the regional techincal colleges at any disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis,</i> for example, the NIHE colleges or the National University of Ireland.  There is great hope placed in the future of our RTCs.  Their courses are designed for young people for the conditions of the workplace today and tomorrow.  Let us not tie them down or restrict them for the want of framing the necessary legislstion that would give them autonomy and allow them develop their full potential.</P>
    <P>All of that should be done in the context of the Bill before us this evening because they are all closely related.  I have little patience with what might be described as piecemeal reformative legislation when so much of this reform is long overdue if we are to provide the kind of educational system so necessary for our young people in today's world.  I would appeal to the Minister to introduce that reforming legislation, when she will find there will be a great deal of support for it in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the merits of the present interviewing system.  It is not without merit; the Minister is quite right in that respect.  She referred to the obligation to match an applicant to a post and the inherent danger that the type of applicant one might find through the Public Appointments Commission might not be familiar with the requirements of the post in question.  Indeed, such an applicant might not be conversant with the ethos of the school in which the vacancy occurs.  It must be remembered that every school has its ethos, and that every principal knows exactly what he or she is seeking when taking on a new appointee which very often goes beyond professional qualifications.  Very often they seek other qualities which will allow appointees knit into the existing school personnel framework or environment.  If this Bill reaches Committee Stage that factor must be recognised &mdash; that school principals, who are familiar with all the dimensions and requirements of any given post, must not be excluded from an interview board.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, she did not indicate that she was hostile or apathetic to what is being advocated. I detected a great deal of optimism in what she said.  It appears that the Minister is open to change if she can be shown that it will be for the betterment of the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If change is delayed too long it somehow loses a great deal of its value and that is the essential point I wish to make in the debate.  The proposals advocated in the Bill are good and their effects will be very beneficial to education.  I have no doubt that if they are implemented benefits will flow to teachers and on to the children, who are our main concern. Parents will also be pleased.  In fact the whole system will benefit if the proposals are implemented.  I should like to repeat, for the umpteenth time, my request to the Minister to ensure that the change is <Col N="1008" /> made today.  I would like to see the change made in the context of the wider reform I referred to in the course of my short contribution to the debate.</P>

      <P>I understood the Deputy to refer to change for change sake.  I must ask if there is anything in the Bill that will improve the existing system.  Deputy Birmingham is a new spokesman on Education and, obviously, he is anxious to bring a new proposal forward.  I welcome any debate on education but I have difficulty in supporting the Bill particularly having regard to statements made by a front bench colleague of Deputy Birmingham's.  Deputy Bruton is on record as saying that he favours devolution but the Bill appears to suggest further centralisation.  That suggests to me that the Fine Gael Front Bench spokesmen have not considered what they would like to achieve in various sectors, particularly in regard to education. We must call for localisation in regard to education.  The VECs have served us extremely well.  They have been responsible for education at local level since the passing of the Act in 1930.  It is important to make the point that VECs are publicly accountable, as the Minister said.  Their meetings are open to the press, the membership of them is representative of all political opinion, staff and industry.  One can justifiably make the claim that they represent local interests to the best of their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of a person who is a product of the vocational education system not to emphasise the important role the VECs have played in the development of education.  It is important for me to highlight the foresight of those who framed the 1930 Act and how its provisions have stood the test of time. <Col N="1009" /> They have been adapted to modern developments in technological education. We have seen the advent of regional colleges and higher institutes of education being established throughout the country.  At this stage I should like to congratulate the Minister on granting university status to two technological institutions, a move that was welcomed by everybody in the education field.  It is important that we should not forget the progress made by students attending vocational schools and pay tribute to those who have worked within the vocational education system, particularly the teachers.  We must acknowledge the work done by teachers for the schools, the pupils, their parents and for industry. One of the greatest achievements of vocational education was the creation of a link between the schools and modern industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Local Appointments Commission and ask what role they play.  Is that a role we would like to have within the education sector? It is appropriate to put that question because Deputy Birmingham seems to be suggesting that a local appointments commission should be established to decide on the appointment of teachers to VEC schools.  I wonder why we should not have a similar commission to decide on appointments to secondary and national schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have a commission to decide on appointments for ancillary education services?  If we adopt Deputy Birmingham's suggestion in regard to the VECs I do not see why it should not be applied across the board. However, the Deputy must be aware of the logjam in regard to appointments by the Local Appointments Commission.  It appears to me that the Deputy wants to screw up the appointments system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of a local appointments commission was promulgated by Arthur Griffith for the purpose of filling top level executive posts and with the desire to <Col N="1010" /> remove such appointments from any political interference.  I am sure all Members agree with that procedure.  Subsequently, the Local Appointments Commission were used to consider applicants for posts in the Garda Síochána, the prison service and other sectors in the public service. They have operated well and are held in the highest esteem.  However, they have never been known for the speed of their operations.  For example, after the acting city manager of Cork was appointed manager of the Limerick City authority it took 15 months for the commission to appoint a full time replacement.  What was the cause of that delay?  There are many other examples in the public sector particularly in the appointment of town clerks on urban councils, commissions and so forth.  I would like to cite the example of a composite advertisement for, say, a town clerk in places as diverse as Kinsale, Bundoran, Wicklow and Navan.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Turf Development Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was discussing the need for us in Government and in politics to take into account the social impact of management proposals to convert Bord na Móna production operations from a direct labour PECO system to a contract HAKU system.  It should be remembered that the overriding reason for seeking full blown implementation of this system over a relatively short five year period is to deal with the £166 million debt that the company face at the moment, and one cannot minimise the size of that challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that 70 per cent of the total cost of production relates to wages and salaries, and overheads related to wages and salaries.  The reduction of the workforce by 1,200 should be of assistance in bringing costs into line, so that even as we stand at the moment the option of a direct labour HAKU system <Col N="1011" /> should not be totally discounted.  It is crucial to have a good season in 1989 and 90 per cent of the production will be acquired by the well established direct labour PECO system which has operated in Bord na Móna for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>To look at the short-term for a moment, streamlining of that system is of vital importance.  The trade union movement accepts that rationalisation is necessary. Fairly fruitful talks have taken place so far and this will mean that the streamlining of this system will be very considerable in this coming year.  The demarcation and controls of restrictive practices, some of which have been negotiated between management and unions and some of which have been imposed by management themselves, will be looked at very critically in an effort to ensure that the cost handicaps which are inherent in all those systems which have grown up in Bord na Móna's operations in the past ten or 15 years will be eliminated so that efficiency production, and reward for efficiency and production, will become the central feature of the PECO system's operations in the coming year and for whatever time the PECO system will be part of Bord na Móna's operations while the conversion is taking place.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made at the end of the day that it is only by negotiated agreement to establish procedures with the trade union movement that the sort of morale that is necessary will be created to bring about the sort of response that is required from the workforce to lift the board out of the serious difficulties they now find themselves in.  I am glad that substantive negotiations are taking place. It is unfortunate that we have had to wait until so close to the beginning of the production season for those discussions to get started.  It is only in an atmosphere of co-operation and good faith that we will see the sort of changes that are necessary which do not constitute simply postponing the evil day but which address the real problems in the board.  The primary responsibility for resolving the problems <Col N="1012" /> at the end of the day rests with the management and unions within the board itself.</P>
    <P>I have focused my attention specifically on County Offaly, even though other counties in the midlands and the west depend on Bord na Móna for part of their economic infrastructure.  It is clear that County Offaly depends to a far greater extent on Bord na Móna operations than any other part of the country.  In trying to change the role of the semi-State company in our midlands economy it is important to realise that the proposed conversion to the HAKU system on a contract basis rolls back Bord na Móna's operations to a point where ultimately they are not involved in the primary production of peat at all.  It is interesting to look at the long title of the 1946 Act which was set up to replace the old Turf Development Board.  It was:</P>
    <P>An Act to make better provision for the development, in the national interest, of the production, distribution and supply of turf in the State, and for this purpose to establish a board to be called Bord na Móna,....</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that it was set up for the production and supply of turf.  The contract HAKU system takes Bord na Móna out of the production of turf and they become a purchasing agent from contractors and they then market the raw material through meeting contractual obligations with the ESB power stations, or subsequently manufacturng briquettes or horticultural peat which would be a different operation.  This is not simply a radical change in their operations, it is a revolutionary change.  We have to tread very carefully to see to what extent and how quickly such revolutionary change can take place.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, it is important to realise also that Bord na Móna supplemented the economic infrastructure of Offaly.  Offaly has not been totally dependent on Bord na Móna; some manufacturing industry does exist there, thankfully.  However, historically, the industrial base of the county was in traditional products.  It is unfortunate to note <Col N="1013" /> that between 1973 and 1986 there was a drop of 400 in the number of people working in manufacturing industry compared to a net gain in the midland region in the same period of 4,600.  Therefore we see that the reduction in jobs in Bord na Móna cannot be taken in isolation when we try to assess the impact it will have on the local economy.  It is simply part of a retrogressive trend which has been there since the eighties and the seventies.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that in a way the decision makers, the policy shapers of our national economy, by-passed Offaly in terms of industrial expansion on the basis that we had two mainstay industries &mdash; Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Now that the time has come when a whole new apparatus is to be established for the exploitation of this natural resource there is quite clearly a great need for an alternative regional strategy to ensure that the area gets not just the percentage of job creation in the industrial sector that is its due but even more than that to make up for the serious depletion in the workforce that is envisaged and that has already occurred in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The IDA Developmental and Financial Policy 1988-1990 put forward a proposal that there would be job creation of 37,000 in the industrial sector in that period.  On a population basis Offaly would expect 600 of those jobs, in the event of a <i>status quo</i> in the mainstay industries to which I have referred.  It is quite clear that having lost 700 jobs with the voluntary redundancy programme, seasonal workers who have gained employment traditionally in Bord na Móna during the production season will also be affected by the contract HAKU system.  There is need for a rethink on the regional strategy that applies to the midlands and I can speak specifically about County Offaly.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Energy has a very real commitment to that area.  He understands how serious the position is. It will not be strictly within the remit of the Department of Energy to deal with <Col N="1014" /> these problems but all the agencies concerned and all the Government Departments should co-ordinate in putting forward proposals that will meet the present needs.  If the board can, on their own or through joint ventures with other parties who could provide some capital or technical expertise, develop and market new products commercially, the establishment of new industries would have to be in the same regions in which the depletion is now taking place.  Therefore County Offaly should get a very high priority because that county is the main source of the raw material.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation is necessary.  An effort will be made to take personal political advantage of the changes that are taking place but clearly, those who seek to take it will have to come up with an alternative to deal with the specific problems. There is no point in talking about the <i>status quo.</i> If we are interested in the long-term viability of this company, if we are serious about them continuing to play an important part in the economy of the midlands and if we are really committed to a semi-State body being involved in the exploitation of this natural resource, that change has to take place.  What we have to do is harness that change and the social change in particular so that the sort of economic dislocation that might result will not simply apply to one region as against all others.</P>
    <P>This is the challenge that faces the Minister and the board of management and workforce of Bord Na Móna.  As has been demonstrated in the past, this company can once again be a flagship of the semi-State sector.  Ideologies and sacred cows must be left outside the doors of the negotiating rooms, and commonsense and a real commitment to the development of this industry will be required.  I am confident that when the major decisions are to be taken the one party who have been committed to this semi-State body since its inception, the party who had the vision to set it up in the first place as opposed to a then Opposition party who regarded it as a white elephant in the red bogs of Ireland, will ensure that the socio-economic role <Col N="1015" /> of this company in the midlands region will increase and diversify.  We will face the problems and put forward a plan for the future that will work.  A job replacement strategy is needed in harness with the job reduction policy that we have seen so far and this Government, through their economic policies can bring about those conditions and the jobs that are so badly needed by the people whom I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I would like to welcome any positive proposal relating to any State or semi-State company at present, particularly in the run-up to 1992, the single market and all it entails and the great opportunities that are contained therein for all Irish companies, particularly Bord Na Móna.  I would also like to pay tribute to the board for their activities in the past, the manner in which they conducted their business, provided fuel and gave employment, admittedly quite an amount of which was seasonal employment but which was the lifeblood of many parts of the country, particularly the midlands.  Like the last speaker who referred to his own constituency of Laois-Offaly, I would have to, like other speakers, draw attention to Kildare which has a particular interest in Bord Na Móna and all related thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the board had considerable success down through the years their entire story was not successful.  I would hope that this Bill and all it proposes, and the board's new proposals are successful and that the projections and foresight that are necessary to achieve the right outcome are employed.  I hope we do not see a repetition of some of the nuisances we saw in the past.  I can recall not so many years ago, and my colleagues from the Kildare constituency can do likewise, Bord Na Móna being in a position to sell their peat products to a firm that were engaged in manufacturing another byproduct but they did not see fit at the time to accommodate that company. Eventually the small company, Irish Ceca Limited in Allenwood, were forced into liquidation.  Ironically, the board propose <Col N="1016" /> now, a few years later to manufacture the same product.  I hope we do not see too much repetition of that kind of tactic particularly in the new slimmed-down, energetic, vigorous version of the board which is about to emerge under this new structure.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to refer to in passing is a brochure from Bord na Móna entitled &ldquo;Entrepreneuring the Midlands&rdquo;.  It came with an invitation to a seminar in the Montague Hotel, Portlaoise. The foreword by the managing director states that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been tremendously successful and that it has succeeded in regulating Irish interest rates, Irish inflation rates and Irish wage rates. While I congratulate the captains of industry, and particularly those in the State sector, and accept that they should row in and enunciate Government policy whenever possible, I would like to see a little more accuracy than what is contained in that phrase.  While on the one hand in recent times certain claims can be made that a new era has dawned, which started roughly about two years ago, I would like to remind those &mdash; and I hope there will be a correction at some stage in the future &mdash; that the recovery started some considerable time before the inception of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I would like to place on record my surprise that that kind of propaganda should be contained in a document of that nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to revert back to the board's activities over the past couple of years.  I fully support and congratulate them on their proposals in relation to the export markets they have created over the past few years and those which they propose to create and, in particular, the new and diversifying industries which they have brought under their wing and where they propose to create further employment.  Diversification is extremely important so far as the peat industry is concerned and particularly with the coming of the post-peat era.  That is particularly important to those of us who live in constituencies where there is a great dependency on the activities of <Col N="1017" /> Bord na Móna.  Diversification is to be welcomed provided it does not extend into areas whereby it would put other smaller and competing industries at risk. While, on the one hand, I welcome the aggressive nature and the new slimmed-down version of the board, on the other hand we do not want to see the demise of, perhaps, some smaller associated industries.  I sincerely hope that does not happen and that it will not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The horticultural industry is an area in which the board has taken a particular interest, and rightly so.  It is in relation to that area that I would like to congratulate those involved.  They have done tremendous work and research and have sought out markets of great importance both at home and abroad and particularly on the Continent.  That is something on which they are to be congratulated and also in the area where they have produced peat products that have helped in the control of pollution.  There will be an ongoing demand for products of that nature.  It is not as if they are producing something which is likely to become obsolete in a couple of years time.  Because of the emphasis on the need to protect the environment and so on at present, obviously they are on the right track and I hope they will continue.</P>
    <P>The one thing that worries me about the new board is the hype that goes with it.  When I refer to the new board, I mean the new look board.  A certain amount of hype goes with it.  I accept there is bound to be a certain amount of jubilation at a relaunch but cloaked within that hype is a certain amount of undesirable job shedding that will have a severe impact on the economies within which the board has located its activites.  In counties such as Kildare and the adjoining counties, the dependency on the employment given by the board is such that unless the new proposals are very successful &mdash; at least as successful as anticipated at present in terms of employment and downstream employment &mdash; then a serious problem can arise over the next couple of years but it will not at that stage be possible or be of any benefit to people to look <Col N="1018" /> backward and say: &ldquo;Why did we do that or why did we not do something else&rdquo;. At that stage it will be far too late because events will have caught up with us and we may be attempting to close the door when the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Cowen, made reference to an area which is particularly important and which I want to deal with, however briefly.  That is the section in this Bill whereby when Bord na Móna have ceased to utilise a particular bogland or peat area first preference is given to Coillte Teoranta before anything else can be done with it.  Two or three problems arise immediately.  First of all, Bord na Móna can by the condition in which they leave the post-peat bogland predetermine the uses, or the lack of uses, to which the land can then be put to afterwards by cutting to a certain depth or by not cutting to a certain depth.</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand the theory that Coillte Teoranta should have the final say in deciding what happens to the boglands afterwards.  There is no possible way that could or should be accepted and I strongly urge the Minister to consider that section and introduce amendments which would allow for discussions to take place, if necessary, with local authorities, Teagasc, Bord Fáilte and/or farming and other local bodies which would continue to have an interest in the post-peat uses of this type of bogland.  For instance, in the constituency of Kildare the people in Teagasc, in the person of an executive, Mr. Andy Cole, produced a very extensive plan some considerable time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous to be talking about coal when the Deputy is referring to turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens to be a public document which gave the post peat uses of the land in question and has been <Col N="1019" /> referred to in this House on numerous occasions in the past.  The reason I mention that document is because it went to great length to point out the alternative uses to which the peatland could be put. It pointed out that there was a possibility for the production of grass or grassland, and ultimately beef production.  There was provision for amenities for the flooding of a lakeland area and there was provision also for forestry.  The difference there was that there were a number of options; there were options for everybody and those options would be available through consultation.  Under the proposal as suggested in this Bill, only one particular body, or at the very most two, Bord na Móna, and on the other side of the diagram Coillte Teoranta, would decide between them to what uses that bogland would be put.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Bord Fáilte still have a number of proposals which are extremely useful from the point of developing the tourism industry in the midland areas, all of which incorporate the use or partial use of the cutaway bogs.  The local authorities, Kildare County Council, and I am sure the adjoining county councils have their own proposals for the development of alternative uses of cutaway boglands. The various trades councils in the various constituencies and counties have their own proposals as have the farming bodies.  There should be some means of consulting with those bodies before anyone makes a final decision on how those cutaway boglands will be developed.  That is an important and crucial element in the success of the likely end product as a result of the passing of this legislation</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister to refer in particular to that section &mdash; which I recall from memory as section 7 &mdash; whereby Coillte Teoranta have the sole prerogative of getting first option on the post-peat development of boglands.  I do not accept that they should have this privilege as there are many other agencies that have a useful input to make. <Col N="1020" /> This should be taken into consideration first and only then should a decision be made.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while on the subject, I think there is considerable scope at present to develop tourism and amenity facilities.  I know this is incorporated in the Bill but as Deputy Power on the opposite side of the House and I have repeatedly pointed out to the board, even under present structures it is possible to develop amenities and incorporate them with the peat extraction activities.  There is no reason that this cannot work hand in hand.  For instance, if it is possible to bring coachloads of tourists around the Daimler Benz plant in Stuttgart in Germany I do not see any reason that we cannot bring train loads of tourists around our partially deserted boglands throughout the midlands or other parts of the country.  This would be a simple operation as there is already in existence a rail link to virtually all of our boglands which could easily be utilised, inter-linking it with its current use in the area of peat production.  One could be complementary to the other.  We could attract people into the area.  As well as generating interest in the bogland this would also generate interest in old steam engines and the use of the old railway lines.  There is a whole host of areas that could be easily developed if we made the attempt to do so.  I cannot accept any suggestion that Coillte Teóranta should have first option on the use of this land as naturally they would use it for forestry.  This is only one option, there are others which should not be excluded just to suit their objectives.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said I had hoped that the development of the board as we see it will not result in creating competition against smaller industries which could ultimately go to the wall.  I mention that for very good reasons.  With the increasing competition that is likely to take place when the internal market is completed I think we are going to have an increased level of activity in all companies, and rightly so, but this should not be to the detriment of the long established indigenous industries which gave constant <Col N="1021" /> employment over a long number of years. We need to be careful that we do not create problems in that area.</P>
    <P>I, too, would like to refer to the dependency of Bord na Móna on the ESB. Over the past number of years there has been great concern about smog, pollution, and its effects, and it should be pointed out that while peat is not entirely pollution free it is somewhat better than other fuels in this respect but not as good as gas.  Nonetheless, a few short years ago peat represented a very useful alternative during the oil crisis and we were very lucky to be able to fall back on this resource and utilise it to the extent that we did.  At that time, the then Minister decided to link the price of peat products to those of other fuels.  This was a useful development from the board's point of view in that they were able to sell their products for a higher cost which was very useful in terms of revenue.  The purpose of that measure was to allow the board to develop their activities.  However, I am not so sure they were developed as much as one would have liked.  I recall that this price increase took place in mid-1982 and while I agree it was a wise decision at the time, I do not accept that the real reason for which the increase was granted was ever justified by the board in terms of expanding and developing their activities.  They are doing so now but this is some considerable time later. They could have shown a little more concern at that time for the consumer.</P>
    <P>When we referred to the use of post peat boglands, we mentioned forestry, tourism, grassland and other amenities. The amenities are legion, and just would not involve guided tours through a vast bog but also the development of picnicing and fishing areas, water sport facilities and so on, all of which are useful, particularly at a time when there is such demand for amenities.  In areas close to large centres of population it is essential that such areas be developed.  What better time to do so than when Bord na Móna are likely to cease their activities and hand over the bog for other uses? We then have to ask how this can be fully developed, whether it be developed by <Col N="1022" /> the board, for which there is provision in the Bill or whether it ought to be developed in conjunction with other agencies.  I would prefer to see the facilities developed in conjunction with other agencies such as the local authorities and various other bodies such as Teagasc and Bord Fáilte.  I am quite sure it would not be impossible to come up with a board of management drawn from the agencies to supervise such activities, meet the requirements and satisfy the entire community. If there is one topic that generates a great deal of heat, it is the use to which bogland should be put to.  It almost generates as much heat as the question of use of our rivers and lakes. For that reason it is imperative that the Minister considers carefully the uses of this land rather than allowing its use to be determined by one or two sectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill will require the board to acquire other companies at home and abroad.  This is to be welcomed as progressive in the type of activity that we desire in the run-up to 1992 and thereafter. I hope that the company will be in a position to compete aggressively particularly on the foreign markets because after all we depend a great deal on what happens outside our economy.  For that reason, the companies we launch on the European and world markets will determine the level of employment whether at home or abroad.  If they do their job well they will be rewarded and the economy will benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>The new system of funding through the European Structural Funds presents interesting prospects, namely, the integrated development programme and those now being prepared by Government. While I do not agree with the manner in which the ground work is being laid, nevertheless if they are successful, and I hope they will be, that is an avenue that should not be overlooked when we consider the alternative uses of bogland. That avenue will be appreciated in Europe because Europe is amenity conscious and aware of the need to conserve boglands and other natural amenities. Whatever is done now should be done in <Col N="1023" /> the knowledge that funding will be available for the further development of activities in the boglands, provided we put down the proper framework.</P>

      <P>If the option is that we give it to the agency which is the biggest and the most anxious to get hold of it, I will not accept that.  We should do our best to ensure that a system is devised whereby the best possible use of land is achieved.  That would incorporate a variety of uses.  If there is an attempt to steamroll a single use through some parts of the constituency of Kildare it will not get easy passage, as all the voluntary agencies with whom I have discussed this have clearly indicated their total opposition to handing over the use of post-peat boglands to any one agency.  I appreciate the Minister's wish to make a clean sweep and transfer the property to a particular agency, but I reject it as quickly.</P>

      <P>What I object to is that it has become the prerogative of Coillte Teoranta and of Bord na Móna to decide on the uses to which post-peat bogland is <Col N="1024" /> put.  Bord na Móna can predetermine the use by cutting to a particular depth and Coillte Teoranta can say to any other agency and to Bord na Móna that they have a project in mind some time in the future without specifying when, and that they have the land earmarked.  That means that all other agencies with useful proposals for the development of those areas are immediately told to keep their hands off.  That is not acceptable.  I cannot overemphasise my total opposition to the proposal to give that prerogative to Coillte Teoranta.</P>
      <P>If we are to set up a new board which I hope will be benign to all of us in County Kildare, and with the due respect to my colleagues in adjoining counties, the headquarters for the new aggressive marketing board should be in the Kildare section of the Bog of Allen.</P>

      <P>They say that Fionn McCumhaill is buried there somewhere. I pay tribute to Bord na Móna for the development of the peat processing machinery that the board pioneered over the years and I hope that that development will continue.  Boglands will not remain forever and there will be serious consequences in certain areas when some bogs are cut away.  The important thing is to remember that there are alternative uses, labour intensive alternatives, to take their place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Coillte Teoranta, I accept that forestry is desirable.  A reasonable mix of forestry, grass land and amenity would be ideal.  If we have that mix the best possible use of land will be achieved and we will create further jobs.  Jobs, it is generally accepted, arise from the provision of recreational and amenity facilities.  If we are serious about job creation we have to think about amenities <Col N="1025" /> in the context of this Bill.  We must think about amenities such as the Bog of Allen which is within an hours drive of the capital city.  We should not overlook that.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposals of the Minister are achieved during the next number of years.  I hope that what I and other Members envisage in terms of the after use of boglands and in terms of the provision of jobs through a variety of uses will be achieved.  I hope that variety becomes the spice of life and that as a result we will be able to use to the best of our ability the natural amenities that are there for us to enjoy and that they will be further developed thus creating more jobs in the years ahead.  If we do not use our boglands judiciously a great opportunity will be missed and we will decry the missed opportunity just as we now decry the closure of sections of canals which were closed years ago. Years afterwards we look back and say &ldquo;in God's name, why did we ever do that?&rdquo; When there is a natural amenity there we should not overlook the opportunity of developing it.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of the Turf Development Bill is good because it will give a new lease of life to Bord na Móna. Morale in the company has been very low &mdash; there have been many redundancies, there was no great sign of expansion and workers were very unsure of their futures.  Many employees wondered if there was any future for Bord na Móna and whether they should get out now.  I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It is a breath of fresh air, a midland breeze perfumed by the heathers, as the song says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill can only be helpful to the future of Bord na Móna.  I do not mean that as a criticism of the old Bord na Móna or their predecessor in the forties, the Turf Development Board.  I should like to pay tribute to the hardy pioneers of Bord na Móna who cut the first drains in our bogs and worked hard to make a success of a far sighted enterprise.  They filled our fuel needs when we had no other fuel and they brought prosperity to the midlands.  They were the people who <Col N="1026" /> changed the term &ldquo;bogman&rdquo; from meaning Yeti or Abominable Snowman to a term of endearment which we now associate with the haunting music of the Marino Waltz.</P>
    <P>Many of the early Bord na Móna workers have retired, were made redundant or have gone to their eternal reward. I want to pay tribute to them for their toil and effort.  They built the railways, mechanised turf production and their engineering expertise designed and produced the type of machine best suited to our terrain.  They branched out into the production of turf briquettes and machine won turf, peat moss, horticulture and agriculture and they even undertook pilot schemes despite the restrictions which were placed on them under the old Act.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the Bord na Móna pensioners and praise them for the great work they did, I am tempted to say that talk is cheap because the Bord na Móna pensioners who retired before July 1984 have not got any increase in their pension for the past four and a half years.  I believe a committee are considering this issue and it is high time that injustice was remedied. I ask the Minister to convey our wishes to the chairman of the committee. We should not wait for all the pensioners to pass on to their eternal reward before a decision is taken to increase their pension. Too many medals are presented posthumously and it would be nice if an increase in their pensions was granted while they are still alive.</P>
    <P>This Bill places many restrictions on the board because of the provision to refer back to the Minister.  The phrase &ldquo;Subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; appears far too often in the Bill.  Because Bord na Móna have proved that they are capable of carrying out their core business &mdash; the production of turf and peat moss in whatever form, and marketing it at home and abroad&mdash;we should let them continue to do this.  I understand why some check has to be kept on the company if they engage in activities which are not strictly related to peat or if they engage in new ventures.  I must ask <Col N="1027" /> a question in this respect: will the sub-boards be constituted without any managerial staff?  The existing company have six worker board members and one in management.  Will these members be represented on the new board?</P>
    <P>I know the company can operate abroad and I believe there have been inquiries, even from the USA, about availing of the expertise of the company. We may have to go to Finland to find out how best to produce turf but the Americans still come back to us for the know-how: they return to the old sod to find out about peat.  I see wonderful opportunities for expanding our peat moss exports and giving them greater added-value on the Continent.  Some years ago I attended a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg.  When we visited a nursery I was delighted to see a green bag with a shamrock on it.  Bord na Móna's new acquisition in France is a welcome venture.  It is well intended, it will bring benefits to the country and will enable us to expand in what is a very large and lucrative market.  We have a good product in peat moss and it is needed all over the Continent.  Up to now this product was not marketed to the extent that it should have been and we should now expand the market to hold on to our customers and to keep them happy.  It is said that a rolling stone gathers no moss, but I expect the moss now being exported to France gathers a lot of French francs for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that Bord na Móna are toying with the idea of going back into the production of carbon.  That may be a more lucrative venture for Bord na Móna because they will have control over their costs and production.  I hope the private producers of peat moss will not be eased out of the market as a result of this Bill and the new management in Bord na Móna.  Today big ventures in, for example, the bakery trade are in a position to squeeze out the small man. Some of the people I know involved in the production of peat moss have made a success of their business, and it is good that there is no monopoly in that sector. <Col N="1028" /> Perhaps Bord na Móna could privatise to the extent of building roads because roads will be needed into new forests. Roads have never been so badly wanted &mdash; there have never been so many potholes in &ldquo;The Old Bog Road&rdquo;&mdash; and I believe Bord na Móna would be prepared to accept such a challenge.  They have the expertise to undertake this task; they have built railways and I see no reason why they should not build roads.</P>
    <P>I compliment Bord na Móna for acting as agents in the grant scheme for private turf production.  As a result of their efforts co-ops have been set up all over the country and communities have become involved in turf production again.  This is particularly laudable because Bord na Móna were cutting a stick to beat themselves &mdash; they were helping private producers to produce turf and these people would no longer be Bord na Móna customers.  They did their work well.  I would like to see that scheme continued because there is still a lot of work for them to do in this area.  I believe the scheme is being phased out but I should like the grant system which was established, executed and implemented by Bord na Móna to be continued.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of setting up a new process to eradicate effluent from sewage systems and it has been proved that peat moss can be used as an agent in the eradication of effluent.  Bord na Móna are developing this process in conjunction with Wavin Ireland.  I realise it is early days yet to declare this process a complete success, but all the early reports have been very good.  Kildare County Council have set up a scheme in Donore. Up to now this scheme has proved very successful and this could well be the answer to difficulties in relation to septic tanks in areas where there is a very high water table.  It even opens up possibilities for sites which could not have been used for housing purposes before.  Above all, it will have a revolutionary influence in the anti-pollution drive.  I hope that farmers will avail of this process to cure silage effluent problems.  This new use of peat now being pioneered could eventually be the chief agent in clearing up our rivers <Col N="1029" /> and watercourses and I have high hopes for the success of that process.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, experimental horticulture work has been carried out in Lullymore for many years. This work has been quite successful but there have been some drawbacks because there can be pockets of frost in midland areas which are not in areas nearer the coast.  Because of this experimental work nurseries have sprung up all over County Kildare which are fit to take their place with any other nurseries.  Groups of nurseries are forming co-operatives and are growing in bulk to fill big orders.  These nurseries put on shows every year.  In 1987 the venue for the show was SAP; in 1988 the venue was Dunne Brothers in Allen and next year &mdash; and I hope the Minister will find time to attend &mdash; the shows will be held in Kilcock.  Incidentally, a nursery man in Kilcock won the first prize for a garden layout at the international show in Scotland last year. This proves that there are canny people in Kilcock as well as in Scotland and is a measure of the expertise and competence in this area.</P>
    <P>Apparently up to now Bord na Móna could not be commercially orientated or involved in marketing, but this Bill will give them the go ahead in this area and will open up great possibilities for them. They will be in a position to give initial training and guidance.  The nursery in Lullymore has proved to be the nursery of nurseries, the <i>crème de la crème,</i> as it were.  Nine or ten years ago there were moves to discontinue that nursery, but I am glad that did not happen.  Thanks for its not happening can go to our party. Beside Lullymore we have Teagasc, formerly An Foras Talúntais, and the Peat Interpretation Centre.  These institutions have carried out extensive research and experimentation on all types of bog.  This paved the way, laid down the guidelines and charted the pitfalls for the future of our cutaway bogland.</P>
    <P>This year those of us who attended the seminar and workshops in the RDS on the subject were fortunate enough to see on our field trip, the successful growing of vegetable crops, carrots, onions and <Col N="1030" /> potatoes and even grass for the laying of instant lawns, playing pitches, golf greens and so on.  We saw excellent pasture on cutover bogland and a wonderfully viable farm with a suckling herd, run by Bord na Móna in Offaly.  On that day we also saw unusual crops that could be grown on acid soil, such as blueberries which found their way into the most prestigious supermarkets in England and were widely acclaimed.</P>
    <P>The upshot of this four day workshop on the utilisation of midland peatlands was a decision in favour of a divergence of uses to which bogland can be put. Forestry would rank high here.  There was a strong case for the preservation of certain types of bog, like a particular bog in Clara, County Offaly, various types of bog in County Kildare, Lullymore and the Robertstown area.  There was mention that the amenity area in Robertstown could be flooded to provide lake-lands, water sports and sailing.  Tourism was mentioned, too.  Farming on marginal land was widely discussed with the possibilities of making small farms more viable.  This is something to which much thought should be given.</P>
    <P>We should think of how best to use all the land.  Our Minister has a particular interest in this.  Some years ago he was widely responsible for forming party policy in this regard.  I have faith in him. Bord na Móna have only a small portion of the bogs of Ireland.  Most of the bogs are in private hands and much of the bogland is non-productive.  We should view the future of our bogs globally as a big unit.  There is now no such thing as the Land Commission they are not dead, but sleepeth.  We need a body to take overall responsibility for restructuring and making small farms at the edge of the bog and marginal holdings viable. This is all right if there is a dry lie on the home farm.  Extra pasture might be obtained and possibly some hay or silage would make a huge difference to these farms.</P>
    <P>We should embark on a policy of leasing land to prospective young farmers for some years.  In the Land Commission days, farmers were given land willy nilly <Col N="1031" /> and some of them did not prove that they deserved it.  A leasing system would enable us to segregate the sheep from the goats before outright ownership was given.  An overall body would be needed to manage drainage.  It would be possible to carry this out on a phased basis.  It is not such an insuperable job to deal with 100 hectares in a year, the acreage that Bord na Móna would have, and a bit of private bog that might be restructured, also.</P>
    <P>With regard to horticulture, there is a need at this stage of the experimental work done in Lullymore for a pilot scheme on a commercial scale.  We can thank Bord na Móna and Teagasc for providing an area for a pilot scheme at Lullymore.  A very large firm with marketing expertise are prepared to embark on growing vegetables and training young people &mdash; giving them an insight into what is needed and a knowledge of the pitfalls to avoid.  I hope this might lead to private growers in the Carbury area, as happened in the Kildare area with mushroom growing.  There is a central marketing system, with storage, a co-operative and guaranteed prices.  There are private individuals growing mushrooms in tunnels.  I hope the same thing might happen with regard to vegetable growing because that type of thinking will create jobs in areas which would otherwise be derelict when Bord Na Móna and the ESB pull out.</P>
    <P>My interest in this subject is not new. I expressed it ten years ago when for a short time I was a Member of the European Parliament.  I saw EC funding being given &mdash; for worn out coalmines in Germany and Britain to produce a fuel that was available on the Continent.  I made a case for our virgin bogs, cutover bogs and blanket bogs.  The interpreters thought I had engaged in fantasy and they were not sure of the translation of virgin bogs.  When grants can be got for the slag heaps in Wales or worn out mines in Germany, we can make a case for EC funding for what should replace the cutover bogs.  This would provide jobs in the <Col N="1032" /> area of restructuring.  I hope we get a grant for this.</P>
    <P>Before the ESB and Bord na Móna pull out &mdash; in Allenwood there is mention of the year 1991 as a definite year for closure and they have already departed from areas in County Offaly &mdash; it is the duty of the IDA to show the will to set up industry there.  This is a very serious problem.  We have talked about it for ten years and I have not seen any sign of action as yet.</P>
    <P>The growing of vegetables should not be dismissed lightly.  There is a feeling in this country that because Erin Foods was a failure vegetables cannot be grown here or marketed.  That is wrong.  I have my own ideas as to what happened in the case of Erin Foods, but we have proved that we can grow vegetables to the extent that we can provide a canning industry, at least enough for our own needs.</P>
    <P>We also have the mechanical and technical expertise in Bord na Móna, technicians, mechanics and electricians, to form the nucleus of employment for heavy industry.  That must be utilised in the midlands.  It is better that these technically qualified people would use their expertise in the midlands than in Manchester or Manhatten, and that is what I hope will happen.  All these items I have mentioned could knit nicely into an integrated rural development programme with each divergent use of the land complementing the other.  This would provide us with a pleasant landscape that would be conducive to tourism, agribusiness, afforestation, waterways, farming, horticulture and, above all, jobs for the next generation at home.</P>
    <P>Taking all that into account I am amazed and saddened at the reply Minister Burke gave on 20 October, at columns 456 and 457 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Mr. Durkan asked the Minister for Energy if he has made any definite decisions regarding the alternative uses of cutaway bogs, with particular reference to County Kildare; if his attention has been drawn to proposals made by Teagasc at Lullymore, County <Col N="1033" /> Kildare, in the matter; if he foresees the inclusion of the development of cutaway bogs within the ambit of integrated rural development programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke): The Government, in July 1987, decided that cutaway bogs in Bord na Móna hands which are suitable for afforestation should transfer to the Forest Service.  Some 1,000 hectares of cutaway bogs transferred to the Forest Service in 1987 have already been planted.  Negotiations are in progress for the transfer of further areas and these will also be planted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware that experiments are being conducted by Teagasc and Bord na Móna in County Kildare and elsewhere in relation to grassland and horticultural uses for cutaway bogs.  The results achieved to date would not support any reversal of the basic decision taken by the Government, bearing in mind, in particular, the state of Bord na Móna's finances and its inability to endure any expansion of its loss-making activities.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised at that reply because the results do not bear it out. All our efforts have been in vain if that thinking prevails in the Department of Energy.  It is ironic that Minister Burke has now gone, but I have every confidence in Deputy Smith as Minister for Energy. I know him well.  The case was made by experts at the RDS and bodies representing various interests at the seminar were prepared to give co-existence a chance.  The Bill however, contains a provision which would madden me.  Where Bord na Móna have 1,000 hectares of cutaway bog, they are required to tell the Department of Forestry each year in advance what will be available.  If they want the lot they can take it; if any crumbs are left, other interests are welcome to take them.  This has obviously been dictated by the Civil Service and I am glad the Minister is prepared to <Col N="1034" /> amend it.  The Forestry people attended the RDS and were very critical of anybody who questioned their claims. Instead of making their case in the presence of us all, they wrote to us later.  I have no doubt that much of the cutaway bog should be planted but not all, as was intended, according to the Minister's reply.  If that attitude prevailed there would be no properly planned amenity scheme and very few jobs would be left after planting of the trees.  We cannot wait until the year 2010 for these jobs.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made at the RDS were, first, that irreplacable virgin peatlands must be preserved, the extent of representative examples being in the order of 10,000 hectares.  The second recommendation was that there should be an overall authority to determine the future of the midland peatlands, based on the region, and with direct access to Brussels.  The third recommendation was that an area of viable size and peat depth should be set aside to determine the potential for commercial vegetable production over peatlands.  Lullymore would be a suitable site.  The fourth recommendation drew attention to the need for the development of the amenity potential of the midland peatlands, to include interpretative centres.  In this context the implementation of the Robertstown plan should proceed as a pilot scheme.  The fifth recommendation was that the future use of cutover peatlands should be determined on the basis of a regional cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great interest in this subject and has adopted a sensible approach to these suggestions.  He is a practical farmer who has a thorough knowledge of his brief.  I know he will ensure that the Bill will allow for all interests to be accommodated in our bogs.  Forestry should perhaps take up 50 per cent, but that would allow room for many other activities.  The midlands will be grateful to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have a dream for my county.  I have worked in the bog for the past 40 years and my family still cut their own fuel. Although I am unlikely to see that dream <Col N="1035" /> realised, I hope my children and my friends will.  I want to see an amárach for the midland peatlands, with thriving happy communities who can live and work there.  There is a saying that sometimes one cannot see the wood for the trees.  I want the Minister to understand what would happen if we had nothing but trees.  He has shown perception and consideration in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the main there is a welcome for this Bill among Bord na Móna employees and others, but there is concern too, which I have raised in a constructive manner.  My motives are reasonably pure.  I do not seek to perpetuate my position in politics as some might do, as they seek to preserve their position in ailing companies or outdated Departments.  I want to see happy, healthy families continuing to live and work in the quiet midlands.  For those of us who live there, the lines of the Rathangan poet, William A. Byrne, could never have been more relevant than some months ago when we endured smog in this Chamber and throughout the capital city.  He wrote:</P>
    <P>The purple heather is the cloak</P>
    <P>God gave the bogland brown,</P>
    <P>But man has made a pall of smoke,</P>
    <P>To hide the distant town.</P>
    <P>I leave it in the capable hands of the Minister to ensure that a patchwork of different land use will be a future feature of the midlands.  I should not like to see an unbroken green mantle of Sitka spruce.  It might be very patriotic but it would not be very profitable in the short term.  At a time of high unemployment and emigration the provision of jobs must be the priority in our party.  This Bill will copperfasten the remaining jobs in Bord na Móna and give a viable future to the board.  In the slimming down process there has been much early retirement and redundancy.  That might provide short term relief and give a breathing space to the firm and former employees, but we must plan to provide replacement jobs in these areas.  The ideas I have proposed may be helpful and I am confident that <Col N="1036" /> the Minister will act for the best on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noticeable that a number of Deputies from the midlands who have a specific interest in this matter are among the contributors to this debate. We must have regard to the origins and purposes of the 1946 Turf Development Board and the situation which existed before that board came into operation.  I am aware of the tradition of turf use and development, the manual nature of turf extraction and the near slavery-type conditions involved, with children working long hours in very hard conditions, and then the long haul, particularly from my own area, by horse and canal to the Dublin market, with very little return. Despite the very hard labour of these people they lived in the direst poverty. The Turf Development Board, looking at the social needs of the midlands community and knowing it was the most deprived area of the country, took specific action to create real employment where none was before.  They created infrastructures and economic activity. Bord na Móna effectively transformed the midlands from an area of dire poverty to a thriving economic community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am firm in my belief that Bord na Móna is the jewel in the crown of the commercial public sector.  In their research and development and engineering they were world pioneers.  This was the pride of both management and workers.  A grave mistake was made initially with regard to Bord na Móna and that has continued through its history. They were effectively thrown to the wolves and the vultures in the private finance houses.  The State, as shareholder, did not invest with equity.  It simply told Bord na Móna that when they wanted equity they would get a loan and that has been the most crippling aspect of the structure of Bord na Móna since their foundation.  It was a dire mistake which has led over the years to the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds in trading profits being returned to the commercial banks and the finance houses to pay back loans.  If the initial investment had been <Col N="1037" /> made in Bord na Móna this would not have been necessary, the profits would have come back to the board, the State and the people.  That loss is now running at about £20 million per year, a continuing haemorrhage on the activities of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The board have been involved in many areas of production within the turf area, sod peat, milled peat, briquettes, peat moss, nursery products and diversifying into sheep, cattle and vegetables.  There has been a constant trading profit from the activities of Bord na Móna and it should be noted that £20 million per year is at present paid by the employees of Bord na Móna in PAYE and PRSI to the State.  At the same time Bord na Móna are forced to hand over £20 million in interest to the banks and, more recently to the State because of the lack of investment in this fine State industry.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Act, 1980, brought about the ludicrous situation where Bord na Móna were obliged, not alone to directly assist people to come into competition with themselves, but to make grants available from their own resources to their competitors.  If a company in the private sector were told that they would have to fund competitors and make their expertise available to them I wonder where the ideology would come from, the Right or the Left?  It is quite certain that there would be an outcry from the Right against interference in competition and fair play for the private sector.  However, under the 1980 Act, Bord na Móna were forced by the State to make their expertise and money available to create competitors, to make bogland available to them and to show them how to extract the material so that they could compete directly with them.  The effect of that disaster was that four peat sod works closed down, jobs that previously existed were transferred to the black economy area, child labour was reintroduced for the first time in many years in the bogs, there was a high cost to the national economy, a loss of production, a loss of tax and PRSI payable by employees and, because of the ineffectiveness of the schemes, there was a loss <Col N="1038" /> of the essential energy source of turf which was no longer being extracted as it should have been.  I am pleased the Government have phased out this scheme and &mdash; unlike my colleague from Kildare &mdash; I do not shed any tears for it.</P>
    <P>It is true that there were bad seasons because of the weather when the stockpile was reduced but it should be acknowledged that the efforts of the workforce and the management in Bord na Móna have turned events around.  During the bad period when investment was needed the State again gave a crippling loan to add to the already huge burden on the shoulders of Bord na Móna.  It is important that we look at and are aware of the record of reduction of employment within Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In 1984 Bord na Móna had 5,000 full-time employees and 1,000 seasonal workers.  In 1987 that had been reduced by redundancies and other measures to 3,000 full-time employees and 1,000 seasonal workers.  Let it be said that the unions, on behalf of the workers, agreed and reluctantly accepted the need for that trimming in the interest of efficiency and productivity.  It should also be said that most of this reduction from 5,000 to 3,000 full-time workers came about among the general operatives and the technical staff.</P>
    <P>The headquarters of Bord na Móna is referred to by their workers as &ldquo;the palace in Baggot Street&rdquo;.  The reduction of numbers in the palace in Baggot Street was a very small element in the total reductions in the workforce.  The management &mdash; not necessarily the board &mdash; are not satisfied with the agreement they have secured from the unions in regard to trimming the workforce.  There is an unreasonable and near fanatical pursuit of privatisation.  There are plans at present for a reduction of a further 2,000 jobs, leaving Bord na Móna with 1,000 full-time employees.  However, they will not be made redundant in the normal sense.  There is a new trick to get rid of permanent jobs.  New, private companies are to be set up and this has been hailed by the chairman of Bord na Móna as the <Col N="1039" /> ultimate in worker democracy.  I profoundly disagree with the chairman's estimation and I reject the notion that privatisation on the scale proposed is anything near worker democracy or has anything to do with it.  What is proposed is straight, undiluted Thatcherism and has nothing to do with worker democracy.</P>
    <P>It will result in the shedding of permanent, pensionable jobs; it will result in the control going to gombeen men who will be set up &mdash; not out of their own pockets &mdash; but out of the pockets of the taxpayers and those of Bord na Móna workers.  The so-called entrepreneurs will not be financed from private sources but from public funds, a new form of privatisation. The people taking over the public sector will now be funded by the public sector for doing so.  It will result in the scandal of funds being made available from the public sector to finance a new uncontrollable private sector.</P>
    <P>What will be the conditions for the employees under these new gombeen men who will be set up by the State?  I submit that the workers will be back to square one and all the things for which they fought down the years will be gone in one fell swoop.  Will they have pensionable employment with the new contractors? Will they have permanency? Will they be allowed to join a union? What will be their rates of pay?  If the weather is broken will they get wet time pay?  The answers to all these questions are obvious.  They will not have pensions or permanency or be allowed to join a union.  Their rates of pay will be very bad, they will not be paid during wet weather and they will be thrown out if they attempt to protest about it.</P>
    <P>Privatisation will result in workers being driven into the black economy because the rates of pay will be such that they will not be able to survive in the midlands.  Child &mdash; I stress the word &mdash; labour will be reintroduced under these contractors and children will again be taken out of school to work on the bogs to replace men who had previously worked there as permanent pensionable employees in a State company.  This will <Col N="1040" /> not be worker democracy, but a reversion to the bad, sad ways of the past.  The workers, through their union, must fight to retain the rights they have won and for future workers in that company.</P>
    <P>The privatisation we are speaking about is of a new type and goes further than all previous attempts at privatisation I am aware of.  Normally we have seen privatisation of what could be described as the fringe activities of companies with contractors being brought in to do things not part of the core activity.  Under its present chairman Bord na Móna are now attempting for the first time to privatise the core activity of the company, the production of peat.  Under this proposal and previous speakers agree entirely with me on this, Bord na Móna would no longer be involved in the production of peat.  Instead they would be the organisers of gangs of private contractors with no control of the conditions under which they employed people.  Former workers would no longer be employed by Bord na Móna, and workers would be reduced to what has been described as &ldquo;yellow pack seasonals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We got a foretaste in the 1987 pilot scheme of what they call &ldquo;selling on the spread&rdquo;.  I saw young children being taken from school by the people who took these contracts to save turf.  Do we want to reach the position where a charter for the black economy and child labour would be reintroduced in the midlands? That would have nothing to do with worker democracy and anybody who says it would and who says they have a socialist conscience should strictly examine that socialist conscience to clearly show themselves how much they are in error.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about the intentions behind this measure.  I question the need to break up the single board which now exists into a number of separate companies or boards.  This would have the effect of reducing their activities, responsibility and effectiveness.  It would also undermine the strength and cohesion of the commercial State company, Bord na Móna and I am certain it would lead <Col N="1041" /> to the privatistion of the profitable sectors, for example, the peat moss sector, and further premature closures.  I am also certain it would have serious consequences for the economy of the midlands.</P>
    <P>Break up, and I use that word purposely, is incompatible with the broad economic and social objectives of the 1946 Turf Development Act parts of which were quoted by a previous speaker. I ask the Minister why is there a need for the sub-boards we are talking about? Why can the functions of these boards, not be delegated through normal management structures?  Is it not true that, as a result of this proposal, there would be costly bureaucratic exercises with new boards and executives and a new layer of top management positions in Bord na Móna and their new subsidiaries?  At a time of cutbacks in the number of jobs in the area I believe it would lead to serious resentment among workers who would be told that there is no work available for them.</P>
    <P>It is notable that in the Turf Development Bill, 1988 there is a failure to provide any proper financial structure for the board.  As I said earlier, no equity investment has been made in Bord na Móna.  All they have ever received are loans from what can be described as the vultures of the finance houses who take their pound of flesh every day.  This Bill should amend the 1946 Act to allow for the conversion of the Exchequer loan at least, recently given to Bord na Móna, into equity investment and to allow for a further injection of State equity into the company.  Such restructuring is vital for the recovery and future success of Bord na Móna.  This would lead to permanent, well paid jobs and the creation of wealth in the midlands and continued economic activity.  The planned use of the valuable resource we are talking about would only be possible in that way.  Only the State, through Bord na Móna, would be able to undertake this major job and we should not simply leave it, as I said earlier, to the private sector who are incapable of doing this except for taking the fat pieces for their own hungry needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not what it seems, certainly <Col N="1042" /> not all of what is seems.  The intention is, and the effect would be, to divide and weaken.  Some sectors would be fattened up at the expense of workers and taxpayers for handing over to the greedy private sector, a private sector let me stress which would be heavily subsidised for the privilege of taking over the well developed public sector.</P>
    <P>Diversification, as proposed in the Bill, away from purely peat activities would certainly be welcome.  Taking the shackles off the commercial public sector, allowing them to develop and compete, to enter joint ventures and carry out active marketing would also be welcome but I ask what is happening on the ground?  Are Bord na Móna not aware that this Bill is before the House?  Do they not know what is being proposed by the Minister and, if so, why is what is happening on the ground occurring?  Let me give two small examples of what I am talking about.  We are talking about diversification away from the main peat areas, yet the shrub nursery at Lullymore is being sold off to the manager without going to tender, and there is notice of an intention to sell a farm at Clonsast in an extremely productive area without the grants or subsidies which would normally be available to the agricultural sector. What is happening?  Does what we are witnessing in this House amount to shadow-boxing and do Bord na Móna not know what we are doing about it?</P>
    <P>I have very serious doubts and reservations and I would caution the unions and workers to be on their guard as I believe that this Bill would result in their long fought for rights being attacked and undermined and being set at nought.  I await the Minister's reply with interest and, if not satisfied with the Minister's reply, I will be pressing my party to table suitable amendments so as to have the effects of the Bill changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Turf Development Bill, 1988 and I preface my remarks by congratulating Deputy Smith on his appointment to this very important portfolio. I have no doubt he will bring to his <Col N="1043" /> new Department the same capacity for dedication and hard work which was the hallmark of his work while he was junior Minister with responsibility for forestry. It is appropriate and encouraging that his new area of responsibility brings under one umbrella the related enterprises of peat and forestry development.</P>
      <P>I would like to think that the Minister, coming as he does from an adjoining county, in dealing with this important area of national administration will display the good old Irish characteristic of concern for one's neighbour as we in Laois-Offaly are faced with serious difficulties arising from the declining operations of Bord na Móna and the understandable rationalisation programmes necessary to ensure the future of the company.  I do not have to remind the Minister that the resulting job losses undermine in a very serious way the social and economic structure of both our counties. The opening point I want to make is that there is a duty on the Minister and the Government to put in place an alternative economic development programme with the purpose of providing alternative employment and preserving the social structure of a vast area of our country.</P>
      <P>There is a degree of urgency in dealing with that matter because of the time factor involved in getting new projects off the ground, and particularly in forestry development we may not have taken the necessary corrective action in time. However, there is nothing to be gained by looking at the past and we must now move forward in a positive and constructive manner for the purpose of maximising the potential of our bogs &mdash; not only in the national interest but in a particular way for the now devastated midland region &mdash; whether in terms of unharvested peat or of our cutaway bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people look on the midlands as a prosperous agricultural region.  While I agree some excellent agricultural land and some of the most progressive farmers are in the area, the fact remains, particularly as far as Laois-Offaly is concerned, <Col N="1044" /> that all the important economic indicators, such as <i>per capita</i> income and population figures, are that our overall economy is more depressed than in some counties west of the Shannon which enjoy considerable economic support from the Government.  That has been so over the years, yet up to this time we have failed to make any real impact in convincing the Government that we are a seriously disadvantaged area.  For that reason I express here tonight a great deal of confidence in the new Minister.  I recognise him as a practical man.  Coming as he does from a sound agricultural background, he realises the problems of small farmers, particularly in the disadvantaged areas of the midland region. I have the utmost confidence that given time we will be able to tackle the anomalies which have beset that region for such a long time.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a broad and generalised statement in the context of this Bill because of our dependence in the past on an expanding Bord na Móna operation in County Offaly and, I suppose I must admit, to a lesser extent in County Laois, for the purpose of impressing on the Minister the urgency of taking corrective action now.  Perhaps the greatest area of Bord na Móna development so far as the two counties were concerned was centred in County Offaly; nonetheless, many Laois workers travelled daily to many of the Bord na Móna operations in County Offaly and redundancies arising from the operations there had a serious spin off on the economy of County Laois as no doubt they had also on County Offaly.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, it is appropriate that we pay a tribute to Bord na Móna, their workers and management.  Over the years they built and expanded an indigenous industry which provided a valuable fuel resource.  They diversified into added value products in the form of many successful and world recognised horticultural peat products referred to earlier in this debate by my colleague, Deputy Power, and other speakers.  If we are to succeed as we want to succeed nationally in tackling the problem of <Col N="1045" /> unemployment we can achieve that only through maximising the potential of our national resources like peat and other agricultural products in the process of value added.</P>
    <P>Day after day the demands indicate the need for greater efficiency in all areas of economic activity.  I am happy to put on record one example of the board's successful achievement in that area.  I refer to the Coolnamona factory at Portlaoise which is vital to the local economy and is making a very valuable contribution to the overall success of the board's operation particularly in relation to exports which must be the base on which all future expansion takes place. Let me welcome the most recent development in that area, the acquisition of the distribution firm in France for the purpose of promoting peat moss in the French market.  I spoke to the Minister in relation to that matter recently.  I hope that the continuing expansion of Bord na Móna will result in a corresponding increase in employment in that factory. This is important to the economy of County Laois and certainly important to the economy of the town of Portlaoise and all the surrounding towns and villages in that area.  A great tribute must be paid to the management in Coolnamona and the workers involved there because they have made a tremendous impact in generating and creating an efficient operation which is now recognised as part and parcel of the success of the overall Bord na Móna operation.</P>
    <P>I hope sincerely that the Bill before the House will assist the board in expanding their range of activities, particularly employment intensive activities of value added and exports, the only sound basis on which new jobs can be created.  Far too often we were guilty of creating artificial jobs sustained by increased borrowing or increased taxation.  Now we realise that the only jobs that can be sustained at the end of the day are jobs which are regarded as productive and which of their very nature generate further economic activity resulting in further employment. That is the basis on which all worthwhile development should take place, and it is <Col N="1046" /> the hallmark of the present Administration. The successes which have been achieved in the past two years must be regarded as encouraging.  The results being achieved are a direct result of the very positive policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>The free European market of 1992 presents the board with a new challenge and a new opportunity.  We must ensure that they are given a free hand with the least interference in exploring and capitalising on the opportunity that large new market presents to our country.  I am fully satisfied that Bord na Móna have not been aggressive enough in exploring the full potential of the new European market.  This is reflected in the deteriorating financial situation of the board. Of course I recognise that there are marketing and other considerations, including weather conditions, which invariably are reflected in the board's financial accounts.  If the board are to meet the challenges of the future and play their full role in the economic development of this country they will have to apply to their operations sound commercial management criteria which, properly applied, should not conflict with the social requirement of job creation which is of vital importance to the midland region.  Bord na Móna have demonstrated their capacity for diversification.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the provisions of the Bill afford an opportunity for a continuation of these activities particularly in the export market.  It is important that the board be given the opportunity to maximise their operations and profits through an ancillary or related project.  However, such ancillary operations should be engaged in only for the purpose of making their main operation more viable which is the harvesting and processing of peat and such enterprises as will eventually be developed on our cutaway bogs.  Any profits gained from such ancillary operations should be devoted to developing the potential of job creation in the base industry, peat and peat products, entailing the regeneration of employment in areas affected by the board's declining operations in <Col N="1047" /> recent years.  In this respect Clonsast is an excellent example.  To a large extent the economy of the midlands was based on the operations of Bord na Móna in towns such as Portarlington, Tullamore and the smaller villages of the region, some totally dependent on the earnings of their employees.  As a result of diminishing peat resources in Clonsast the ESB generating station at Portarlington has closed with considerable job losses. The closure of that station, with a corresponding loss of jobs on the bog, has had a serious effect on the overall economy of the area.  The Minister, his Department and the Government will have to consider seriously a development strategy for the region, particularly for the Counties of Laois and Offaly, resulting in the creation of new jobs to replace those already lost.  These points have been adequately made by my constituency colleague, Deputy Cowen, who spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>It is also important to the operations and economy of the board that they exploit the potential that will arise from a full, free European market.  In this respect the provisions of section 17 and 20 are somewhat contradictory and restrictive in relation to the freedom of the board to extend their remit beyond the area of their main operations.  The Minister should re-examine these provisions with a view to ensuring that the operations of the board are not inhibited through unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions.  Indeed a hallmark of this Government has been the fact that they have endeavoured to shake off the shackles of unnecessary bureaucracy and administration. Knowing the practical man the Minister is, the board will have nothing to fear from him in that respect.  It is my belief that the board's operations will be approached by him in a constructive and objective manner.  I can assure him that I will be monitoring their operations under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that there is provision for the establishment of sub-boards because delegation of responsibilities by way of good organisational structures is <Col N="1048" /> now an accepted part of good management. However, the provision which excludes employees from being members of such sub-boards somewhat inhibits their potential for development.  It is fair to assume that management would appoint workers with the greatest expertise in their areas to the new sub-boards.  To do otherwise would be a reflection on the overall performance of the board, which must be a priority of management and which I am sure will be kept under close scrutiny by the Minister and his Department. I see nothing wrong with a mix of board employees and outside expertise which would assist in promoting maximum efficiency.  The Minister should re-examine the provision which excludes board employees from the proposed new sub-boards.</P>
    <P>The section which will generate the greatest interest will be that dealing with the future of cutaway bogs.  There have been many reports written and much research conducted into the potential of this natural resource and its capacity for development.  It is time all concerned now made up their minds.  We should have been phasing in an ancillary industry on cutaway bogs over the past ten years. We must be objective in planning for the future.  Had we been more objective and constructive over the past ten years we would not have experienced the same environmental shock in terms of job losses in recent months, particularly in the Counties of Laois and Offaly.  Such job losses are being cushioned in the short-term by redundancy payments but, in the long-term, will have devastating effects on the social structures of the communities affected, in turn highlighting the urgency of finding alternative employment enterprises.  I must confess to having reservations about the benefits of voluntary redundancies in areas of enterprise which have a capacity for development and further job creation.  Forestry development is a good example in that respect.  I might bring to the Minister's attention the development potential in forestry.  It is recognised at present that the Minister's Department is under-staffed when it comes to the maintenance of <Col N="1049" /> existing forests and plantations.  I would contend that there is a total imbalance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the staff of his Department and the forestries coming within his jurisdiction. For example, in some areas there are almost as many foresters as there are forestry workers.  The Minister must examine this problem and endeavour to restore some balance between them.  I am not contending that we do not need the number of foresters we have but there is potential for additional jobs, by which I mean the employment of additional manual forestry workers in the expansion of our planting programme and the maintenance of existing ones.  It is false economy to invest in forestry development while not being in a position to maintain that development, particularly when it could create much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>As a nation we have been guilty of complacency not only at Government level but also in the area of productive employment.  We have been prepared to tolerate inefficiency on the understanding that, at some point, the Government and taxpayers would come to the rescue.  In the last two years under a Fianna Fáil Government that myth has come to an end.  Government action has brought about a realisation that inefficiencies and bad management cannot be tolerated and that the all too easy lifeline of falling back on the taxpayer through increased taxation is no longer an option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this matter and to thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food for coming to the House to respond. I do not think I have to point out to him the severe income crisis that beef producers, particularly the winter feeders, are experiencing.  We all sold our entry into the EC in 1973 on the basis of the advantages that would accrue to this country, particularly to the agricultural sector.  Those advantages were based on the natural advantage of grass-based production in agriculture.  It is with a very heavy heart that I raise this issue of the income crisis for beef producers.</P>
      <P>Beef producers suffered an 80 per cent decline in their incomes in 1988 over 1987.  I am appealing to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take urgent action to ensure that this vital industry, which contributes more than £1.2 billion to our exports and represents 4 per cent of our gross national product, is supported immediately by him and the Government. To date the Minister has failed to recognise the income crisis for this sector. When we compare like with like and consider that industrial output depends on 71 per cent of imported raw material &mdash; that figure includes profit repatriation &mdash; we will see that in regard to agriculture, particularly beef production, which has 18 per cent imported raw material, the real value of our beef exports when compared with manufacturing exports is in the region of £5 billion.</P>
      <P>Unless measures are taken to ensure a future for our farmer-producers the seasonal distortion caused by APS &mdash; aids to private storage &mdash; last autumn, and indeed the promised removal of the British variable premium from the beginning of April next, will further exacerbate an already difficult situation which has been caused by the necessary compliance with the ban on growth promoters and, indeed, the price of calves and stores since the introduction of the super-levy and their scarcity of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the autumn of 1986 the average price <Col N="1051" /> for a 400 kg store was £400.  In the autumn of 1988, just a few short months ago, as our winter fatteners were trying to fill their sheds, the average price for a 400 kg store had gone up to £600, an increase of more than 40 per cent.  The Minister may not be aware that yesterday £300, plus £1 per kilo, was given for a 300 kg bullock; £625 for a 300 kg store.  There are 10,000 jobs at risk in meat processing factories and on commercial and family farms.  Meat factories that are quoting &mdash; indeed, there are not too many and most of them are open for a day or two per week at the moment &mdash; are offering at best 111p or 112p per lb. for the top grades and down to 107p to 108p per lb. Effectively, they do not want them.  A factory in my constituency has not killed bullocks since Christmas.  Winter feeders would need a minimum of 120p per lb. to break even and to have any margin or any profit we are talking about 125p per lb.</P>
    <P>Every bullock, as I said before, that will die between now and July will die in debt.  There will be a total collapse of the beef industry if the farmer-producer's income is not protected, as the banks will no longer, and to be fair can no longer, advance the necessary capital to replace stock.  Winter feeders will no longer be able to fill their sheds next autumn as the margins have been completely eroded. Fine Gael pointed to this danger long before today or yesterday.  In March 1988 my predecessor produced a policy document on securing a future for the beef industry.  In that document he pointed out that calf prices were booming and were squeezing the margins for beef production. Indeed, he said that the increase in calf and store cattle prices put into question whether many farmers could afford to remain in beef production.</P>
    <P>A year ago Fine Gael pointed out the dangers but nothing was done about this problem.  We went on to say that about 90,000 farmers were involved in cattle production in 1985 and that the future viability of many of them was in question. The situation has deteriorated since then. There are 25,000 farm families at risk <Col N="1052" /> from the production of the calf through the store into the fattening to beef stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that I have criticised him before on capitulating at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the new beef regime in the face of the new farm Commissioner.  To accept 220,000 tonnes on a tender system for intervention, given the position last year, was an appalling abandonment of a sector that is of vital national importance, in view of the fact that it was the bull regime and not the steer regime that was causing the problem in relation to intervention. I do not have to reiterate that it is steers we are talking about and not bulls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to correct me when he is replying.  He failed to achieve what he promised us in December and for 20,000 tonnes he took the shilling.  There is a coincidence in that the Commissioner for Agriculture changed between December and January and he was looking across the table at his former colleague. The Minister can forgive me for drawing conclusions from that, conclusions that, perhaps, he is not too comfortable with, but I have made those views known before now.  The Minister knows as well as I do that it was the bull regime that was causing trouble and not the steer beef regime.  We have been abandoned by the European beef regime.</P>
      <P>In 1989 our steer beef production is at a disadvantage of £350 per beast on German bull beef production.  Two years ago the disadvantage was £30 per animal. The figure I have quoted is compiled by taking into account the difference in the price of a calf, about £150, and I am being conservative, dearer here than in Germany.  The VAT refund difference is £70.  The Germans, as we all know, get 11 per cent of the flat rate refund compared to our 2 per cent.</P>

    <P>With regard to hormones, natural in <Col N="1053" /> the bull, we are no longer able to use growth promoters here through a willing compliance with EC regulations and effectively, that is worth £120 per animal when talking about bullock versus bull. The proposed removal of the variable premium in a few weeks time will also cause problems in that last year it was worth 8p per lb.  The Minister was pushed around at the negotiating table.  To be fair to him, he did not get his way but he protested meekly; he did not do as he said he would in December, he capitulated. The Minister allowed further advantage to the bull beef producer over the steer beef producer.</P>
    <P>The removal of the British variable premium of 8p per lb. is another story for the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  The British Minister, as I understand it, was taken ill at the meeting and within eight minutes of his departure from the Council his replacement capitulated on the variable premium issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity to correct me.  The effect of the change is that at this time there is an off-loading of finished cattle and forward stores in the UK to take advantage of the last remaining weeks of variable premium there.  The normal market we would expect in the UK at this time of the year is not available to us because of that.  There is also a problem in relation to the sheepmeat subsidy in the UK, effectively equivalent of £950 per tonne because of the variable premium aspect thereto which makes sheepmeat cheaper so that there is a lesser demand for beef than we could expect at this time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The margins on beef production, more particularly the winter feeder, have been further eroded by the super-levy, the scarcity of calves, the increasing of the price.  We also have the major problem of seasonality and the distortion of the trade by APS in the back end.  At the height of APS 54,000 to 55,000 bullocks <Col N="1054" /> were killed and put into store shortly before Christmas.  Last week 3,500 bullocks were killed here.  Any contracts that have been filled out at the moment are being filled from stores.</P>
    <P>The necessary compliance on the hormone ban effectively means a decrease of .4 of a kilo per day in live weight gain and up to 90 days longer to reach the equivalent weight on the finished steer. Then the risks are that they will not grade; in fact most are not grading.</P>
    <P>We also had an increase in the price of feed this winter.  Let us compare the 1986 figures with the 1988 figures for beef production. There has been a 40 per cent increase in the price of a calf and only a 5 per cent increase in the price of beef averaged over the spring months.  Please do not tell me &mdash; because I have heard the Minister say it before &mdash; that there was an increase of 15 per cent in the price of beef last year.  Yes, there was; for one week.  I am talking about averaging it out and getting a true picture of what was achieved, particularly by the winter beef feeder in the spring months.  I would ask the Minister not to repeat the figure because he makes a fool of all of us, particularly himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we are agreed on that if on little else.  The winter feeder at the moment would need to reach 120p per lb. at one kilo per day live weight gain to break even.  The farmer is not getting that.  He is not getting 120p per lb. but somewhere around 111p for those that make the top grades, the Rs, forgetting the Us altogether at this stage. That is at least 8p a lb. short of his expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, as the Minister who has been beating his drum about the increase in agricultural incomes both last year and the year before, the Minister who has failed to differentiate between the different enterprises, to do something. Thankfully our dairy farmers have <Col N="1055" /> enjoyed a very good increase in their income.  Thank God, because they worked hard enough and long enough for little return, 52 weeks of the year, seven days a week; but the Minister has not said, on all the occasions he announced the increase in agricultural incomes in recent times, that none of the other sectors are enjoying the same increase in income as the dairy farmer.  The sheep producers have had better times, I will agree, and it looks like there will be another year or two for them and things are not going too badly; but what about the pig production sector?  What about the cereal farmers and the tillage farmers and what about the beef rises that we are talking about here tonight?  The Minister has not analysed and has not broken down enterprise by enterprise and margin by margin and is giving a false impression. In fact he is casting despair on the other sectors because everyone feels at the moment that all agricultural incomes increased by 17 per cent last year and 15 per cent the year before.  I wish to God that was the case, and anything I can do to help the Minister to be able to state that and stand over it I certainly will do.</P>
    <P>We look to the Minister for a solution to the beef crisis which affects the 90,000 farmers involved in beef production from the calf through the store to the finished animal.  If the winter beef men cannot fill their sheds, if the banks will not forward them the money in the autumn, the store price will collapse and we will not have the natural flow of calves and stores from the west to the east and midland counties where we have the more intensive feeding units for the winter months.  I hope the Minister can offer us something here this evening because this entire industry is looking at him for a solution.</P>
    <P>First, what efforts has the Minister made to increase the export refunds?  If we could increase the flow of the animals that will not grade, the poor and middling quality animals, out of this country and out of the Community, it will leave more <Col N="1056" /> room down the line.  What efforts is the Minister making, and has there been any effort in Europe to recognise our problem and to respond to our problem with an increase in export refunds?  Would the Minister consider restricting APS in the autumn?  We need it in the autumn when 54 per cent of our beef comes in off grass, but would the Minister consider restricting the APS price to 90 per cent of the average spring price, to have it related to the spring price so that we reward the winter feeder and get away from this appalling seasonality problem? Would the Minister also consider having a trigger price so that we could have APS in and out depending on whether the market price of beef in the autumn hits 90 per cent of the spring price or not?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister make efforts to extend the British variable premium to at least 1 July so that the winter feeders this year can be looked after and we can plan and modulate our programme for next year and further years accordingly? This would bring order back into the sale of the fat cattle coming out of the sheds this year.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister looked at the possibility of pursuing the modulation of the variable premium again?  I know it was discussed in Brussels and again there was very little support.  I know the store men would be up in arms if they got nothing. We are not talking about abandoning the store men; we are talking about weighting the payment in favour of the winter beef producer and those killing the cattle or selling the cattle in the spring of the year.  We must look again and not abandon this possibility, and I know the Minister has not been getting support and that the British are involved in this too.  We must look again at the possibility of looking after the store men but weighting the special premium in favour particularly of the winter feeder.  There are storemen in my own constituency too and they must be looked after, but let us not forget that they do not have the added burden of the £6.50 levy at the point of kill of the <Col N="1057" /> bullock in relation to TB eradication. That is borne by the winter fattener or the summer grazier who kills off grass or kills out of the sheds.  There already is a disadvantage there to the man producing the finished beast and we could look again at the modulation of the variable premium and be fair to all sectors in beef production.</P>
    <P>We are expecting intervention back next week for R grades only.  I am afraid this will not be extensive enough to even make a dent in the crisis.  It will perhaps increase the price by about 3p per lb.  We will then be looking at 114p per lb. for R grades.  To break even they need 120p per lb.  To have any margin and allow the bank managers to forward the money next back end they need 125p per lb. Intervention will fall so far short that it will be virtually meaningless.</P>
    <P>Can anything be done about this?  Will the Minister look to this again?  Will his colleagues, the other agricultural Ministers, recognise the crisis here and come to our aid?  Will the Minister pursue the problem with venom and determination and not capitulate, and ensure that his former colleague, whom we all wish very well in his new job as Farm Commissioner, recognises and fully understands the crisis in a vital industry here, our winter beef sector and the beef sector generally?  I look to the Minister for answers and for solutions.  The 90,000 farmers here involved look to the Minister for solutions and we need them now, not next autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has addressed a number of issues to me.  I have to take this as flattery in that she seems to suggest that not only do I have the role of Irish Minister for Agriculture and Food but of all 12 Ministers for Agriculture and Food and that of Commissioner for Agriculture and Food.  According to the Deputy I have this dominant role of all 12 Ministers and the Commissioner and all I have to do is to tell all the others to do something <Col N="1058" /> and it is done.  The Deputy will acknowledge herself that I do not have that power.  I have had, I am glad to say, considerable success which has been measured in the unique increase in farm incomes in the beef sector as in other sectors which is out of line with that experienced in any other country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would do well to read the records as distinct from listening to some of the corridor stories, fairy tales as to the capitulation of a British Minister 15 minutes after another Minister became ill.  None of that is true.  I would invite the Deputy to have a look at the Community price proposals, and particularly at the paragraph which makes special reference to the unique income increases in Ireland which are out of line with the rest and the graphs which demonstrate, if words are not adequate, that that is exactly the pattern.  In this case I am glad to say that beef too has been a feature of this substantial income increase in those last two years.  There have been no two years in the history of farming in which income increases in all our major sectors have been as significant as in the last two years.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy is obviously pointing to &mdash; and I acknowledge it because it is fact &mdash; is that there is now a seasonal reduction in beef prices.  It has to be acknowledged that while we have had those two years of unique, unprecedented increases in farm incomes, including beef, we are now witnessing a problem of seasonality in beef production. It is a problem I have highlighted on a number of occasions and I propose to address the issue as to how we can deal with it.  It will not be possible to establish an efficient value added industry in this sector until an adequate and permanent solution to the problem of seasonality is found, no matter what the level of buoyancy in beef prices generally is throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our target in the years ahead is to seek out and develop an increasing share of European Community markets.  Our ultimate aim should be to develop marketing <Col N="1059" /> channels which would enable the customers to identify our products and develop a loyalty to them.  This strategy cannot work unless we can supply our products on a year round basis.  Not only do I acknowledge that but I have stated it many times.  European markets require fresh meat cuts, hence the importance of eliminating, or at least greatly reducing, the seasonal variation in cattle supplies. There are two aspects to this problem. First, there is the immediate problem created by current market prices for fat cattle and, secondly, there is the long term or structural problem.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that prices will show improvement over the coming months. The following factors are relevant: a green rate adjustment of 1.55 per cent, which incidentally followed from the beef outcome that the Deputy has decried so much, will apply as and from 27 February and will affect intervention prices as well as eliminating negative MCAs, the intervention for R grade steers to which the Deputy has referred will be triggered on 27 February 1989; live exports, which had been dormant in January have now recommenced.  The optimism of farmers generally, which can be measured from a variety of factors, for the future of beef must be reflected in the prices they pay for calves.  If beef prices are depressed surely calf prices will also be depressed and some people must face that reality. Buoyant beef prices mean high calf prices.  You cannot have it the other way around and it is time that was stated as a simple fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>High calf prices do not necessarily mean increased beef prices. That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices continue, for that reason, at a very high level in Ireland and throughout the EC &mdash; at a disproportionately high level in Ireland by comparison with the rest of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> The reduced supply of calves as a consequence of the reduction in cow numbers has been partly compensated for by a shift away from veal production on the European mainland.  Veal production dropped by about 9 per cent in 1988 compared to 1987.  However veal price has substantially increased in response to the reduced supply and the trend to reduced veal production is expected to stop and even reverse itself. The &ldquo;overhang&rdquo; on the market of a large reserve of EC public storage beef is rapidly reducing.  This dropped by 44 per cent during 1988 from 755,000 tonnes at the beginning of the year to 425,000 tonnes at year end and has further reduced to 385,000 tonnes at present. Most importantly, a general improvement in the market for beef is anticipated, particularly in the UK, France and Germany.  The post Christmas traditional lull in demand for beef seems to have lasted longer than usual this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is related in part to the unusually mild winter.  However, there are signs that the demand for beef is picking up, and the supply of beef is forecast to drop by a further 3 per cent during 1989 in the EC as a whole.  This would be the lowest level of supply during this decade.</P>
      <P>There has always been a greater element of risk in shorter term beef production systems especially those where farmers are in production for part of the year only.  The summer finisher who buys in spring and sells in autumn wants low spring prices and high autumn prices.  The winter finisher who buys in autumn and sells in spring wants the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we would have greater stability and less fluctuation in the fortunes of individual beef farmers if longer term production systems were more widely practised, such as calf to beef systems, buy in spring to sell the following spring or buy in autumn to sell the following <Col N="1061" /> autumn.  The belief of many beef farmers in the past was that you should buy replacements at the time you sold, then your real profit related to the differences in price received for one batch of cattle and the price paid for its replacement rather than the price paid and received for the same cattle.  With greater specialisation in recent times this practice, I am glad to say, has diminished.  Perhaps it is time for individual farmers to reconsider its merits in terms of cash flow and reduced risk.</P>
    <P>Turning to the longer term aspects, as I have already said the main Community support for beef in recent years has been geared towards catering for the autumn glut of cattle which primarily arises in Ireland.  It is hardly realistic to suggest that we should seek a reduction in these supports, beyond those which have been already agreed, in the interests of winter fatteners.  Neither is it realistic to suggest an APS scheme in the spring months.  No other member state is in favour of such a scheme and we would get no support for it.  It is one thing to say we should have it but the facts are otherwise.</P>
    <P>A modulation of the special beef premium on a seasonal basis would have some attractions but the reality is that it was not possible to get agreement in Brussels for such a system.  It is clear that we will have to rely to a greater extent in the future on returns from the marketplace. I believe that much can be achieved by meat factories through their pricing policies.  If, as we hope, increased market outlets are obtained in Europe, the increased competition for cattle in the springtime should lift prices to more attractive levels.  Indeed, it might well be in the interests of meat factories to pay more competitive prices in the springtime and to rely on the autumn business to generate their profits.  The recently agreed revisions to the Community beef system contain a number of positive factors which should be beneficial in helping to tackle the seasonality problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1988 I succeeded in getting Brussels agreement to extending the date for eligibility for the suckler cow premium scheme from 30 November to 31 January.  The premium will be increased from £38 to £51.  The extension of the date will be of assistance to farmers wishing to engage in once calved heifer production which is now being actively promoted by some commercial interests.  The termination of the UK variable premium scheme will, in fact, facilitate this development.  The variable premium applies to steers and maiden heifers only.  Until now once calved heifers suffered because the heifer, when slaughtered after producing a calf, did not qualify for variable premium and accordingly had to bear a discount of up to 10p per pound compared to the prices available for maiden heifers. Following the termination of the scheme this differential will disappear.  The heifers which produce calves before 31 January each year will be available for slaughter during the following spring. These developments, including the increase in the suckler cow premium, will have the effect of increasing considerably the profitability of once calved heifer systems of production.</P>
      <P>To sum up, the short-term difficulties which winter fatteners are now experiencing &mdash; I recognise there are short-term difficulties &mdash; will, hopefully, be of short duration and prices should begin to harden in the near future.  In the longer term, a solution to the seasonality problem is of major importance to the continued development of the beef industry. All the indications are that in future we will have to rely to an increasing extent on the market price for returns and I would urge the meat factories to look to their longer term interests as well as immediate ones in framing pricing policies. Elements of the revised EC beef support régime should be of assistance in increasing the supply of cattle in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the opportunity <Col N="1063" /> to make this brief statement late at night but I wish to make one further comment.  One thing we should all avoid is contributing to talking down prices. Even in the face of the buoyant prices we have experienced in the last two years, I would caution against anyone in this House or outside, for the sake of making <Col N="1064" /> an argument, talking down prices against the interests of the producers we are anxious to serve.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, we and our other partners in the Twelve have urged repeatedly on the South African Government the need to take urgent and active steps to initiate a genuine national dialogue with all sections of the South African population.

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 28 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's extradition arrangements with most countries in Western Europe are governed by the European Convention on Extradition to which Ireland and 18 other countries are party.  These countries are: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</P>
      <P>Belgium, Malta, Portugal and Britain are not parties to this Convention.</P>
      <P>Both Belgium and Portugal have signed the Convention but have not at yet ratified it.</P>
      <P>I understand Portugal is, at present, completing its parliamentary procedures to enable it to become a party.</P>
      <P>In the case of Belgium, we have been in negotiation with the Belgian authorities on the terms of a bilateral extradition treaty within the last few years. The negotiation of the text has been undertaken in a series of meetings and through subsequent correspondence but the final text has not yet been agreed. Consideration of the text is continuing.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware extradition arrangements with Britain are governed by Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Ireland's extradition arrangements in Europe are therefore extensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of countries have withdrawn their diplomats from Afghanistan.  Clearly such a <Col N="847" /> decision is a matter for the countries concerned. In the case of Afghanistan concern for the safety of diplomats and their families in Kabul is obviously a major consideration on the part of those concerned.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland has regularly stated its views on the question of Afghanistan in the UN, we have not had occasion to make a statement on this particular aspect of the question in that forum.  In a statement on 14 February, along with our partners in the Twelve, we expressed satisfaction at the prospective withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.  This fulfils one of the main provisions of the Geneva Agreements, which constitute an important step towards a comprehensive political solution to the Afghan problem.</P>
      <P>With the full Soviet withdrawal, possibilities now increase for an internal settlement in Afghanistan.  Along with our partners in the Twelve, Ireland urged all parties concerned, including the Resistance, to exercise moderation and realism in order to achieve the establishment of a fully representative Government formed through a genuine act of self-determination. The Twelve reiterated their continued support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to assist the formation of such a Government, while accepting that it is the exclusive responsibility of the Afghan people to decide upon its composition.</P>
      <P>The achievement of a comprehensive political settlement, which should guarantee a non-aligned, independent and democratic Afghanistan where respect for human rights will prevail, and the restoration of peace are necessary preconditions for the voluntary return of the refugees in safety and honour.</P>
      <P>In the statement of 14 February the European Community and its member states stressed their readiness to contribute to the multilateral aid effort to resettle the refugees, help the innocent victims of war and reconstruct the country, in close co-operation with the United Nations co-ordinator for humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recent judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the Brogan case which found the provision of the British prevention of terrorism legislation allowing the detention of an individual for up to 7 days without bringing him before a court to be in violation of article 5.3 of the Convention which requires that a person arrested shall be brought promptly before a judge.</P>
      <P>The British Government have informed the Council of Europe that it is their wish, if it could be achieved, to find a judicial process under which extended detention might be reviewed and where appropriate authorised by a judge or other judicial officer.  In the meantime, to the extent that the exercise of the relevant PTA powers may be inconsistent with the obligations of the Convention, the British Government have availed of the right of derogation under Article 15(1) of the Convention.</P>
      <P>The response to the court's ruling is a matter for the British Government.  It is permissible to derogate from a provision of the convention under article 15 which provides that in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation, any high contracting party may take measures derogating from its obligations under the Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation...and no derogation under Article 2, except in respect of death resulting from lawful war or from Articles 3, 4 (paragraph 1) and 7 shall be made under this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have considered for some time that the period of seven days detention should be reduced.  This view <Col N="849" /> has been put to the British Government along with views on other aspects of the PTA legislation and its implementation.</P>

      <P>On 23 December I issued a statement welcoming the increase in the number of prisoners in Northern Ireland who were given special parole to enable them to share Christmas with their families. I especially welcomed the fact that of those receiving parole, 84 were life sentence prisoners, including nine young offenders serving indeterminate sentences and being held at what is termed &ldquo;during the secretary of state's pleasure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Prisons policy in Northern Ireland is an important issue which is regularly discussed in the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental conference.  At the most recent conference meeting on 8 February, we reviewed recent encouraging developments in this area.  The communique welcomed the recent decision, following a special review of the cases of the remaining 17 Secretary of State's pleasure cases, to refer 9 of these cases to the judiciary about the possibility of fixing provisional release dates.</P>
      <P>I look forward to further positive developments in 1989 &mdash; particularly in relation to the current special review of the sentences of the remaining special category prisoners in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Counts of the number of private households are available periodically from censuses of population. The number of private households (permanent and temporary) in censuses since 1971 are as follows: 1971, 730, 543; 1979, 876, 659; 1981, 910, 700; 1986, 976, 304.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We were part of the consensus in the United Nations General Assembly by which, in September 1987, a resolution welcoming and expressing support for the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement of 7 August 1987 between the five Central American States was adopted.  President Arias of Costa Rica was the architect of that agreement.</P>
      <P>The International Verification and Follow-Up Commission for which provision was made in the agreement included the Secretary General of the United Nations. When the Central American States in January 1988 transferred the functions of that commission to an executive commission comprising only their foreign ministers, the UN Secretary General ceased to have a formal role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months the Central American States have been discussing with the Secretary General the possibility of UN assistance in verifying the provisions of the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement regarding the cessation of aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements from outside the countries of Central America in which there are armed conflicts.  Earlier this month agreement was reached between the Central American States and the UN Secretary General, subject to Security Council approval, on the creation of an international verification group with a checking and observation function.  The Secretary General and the Central American States are to work out <Col N="854" /> in detail the terms of reference of this verification group.</P>
    <P>This agreement and other measures agreed by the five Central American Presidents at their meeting in EL Salvador earlier this month are a very welcome political and psychological boost to the peace process.  The Twelve have issued a statement welcoming these developments.</P>
    <P>We avail of every opportunity, at the UN and elsewhere, to indicate support for the &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; Agreement and to urge the Central American States to maintain their efforts to implement it in full.  Together with our EC partners we will again be expressing support and encouragement for the Central American Governments at the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the Twelve, the Central American States and the States of the Contadora group in Honduras on 27 and 28 February 1989.</P>

      <P>Mozambique is not a priority country and in present budgetary circumstances it is not possible to provide special assistance in respect of Mozambiques' programme of economic restructuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the European Community recently decided to grant aid worth 30 MECU specifically to support the second year of the economic reform package on which the authorities in Mozambique have embarked.  This follows a similar decision made in 1987 involving aid valued at 40 MECU which is currently being disbursed.  These decisions take the <Col N="855" /> form of sectoral import programmes which will make foreign exchange available to key economic agencies, particularly in agriculture, fisheries and transport.  Ireland was happy to support both these programmes which constitute an important contribution to the efforts at economic restructuring in Mozambique.</P>
    <P>As a party to the Lomé Convention, Mozambique benefits from the European Development Fund.  The Community is providing 130 MECU in grants and 1.5 MECU in risk capital to Mozambique under Lomé III.  Mozambique also receives substantial amounts of food aid and emergency aid from the Community.</P>

These vehicles arrive in the vicinity of the fruit and vegetable market in the early morning because of the perishable nature of the goods on hand, the motors of the refrigeration units are left running.  Where this causes a noise problem in the vicinity of dwelling houses the gardaí from time to time get the drivers of these vehicles to move on and I understand that the drivers, for the most part, are understanding and try to park in areas where they will not cause a disturbance.  The gardaí will continue to give this problem as much attention as possible, having regard to the many other demands that there are on their resources.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State aged 66 years or over and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years.  The scheme also applies to spouses under age 66 for journeys on which they accompany the qualified person.  The issue of free travel passes to spouses in their own right would be a major extension of the scheme and while it is not possible to give a precise estimate of the cost of such an extension it is likely to be significant.

      <P>The national fuel scheme administered by my Department applies to persons in receipt of long term social welfare or health board payments who live alone or only with persons who come within certain categories.  Children aged 18 and over do not come within these categories unless they are in full-time education.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of invalidity pension and has a child over 18 years of age who is not in full-time education residing with him.  He is not therefore, entitled to be paid a fuel allowance from this Department.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned is in receipt of separate payment on his invalidity pension.  Apart from the fact that she also is residing with a child aged over 18 who is not in full-time education she is a dependent on her husband's pension and is not the actual pensioner. Thus, she is not entitled to be paid a fuel allowance from this Department.</P>
      <P>The allowance paid to the wife of the person concerned last year and in previous years was paid under the exceptional needs provisions of the supplementary welfare scheme administered by the health board and was not in fact a fuel allowance under the fuel scheme then in operation.  It is open to her to apply again this year to the health board under the same provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to the age of 18 years.  However, in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers, who are receiving a social welfare pension or allowance, increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years provided that they are in full time education at either second or third level.  This also applies to widows who are claiming invalidity, retirement or old age contributory pensions.  The same arrangements will apply to widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children under the new social assistance scheme which I am introducing in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>As also announced in the recent budget, it has been decided to extend the child dependant allowances for long term recipients to children aged 19 years where they continue in full time education, as a first step towards extending child allowances in all cases to age 21 where the child is in full time education.</P>

The improvement of this section of road forms a part of proposals for a major improvement scheme for the N22 between Killarney and the Kerry-Cork county boundary.

      <P>Government assistance to organisations providing advisory and welfare services to Irish emigrants in Britain is allocated on the recommendation of DION, the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services.</P>
      <P>Grants in this area are given to agencies, principally in Britain, operating front line emergency services for emigrants, particularly those in younger age groups who run into problems and who might otherwise find themselves in difficulties. In brief, the grants allocated in 1988, were used to support the salaries of 21 professional staff in 13 agencies and to contribute to the running costs of two other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to give precise details on how the additional sum of £250,000 allocated to my Department for <Col N="885" /> emigrant welfare in 1989 will be spent as DÍON has not yet had the opportunity to consider the matter fully and make recommendations to me.</P>
    <P>DÍON has intimated, however, that the increased funding will enable support to be extended to voluntary bodies intending to establish advice and counselling services for Irish emigrants in areas in Britain where no such facilities exist at present and to provide support for research and information projects on emigrants' accommodation and employment needs.  In this connection, DÍON has arranged for advertisements to be placed in the Irish community press in the next few weeks featuring details of the new arrangements for grant assistance. These advertisements will invite voluntary bodies to apply for funding support and identify the priority activities and projects which will be considered for support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 124 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with section 68 of the Health Act, 1970 health boards have an obligation to make available a service for the training of disabled persons for employment and for the making of arrangements with employers for placing disabled persons in employment.  Health boards fulfil this obligation by providing such services themselves or by giving financial assistance to voluntary organisations to do so on their behalf.  Training <Col N="886" /> and employment is provided in centres and workshops which cater for a range of disabilities as well as in specialised mental handicap workshops.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap which reported in 1965 made a number of recommendations in relation to training and employment.  A more comprehensive report in relation to training and employing the handicapped generally was presented to the Minister for Health in 1974.  The recommendations in the that report form the basis of official policy in this area.  The services continue to be enhanced and expanded as resources permit.  Occupational provision is also one of the aspects of mental handicap services which is being considered by the current review group on mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board has a general co-ordinating function in relation to the statutory and voluntary organisations involved in training and placement.  It also provides a number of services for disabled people, including the assessment of disabled persons for vocational training, their placement in the training centre best suited to their needs and placing them in employment following training.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the National Rehabilitation Board, continuously monitors the services in question.</P>

    <P>There are at present 215 patients awaiting hip replacement operations at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The number of public patients who received hip replacements at Our Lady's Hospital in 1988 was <Col N="888" /> 171 while 31 private patients received hip replacements.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the three orthopaedic consultants at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan are now dealing solely with the North Eastern Health Board counties.  Prior to 1987 orthopaedic surgery for Longford and Westmeath was also done at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan but this is now carried out at the General Hospital in Tullamore.  I might add that consultant staffed orthopaedic services are also provided at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the improvement in the waiting list for hip replacement will continue in the North Eastern Health Board and, in time, will show a considerable reduction.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any waiting list for the services mentioned by the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, unfortunately, necessary for me to make a public statement recently in relation to misleading and inaccurate statements which had been made about the MMR campaign.  The body concerned has in fact disassociated itself from those inaccurate statements and has declared itself fully supportive of the MMR programme.</P>
      <P>The programme is focused on children aged 15 months to two years with the objective of achieving and maintaining at least a 90 per cent of the vaccination amongst this age group.</P>
      <P>The vaccine is also being made available to children in the two to five age group with the objective of achieving at least a 90 per cent uptake in this group.</P>
      <P>The programme of immunisation began in October 1988 and the target which I have set is to achieve a 90 per cent uptake in both groups by March 1990.  Already a 31 per cent uptake has been achieved nationally in the primary target group while in some areas the uptake has been over 40 per cent and a 25 per cent uptake in the second group.</P>
      <P>The media campaign associated with the programme is designed in three phases over the 18 months of the programme. The second phase is due to be launched in early March.  The success of the media campaign is reflected in the excellent response from parents who have so far brought their children in for vaccination.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will achieve our vaccination target with the continued support of medical and health board staff and the professional bodies involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will outline the main developments in community care over the last five years; and in particular, the financial allocations for this area.</P>

      <P>The main developments during the period in question were as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) In regard to psychiatric services the policy has been to bring about a change from a largely institutional based service to a service based in the community, as outlined in <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published in 1984. There has been a continuous reduction in the number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals and at the end of 1988 this number stood at 8,600.  This has corresponded with the development of alternative community based facilities such as day hospitals, day centres and hostels. On 31 December 1987, the latest date in respect of which figures are available, there were 204 hostels in place with some 1,300 places together with 17 day hospitals and 46 day centres with approximately 1,300 attenders.</P>
      <P>(b)  A similar emphasis has been placed on the development of community based services for the mentally handicapped during the period.</P>
      <P>(c)  The development of a network of health centres throughout the country has been continuing and during the past five years more than 40 new premises have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  Day care services for children have been an important support measure for families under stress.  The number of places available for children in centres assisted by health boards has risen considerably in recent years.  There are now over 6,000 children attending centres funded by health boards, at an annual cost of over £1 million.  The reported incidence of child abuse has risen in recent years.  The Department published a new set of child abuse guidelines in 1987 <Col N="896" /> which set out in considerable detail the recommended procedures for the reporting, recording, investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse, including child sexual abuse. Special funds were allocated in 1987 to provide units in Dublin at Temple Street and Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child sexual abuse. Additional funds in the region of £0.5 million were made available last year from the national lottery to enable the health boards outside of Dublin to provide similar services at local level.</P>
    <P>(e)  On the preventive side, the measles immunisation programme ran from October 1985 to October 1988 when it was replaced by the measles, mumps and rubella immunisation programme which commenced in October 1988.  A range of measures designed to combat the spread of AIDS in the community has been put in place.</P>
    <P>(f)  Protracted negotiations have taken place in relation to the operation of the General Medical Service.  A new method of payment for doctors has now been agreed, thus establishing a sound basis for the development of general practice in meeting the health needs of the population.</P>
    <P>(g)  The report of the working party on services for the elderly was published in October 1988.  This provides a blueprint for the development of services for the elderly in future years.</P>
    <P>Revenue expenditure for the Health Vote on community services is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In addition, approximately £6 million was allocated from the national lottery surplus in 1987-1988, and further funds will be allocated in 1989, to support a <Col N="897" /> wide range of community based activities, including community based facilities for the physically and mentally handicapped; community based accommodation for the elderly; psychiatric hostels and mental health centres; community information and development services; and improved services for the assessment of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.</P>

Accordingly, the information requested is not readily available, and priority work precludes the allocation of staff to the task.  I would say, however, that schools are generally aware of their entitlement to posts of responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria laid down in relation to the computer studies option for senior cycle pupils is published in the &ldquo;Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools&rdquo; (Page <Col N="903" /> 219).  The syllabus to be followed includes both computer application and computer programming, the emphasis being on problem solving techniques.</P>
    <P>The computer studies option does not form part of the leaving certificate examination but pupils who take it and perform satisfactorily are given statements to that effect by my Department.  School authorities who wish their pupils to receive such a statement must apply in good time for approval.  Records of the work done by pupils during the year must be available for monitoring.  At the end of the year the principal of each school concerned is required to furnish my Department with a list showing the names of the pupils who have satisfactorily completed the course and who have reached a satisfactory standard.  The names of pupils submitted by the principal are, subject to monitoring, accepted as having reached a satisfactory standard and consequently the information sought regarding the percentage of unsuccessful students is not available within my Department.</P>
    <P>At present the computer studies option is approved in a total of 271 post-primary schools.  The total number of students who availed of the course in the 1986-87 school year and who performed satisfactorily was 7,728.  The corresponding figure for the 1987-88 school year was 8,325.</P>

      <P>To move to a current year basis of recoupment would require a 100 per cent increase in the first year in the provision for higher education grants.  In view of existing resource constraints I am not at present in a position to fund such an increase.</P>
