    <Title>Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989   [Seanad]:  Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State denied that the Government had made a deal with the IFA to weaken the Water Pollution Bill.  However, I have evidence that a deal has been made as I have a copy of a circular issued by the IFA to their members which lists six areas in which the Government have agreed to dilute the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her speech last night the Minister confirmed that on Committee Stage she will be introducing amendments in conformity with this deal.  She would have us <Col N="673" /> believe that the amendments are innocuous procedural matters.  On the critical &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision, which was the big loophole in the 1977 Act, through which polluters escaped prosecution in their hundreds, the Minister said she would be expanding it to &ldquo;include a requirement to provide, use and maintain suitable facilities to prevent pollution&rdquo;. Using virtually the same terminology the IFA circular says: &ldquo;we have been successful in getting the term `could not have been reasonably foreseen' changed to `took all reasonable care by providing, maintaining and supervising facilities suitable, having regard to all the circumstances for preventing pollution'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the IFA version is correct then the new Bill will be less effective than the 1977 Act which allowed 35,000 fish to die in our rivers last year.  The Minister's statement last night confirms the concessions which have been secured by the IFA regarding liability and the making of by-laws.  Under the original Bill a local authority would have the power to make by-laws prohibiting or regulating agricultural activities in specified areas but this can now be appealed to the Minister. He can simply sit on the appeal just as he did on the proposed Liffey Valley area amenity order which was submitted to him over two years ago, and which has still not been approved.  The by-laws will then not come into effect.</P>
    <P>This new concession will give farmers the same means of frustrating the Water Pollution Act as the coal industry have of frustrating the Air Pollution Act.  Just as Dublin is still choking in smog two years after the passing of the Air Pollution Act, next summer our river banks will be stocked with dead fish even if the present Bill is passed.  The IFA have also claimed to have got concessions on what is known as split sampling.  The Minister has informed the IFA that he proposes to make regulations under the 1977 Act requiring local authorities to provide a sample of effluent and waters to the owners of the premises or lands concerned, where possible, subject to their ability to locate the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made also to afford <Col N="674" /> the owner of the premises or land an opportunity to be present when the samples are taken. My information is that local authority staff are horrified at this proposal. This will provide farmers and their legal representatives with a golden opportunity to challenge every single prosecution on the grounds either that sufficient effort was not made to locate the individual in order that he be present when the sample was taken or, at its worst, will provide unscrupulous people with the temptation to doctor the sample handed them by the local authority.  It implies that local authorities and their staff cannot be trusted to take a fair sample, to carefully deliver that sample, sealed, to a competent analytical laboratory and give evidence in court on the results of a sample taken from a known site.  We will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that the Minister will not be in a position to make regulations under the 1977 Act providing for split samples.</P>
    <P>The Government caved in to the demands of the IFA with regard to this Bill.  Just as significant, so also have the Fine Gael Party.  It is highly significant that the Fine Gael position on this Bill was expressed here last evening not by their environment spokesperson, Deputy Shatter, but by Deputy Lowry who articulated the IFA position chapter and verse.  Where was Deputy Shatter last evening?  Does Fine Gael's verbal concern for the environment stop at the farmyard gate?  Deputy Shatter has been very good in recent days in calling on the Minister to resign.  It would appear he has been less successful in persuading his rural colleagues that we need an effective Water Pollution Bill and that the law will have to apply to farmers just as it does to everybody else.</P>
    <P>From what we heard in this House last evening I am not optimistic about the Bill before us.  Both the Government and Fine Gael seem intent on leaving us with a feeble, ineffective new Water Pollution Bill.   While the public are being told that tough new laws are to be introduced &mdash; and the Minister herself said so during <Col N="675" /> the summer &mdash; Government and Fine Gael Deputies are in here punching holes in the Bill so that it will end up just as limp as the Air Pollution Act which failed so miserably to deal with smog.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, The Workers' Party will be tabling amendments to ensure that its provisions are tightened up.  We will resist every attempt, whether on the part of the Government or Fine Gael, to introduce amendments which would give effect to demands made in the earlier part of this year by the IFA to have this Bill weakened significantly.  There is no point in this House spending a long time debating the serious problem of water pollution, nor in Ministers making statements and issuing press releases on their concern about the effects of water pollution if we end up &mdash; just as we have on the issue of air pollution &mdash; with a Bill which is patently ineffective, whose provisions have been surrendered to a particular vested interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I have been very disappointed so far by Opposition speakers' contributions. Deputy Gilmore, who I presume is The Workers' Party spokesperson on the Environment, demonstrated an amazing lack of knowledge of its provisions last evening.  I was glad to note that, before speaking this morning, he had engaged in some preparation and had received some additional information.  Last evening he demonstrated that he was totally unaware of its provisions and of amendments announced as far back as March last, repeated in the House by the Minister of State last evening.  I would have assumed that a spokesperson of a political party would have been well aware of them.  Deputy Gilmore appeared to engage in the classic exercise of substituting his lack of knowledge of the provisions of the Bill with the usual kind of diatribe we have come to expect from The Workers' Party against Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and anybody else he could include.  His type of speech is fairly standard from The Workers' Party Members, <Col N="676" /> I regret to say, merely adapted on this occasion to include the IFA and farmers.</P>
      <P>In the course of his contribution he engaged in The Workers' Party usual line of argument, that is proposing the easy solution to every problem, which is to throw money at it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not throwing money at it.  There is the very important matter of £140 million of EC money. Deputy Dempsey is throwing money at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Gilmore was proposing, in that the general tenor of his remarks were to the effect that every problem can be solved simply by throwing money at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Government are getting £140 million of EC money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore, if I recollect properly, was able to make his speech without interruption. The Deputy in possession now must be given the same courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the solution being proposed by The Workers' Party &mdash; increase local authority personnel, increase the money being thrown at the problem in the hope that, in the end, it will disappear.  As usual The Workers' Party do not suggest where the requisite money can be got for such luxuries.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, at present there are 62 engineers, 70 technicians, 15 chemists and 16 specialist technicians involved in the control of pollution in local authorities around the country.  I would not have thought that would qualify as neglect of pollution control on the part of the Government or local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke at length about the fact that consultation had taken place, with meetings between the IFA and all the political parties.  I thought The Workers' Party were very much in favour of consultation, of meeting people, in an endeavour to reach the best possible <Col N="677" /> solution to any given problem.  That is exactly what took place in this case. There is nothing wrong with consultation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to split samples. I was amazed when the IFA sought a change in this provision in the law. The amendment agreed by the Minister actually strengthens the law in that heretofore, in the case of a sampling, a farmer could always deny &mdash; and probably would be believed in court &mdash; that the sample produced by an official was that taken from his river or the area polluted.  If the sample is split, as is proposed in the amendment, I contend that will strengthen the law in that a farmer cannot then deny that the polluting matter was taken from his river or from the area in question.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Gilmore <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Fine Gael opening contribution which bore a remarkable similarity to the IFA document issued around the time the Bill was first circulated and appeared on the Order Paper in March-April last.  All of the then changes advocated by the IFA were advocated in the House here last evening by Deputy Lowry.  I have no problem at all with some of the IFA suggested changes because they appear to be very reasonable. However, we would be going to extremes were we to accept all of them. I would agree with Deputy Gilmore that what would happen if all of the IFA amendments were accepted would be that we simply render the Bill meaningless and we would be wasting our time debating the matter.  As Deputy Gilmore said, it would amount to a recapitulation.</P>
    <P>I would like to start by saying that, coming from a farming county, I totally reject the claim that this Bill discriminates against farmers.  The simple fact is that since the passing of the 1977 Act, the one that this Bill proposes to amend and strengthen, circumstances have changed substantially.  Farming has become much more intensive and the only way to cope with the changing farming practices of the past 12 years is by passing a Bill such as this or by putting all types of agricultural development under the jurisdiction of the planning <Col N="678" /> laws.  The latter certainly would be a less desirable way of dealing with the problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry made an amazing statement in relation to the local authorities acting as bounty hunters.  He gave the impression that local authorities would go mad with the prospect of the fact that they could bring charges against farmers and other people, bring them to court and have the fines paid directly to them. I think he actually used the words that &ldquo;local authorities would go mad bringing farmers to court&rdquo; but I reject that.  Local authorities have more to do with their time and their money than going mad bringing people to court.  The fisheries boards already have the power that is proposed in this Bill and they have not gone mad.  They could benefit substantially, and they would probably have a greater interest in benefiting from such a provision.  That argument, which has been used by the IFA, is not a valid one. The precedent for this section in the Bill is in the planning laws.  Local authorities receive the money from planning fines when they bring people to court.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is no doubt that the proposed legislation before us, which has passed through the Seanad, considerably strengthens the legislation on water pollution.  It strengthens the hands of the Minister, local authorities, fisheries boards and even private individuals in tackling the problem of pollution.  It certainly strengthens considerably the Water Pollution Act, 1977, mainly by clarifying a number of sections of that Act which, in practice, were found to be inadequate.  I refer particularly in this regard to provisions relating to High Court orders and section 12 notices.  The 1977 Act is further strengthened by the increased penalties and sanctions which are included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from strengthening the 1977 Act, the Bill is also to be welcomed for its attempt to tackle pollution with certain new measures and controls.  The most notable of these is section 21 which allows a local authority to introduce by-laws to restrict the type of agricultural <Col N="679" /> activity that may be carried on in a particular area.  Secondly, the new powers to review licences during the course of their lifetime is also very useful, as is section 22 of the Bill.  In summary, the legislation can be said to be attempting to tackle the problem of pollution, firstly, by increasing the power of those whose responsibility it is to prevent and tackle pollution; secondly, by spelling out clearly to all potential polluters that any pollution they cause could result in severe financial penalties by way of fines and court actions and, thirdly, by the introduction of new powers and controls to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>It has been said on more than one occasion that the basic philosophy behind this Bill is summed up in the phrase &ldquo;let the polluter pay&rdquo;.  I have no great difficulty with that philosophy and I venture to suggest that there are very few people in this House who would have difficulty with it.  It is a very catchy phrase and in some senses it could be said to have captured the mood of the people when it first came into vogue after the awful series of pollution incidents during the summer of 1987 as fish kill after fish kill was reported.  However, that is a very simple philosophy and it seems to be a very simple solution at first glance, but I wonder is it really as simple as it looks. We must avoid a situation arising in the legislation whereby we would create another goldmine for our legal people.  If we do not get the balance right we could end up with everybody paying huge sums in legal fees in addition to, or perhaps even instead of, the actual polluter paying.</P>
    <P>There will be little difficulty in using the philosophy as a yardstick in cases where someone is caught red-handed in the act of pollution &mdash; there were a number of incidents in 1987 where you could say that people were caught red-handed &mdash; to deal fairly severely with these people in the courts.  For example, if a person has a pipe carrying effluent into a river or lake, everyone will agree that that person is a polluter and should pay for his crime.  If a factory disposes of <Col N="680" /> effluent into a river or if you see somebody dumping slurry into a river, as happened in the midlands in 1987, there will be no problem as regards defining those people as polluters but in other cases it may be somewhat more difficult to define a polluter and a prosecution could be well-nigh impossible.</P>
    <P>Some years ago farmers, including many in my constituency, decided to expand and improve the facilities on their farms.  They provided slated sheds, silage pits and various other improvements under the farm improvement schemes. To qualify for the grants at that time most of these people had to receive planning permission and the work was carried out in many cases under the supervision and inspection of ACOT officers.  In other words, the work was done under the guidance and direction of officers of a State body, following the specifications laid down by the Department and by ACOT, as they were called at that time.  Four or five years later those works caused pollution.  Who is responsible for that pollution?  Is it the farmer who relied on the expert advice at the time, who complied with all the planning conditions and did the work according to Department specifications?  Is it the ACOT officer or the departmental official who passed the work as satisfactory or is it an act of God?</P>
    <P>In the south-east part of County Meath, with which Deputy Bruton will be familiar, there was a huge growth in population during the seventies and early eighties and a huge number of planning permissions were granted for once-off houses in rural areas, mostly on appeal to the Minister.  This is an area of the county which is not noted for its permeability and there is growing evidence of an increase in the number of wells being contaminated from septic tanks associated with such development.  Who will pay for the pollution in this case? Will it be the last person to receive a planning permission, the first person to receive it, all the people in the area or maybe even the Minister responsible for granting the permissions at that time? There are many other cases where it <Col N="681" /> would be just as difficult to implement this philosophy with court action.  Again, I say that the philosophy is excellent in theory but I am sure it will create certain legal difficulties and the end result will be that pollution will pay the legal profession very well.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from a rural constitutency, I am very much aware of the concern being expressed by the farming community about the policy of making the polluter pay.  These fears are being expressed by farmers not because they believe they should be allowed to pollute with impunity but because they fear that any farmer who, through no fault of his own, causes pollution could find himself faced with a huge fine and further court action to make good any losses suffered by a third party.  If one takes into account the size of the fines proposed in the Bill, that a polluter can be forced to make good the damage he has caused and that he may face further bills to remedy the faults which caused the pollution in the first place I think it is fair to say that none but the very wealthy will be able to survive.</P>
    <P>Looked at in this light, the Minister and Members of this House will understand farmers concerns.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the provisions in the Bill in this regard so as to allay what I know are unfounded fears.  In her reply to the debate the Minister could go a long way to allaying the fears among farmers and other sectors of the community if she makes it clear that it is not her intention nor the intent of the Bill that people who inadvertently or accidentially cause pollution will in effect be deprived of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>Serious concern has also been expressed about the implications of section 7 which replaces section 10 of the 1977 Act.  This provision will allow any person a right to seek a court order directing the person responsible for causing water pollution to mitigate or remedy any effects of the pollution in the manner directed by the court.  In addition, and perhaps much more seriously, the court may also order the polluter to pay the <Col N="682" /> costs incurred by the applicant in investigating, mitigating or remedying the effects of the pollution.</P>
    <P>The first point of concern regarding this section is that it appears to confer on every Tom, Dick and Harry the right to take a court action against anybody they think is causing pollution.  It appears from the Bill that action can be taken at any time by an individual irrespective of whether the alleged polluter has been convicted in court of such an offence.  Of course, the legal position is not as simple as that and I have been informed that only the person directly affected by the actions of another can take legal action against that person, that is, the injured party.  In addition, I have no objection to a person having to compensate an individual or a group for the pollution he has caused after he has been convicted of the offence but I have grave doubts about retaining section 7 as it currently stands. It appears that under the section a person can be taken to court in a civil action which could be very costly to defend while that person might, in fact, be innocent. I would like the Minister to clarify this point.</P>
    <P>I believe that in counties such as Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, which suffer from an overspill of population from the city, a huge spate of court actions will be taken by former city dwellers now living in the country and who object to normal agricultural activities in rural areas.  Already in County Meath the massive development which I mentioned earlier has led to conflict between farmers and people who have moved out of the city to live in the country.  Disputes have arisen about smells emanating from farmyards, there have been objections to slurry spreading on the land and protracted planning disputes where former urban dwellers have objected to planning applications for farm buildings, silage pits and so on.  I fear this section will lead to a virtual civil war in rural areas.  Every crank in the countryside will be in a position to haul his neighbour into court almost at the drop of a hat.  Apart from anything else.  I think from a practical point of view it could lead to a build-up <Col N="683" /> of vexatious cases in our already creaking legal system.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this section and to continue the present system whereby the fishery boards and the local authorities are the only two bodies which can take action under the Water Pollution Acts.  There are some who would advocate that only local authorities should have this right, but in the case where a local authority are not doing their duty for one reason or another, it is important that there should be another body to do that work. In addition, it has been pointed out that a local authority may be a polluter and it is important that somebody can take them to task for pollution.  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify the position because this section has caused great concern among the farming community.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, when this Bill is enacted it will greatly increase and strengthen the powers which exist under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Subject to the reservations I have stated, I agree that the general thrust of the Bill is correct and underlines the fact that neither this Government nor the Minister will tolerate anything less than the highest standards of pollution control.  However, I have to say even with the best will in the world and the best legislation pollution will not be controlled or eliminated simply by passing the legislation.  Legislation was in place in 1987 &mdash; perhaps it was faulty but it was there &mdash; but it did not stop pollution.  Many of the fish kills and pollution accidents which took place in 1987 occurred because of a particular set of circumstances which included good weather prior to silage harvesting and very heavy rain during the summer months.  Another factor was that advisers did not allow for sufficient expansion in farming activities when advising farmers about the provision of slatted sheds and silage and slurry pits early in the eighties.</P>
    <P>Technically, the three major causes of pollution from agricultural holdings are (1) the failure to intercept waste at the point of generation; (2) losses of waste <Col N="684" /> from the storage area due to insufficient capacity and (3) excessive run-offs from the land in which waste is spread.  In other words, in most cases a lack of expertise caused pollution rather than any malicious intent.  We must keep this in mind while we are discussing this Bill so that we can keep a sense of balance.</P>
    <P>Apart from having legislation in place, basically what we need to do is change the attitudes of a tiny percentage of the population who have no regard for their environment and to help the vast majority of the population who are basically well-disposed towards keeping a clean environment but who may lack the expertise in ensuring they do not do anything to spoil the environment. Changing the attitudes of people is by far the most difficult task to tackle.  The problem is getting this minority of people to acknowledge that our environment is very important and it must be preserved, not just for the present generation but for future generations.  Of course, there are those who believe that our environment and natural resources are there to be exploited without any reference to future generations.  The attitude of these people is to get as much as possible as quickly as possible.  These people have no commitment to the environment or to future generations.  As I have said, for them it is a question of how much they can get and how fast they can get it. Fortunately, these people are in a minority and very few of them are in the farming community.  This attitude tends to be found more so among those involved in industry and manufacturing but again I have to say that, thankfully, they are a minority in those areas also. The only way to change this type of attitude is to hit these people where it hurts, that is in their pockets.  The Bill will go a long way towards doing that with the proposed massive increases in fines. However, fines alone will not change attitudes if a person does not think there is some chance he will be detected and punished.  We can have all the legislation we like on the Statute Book, but if a <Col N="685" /> person thinks the chances of that legislation being implemented are slim then the law will have little or no effect.</P>
    <P>In this regard, enforcement and increased vigilance by local authorities and fisheries boards will be most important. The vigilance of the general public would be most helpful.  I suggest that a scheme be adopted under which an officer of a local authority would be designated a pollution officer who would encourage the public to report cases of alleged pollution.  That would be a great help.</P>
    <P>I have made my views known on the question of allowing people to take out court orders against polluters.  The move I have suggested would be a reasonable compromise.  It is vitally important to start the process of changing people's attitudes to pollution at an early age. Indeed, instead of trying to change attitudes we should be trying to form them in children at an early age.  In primary schools efforts are being made through environmental study classes to give children a sense of pride in their local environment. However, much more could be done.  Secondary schools pay little or no attention to this matter and that is a great pity.  I hope that the new junior certificate will provide for a continuation of the environmental studies programme and that civics classes will be used to encourage young people to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the benefits that accrue when attitudes are changed in regard to the environment.  The town of Trim has won the national tidy towns award on three occasions, the only town of its size to have achieved that distinction, and one of the reasons the town won those awards was the absence of litter in it.  Visitors to the town have often commented on the absence of litter and the civic pride that exists in the town. The local council can take their share of credit for this but the major share of the credit must go to the local tidy towns committee who over the years successfully instilled a sense of community pride in the people of the town.  At primary school level young people were <Col N="686" /> made aware of their local environment and the importance of keeping it clean. The campaign of that organisation over the years has proved very successful.  I did not mention those details simply because I wanted to boost Trim but to emphasise how important it is to form attitudes in young people.  Too often we adopt the attitude that it is not possible to change Irish people, that we will be always that way and that everything will be all right at some stage.</P>
    <P>More than ever the attitude that everything will be all right at some stage or that we should leave things as they are must be changed.  We should not accept anything but the highest standard from everybody.  There is evidence that the farming community accept this and the notion that the farmer is the guardian of the countryside.  In a survey completed at the end of 1988 the notion of farmers being the guardians of the countryside was overwhelmingly supported by the farming community.  In fact, only 18 per cent did not agree with the notion that they are and should be the guardians of the countryside.  I cannot over emphasise the importance of education in the context of prevention of pollution.  It is vitally important to note that the drop in pollution and reported fish kills in 1988 was a result of a programme of education which was pursued by Teagasc and the IFA in 1987.  The major focus of attention at that time was to educate the farming community who showed their concern about the problem.  More than 300 seminars attracted in excess of 20,000 farmers and a further 30,000 farmers attended events at which pollution control exhibits or demonstrations were staged.  In addition, almost 12,000 farms were visited and 45 per cent of them were found to be in the medium to high risk categories so far as pollution was concerned.</P>
    <P>Although approximately 5,000 of the farms visited were in the high risk area very few prosecutions were instituted. That was not because of any negligence on the part of the local authorities or the fisheries boards but because the advice and assistance given by the experts was <Col N="687" /> followed by the farmers.  That is a clear indication of the reasonable attitude that would be adopted by farmers if the proper approach was made to them. Farmers have shown that they are as concerned as everybody else about the dangers of pollution.</P>
    <P>The effects of the positive educational programme embarked on in 1987 can be seen in the reduction in the number of pollution incidents reported in 1988.  It is an indication that a positive approach to the problem, and the provision of advice, can be just as effective, if not more so, as huge penalties.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 21 which permits local authorities to introduce by-laws to restrict certain agricultural activities. I have no doubt that that will prove to be one of the most difficult provisions to implement.  It is designed to do no more than enable local authorities to take action in regard to farm pollution and it is similar to the action it can take in relation to other forms of pollution.  It would be helpful if the Minister of State would spell out more clearly the circumstances in which she would envisage that provision being used.  It is my view that it was included to deal with the more severe cases of pollution.  We are all aware of the damage done to Lough Sheelin which has been badly polluted over the years.  I can see this provision being used to deal with that problem but I do not envisage it being used very widely. Before the provision is implemented the Minister should give some consideration to the preparation of management agreements which are currently in vogue in other EC countries, particularly the UK. I am referring to voluntary agreements between a public body, like a local authority, and farmers to manage lands in a certain way for environmental reasons and usually for a financial consideration. There is evidence that such agreements would find acceptance among the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not designed to get at farmers and I say that as a Member who represents a farming community.  It is intended to deal with water pollution <Col N="688" /> from all sources.  There is an emphasis in it on the farming community simply because they were not adequately covered in the 1977 Act.  The final point I would like to make is that it is more in the interests of farmers to maintain our clean green image if we are to continue to develop our agri-food sector.  In the long run it will be the farmers who will benefit most from a clean environment and from producing food in a clear pollution free environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time the Fine Gael Party have recognised the need to update our water pollution legislation to ensure that we have a modern legal framework to prevent water pollution and to ensure that our natural resources are protected in the interests of the entire community.  The massive number of fish kills in the summer of 1987 clearly emphasised the need for a change in our laws.  Unfortunately, this Bill was not published until January of this year.  What is more unfortunate is that this Bill has made very limited progress.  We are only taking the Second Stage of the Bill in the Dáil this week because the Bill, when originally published, contained a number of serious defects.  In effect this resulted in the measure going on political ice for some six months while the senior Minister in the Department of the Environment, Deputy Flynn, sorted out the problems he created for himself.</P>
      <P>If this Bill had been properly drafted it should have been passed into law prior to the last general election.  The person who has to bear the full blame for the fact that the required legislation did not so pass into law is Deputy Flynn, the Minister for the Environment.  It is because of the decisions taken by him, which I will refer to in a few moments, that we have a defective measure before us.  In fact we had the unprecedented step &mdash; I have not seen this happen before in the Dáil &mdash; when the Minister of State at the end of her speech in moving the Bill had to recite the various amendments she intends to move to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be ungenerous in <Col N="689" /> making that reference.  I merely wish to illustrate that it is now accepted on all sides that the Bill as originally published is defective.  Nevertheless I welcome the fact that the Minister of State indicated in her speech that certain amendments are to be put forward by the Government on Committee Stage.  I welcome it particularly because out of our concern to get this measure back on track and through the legislative process we took the unprecedented step in the spring of last year of publishing a Bill, not simply a critique of a Bill which is a very easy thing for an Opposition party to do.  We are all aware that the job of Opposition parties is to pour scorn on the Government even when they get it right.  I never believed in that type of Opposition and I have never engaged in it.  I do believe that when things are got wrong there is a duty on an Opposition party to indicate how things can be got back on track.  We took the unprecedented step of having discussions with a wide variety of groups on the provisions contained in the original Bill and in drafting amendments which we circulated at that time to indicate how the Bill should be changed to ensure that, first, it would be effective and, second, wrongful convictions could not be obtained under it.</P>
    <P>It is very important, and Deputy Harney, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, and I will be in agreement with this, that we put into real practice the principle that the polluter pays and that this has a meaningful legislative base.  It is equally important that we do not put into practice a system whereby someone who is not responsible for causing pollution ends up being held liable for it through our court system.  I welcome the fact that it appears that many of the amendments which Fine Gael put forward are going to be taken on board.  Of course we await the detail of the Minister's proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister made reference to the fact that 1988 was a better year, in the context of river and lake pollution, then 1987.  That is true but this year has been a disaster and I do not <Col N="690" /> think we should minimise the extent of that disaster.  It derives directly from Government policy in two areas.  In the first nine months of this year 108 fish kills were reported, almost the entire amount of fish kills in the disastrous year of 1987. According to the Department of the Marine &mdash; the Government's own figure &mdash; 35,000 fish have died in our rivers and lakes as a result of pollution.  Those fish did not die because people had been fishing vigorously, they died as a result of pollution.  This is a very illustrative example of how the Government's rhetoric of environmental concern is sadly lacking in substance.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that this type of gigantic disaster, in the context of fish kills in our rivers and lakes, a disaster experienced across the length and breadth of this country but which did not receive the same attention that the fish kills of 1987 received, does not recur in 1990.  Let this be the last year when we experience this problem.  While it may be true that some of our environmental problems, even in the context of river and lake pollution, are not as great as those experienced by some of our European Community neighbours our problems have increased in recent years.  For a country dependent on its tourism industry, that sells itself as an environmentally clean country, a country to which people are welcome to come to do some fishing, a country which sells a clean food image and where the agri-business forms a very important part of the economy and employment creation opportunities, it is essential that the image of a green, clean Ireland is a reality and not just a public relations exercise. If it becomes merely a public relations exercise it will not be too long before people outside this country cop-on to the falsity of our approach.</P>
    <P>The level of fish kills this year must never again be repeated.  I get worried when I see the Minister for the Environment as he did in the debate on the Estimates last week giving himself a pat on the back for his environmental concern. When we examine the problems caused by pollution &mdash; in this Bill we are concerned with water pollution &mdash; such <Col N="691" /> as those caused by the smog problem in Dublin and by other types of pollution and if we consider the Government's failure to tackle these problems, I am afraid that the pat on the back is merely a self serving piece of political public relations. I hope this Bill and the approach the Government may take in the future will ensure that next year there will not be a repetition of the problems we have experienced during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>In what way has Government policy contributed to our problems?  First, there was lethargy in producing this legislation which is so badly needed and, secondly, when it was published initially it was seriously defective.  The Government failed to extend the farm grants scheme to the agricultural sector nationwide as requested in order to enable farmers who wanted to tackle the pollution problem to have the financial wherewithal to tackle it.  The smaller farmers particularly did not have the money to put into place new farm practices which they were anxious to adopt so as to deal with the possible causes of pollution deriving from their farms.</P>
    <P>Last spring Deputy Avril Doyle who was Fine Gael spokesperson on the Environment, and I called on the Government to take the financial initiative, but they did not take it until it was too late to impact on the problems we had this summer.  That was a singular failure.</P>
    <P>There is an omission in the speech made by the Minister of State introducing this Bill.  The Minister of State said she did not wish to deal in detail with the sections but that we would deal with them on Committee Stage in the normal way. It is quite usual on Second Stage for a Minister to give a general overview of what is in each section.  It is curious that that was not done, but there is a reason and it is that the Government did not want to highlight the fact that under this legislation they are abolishing the Water Pollution Advisory Council that was established under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  The Government never gave <Col N="692" /> any explanation when this Bill was published by a Fianna Fáil minority Government nor have the Coalition given any explanation yet as to why they are abolishing that council.  We know why Fianna Fáil wanted to abolish it.  They wanted to abolish it at the beginning of this year because they did not like independent bodies which would make critical comment on environmental issues. That was the Government that had abolished An Foras Forbartha.  That was the Government that got members of the environmental research unit to sign the necessary letter or form under the Official Secrets Acts not to make public comment of an independent nature as employees of An Foras Forbartha had done in the past.  The Water Pollution Advisory Council produced excellent annual reports detailing the work they had undertaken and the problems in the area of water pollution.  They had never been shy when it came to criticising the Government of the day &mdash; no matter what political persuasion &mdash; for failing to tackle pollution problems.  Because of that the Water Pollution Advisory Council were seen by Fianna Fáil as a threat.  The previous Government knew that if that council remained in being, they would be subject to independent criticism from a body they could not control and whose comment might politically expose some of the environmental rhetoric.</P>
    <P>This Bill formally abolishes the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Someone might ask if they are only being abolished now why they have not been making independent comments since 1987 about the Government's environmental approach to water pollution issues.  What is not generally known is that members of the Water Pollution Advisory Council, which represented a cross-section of bodies which had an interest in water pollution, were not re-appointed at the end of 1986 although section 2 of the 1977 Act required the establishment of the council and provided for the appointment of persons to that council.  The membership of the council ran out at the end of 1986, and when there was a change of Government in 1987 the Fianna Fáil Government did not appoint anyone to the council. <Col N="693" /> Although, in theory, they continued to exist in law, the reality is that the council ceased to have a membership when the Fianna Fáil minority Government came into office in 1987.  The Minister by sleight of hand failed to comply with this statutory obligation, and did not appoint anybody to the independent body established under the Water Pollution Act, 1977, to ensure that an overview was taken of local government and departmental policy and of the action taken by the various sectors in the economy, be it the industrial or agricultural sectors, in the area of water pollution.</P>
    <P>Where is the environmental concern when compared with the quality of the Minister's action, or inaction?  A Minister who is genuinely concerned about the problems of water pollution would surely have appointed members to the independent Water Pollution Advisory Council. The Minister might even have considered that bringing this Bill into this House was such a political embarrassment that to talk about the commitment to tackle the problems of water pollution without having appointed members to the council might have led to a rush to do something.  If the previous Government did not do it, why did not the new Coalition in July 1989 appoint members to the council?  Here was a Government that since July had been heavy on the rhetoric but weak on the action.  It is a bit like the advert we watch on the television &mdash; heavy on the mayonnaise. Sometimes we confuse rhetoric with action taken.  The good old press release comes from the Government Information Services promising to do this and that, and far too often the media are confused into thinking that meaningful action is being taken.</P>
    <P>The promise to do something is far too frequently confused with action.  There is a difference between promising something and actually doing it.  Here is a classic example.  Here we have a Minister who for 12 months, got away with expressing concern about water pollution, yet not a single report mentioned that the Water Pollution Advisory Council had ceased to exist despite Members <Col N="694" /> on this side of the House trying to draw public attention to that fact and, by Dáil question, trying to force the Minister to make the necessary appointments.</P>
    <P>When responding to this debate I would ask Minister Harney to explain why the Water Pollution Advisory Council is now being abolished and if she is aware that when this Bill was published industry and farming organisations said they wanted the Water Pollution Advisory Council kept in place and made effective and wanted people appointed to it. The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, or her senior colleague may reply that an environment protection agency has been promised.  There is a difference between promising something and producing legislation.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House published legislation to establish an environment protection agency some three weeks ago and were derided by the Government. We were told that this agency did not have teeth.  It had teeth all right; it was an agency that, in the context of serious pollution could institute criminal proceedings. For example, if an industry caused a major chemical pollution incident the company concerned could have been fined £1 million and jail sentences of up to five years could have been imposed. We were told that this agency would not have teeth.  About the only thing this agency could not have done was to bring court proceedings resulting in capital punishment against the perpetrators of pollution.  I presume the Government are not suggesting that.  We produced a comprehensive Bill and under it the functions of the Water Pollution Advisory Council could now be exercised, in effect, by the environment protection agency as we had constituted it.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Government are abolishing the advisory council.  We do not know the detail of what the Government propose the environment protection agency will do in the area of water pollution, although one would think we did from all the press coverage this week. The Government issued an outline of their proposals on the environment protection agency &mdash; an outline, incidentally, <Col N="695" /> published purely for public relations purposes, a document made available to the press at a press conference by the Government of the day, who did not even have the courtesy to make that document available to the Opposition spokespeople on the Environment.  All I know of this document is what I have read of it in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>When Fine Gael contacted the Government Information Service an hour after the press conference was held to get a copy of the Government's proposals we were told there was no document; we were lied to because that night on our television screens we could see all of the invitees to the press conference turning over the document.  Is this a Government who are serious about environmental issues or are they more serious about public relations exercises?</P>
    <P>What does this document say this agency will do?  First, we do not have Government legislation.  If the Government are serious about this environmental protection agency I trust they will support the Fine Gael measure when we move it in Private Members' Time next week.  We are told that the agency will control and regulate development likely to pose major risk to environmental quality, will engage in general monitoring of environmental quality and will have direct responsibility for licensing, monitoring and enforcing functions in relation to classes of new development with potential for serious pollution, including air, water, noise and waste.  The functions assigned initially to the agency will cover the most pressing environmental problems involving aspects of air and water pollution control.</P>
    <P>That is what was said in the public relations handout designed to suggest that the Government were doing something of substance in this area.  What did the Minister tell us?  She said there was need for a fully integrated approach to air and water quality protection and waste management.  We all agree with that.  We need to ensure that proper safeguards are imposed and are seen to operate.  She <Col N="696" /> said that for those reasons the Government were committed to bringing forward separate legislation establishing an independent environmental agency and that that will have implications for the role of local authorities in water pollution control.  The Minister went on to say that it was her intention to consult with all elements involved in developing her detailed proposals for the agency.</P>
    <P>In other words, there are no detailed proposals yet for the agency.  Despite the public relations hype this week we are only at the stage of debating this Water Pollution Bill.  The Minister has told us about a few amendments the Government intend to make to the Bill which are along the lines proposed by Fine Gael over six months ago but she is not able to tell us in what way the environmental protection agency the Government say they are committed to will impact on this legislation.</P>
    <P>What role will the environmental protection agency have <i>vis-à-vis</i> this legislation? Will they be able to initiate any prosecutions?  Will they have any licensing function?  Will they have any monitoring function?  If so, why are we not introducing amendments?  Why are we not told of Government proposed specific amendments to be made to this Bill on Committee Stage to take account of the fact that an environmental protection agency are being put in place?  The reason is that the Government have not yet worked out what the agency will do, what the detail of their structure will be or how they will interact with local authorities and central government.  They certainly will not do what the water pollution advisory council could do.  On the basis of the Government's announcement the agency will not be independent in the manner envisaged by the Fine Gael Bill.  I will deal with that in more detail next week. There is only one point I will make in that regard today, that is, that the agency will not be independent to the extent it seems; they will not be able to comment on the approach taken by Government in tackling the pollution problems and criticise it openly.  It appears they will not have any specific function with regard <Col N="697" /> to recommending changes in legislation where they are required.  What the Government have announced is a watered down.  Mickey Mouse agency without indicating when we are going to have the legislation, what functions they will have or how they will interact with local authorities, even in the one specific area of water pollution that we are debating in this House today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to have to explain to us in some detail exactly what role she envisages for the agency in the area of water pollution, why the water pollution advisory council are being abolished, why no-one was appointed to the council after the Government came into office in 1987 and why it is that the Government are afraid to put on the record of this House the detail of the press release for their press conference this week on the environmental protection agency and why they are simply putting on the record of this House the general comment that an agency is a good idea and that they will consult with people to discover what functions it should perform.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>One of the defects of this Bill as published is that it seeks to remove what has become known as the good defence provision in the 1977 Act.  The good defence provision, as it is euphemistically referred to, is a provision in the 1977 Act designed to ensure that people who are not responsible for pollution incidents could not be wrongly convicted of those incidents.  Because of the manner in which that can be interpreted there are circumstances where people who can be truly held responsible for pollution incidents may not be properly brought before the courts or if they are a court proceeding may be unsuccessful.  To tackle that problem the Minister sought to amend the working in section 3 of the Bill as published; but the amendment the Minister introduced could create a situation whereby somebody who had done everything practically and humanly possible to prevent a pollution incident could still find himself before the courts. That is clearly not an appropriate way to approach matters.  I welcome the fact that <Col N="698" /> the Minister has, in a general way, indicated that the amendment Fine Gael proposed last spring to resolve this problem will be tabled by the Government so that that type of situation does not arise.  That is of considerable importance.  It is also welcome that the Minister is prepared to take on board some amendments to clarify the application of section 20 which could cause similar problems.  It is not reasonable, in the agricultural area or in any other area, that someone be liable to criminal or civil action in the courts as a result of a pollution incident taking place on someone else's land that results in that pollution flowing on to the innocent person's land.  It is not acceptable that that innocent person be prosecuted.  Equally it is not acceptable, if a farmer's neighbour does something that specifically causes a pollution incident, that the farmer across whose land a river or lake crosses should find himself in court, even though he could not prevent nor could he envisage the pollution incident happening.</P>
    <P>The drafting of this legislation has meant that amendments have had to be made to it.  I reject the approach taken by Deputy Gilmore of The Workers' Party. Fine Gael are interested in ensuring that we have on the Statute Book comprehensive and effective legislation.  We are not interested, for the sake of making some political point, in having innocent people brought to court accused of a criminal offence when they had no responsibility for an incident that has occurred and that they could have done nothing to prevent.  It is too trite to suggest that Fine Gael want to, in some way, water down this Bill.  We want an effective measure but a measure is not effective if it results in innocent people being convicted.  I would have expected that Deputy Gilmore would have recognised that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through the detail, just as the Minister did not want to go through it, of every section in the Bill. We will do that on Committee Stage. However, I want to raise one thing with the Minister which she refers to as one of the areas in which the Government <Col N="699" /> intend to bring in an amendment.  I am not sure what approach the Government intend to take in this area.  Section 21, to which other speakers have referred, makes extensive provisions for local authorities to make by-laws that could impinge directly in a dramatic way on the ordinary running of a farm.  By-laws can become legally binding and render a person under this legislation liable to criminal prosecution and conviction.  This can happen with no consultative process having to be engaged in as regards the context of the by-laws.  In the way this section is drafted the by-laws are rather odd.  Some people would question the necessity for by-laws at all in this area once you can make use of the other criminal-civil provisions contained in the legislation in the first place.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>If we are to have the by-laws it is highly logical that a local authority can prepare draft by-laws which then go to the Department of the Environment, are then confirmed by the Department and could, thereafter, render somebody liable to criminal prosecution, although it is also provided that once they are made objections can be raised to them and they may be amended thereafter.  It would seem a far more logical approach with regard to section 21 to provide for the publication of draft by-laws by a local authority and that those by-laws then be available for public comment.  I suggest that after 60 days the by-laws should then either be approved by the Minister or approved by him subject to amendments following his consideration of any representations made in regard to the draft by-laws.  It makes no sense to make them and subsequently amend them.  I think the correct approach is they should be draft by-laws published for public comment, with that public comment being sent to the Minister, and the Minister then having options to approve them or amend them or return the draft to the local authority suggesting amendments to be considered by the local authority.  That would make a great deal more sense.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to have new pollution <Col N="700" /> legislation on the Statute Book; it is another thing to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to enforce it.  I want the Minister to clarify what role she envisages an environment protection agency would play in this area.  In the Fine Gael Bill it is quite clear that local authorities could continue to bring proceedings, but the environment protection agency would have a residual power, where a local authority have not acted and should act, to intervene and bring proceedings under the water pollution legislation.  Indeed, the environment protection agency under the Fine Gael Bill would have other powers.  The Minister should clarify the position.</P>
    <P>She should also clarify whether the local authorities are going to have the manpower and resources to apply this legislation in practice.  All too often legislation is passed in this House and thereafter everyone assumes it is operating but often it is not operating because local authorities, who are given the functions under the legislation, lack the finance and, therefore, lack the manpower to apply the legislation or police it.  What additional expense does the Minister envisage local authorities throughout the country will incur in working this Bill? Does she envisage any additional financial allocation will be made to local authorities to ensure that this Bill can be worked properly?  That is of importance.</P>
    <P>It is important for another reason.  Any local authority who bring proceedings under this legislation will do so in good faith, in the interests of protecting the environment and to ensure that our pollution laws are working.  We are aware, and previous speakers have referred to it, that various organisations including the IFA and the ICMSA have expressed concern that local authorities, if they are to receive the fines that are levied under this Bill, may act in some way as bounty hunters.  I do not believe local authorities will so act, but there is a danger that if local authorities are not given the resources to operate the Bill they may take the view that the Bill either should not be operated or should be operated in circumstances where, no matter what <Col N="701" /> type of incident occurs, the maximum fines are always sought.  The protection that everyone has against a local authority behaving in an arbitrary way is that the courts have to make decisions about fines imposed or orders made under the legislation and if the initial court hearing does not result in a fair decision being made there is the entitlement to look for an appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister would set many minds at case if she would indicate how the local authorities are going to find the funds to operate this legislation.  Where are they to come from?  Will she also indicate to the House what expenditure each local authority incur currently in operating the 1977 Act and what additional expenditure is envisaged will be incurred in operating the new Bill when it becomes law?</P>
    <P>One of the problems in the area of water pollution has been that on occasions the local authorities have been the polluters themselves.  Local authorities are not always all that good in the manner in which they exercise their own functions.  That is often very surprising, considering the policing functions they themselves are given.  The Minister is right in saying the majority of pollutions, of course, are not caused by local authorities; no one is suggesting they are, but the numbers that are caused by local authorities should not occur.  No local authority should ever have to be brought before the courts by a fishery board for polluting our rivers or lakes.  This year we have had instances of that happening.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to clarify what body will in future take action to ensure local authorities do not themselves cause pollution. I believe the environment protection agency I want to see established under a Fine Gael Bill, on an all-party basis, without political contention, should have the role of policing the local authorities and policing Government Departments.  I do not believe the fishery board should have that role.  They should have the role of developing our fisheries industry and resolving other problems in relation to stocking rivers and exercising their other functions.  On occasion there <Col N="702" /> is, by the very nature of things, a personal relationship between the fishery officer and the environmental officers in local authorities in particular areas.</P>
    <P>To ensure properly that some local authorities get their act together and that they are not guilty of pollution incidents, it is of considerable importance that prosecutions or action against local authorities to force them to make good the damage done as a result of pollution caused by their activities should be taken by the environment protection agency.  I think the local authorities will take their responsibilities a good deal more seriously if that is the case.  I want an environment protection agency to monitor the manner in which the local authorities operate this legislation.  At present, some local authorities are more effective than others in applying the 1977 Act.  Some take their duties in this area more seriously than others.  They will all adopt a uniform approach only if the manner in which the local authorities apply the law and the number of personnel they make available to ensure pollution incidents are not taking place are properly monitored.  Annually, we have a report publicly available indicating where the problems lie, what local authorities are fulfilling their functions, what local authorities are not, a report which highlights which local authorities have themselves been responsible for incidents of pollution that have resulted in fish kills or created other problems in our lakes and rivers.  I invite the Minister to take that suggestion on board and to clarify the position as she sees it operating under this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of other issues that arise under this Bill, many of which we are going to tease out on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to respond to some of the things I am raising, when we come to the end of Second Stage.  If possible, it is very important that we complete Second Stage of this Bill before the Christmas recess.  If we do not complete it today, and many Deputies who have an interest in this legislation want to contribute, I invite the Minister to ensure <Col N="703" /> that through the party Whips this Bill will come back into this House next week with a view to completing Second Stage so that we can take Committee Stage early in the new year and tease out some of the problems I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents another important step on the road to ensuring the preservation and conservation of one of Ireland's natural and most significant assets.  Apart from the specific provisions, to which I would like to refer in due course, the Bill's significance can be reflected as part of the chain of developments derived from the Government's commitment to and acknowledgement of the importance of the contribution which a secure and clean environment makes to the economy of this country.</P>
      <P>I know that many can point to individual incidents over recent years where we have suffered nationally at the hands of indiscriminate polluters where personal interest, be it in the case of individuals or individual companies, has taken precedence over the interests of the community at large.  I believe that the publicity attaching to those events is the most positive evidence of a community no longer prepared to accept the interests of the individual or the company over that of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like any modern business we must accept nationally that a change or an influence in one area of the environment causes effects in many other interdependent elements.  Water pollution can, for example, affect the health of the community, the tourism industry and the image of the country generally with attendant consequences in all sectors of the economy.  I am therefore heartened by the Minister's positive approach to this legislation, an approach which I believe should be mirrored throughout this House, and the country generally, in pointing not so much to the detrimental effects of water pollution, of which the entire community is abundantly aware, but rather to the engendering of an environmentally conscious spirit in the <Col N="704" /> community, aware of the importance to the country of a safe and green environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland stands in geographical isolation from its neighbours in Europe which, as we are aware, has had its difficulties and its blessings.  We may have been slow to count our blessings in the past, but there is no excuse today not to be conscious of the strategic advantages we possess through our environmental heritage, particularly through the importance attached by the Taoiseach to this heritage and addressed through successive measures aimed at ensuring the conservation of that heritage for our children. No party, however it may name itself, could possibly propose and see through to implementation such a comprehensive programme of measures aimed at the conservation of our environmental heritage, such as that proposed and implemented by the present and the previous Government.  These are not policies of lip services to the green concept riding on the bandwagon of developments elsewhere but real and true commitments, evidenced by developmental policies capable of implementation and to which significant resources have been allocated.  These developments are the real signs of a truly green party.  The strategy and clear focus of this nation must be on developing and enhancing that consciousness among the community at large, that we in this country possess a green heritage, be it 40 or 4,000 shades, the envy of many of our closest neighbours, and for that reason &mdash; if for no other &mdash; a prized and valuable possession for the entire community and therefore worthy of significant support in order to maintain it.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that with the current consciousness and appreciation of the value of such assets by all its peoples, the European Community would move towards developing a concept of acknowledging the important contribution which pollution free environments contribute to the wellbeing of the Community generally in a practical way.  It is not sufficient that the environment be regulated and guarded, we must look <Col N="705" /> towards developing pro-active approaches which take account not only of conservation needs but also of the needs of the communities living within these areas.</P>
    <P>So many of our neighbours lament the devastation of industrial development and its consequences for the environment and on environmental amenities.  They look to countries, such as ours, to conserve that remaining unspoiled asset. That policy must also take account of the sacrifices necessary to maintain that heritage and produce practical and real support for communities, such as ours, to ensure the conservation of that resource for future generations.</P>
    <P>I believe that a successful future conservation policy lies in the adoption of real supportive measures capable of supporting those communities which take action to safeguard the environment.  It is possible that through the adoption of a green charter, or some such concept for localities capable of exhibiting environmentally safe standards within specified guidelines, a support package could be developed which would provide the means to maintain those standards.  Such support should be capable of ensuring that those localities need not attract environmentally substandard industries or processes and, if necessary, provide sufficient resources to ensure that any industry can adopt the most safe methods of processing or treating waste and maintaining the highest standards always.</P>
    <P>I would also like to stress that the conservation of our environment is not a preservation process whereby we lock the gate and throw away the key.  It is a dynamic process, an inter-active process capable of promoting and sustaining industrial development which co-exists in harmony with the environment, agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and, indeed, all industries have a significant place in that development.  We must satisfy ourselves that the basic criteria for that harmonious co-existence are adhered to and engendered in all those engaged in industry so that they are acutely aware of and appreciate the consequences of pollution on the community <Col N="706" /> at large.  Such, indeed, is the spirit under lying the European impact directive.</P>
    <P>There is no change to be had in decrying industrial development, which we know is necessary for the economy, but we can be choosy and we can be safe and we can impose the strictest regulations on industry.  In that scenario there is every reason to believe that we can muster even greater support for a continuation of environmentally conscious policies which safeguard the heritage of our country and that of Europe.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the vast potential we have today to attract huge numbers of our European neighbours on the basis of our green assets, water, air, amenities and the many other attractive features of our unique cultural and environmental heritage.  We know that our current visitors marvel and are rightly envious of those advantages which we ourselves, perhaps, at times do not sufficiently appreciate or exploit.  In this latter context, that of exploitation, it is time to recognise the fullest developmental potential of those resources and the employment industries and amenities which they can sustain.  It has never been a more appropriate time to do so, and as the European Community moves towards ever stringent regulations relating to the conservation of the environment, it is we who must stay at the forefront in promoting those policies and, more particularly, in adhering to them completely.  This Bill is a significant and timely message to our Community partners that we intend to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill which modifies and extends the present arrangements for the control of water pollution is both necessary and timely.  As the Minister has indicated previously, it is not a single measure so much as part of an on-going programme of measures aimed at combating water pollution and part of an integrated programme involving the targeting of resources and the areas most urgently in need of attention.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 nearly £300 million has been invested by local authorities in up-grading local sewage treatment and disposal facilities.  These resources have shown <Col N="707" /> substantial returns in terms of a reduction in the pollution of rivers and streams. The allocation of £69 million alone in 1989 for the sanitary services capital programme will enable the maintenance of this drive towards pollution abatement.</P>
    <P>Regarding my own county of Wicklow, and particularly with regard to the agricultural implications in this Bill, I would like to make some comment.  Following the widespread evidence of fish kills during the summer of 1987 a programme of measures to combat water pollution was introduced by the Minister for the Environment for implementation by the local authorities, the fishery boards, the farm advisory bodies and, most importantly, the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures there was a dramatic downturn in the number of reported pollution incidents during 1988. Specifically in County Wicklow, the number of new cases investigated reduced from 91 in 1987 to 35 in 1988. Furthermore, cases of agricultural origin accounted for only 18 of the 35, which represents a sharp drop from 73 per cent to 51 per cent in the occurrence of agricultural pollution as a percentage of the total cases investigated.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the number of fish kills in County Wicklow fell from six in 1987 to two in 1988.  Of these, one was very minor and little supportive evidence was found; the second was the result of diesel spillage from a farmyard rather than agricultural pollution <i>per se.</i> Overall, between late 1984 and the end of March 1989, Wicklow County Council personnel visited a total of 385 farms in the county; of these 123 visits were in response to complaints under the Water Pollution Act; 116 resulted from recent changes in planning legislation, with the balance of 146 being due to the farm survey.  Categorising these in terms of pollution risk, 32 per cent were assessed as low risk, 37 per cent as medium risk and 31 per cent as high risk.  The same council followed up initial visits either by issuing advisory letters or by section 12 notices.  Most recent inspections show that farmers are, by and large, taking their responsibilities very <Col N="708" /> seriously indeed.  Remedial works have been completed in many cases and further works are in progress in most other cases.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this Bill are general and specific.  The principal Act, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, is now almost 12 years old.  As it was the first of its kind, so to speak, some of its provisions were set out in fairly broad terms which need to be tidied up or corrected in the light of subsequent experience.  The current Bill is an amending Bill and, like most amending legislation, seeks, by clarifying and expanding, to move from the broad and vague to the more precise.  Many of the provisions in the 1989 Bill, compared to the 1977 Act, are fulfilling precisely this function.</P>
    <P>That is the general need, but the particular need goes back to 1987, the year of the fish kill, and the consequent promise by the Minister for the Environment to bring in amending legislation which would prove to be &ldquo;a powerful deterrent to those who, through their carelessness and greed, risk destroying one of the nation's most valuable resources&rdquo;.  In other words, the polluters were to pay for their pollution.  The 1989 Bill began life as the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1987, and its principal measures, particularly the proposed increase in maximum fines, have been common knowledge for some time.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> devoted most of its issue of April 29 to a series of articles on the new pollution Bill.  While the articles highlight much in the new Bill which is of real concern to the farming community, some of the information was misleading, due to over-reaction or a genuine misinterpretation of its provisions. Accordingly, before dealing with what is new in the legislation I should like to comment on what is not new, provisions which either remain unchanged or are clarified, tidied up or expanded without posing any major threat.</P>
    <P>The general prohibition under section 3 of the 1977 Act, that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter water, remains unchanged and, <Col N="709" /> while there has been comment to the contrary, the new Bill does not broaden or change in any way the definitions of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; or &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo;, both of which were more than adequately wide ranging in the original Act and which are now restated as follows: (1) &ldquo;waters&rdquo; are defined under section 1 of the 1977 Act as &ldquo;any [or any part of any] river, stream, lake, canal, reservoir, aquifer, pond, watercourse or other inland waters, whether natural or artificial; (2) &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; is defined in the same section as &ldquo;any poisonous or noxious matter and any substance, the entry or discharge of which into any waters is liable to render those or any other water, poisonous or injurious to fish spawning grounds or the food of any fish or to render such waters harmful or detrimental to public health or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or recreational uses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been stated that section 9 of the new Bill extends the powers of local authorities to regulate or restrict agricultural practices without provision for the farmers to appeal.  Section 9 states that where it appears to a local authority that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent or control pollution of waters, it may serve notice in writing under this section on any person having the custody or control of any polluting matter on premises in its functional area, in other words, the section 12 notice has a general requirement to specify the measures which the local authority consider necessary to prevent entry of polluting matter to waters.  Section 9 of the new Bill expands the wording to enable any such notice to (a) regulate or restrict or make subject to conditions the carrying on of any activity, practice or use of land and (b) require the provision, relocation or alteration of facilities for the collection or storage of polluting matters.</P>
    <P>Section 12 notices issued by local authorities contain new wording which merely confirms the sort of conditions which are already being imposed, for example, in relation to land spreading &mdash; minimum distance from watercourses and prohibition on winter spreading &mdash; farmyard draining arrangements or the detailing <Col N="710" /> of sizes, etc., for silage slabs and slurry tanks.  While it has been implied elsewhere that there is no provision for appeal against such notices, the opposite is the case.  If anything, the appeal provision is now more flexibly in favour of the appellant than it was under the terms of the original section 12, in that it makes specific provisions for amending the time for completion of measures.  It also allows for the possibility of the notice being revoked.</P>
    <P>Similarly, section 17 of the new Bill is a substitution for section 23 of the principal Act and deals with the issuing of section 23 notices and the information which may be sought by the authorities from the person on whom the notice is served.  There is little in the new section beyond what has become the established practice.</P>
    <P>Section 10 relates to the power of the local authorities to prevent and abate pollution, in particular, to take measures and to recover the cost of those measures from the polluter, and is in substitution of section 13 of the 1977 Act.  While the provisions of the original section 13 could be invoked where it appears to a local authority that urgent measures are necessary the wording of the new section 10 is: &ldquo;Where it appears to a local authority or ......it is necessary to do so, it may take such measures.....&rdquo; Some concern has been expressed at the deletion of the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  I would consider it implicit in the new wording that measures which are considered to be necessary are, of their very nature, deemed to be urgent.  In practice I do not envisage this new wording as being overly significant in the day-to-day application of the provisions of this new Bill.  If there is a shift of emphasis in the provisions of this section it is in favour of farmers in relation to the recovery of costs by local authorities. In the original section 13 the wording is reasonably clearcut, but the new section 10 creates a potential grey area in that it incoporates the phrase &ldquo;to the extent &mdash; if any &mdash; that any measures taken by a local authority..... were necessitated by the acts or omissions of a person....&rdquo; in other words, there <Col N="711" /> appears to be a greater onus on a local authority to prove the extent of a polluter's culpability.</P>
    <P>Of much greater significance in regard to local authorities' interventionist powers, section 7 of the new Bill &mdash; which replaces section 10 of the 1977 Act &mdash; deals with the right of a local authority to apply for a court order directing a polluter to mitigate or remedy the effects of pollution, including the replacement of fish stocks, the restoration of spawning grounds and so on and the additional right of the local authority to intervene directly and take any steps themselves specified in the order which have not been complied with, the cost of such steps being recovered as a simple contract debt.  I would agree that there may be some extreme measures implied here. However, it must be emphasised that such measures are effectively contained within existing legislation &mdash; witness the case that occurred in Limerick some years ago when a farmer was ordered by the court to pay for the restocking of a river under section 10 of the 1977 Act which section 7 of this Bill replaces.</P>
    <P>What is significantly new in this Bill is that, whereas heretofore only a local authority, the Minister for Fisheries or a board of conservators could apply for a court order under the provisions of section 10 of the principal Act, the provisions of this Bill extend that right to any person regardless of whether he or she has an interest in the waters concerned. I will revert to this point later in the context of other new provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Probably the most contentious section of the Bill is section 21 which provides for the making of by-laws on the part of local authorities or the Minister for the Environment to prohibit or regulate the carrying on of specified agricultural activities.   The potential consequences of the provisions of this section can be gleaned when one considers that such by-laws can be applied to part or the entire functional area of a local authority and <Col N="712" /> when one considers the range of agricultural activities to which they will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (1) (a), (b) and (c) read:</P>
    <P>(a)  the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of any polluting matter used in connection with, or arising from any operation, activity, practice or use of land or other premises carried on for the purposes of agriculture, horticulture or forestry;</P>
    <P>(b)  any activity that involves the application to land or to growing crops, or the injection into land, of any silage effluent, animal slurry, manure, fertiliser, pesticide or other polluting matter;</P>
    <P>(c)  any other operation, activity, practice or use of land or other premises for the purposes of agriculture, horticulture or forestry.</P>
    <P>The procedure for making by-laws is relatively cumbersome, involving publications, circulation, appeals, the possibility of amendments or annulments and again the publication and circulation of appeals decisions.  While a local authority may make such by-laws they must be approved by the Minister which converts them from being a local to a national issue.  I would envisage that if and when a local authority wish to control, regulate or prohibit any agricultural activity most likely they will continue as heretofore, that is to do so by means of a section 12 notice.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, in the context of my county of Wicklow, I would envisage by-law restrictions being contemplated only in the vicinity perhaps of the Vartry and Poulaphouca reservoirs because of their significance as a source of water supply for Dublin and north-east Wicklow.  The position as it obtains would not warrant any action being taken under the provisions of section 21.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill before the House introduces the concept of civil liability for pollution, the subject of much adverse comment by the farming organisations. There are two aspects to the provisions of this section, first, the right of the injured <Col N="713" /> party, the victim of the pollution, to take a civil action against the polluter to recover damages in respect of injury, loss or damage and, second, the fears expressed that such civil action would result in the penalisation of an innocent farmer through whose lands the pollution travelled from elsewhere.  Taking the latter point first, section 20 excludes from liability an innocent person through whose lands the pollution flowed from elsewhere on the basis that this constitutes an event he could not reasonably have foreseen or controlled.  It is a reasonable assumption that one cannot forsee when or how one's upstream neighbour may pollute.  This is another area about which much concern was expressed by the farming community. Once the matter has been clarified their fears may prove to have been without foundation.</P>
    <P>With regard to civil liability I would regard it as a basic right that any injured party be able to recover damages by means of a civil action, whether it might arise from pollution or any other form of injury, even allowing for the fact that most pollution is caused by accident or carelessness.</P>
    <P>In my earlier remarks on section 7 of this Bill which deals with applications for court orders &mdash; also the section dealing with the replacement of fish stocks &mdash; I mentioned that a new feature was that such an order may now be obtained on application by any person to the appropriate court regardless of whether that person had any interest in the waters concerned, in other words, any third party, individual or group, may apply to the court for an order to have the polluter mitigate or remedy the effects of the pollution, including the recovery of the costs thereof.  The order may also relate to the costs incurred by that third party, presumably including legal costs in applying for the order.</P>
    <P>Another new aspect of that section is that, whereas section 10 of the 1977 Act referred only to an application to the District Court, the new section mentions both the District Court and Circuit Court depending on the estimated cost of the <Col N="714" /> remedial work required.  Obviously 12 years' inflation has hit the cost of pollution clean up as much as it has hit everything else.</P>
    <P>On the extension of the right to apply for a court order to any individual or group rather than limiting it to specified authorities as heretofore, while many independent environmentalists would consider the right to such a third party a necessary adjunct to democracy, my own view is that this is not necessarily a good thing.  The law and its application are already rife with confusion and the introduction of this new measure could well have the consequence of the courts being besieged with a plethora of independent applications.  This extension to any third party is also included in section 8 which deals with applications to the High Court, and I would similarly comment with regard to this.</P>
    <P>In practice, the most significant aspect of the new Bill is likely to be the proposed increase in maximum fines and penalties applicable on conviction.  These are individually referred to in amendments to various sections, particularly section 24. Briefly the Bill proposes an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction from £250 at present to £1,000 and on conviction on indictment from £5,000 at present to £25,000.  The possibility of a term of imprisonment on summary conviction remains unchanged at six months but the possibility of imprisonment on conviction on indictment is increased from its present maximum two year term to five years.  These increases also apply in the case of offences relating to industrial discharges.  There is a further provision in section 23 of the new Bill that where an offence is committed by a corporate body, a company or a factory, the director, manager or other officer involved can be found personally guilty rather than being able to disappear behind the corporate image as heretofore.</P>
    <P>To what extent the courts will adhere to the new scale of fines remains to be seen.  However, from experience, some people feel that what is needed at this stage is not so much an increase in the <Col N="715" /> maximum fines but perhaps a stipulation in regard to minimum fines as it must be acknowledged that in cases brought by the local authorities to date, the courts have tended generally to give the polluter the benefit of the doubt.  In many cases, even when conviction are obtained, the penalties imposed have been derisory.  A £10 or £50 fine is very little incentive to any polluter to clean up his act.  It might be better, therefore, to have a realistic minimum rather than a vaguely threatening maximum requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the new Bill introduces a novel concept whereby the court, having imposed a fine for an offence under the Water Pollution Act, may order the polluter to pay the fine directly to the local authority rather than to the courts as heretofore.  This again has caused some agitation in farming circles, with suggestions that it might be yet another surreptitious way for the local authorities to make money.  Obviously this was the reason for the remarks about bounty hunters made by the former president of the IFA which, in my opinion, were unhelpful, to say the least.</P>
    <P>It would seem that if a fine is imposed it is of no great importance whether it has to be paid to one body or another. What hurts is actually having to pay the fine.  Given that one of the major objectives of the proposed Bill is to make the polluter pay for damage done by him to the environment, it is not altogether unnatural that such payment should be made to the statutory custodian of that environment.  However, it must be remembered that this direct payment will be a novel concept for the local authorities as much as for the polluters, and again it remains to be seen how it will work in practice given that the application of this provision is at the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the proposed Bill appears to have caused some confusion, raising the spectre of farmers having to seek licences for the discharge of any polluting matter into drains.  This word &ldquo;drain&rdquo; has been echoing and re-echoing around this land in terms of concern from the <Col N="716" /> farmers' point of view.  The section relates to combined drains which, together with sewers, have a very specific meaning under the terms of the Bill. Briefly, a sewer is a sewer pipe which is in the charge of a sanitary authority and a sewer pipe which is not in the charge of a sanitary authority is a drain.  A drain serving two or more premises is known as a combined drain.  Section 72 of the proposed Bill allows the sanitary authority to declare such a combined drain to be a sewer within the meaning of the Bill. The impact of section 22 therefore, will be mainly in the area of trade and industrial effluent discharges rather than agriculture as it is really an expansion of the existing section 16 licensing provisions. Here again, farmers have been worrying needlessly.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes a number of other changes not related to farming activities, mainly dealing with procedures for effluent discharge, licence applications and reviews of existing licences. It proposes the introduction of licence application fees similar to planning application fees and, as I mentioned earlier, extends the scope of licensable discharges and increases the penalties for related offences similar to those affecting the farming community.</P>
    <P>While much of the Bill is without doubt a response to the summer of 1987, to which I have referred already, and therefore inevitably has agricultural implications, the opportunity is also taken to write in practices and procedures which have evolved since 1977 to tighten definitions and plug loopholes &mdash; again not all of them are farmer related.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy I am in day to day contact with farmers and I fully appreciate the concern they have expressed but I believe it is vital that their fears be allayed.  As I said, some of the remarks by allegedly responsible people when this Bill was first mooted were unhelpful.  In fact, that is a major under-statement; they were downright provocative and caused an unnecessary scare throughout the agricultural community.  A co-operative approach by the local authority and the farmer can ensure that this Bill will <Col N="717" /> have little serious impact on the farming community generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey earlier mentioned that this Bill is not about farmers &mdash; or words to that effect &mdash; and I would like to reiterate that.  It is not an attack or an assault on farmers, their land or their livelihood, and that should be made very clear.</P>
    <P>I believe the farming community will be affected to a certain extent and co-operation with the local authorities will be very important in the enactment of the legislation.  It would be helpful if patience was exercised by both the local authorities and the fishery boards so that the new legislation can be introduced in a &ldquo;non-bullish&rdquo; way.  If the high level of pollution control grants were extended I believe this would encourage farmers to doubly ensure that their activities are devoid of any pollution possibilities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government and the Minister would consider giving an incentive to farmers so that they will take anti-pollution measures and improve the anti-pollution measures they have already. Perhaps consideration could also be given to giving farmers reduced interest loans specifically for the purpose of pollution control.  I ask the Minister to consider these points with a view to helping farmers to help the rest of the community in maintaining our environment.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the main beneficiaries from this legislation will be the farmers who produce our food.  The image our food has abroad can be put on a superlative level if we can be seen to have a good, green and non-polluted environment.  This could be based on the principle that a good, green and non-polluted environment yields good, non-polluted food.  If this is done, farmers will be able to seek a premium price for their beef and other foodstuffs in EC markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make an important contribution to the programme aimed at improving and maintaining the standards of water quality.  As I said earlier, any measure which contributes to a better environment will be of tremendous benefit to the entire community and is worthy <Col N="718" /> of the fullest support.  I congratulate the Minister on her timely introduction of this significant legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The cure to our pollution is a process of education. We must start in the schools at the very early stages of people's lives.  Children should be brought on visits to rivers, beaches and farms in order to see pollution at first hand.  Public awareness programmes should be undertaken and advertisements on television, the radio and in newspapers would bring to the notice of the public the incidence of pollution.</P>
      <P>Of course, the other part of the cure is the provision of money for the construction of sewage treatment works. Although some experts claim that such treatment works would cost hundreds of millions of pounds, I believe this would be money well spent.  With grants available from the European Community, this country should plan for the erection of such sewage treatment works, especially in the Dublin Bay area.  Because of the condition of the bay the Minister should see to it that work starts in the early nineties.  It is imperative that we cease dumping raw sewage in Dublin Bay in order to bring to an end an intolerable problem which is worthy of the Middle Ages.</P>
      <P>The EC plan to ban dumping of raw sewage at sea.  In a recently published report it was stated that towns with a population of 10,000 or more would have a secondary or biological treatment plant for sewage before it is discharged into receiving waters and more stringent treatment will be required in cases where water quality is a problem.  At present, most of Dublin's sewage load is processed through the corporation's treatment plant at Ringsend.  This is only a primary treatment facility which merely separates the solids from the liquids.  It has been estimated that the cost of upgrading this facility to a full treatment works would be in the region of £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the far side of the bay, to the nose of Howth, the north Dublin drainage <Col N="719" /> scheme empties totally untreated raw sewage directly into the Irish Sea beside Howth harbour.  This scheme which starts in Finglas serves all the large housing estates, factories and hospitals on the northside of Dublin.  It discharges all this raw sewage into the receiving water.  The tidal pattern in the outer bay is very dynamic and the dumped material is spread over a wide area.  This has caused serious damage to fish life and over the past few years raw sewage has ended up on such beaches as Portmarnock, Dollymount, Portrane, Donabate and other beaches along the east coast.</P>
    <P>This must surely be a danger to our citizens' health and will certainly deter tourists from using our beaches.  Fishermen at Howth can tell us that the best herring spawning grounds in the world just off Howth have been completely destroyed and the day of the famous Howth herring has passed for some time. Because of certain easterly tides, raw sewage has also found its way into the famous blue lagoon which extends from Clontarf to Sutton.  One can see the green algae forming there.  The silting of this estuary was brought about by the erection of the causeway which will not allow scouring to take place.  Despite several motions and pressure from local community groups, Dublin Corporation refuse to breach this causeway.  I believe that before long this popular amenity will disappear.  I ask the Minister to use her good offices with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and to ask the Dublin city and county manager to carry out works to breach this causeway at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle estuary was recently declared a wildlife sanctuary.  This is a most welcome development for the estuary and the people of Baldoyle generally.  The estuary is a winter feeding ground for Brent geese and supports many other species of wildlife.  The estuary was recently &ldquo;twinned&rdquo; with Polar Bear pass in Canada, another welcome development, but raw sewage is washing onto the shores of this estuary and I fear it may contaminate the wildlife food chain <Col N="720" /> there.  A developer is now proposing to run a sewerage pipe along the shores of the estuary discharging sewage into a local pumping station so that he can build 70 to 90 houses locally.  He has already applied for planning permission to do this and I ask the Minister and the Minister for the Marine, to use their good offices to defeat this proposal.  I understand that the European Community have plans to ban the dumping of raw sewage at sea. Therefore, the Minister should now provide proper treatment facilities for the outfalls at the nose of Howth and at Ringsend, to be constructed to EC standards. The Minister should now make a decision to provide sewage treatment facilities in the early nineties.</P>
    <P>The European Community runs an award system called the Blue Flag Award for clean beaches.  Forty-nine Irish beaches sought this award this year but only 35 were selected.  Only five out of the nine beaches entered by Dublin County Council won a blue flag.  Dublin Corporation did not enter the competition. The beaches were judged on water quality, beach quality, management, environmental, education and information aspects.  The problems with Dublin beaches certainly accounted for their poor showing, mainly because of sewage outflows and litter.</P>
    <P>The most visible sign of pollution in Dublin is the brown algae which washes up on the beaches as a consequence of excessive nutrients in the water.  The continuation of the dumping of sewage sludge into the Irish Sea is a cause of serious concern and is in violation of European Community guidelines.  While most publicity surrounds the discharge of nuclear waste from the Sellafield nuclear plant into the Irish Sea, very little notice has been paid to the discharging of raw sewage by Britain and Ireland into the Irish Sea.  It is estimated that 1,200 million cubic metres of sewage, enough to cover the Isle of Man to a depth of five feet, is discharged annually into the Irish Sea.  Most of that effluent contains industrial and chemical waste and we must ask the serious question, can the Irish Sea <Col N="721" /> cope with that effluent being dumped into it for much longer?</P>
    <P>It should be our ambition that by the early nineties all our beaches will attain the EC blue flag standards.  We should clean up and make our beaches environmentally sound.  The pollution of our rivers seems to have grabbed the headlines in recent years.  Most of that pollution is from farm effluent and I understand that effluent from the agricultural sector is ten times the amount produced by the urban sector.  The discharge of effluent into our rivers is caused by a minority of irresponsible farmers.  I understand that slurry is 100 times and silage is 200 times more pollutant than ordinary domestic sewage.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to read recently that fish kills in our rivers are down considerably. In 1988 there were 44, 44 too many.  There are adequate grants available to farmers to help them install proper slurry tanks and they would stop the seepage into small streams.  Many small feeder springs and streams find their way to lakes and that is why lakes such as Lough Ennel have died.  Acid rain is one of the major pollutants in northern Europe.  Forests have been completely wiped out in countries like Finland, Norway and Sweden and now Germany is having a problem with forests.  Lakes have died because of the fall-out from smoke pollution from factories in England and Germany.  The burning of coal is the biggest contributory factor to acid rain.  We will have to curb the use of coal in our factories and households.  We must encourage industrialists to use natural gas which is available off our shores.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and local authorities, should involve local community groups, such as Earthwatch, and associations in the monitoring of acid rain.  Local authorities should appoint officials in different areas for sample taking and provide them with the necessary equipment.  They should locate a laboratory in their area to test water samples.  In that way a proper check on instances of high pollution could be kept.  I have no doubt that community associations will be anxious to undertake that task and it would give them a sense of <Col N="722" /> community involvement.  I am concerned that the scale of modest and slight pollution has increased in the last 20 years. What we need at this stage is an independent environmental protection agency to deal with the problem.  In that regard I welcome the announcement that such an agency will be established and I appeal to the Minister to set it up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have always had wide ranging powers to deal with water pollution but in the past some of them were reluctant to use them or they adopted the light approach to offenders.  The Minister should make it clear to all local authorities that it is her intention to enforce the law and to adopt the toughest line possible with local authorities.  The public at large are not aware that local authorities can be prosecuted.  I note that in 1987 there were 156 such prosecutions. The Minister should tell local authorities, farmers and industrialists to get their houses in order.  Some local authorities claim that they do not have sufficient personnel to enforce the law or monitor pollution levels.  This problem is so serious that the Department should ensure that, for as long as local authorities are responsible for monitoring, sufficient finance will be made available to enable them to employ staff to enforce the law and monitor pollution.</P>
    <P>The sewerage outfalls into Dublin Bay have hospitals in their districts.  It could happen that there would be an outbreak of hepatitis, a highly contagious disease, in any of the hospitals and yet the sewage from them would flow untreated into Dublin Bay.  People swim, fish and sail in Dublin Bay and, of course, many children play on the beaches.  Sewage from such hospitals could be a serious danger to the health of those people.  The water in Dublin Bay should be monitored constantly and sewage from hospitals surveyed so that we will be aware of the extent of its impact on the water in the bay area.  We must ensure that infected effluent from hospitals does not end up on our beaches.</P>
    <P>One reservation I have about the Bill is that in giving all the powers to local <Col N="723" /> authorities and other agencies we may end up, because of under-staffing, with its provisions being useless.  If the Minister established an environmental protection agency will there be sufficient money to staff it?  Will local authorities have sufficient funds to ensure that inspections and enforcement are carried out unhindered? I hope the Minister can reassure me on those points.  The very good intentions of the Bill could be lost if, due to a lack of money, local authorities have a staffing problem.</P>
    <P>Another worry I have concerns oil spillages.  We all remember the serious damage the oil spillage from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> caused to wildlife.  To this day we are not aware of the full extent of the damage of that spillage.  Analyses of the water are still being carried out in the area to ensure that there is no long term damage done to wildlife or to fish life.  It may take years to learn the full extent of that pollution.  Is the Minister satisfied that there is a disaster plan for the Dublin Bay area to deal with spillages from large tankers and so on?  Do we have sufficient stock of the proper dispersals and the other chemicals needed to deal with such a spillage?  Is the Minister satisfied that Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation have disaster plans which can be put into operation at a moment's notice? Are those plans capable of dealing with any problem that may arise?</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased sanctions and penalties in the Bill.  We will always have a hard core of polluters who will only respond to heavy fines, as the Minister said.  I welcome the provision which permits people to proceed against polluters for damages.  It is important that the Bill makes water pollution unattractive.  Our waters are amongst the cleanest in Europe and we must ensure that they are kept that way.  I should like to bring to the attention of the House the increase in the number of reported cases of Alzheimer's Disease.  Scientists tell us that aluminium is a contributory factor. Are local authorities adding to the problem by the additives they use to purify household supplies?  I wonder is it safe to <Col N="724" /> use aluminium pots and pans?  We should address that matter immediately to allay people's fears.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues I support the Bill which strengthens the provisions of the 1977 Act.  It is important to point out that pollution is not a new problem.  We have been suffering from the effects of pollution for many years. Economic development and the protection of the environment are seen by some to be in opposition to each other. Of course, economic development and caring for the environment can be interdependent and should play complementary roles.  I should like to refer to what I consider to be a disappointing aspect of the debate so far.  It appears to me that there is an anti-farmer bias and that is most unfortunate.  We do not want any more divisions or splits in our community. It is irresponsible to try to create an urban-rural divide on this or any other issue.</P>
      <P>The whole question of intensive farming raises a number of issues but it is important to stress that there is a great willingness by farmers to comply with all rules and regulations to ensure that there is not a continuation of pollution.  I should like to refer to statistics which prove that the farming community are trying to prevent pollution.  Up to the end of last September, and this is a point made by the Minister of State last night, 16,884 applications had been received from members of the farming community for grants to help them stem pollution. During the past 18 months farmers have invested £200 million on pollution control facilities.  I mention these two statistics to make clear once again that it is unfair that undue emphasis is placed on the farming sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the comments made by Deputy Gilmore last night.  His references to the farming sector were, to say the least, disgraceful.  He said that some farmers were prepared to obstruct efforts to control pollution.  I think he was referring to a specific case which could have been dealt with under the section dealing with split sampling.  It is <Col N="725" /> most unfair to tar all farmers with the one brush.  We are aware that a very small number of farmers are not prepared to go along with pollution control but to tar a whole community in this way is most unfair and is taking what could only be described as an irresponsible attitude. Adopting such an attitude produces negative results.  It only leads to the building up of resentment and hostility among an otherwise co-operative group.  He went so far as to describe the farmers as a hysterical lobby.  He said they were in a state of frenzy over this Bill and had whipped up a campaign of opposition to it.  Such an attack was unwarranted and is not in keeping with the facts.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to one other important statistic.  An Foras Forbartha in a report stated that 70 per cent of pollution was caused by the urban rural sector, 20 per cent by agriculture and 10 per cent by other sources.  Significantly, there has been a fall-off in the number of fish kills since 1988.  In that famous year of 1987, 82 fish kills were attributed to farmers, 20 in 1988 and 23 out of a total of 121 in 1989.  This is a welcome improvement and underlines the fact that the farmers are not the only polluters in our community, that only a small number of our farming community do not wish to comply with our pollution rules, laws and regulations.</P>
    <P>Let me also refer to the comments of one other speaker.  In his contribution last night, Deputy O'Shea made a rather irresponsible remark when speaking about the need to protect our drinking water.  All of us in this House and, indeed, everyone outside of it, naturally wish to protect our drinking water, but scare stories will not help any of us.  There is a need for vigilance and improvement in the quality of our drinking water but whipping up hysteria and referring to such illnesses as Alzheimer's Disease and pre-senile dementia is of no help to anyone.  I would say to him that he would need to make sure that his definitions of such terms are accurate before making reference to them.  We are all aware of the very great anxieties people have about such diseases, but I would not like <Col N="726" /> it to go out from this House that our drinking water poses any threat.</P>
    <P>I should point out that there are EC directives on water quality and the Government are fully committed to implementing these directives.  In 1988 alone, the Minister made three separate sets of regulations on bathing water, fresh water fish and drinking water.  I do not think it would help in any way to cause further anxiety, which in some cases may be unfounded, among the members of the general community.</P>
    <P>The Government have been accused of dragging their feet on this legislation.  It has been pointed out that this legislation was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas some time ago and that it is only now we are taking Second Stage. The Minister, Deputy Flynn, has shown his commitment and wants to see pollution being brought under control.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has also played his part in that he has been able to assist farmers in carrying out the necessary pollution control works by negotiating an extension of the western package scheme to cover such works. Farmers in all disadvantaged areas are now in a position to avail of grants of up to 55 per cent of the cost of installing slurry and silage effluent storage facilities and young farmers can qualify for grants of up to 69 per cent.  Up to February 1989, 7,500 applications for such grants had been received.  I am also delighted to note that these grants are now available nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Minister has consistently shown that he has adopted an approach based on the promotion of knowledge and information and the heightening of awareness on the need to prevent pollution. Unfortunately, he has been unfairly criticised for not providing the personnel to do this work but, again, such accusations are groundless.  Deputy Dempsey has already given the facts and figures and with the indulgence of the Chair I would like to do the same. Excluding the pollution officers employed by the fishery boards, local authorities employ 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists, primarily on <Col N="727" /> water pollution control activities, together with 16 technicians engaged in hydrometric work essential in the control of pollution.  In addition, 71 local authority administrative staff devoted 32 man-hours to water pollution control activities in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to note from the Minister's speech last night that the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> provides for substantial continuing investment in water and sewerage services over the five years of the plan.  This is of importance because local authorities on occasion have been accused of being major polluters. The construction of sewerage facilities should help in alleviating this problem and lead to a much cleaner environment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been complying with the provisions of section 12 of the existing Act.  The Minister has recognised their importance in controlling pollution. In 1988, he issued guidelines to local authorities for sewage treatment and indicated they should pay particular attention to these.  He wanted the sewage discharges contributing to the problem in different areas to be taken into account by local authorities in planning overall sanitary services programmes.  In 1989, over £62 million has been provided for sanitary services and in 1990 this allocation will be increased to £67.5 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey referred to the importance of education and the need to change attitudes.  I support him wholeheartedly. As a teacher and trained psychologist, I am aware of how difficult it is to change attitudes.  If we are to change attitudes, particularly those of our young people, then we have to recognise the importance of our schools.  I take this opportunity to congratulate ACOT, Teagasc and the farmers' associations for their continuing interest in putting forward as much knowledge as possible on the question of pollution.  They have done a tremendous amount in this regard and they continue to disseminate information on pollution control.  I would encourage them to continue their good work in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> It is in all our interests that polluters be scorned by the community generally and that they be prosecuted and heavily fined.  I welcome the provision in the Bill for an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction, to £1,000, a new maximum penalty of £25,000 on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for a period up to five years, instead of two.  These provisions will apply to the water pollution and the fisheries Acts and they are welcome.</P>
    <P>Some farmers groups have expressed concern about some sections of the Bill. The question of split sampling has been raised during the debate.  The Minister informed the farming organisations that he would take this whole question into account and that he will be in a position to make regulations under the 1977 Act requiring local authorities to provide a sample of the effluent waters to the owner of the premises or land concerned where possible, subject to ability to locate the individual.  A provision will also be made to afford the owner of the premises or land an opportunity to be present when samples are taken and local authorities will retain the right to proceed with sampling should they fail to locate the owner or should the owner decline to attend sampling.  That should go a long way in allaying any fears that might have arisen in relation to split sampling.</P>
    <P>The good defence provision is also something to be welcomed.  It is to be applied also in the case of offences under the 1959 Fisheries Act.  No such defence was available up to now under the 1959 Act so that is certainly an improvement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the making of by-laws, they shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment. Farmers affected by them will have the right to appeal to the Minister and local authorities will be required to give notice of the making of by-laws in newspapers circulating in the areas to which they relate.  The Minister will have power to confirm, modify or annul by-laws and they will only come into operation on a date to be set by the Minister.  This is of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>On the question of consultation I was <Col N="729" /> surprised to notice that the Fine Gael Opposition spokesman, Deputy Shatter, seemed to be rather nonplussed at the prospect of consultation between groups and the Minister in his Department. Surely consensus politics and not confrontation politics is what we are talking about.  I hope this is the way any Government will proceed.  I hope that the representatives of the Opposition benches will be a little more gracious in their acknowledgment of this.  Perhaps the attitude shown is a sign of sour grapes or peevishness and that Fine Gael representatives cannot accept that consensus has been reached between the Government, the IFA and other groups without the help of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many of the so-called amendments put forward by Deputy Shatter on behalf of Fine Gael are truly Fine Gael amendments?  How many of them are now rather out of date, having been promoted perhaps from another source?</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  We all know that there is now far more heightened awareness of environment protection and of anti-pollution laws.  We have seen this not only here but throughout Europe. This awareness is something to be encouraged and worked on.  It is important, however, that we do not home in on one sector of our community.  It would be unfair to put too much emphasis on the farming community in this regard as there are other problems with regard to pollution which should be emphasised. Industrial waste, for example, has not been mentioned very much in contributions here today.  This warrants further consideration and further emphasis.</P>
    <P>We should not shirk our responsibility in preserving our environment as it is in all our interests.  We wish to be able to promote a pollution free country but to do this we must work together as a community rather than trying to shift the blame to one sector.  If we approach this as a community, when this Bill is passed it will certainly bring about a new dawn for our country in terms of the health of <Col N="730" /> the people and the furtherance of tourism, for example, which is always under threat where pollution is concerned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate particularly the Minister, Deputy Flynn, for his ongoing work in this area and I congratulate the Minister of State for the work she is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This Bill is important since pollution generally has become a very topical subject over the past few years and particularly this year.  It has evoked a great deal of comment from informed and not so informed sources.  Notwithstanding all that we must accept the urgent need to introduce measures to protect the environment and eliminate pollution, in this case water pollution.</P>
      <P>My only criticism relates to the way in which we go about these things.  Let us look back over the last number of years, the number of pollution incidents and how they occurred, how they were remedied and how we can ensure that there is not a recurrence.  Let us look at agriculture pollution and how it came about, the number of fish kills, the seriousness of the incidents and the type of pollutants now entering our waters from intensive agricultural production.  Some of us were aware 20 years ago that intensive agricultural operations which appeared to be taking off were likely to lead to serious pollution.  It was no surprise to some of us who had knowledge of the business that pollution incidents were likely to occur.  We warned about it, we talked to people in the business about it and to the experts and we got very little hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While speaking about the experts and the advisory services available to the farming community in relation to the elimination of pollution and in relation to the development of their interests, I would point out that the agencies in the business of giving advice were very slow to recognise what was likely to happen given the trend towards intensive agricultural production.  They should have recognised long ago that there were dangers which could have been reduced with proper planning in the initial stages.  Even <Col N="731" /> a couple of years ago the advice given to farmers seeking to develop and extend their operations was very different to what would be required now to protect the environment and eliminate water pollution in particular.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have been critical of the agricultural community, but these people are safe in making their criticisms because very few of them are likely to be affected in their own constituencies by making such criticisms.  This is an unfortunate feature of politics here.  It is one of the few things on which I agree with the one and only Gay Byrne when he said a long time ago that politicians were responsible for setting the people of the nation at each others' throats.  In that context he was correct.</P>
    <P>If the agencies had given different advice over the years we could have eliminated the problem that arose in the last year or two.  It is not fair to place all the blame on the people who are directly causing the pollution.  It is incumbent on agricultural and industrial producers to ensure that the products they use do not militate against the environment and cause pollution of one type or another. Water pollution particularly is sensitive because of the degree to which pollution can have a knock-on effect, and the degree to which pollution can be transferred from one area to another in the water has huge negative potential and we must pay heed to it.</P>
    <P>The next group of people who are maligned in this context are the industrial polluters.  I would stress that I hold no brief for either agricultural or industrial polluters.  There are people in industry, however, who are discharging effluent, as they are entitled to do within the meaning of their planning permissions and the various Acts laid down by the Oireachtas, but the treatment plants into which some of these pollutants eventually go are incapable of dealing with them, and these chemicals ultimately end up in the water system.  Modern technology should be able to keep pace with advances in the chemical field to deal with pollutants arising from the chemical area at present, <Col N="732" /> regardless of what type of pollutants they are.</P>
    <P>There have been pollution incidents all over the country and one of the problems is the time lapse between the pollution incident taking place and its discovery.  It should be possible to detect a type of chemical in the sewerage system at an early stage rather than allowing it to go through plant which, in many cases, is incapable of dealing with the pollutant and so alert the community as to the dangers.  There has been a number of serious scares in that area, not just in relation to fish kills and water pollution generally, but in relation to the pollution of drinking water.  This happened in the greater urban areas when a chemical was either accidentally or deliberately released into the system, causing grave concern to a great number of people.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail on accidental discharges and the problems that might pose as various other speakers have already referred to this.  There is not much I can say either about the person who deliberately discharges effluent into the system knowing it will cause serious damage.  Other incidents of pollution which are caused by storms, etc. and which could not have been foreseen take place as well.  These two different types of pollution incidents have to be treated separately for obvious reasons.  In regard to overground storage of silage, slurry, etc., accidental discharges may take place because of sudden increases in rainfall causing damage to walls of silos, and there can be difficulties.  Of course, the way around that is simply to ensure that the construction is such as to safeguard the storage facility.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I am worried that various local authorities have been penalised for allowing the pollution of a waterway by a sewer which was alleged to be malfunctioning at the time.  I contend that in that situation the responsibility rests ultimately with the Department of the Environment because they have the capital responsibility for these matters.  The Department of the Environment and nobody else have the ultimate responsibility to provide the <Col N="733" /> finance to update and improve sewage treatment plants anywhere in the country.  In the past 15 years or so the response from the Department of the Environment in that area has been less than impressive.  I am not making a political point but stating a fact.  It is clear to everybody in this House.  Any member of a local authority can point to countless repeated approaches to the Department of the Environment in an effort to update various sewage disposal plants in their respective areas, and the response has been negative, slow or bureaucratic.  By bureaucratic I mean that various plans are submitted to the Minister, surveyed and examined for a period of between three months and three years, after which they may be referred back to the local authorities for further changes, and then referred back to the Department for further review.  The thing goes on to such an extent it is farcical.</P>
    <P>In cases of sewage treatment plants provided over the past ten years each purporting to be the &ldquo;most modern&rdquo; or &ldquo;most efficient&rdquo;&mdash; famous quotes from the advertising blurb &mdash; I have personal knowledge in my constituency of such plants and all I can say is that for modern and efficient plants, very shortly after they have been put in place they give off a most offensive, intensive odour. Whatever other areas they are efficient in, it certainly is not the elimination of odours.  As the old story goes, if there is smoke there surely must be fire.  Serious reservations have been expressed by members of local authorities in relation to the efficiency of these plants.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the numerous towns and villages all over this country, no constituency or county being excepted, where areas of population of up to 1,500 and 2,000 people are being served for years by inefficient sewage treatment plants, the result being that we have discharged into our rivers, lakes, streams and waterways sewage which is less than ideally treated and in many cases not treated at all.  I can think of countless towns and villages in my constituency where plans were submitted to the Department of the Environment, <Col N="734" /> ten and 12 years ago in some cases, in respect of which approval is still awaited. These plans have been revised and revived in the intervening period.  From the point of view of the unfortunate people living in those areas, there has been little response by way of progress in providing the wherewithal to ensure the plants were replaced.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the town of Kilcullen with a population within the numbers I have just mentioned.  There is no sewage treatment plant there of a nature which would be likely to deal with the current requirements.  Take Robertstown, a tourist amenity area, where thousands of children are brought on visits throughout the summer months each year, where there is no treatment plant at all.  There is nothing but continuous pollution in these rural areas.  Here we are spending a great deal of time and energy talking about a Bill which is going to eliminate pollution.  Can I foresee at some stage down the road the local authority in Kildare possibly being penalised, perhaps prosecuted, as a result of a pollution incident arising from something they themselves have no financial control over?</P>
    <P>It is of major importance that we recognise that in the matter of elimination of pollution of our waterways the one way to go about it effectively is to eliminate the difficulty before it arises, and the simplest and safest method of doing so is simply to provide the treatment plants which are necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too much time talking about that element of it but I speak from experience.  Other people in this House must have had similar experience of it.  I am sure the experiences we have had in County Kildare are just a microcosm of what is happening nationwide. I have mentioned the smaller populations. We also have larger urban type populations of 15,000 to 16,000 people in areas barely served by a sewage treatment plant.</P>
    <P>I have to move to another problem in the same vein.  The policy of many local authorities, rightly in my opinion, has been to ensure the continuation of a rural <Col N="735" /> community development, so to speak, as was traditional in this country in that we had small settlements throughout the country in rural areas.  Such small settlements usually consisted of a pub, a shop, a school and a few houses, perhaps 20 or 30.  These small conurbations in a rural environment have been served by package treatment plants, as they are called. Again I have to say that the efficiency of such package treatment plants leaves a great deal to be desired.  I cannot think of any one of them that has worked satisfactorily. I cannot think of a single one where there have not been serious pollution problems since they were put in place.  Modern technology should be well able to cope with that problem now.  Bord na Móna have done tremendous research and have provided the means whereby pollution can be eliminated in such instances.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the local authorities who are given the job of implementing legislation we pass in this House to prevent and eliminate pollution are the very people who have themselves to call on agencies to provide a system for them which is tested &mdash; it must have been tested by somebody somewhere &mdash; for efficiency and ability to deal with the problem, but does not seem to work at all.  Throughout last summer anybody passing by any of the rural communities throughout the country that was served by one of those small package treatment plants would not have to ask what type of plant was in operation.  Whenever they came within five miles of the area they knew for themselves.  I am not scaremongering or exaggerating.  What I have said is fact and I am sure everybody here knows that.</P>
    <P>My reason for going about it in this fashion is to impress upon the Minister that the financial responsibility, and with it the ultimate authority to ensure the success or failure of this Bill, will depend entirely on the ability of the Minister and her Department to provide the necessary financial wherewithal to meet the <Col N="736" /> requirements of the Bill and the impositions being placed on local authorities by the Bill.</P>
    <P>As with many another Bill debated in this House in great detail by the Members, many of whom are themselves members of local authorities, here again the Oireachtas imposes on a junior body &mdash; in this case the local authority &mdash; certain responsibilities and requirements which they have to keep and enforce as a result of legislation passed in this House. That is all right, but along with that there is no question, no talk at all of the money required to so do.  If one goes back over the last 10 or 15 years and examines the volume of legislation passed in this House imposing financial obligations on local authorities, one will be aghast.  I hope that at some stage in the course of this debate we will see a recognition of the obligation placed on the local authorities by the passing of such legislation as this be underpinned by a willingness to provide money to pay for such obligation.</P>
    <P>We are not going to wander into an area of devolution of power to local authorities and so on; that is for another debate, but my feeling about the operation of local authorities in any sphere is that their effectiveness can be measured by the amount of money they have to do the job they are asked to do.  If they have the resources invariably they do a very good job.  Various people have suggested here in the recent and not so recent past that, for instance, environmental impact studies are issues which are above the realm of the ability of local authority staff to assess properly.  I do not accept that. I think they are quite capable of dealing with any study, provided, of course, they have the money to employ the expertise to deal with it.  It is particularly unfortunate that local authorities are in some way being castigated for many things they have no responsibility for.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned also &mdash; and I want to refer to it again briefly &mdash; the ability of the sewage treatment plants to deal with particular types of effluent, particularly toxicants.  Oils are particularly difficult to deal with, especially those from the <Col N="737" /> industrial areas.  They have caused many serious problems in the past.  We do not hear much about them but they are still there simply because they go into the sewage treatment plant; the system cannot deal with them effectively and then we hear about the possible consequences. Recycling is an obvious way round many of those problems.  A great deal of time and energy needs to be devoted to defining ways and means whereby those types of chemicals or oils can be recycled. There are people who specialise in those areas at present; it creates employment, it is useful and it also has obvious benefits for the environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spent some time talking about the pollution of our seas. When one considers it, a summer such as that gone by was an obvious time for all of us to puruse the possible dire consequences of pollution of our seas, which arises as a result of water pollution, sewage disposal, treated or untreated as the case may be.  Because we thought we were removing the pollution problem from our immediate environment &mdash; where we lived &mdash; and discharging it further afield out into the sea, we were inclined to relax unnecessarily.  Now we find in our recreation time that we have to deal with the problem of facing up to the sins of the past.  We can look with some concern at the degree of pollution that has taken place in our seas, off our coasts and our beaches over the past number of years, and we have not done enough about it.  The saddest thing about this is that much of it occurred from the various outfalls which were provided to cater for the increased population and to improve sanitation in urban areas.  It is unfortunate that we had not taken a somewhat different line to ensure the elimination of pollution of our seas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to another area of water pollution which has not been mentioned to any great extent today, the pollution of ground water which can arise from industrial, agricultural or ordinary domestic septic tank drainage.  There are some parts of the country where this is causing very serious problems.  I know the experts will immediately say, in the <Col N="738" /> case of septic tanks, the nature of the pollutant is not nearly as serious as a chemical from an industrial process or from silage or slurry type pollutants.  That may well be the case, but there is the increased problem of various chemicals being used in households, chemicals which ultimately end up being discharged into the sewage system which, in rural areas, can only be dealt with by way of septic tank disposal and treatment.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority who spend a good portion of their time trying to ensure that urban and rural areas are treated alike &mdash; many of us consider that in the recent past the rural dweller has been getting the short end of the stick and is not getting fair play &mdash; I should like to say that there are instances where septic tanks have not operated efficiently and in some cases such tanks have been drained into streams or watercourses in order to eliminate overflows.  That may well work, provided that the effluent is not of a toxic nature, on the other hand it may not work.</P>
    <P>I would like to see modern sewage and water treatment technology being used to a far greater extent, even in the case of the ordinary domestic septic tanks, in order that it would be able to cater for the kind of chemical now being used in households and which ultimately ends up being discharged into the sewage system. If that is not done we will have serious problems in that area over the next ten or 15 years.  I say so in the firm knowledge &mdash;this is something I said to various other people in the intensive agricultural area ten or 20 years ago &mdash; and without fear of contradiction that we will have serious difficulties arising from septic tanks in ten or 15 years' time unless we take action.  I am not saying that we take action by writing to the people and telling them: &ldquo;you must cease.  You can no longer exist. You cannot have a septic tank there&rdquo;. Modern technology should be well able to cater for the requirements of that kind of development nowadays.  There should be no difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>We talk about the requirement we have to provide for sewage effluent disposal, etc., in this country.  How would <Col N="739" /> we manage if we had the kind of population which they have in the Netherlands on the same kind of land mass?  I know they have different means and methods for dealing with it there, but they also have to deal with an awful lot of septic tank problems, just as we have to deal with them here, but they seem to be able to deal with them much more efficiently. We should look closely at the possibilities of utilising the advances in modern science to deal with that type of problem.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in this Bill that one could speak about, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I do not want to drag out the debate unnecessarily and there are other speakers on both sides of the House who wish to get in.  I again appeal to the Minister to recognise that the need for this Bill is accepted by everybody and the need to ensure that the Bill can be operated efficiently rests ultimately with the Minister and the Government. If the funds which are required are not provided by the Department then there is no sense coming back to us at local authority level and saying: &ldquo;Your local authority have caused pollution by virtue of the fact that they allowed effluent to be discharged into a particular river or stream&rdquo;.  Unless the Department are prepared to come back to us and say: &ldquo;As long as you can tell us that you require an updating of a treatment plant we will provide the money for you&rdquo;.  Then we will say: &ldquo;We will operate this Bill efficiently&rdquo;.  The members of the various local authorities throughout the country will then be able to say to the Government, regardless of which Government are in office, &ldquo;We can ensure that we will eliminate pollution of this or any other type&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very welcome legislation. It seeks comprehensively to address an issue, the issue of water pollution, and to bring our legislation up-to-date in a very vital area.  It has, I am pleased to note, been welcomed by all sides of the House.  In addition to dealing with the water pollution legislation itself &mdash; the principal Act &mdash; it also amends <Col N="740" /> legislation dealing with our inland fisheries, an area of law which badly needed attention.  For that reason, the Bill is doubly welcome.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and his Minister of State, Deputy Harney, have been rightly and properly congratulated for bringing the Bill forward.  It is also in order at this point to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly, who did so much work in regard to the fisheries side of the Bill in 1987 and 1988 to ensure that the law relating to the fishery boards was comprehensively dealt with at this time and also to ensure that the boards themselves retained their position in law and, indeed, enjoy an enhanced position in law.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said last night: &ldquo;This country can still be boastful of having the cleanest waters in Europe&rdquo;.  Long may it stay that way.  This legislation and the Government commitment to historically high rates of continuing investment in water and sewerage services in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>&mdash; these twin commitments combined &mdash; will go a long way to ensuring that our waterways, our lakes, our drinking waters and our coastal waters remain unpolluted.  The last speaker will recognise that what is being done in this legislation, and what is being done in the national development plan, will address, in large part, the sort of issues he raised and, in particular, the concern that local authorities would primarily be responsible for the implementation of this legislation and should have a sufficiency of funds but, in particular, capital funds to bring on stream &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; proper working arrangements for handling pollutants and, in particular, sewage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, only so much can be done by the State and local agencies in this regard, the public must also play their part.  Every man, woman and child in the country has a fundamental interest in the environment.  As consumers and users of recreational waters and as beneficiaries of Ireland's image as a green and unpolluted land, we must all play our part in combating the threat to our environment. <Col N="741" /> The householder, farmer and industrialist have a common interest in a pure and unpolluted environment.  For this reason I hope that when the Bill becomes law, when the proposed capital investments are made and new plants are up and running, the Minister and his Department will invest in a major educational environmental programme which will recruit everybody in the land as an environmental guardian.  It is particularly worthwhile investing resources in this area.</P>
    <P>Investing money in expensive plant, establishing public monitoring agencies and providing in law for a heavy penalty against deliberate offenders is only half the battle.  The most important part of the battle lies in elevating the public's awareness to their personal role in the matter.  There are, of course, excellent community organisations such as Earthwatch, Greenpeace and so on but, sadly, they attract only minority support. We need to make the environment a national issue and recruit all the people of the nation to the cause of environmental awareness.</P>
    <P>We in Wicklow have been fortunate in the last few years from the point of view of capital investment in the area.  Major schemes have been undertaken in Bray &mdash; oddly enough that was the largest scheme in the last two years in the capital programme but it was not mentioned by the Minister of State last night &mdash; and in Greystones, Blessington and Enniskerry. There are also many small schemes in operation throughout the county and other major schemes are in progress or at the planning stage.</P>
    <P>Many of these schemes, in particular the schemes serving the major towns, have one specific aspect in common.  For example, Bray, Greystones and, ultimately, Wicklow, will all have long sea outfalls.  Two of the speakers touched on this issue.  This type of scheme represents a major capital investment.  However, sewage which is not fully treated is still poured into coastal waters.  I have my doubts about the efficiency of such arrangements and I wonder in the long term what the effects of such discharges <Col N="742" /> will be.  Indeed, one does not have to be concerned just about the long term, I wonder, when EC regulations come on stream, whether the outfalls &mdash; some of which are only being built &mdash; will meet the required standard.  What impact, for example, will the huge volume of discharge into the Irish Sea have over the next five to ten years?  The Irish Sea is largely an inland sea and the tidal scouring effect is limited.</P>
    <P>We can properly and vociferously complain about Sellafield and the careless attitude of the British authorities which is based on a total disregard for the public health of the people on the east coast of this nation, but we should also look at our own actions in this regard.  Before we provide more long sea outfalls, the cumulative effect of their operations must be scientifically assessed.  If you look at the beaches from Louth to Wexford, one of the depressing aspects is the amount of detritus coming in on the tide, much of it from the sea outfalls.  It will obviously be a danger and a hazard in the long term.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow is particularly vulnerable to water pollution.  The lakes at Roundwood, Poulaphouca and Blessington are the most important sources of potable water on our island.  They play a vital role in the life of this city and they provide drinking water for one third of Ireland's population.  It is obviously important that these lakes and their catchment systems are kept pure and unpolluted, but there is a cost on the local community in preserving the integrity of the lakes and the purity of their water feeds and water catchment area.</P>
    <P>One of the major costs, which has been willingly borne by the people of Wicklow, has been a very restrictive attitude towards development planning in the areas around these lakes.  Given that the lakes are dispersed across the whole north-east of the county, that they spread from the north-east of the county right across to the north-west, that they cover a very large geographical area and that their catchment area covers an even greater geographical area, there is a problem in retaining the purity of the <Col N="743" /> water going into these lakes.  Some response from the Department of the Environment is needed in this regard. The people and the public planning authorities in Wicklow have, as I said, willingly guarded the water purity in these areas but they have had to do it at the cost of limiting the full enjoyment of their land by local families.  This has been an issue of pressure at planning level in Wicklow County Council over the last two years and has become even more acute over the last few months.  Some assistance is needed for such families. Clearly, if you intend to build in the vicinity of a water catchment area, near our potable water reservoirs, very restrictive conditions will have to be applied to buildings and expensive plant will need to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>It may not be popular to suggest it but Dublin Corporation are the major drawer of the water &mdash; they draw it for the whole of north-east Wicklow as well as the city of Dublin from Roundwood and Poulaphouca &mdash; and they are a rich authority. The Minister and her officials could perhaps be prompted to suggest that a joint effort to alleviate the hardship which is willingly borne by the population in this regard should be made.  The people of Wicklow see the lakes as a very valuable and worthwhile addition to a beautiful county but, at the same time they &mdash; like the people of Dublin or anywhere else &mdash; have a right to the full enjoyment and use of their land and property.</P>
    <P>The other lakes and waterways in Wicklow are not only important because of their use as a supply of drinking water, they have contributed to the unique scenic attractions of the county.  The lakes of Glendalough and the associated archaeological remains are one of Ireland's major tourist attractions.  The beaches of Wicklow are a major recreational amenity, not just to the people of Wicklow but to the people of this city and from surrounding inland counties.  The people of Wicklow, therefore, have a very special interest in this Bill and in its ultimate implementation when it passes into law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Before moving to the specific contents of the Bill, I should like to deal with a somewhat strident element which was introduced to the debate last night by a spokesperson for The Workers' Party. He singled out farmers and their organisations for what can only be described as a divisive and vicious attack.  It is true that farming operations cause problems with pollution, particularly &mdash; as happened over the last 15 years &mdash; when farming moved from being a low intensive activity to a high intensive activity. Everybody accepts that this transition and the educational process associated with it have been difficult.  It is also true &mdash; and farmers make this point &mdash; that some operators adopt an unacceptable, could not care less and slipshod attitude to the environment.  Farmers and farming organisations have been critical of such operators and they have been especially critical in County Wicklow of people who have transgressed in this regard. However, to revile the entire farming population for the sins of the few is surely doing them a grave injustice.  There are not many farmers in Bray but I detest the type of politics that seeks to create a division between those who live in towns &mdash; where I and most of my supporters live &mdash; and those who live in the countryside, where most of our forebears lived.  They are appealing to the urban voter by attacking the rural voter.  This approach is particularly worthy of condemnation in the context of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the protection of the environment is a task for the entire community. It is something that interests people in towns as much as those in the countryside.  The farming community with whom I have been in contact are most anxious to ensure that we have and maintain the highest standards.  They make the point themselves &mdash; and as late as last night the chairman of the IFA in County Wicklow made the point to me on the telephone &mdash; that the image of Ireland as a clean, unpolluted place is vital to their industry and to the sales of their products abroad.  They make the equally valid point that the very nature of farming means that they are in closer <Col N="745" /> contact with nature and the environment than many of us.  Conscientious farmers &mdash; and I would include 95 per cent to 98 per cent of all the farming community here &mdash; are conscious of their responsibilities to the environment.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party last evening attacked lobbying by farming organisations on this Bill.  The point to be made here is that this is an open parliamentary democracy.  The right of any group in society to lobby and make one's views known on any piece of legislation is central to the operations of our democratic system.  The right exists whether the lobbying is carried out by Greenpeace, Earthwatch or by the IFA.  It is a commonly shared right and one which every Member of this House should defend. One can understand that The Workers' Party &mdash; whose ideological roots lie outside democracy &mdash; may from time to time lose sight of this fact but the rest of us should not.  This is a democracy and lobbying and putting forward one's views is part of democracy.  It is wrong for any politician in this House to seek to deny that aspect of democracy.  After all The Workers' Party &mdash; we can forgive them for their oversight &mdash; still await reorientation in matters relating to democracy from a little further east than the city of Dublin.  However, we should not be drawn by their divisive rhetoric.  To seek to put a divide between rural and urban on this issue is totally reprehensible.  If a divide between rural and urban were to develop on this issue, ultimately it would be destructive to the emergence of a common cause for the protection of our environment among all the people of Ireland.  What we should be seeking to foster in this House is a common cause in support of the common interests of a clean and pure environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in drafting this Bill, rightly listened to the farming community as he did to other interested parties and, hopefully, as he and his Minister of State will listen to points made in the course of this debate.  After all that is what democracy is all about.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State made the point herself, the Bill itself is a very complex <Col N="746" /> one.  In the course of a Second Stage contribution it is not really possible to cover all of its features; in fact one would be ill advised to try.  There is a number of specific aspects of the Bill which warrant exposition and further discussion.  In section 3 there is a fundamental change in existing provisions in that a person charged must now be able to show that he could not reasonably have foreseen that an act or omission might have led to the pollution of a water system.  While this change means that a person who has acted manifestly stupidly, selfishly or carelessly cannot walk away from their responsibilities, in its drafting, it provides protection for those who, due to some unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances, become unwittingly involved in a pollution incident.  This seems to me to be very good drafting in that it means that the conscientious person is protected while the unconscientious person is not.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Deputy Durkan has left the House because this section addresses a concern he mentioned, one that has certainly been mentioned in representations I have received from the farming community and from industrialists, that is, that it is not always possible to foresee every circumstance; it is not always possible to provide when one is building, say, a slurry pit, septic tank or whatever, for every circumstance.  The one thing we can always be certain about is that the unexpected inevitably will happen at some time.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is important that the Bill &mdash; which after all does introduce some very swingeing conditions &mdash; should be so drafted that a person who can show they operated with good will, with due care and caution, who can show subsequently that some entirely unforeseeable act caused them to be involved in a pollution incident, is protected.  This is one of the subtleties in the drafting of the Bill which addresses major concerns on this specific aspect of the law which has been raised in some of the public debate.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 &mdash; extending the right to any person to seek a <Col N="747" /> court order against a polluter &mdash; are most welcome.  This provision fits in with the view I have outlined already, that the whole community should become active in the protection of the environment. When the provisions of this Bill are implemented it will be important to ensure that this section does not become the base from which vexatious claims or witch hunts can be launched against neighbours.  When one puts that type of provision into law there is always the danger it may be misused.  It is up to the courts and the various authorities to ensure that that provision is not misused. It is a very powerful provision and if used wrongly, a potentially dangerous one, but, on balance, it is a welcome provision because it clears a point with regard to legal standing which has been problematic to date.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said last evening, there will always be the hard core of polluters who ignore the common good.  There will always be people who will be mindless of their responsibilities. This hard core, this mindless group, will respond only to stiff penalties particularly if there is a high risk of their being caught and punished.  The provisions of this Bill include very stiff penalties.  Their full implementation by local authorities, fishery boards and third parties &mdash; who, under the provisions of section 7 will now be able to act &mdash; will certainly provide a very high risk of not merely being caught but of being punished.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a very potent mix of penalties.  For example, an increase of the maximum fine to £1,000 on summary conviction will certainly make people who are careless a little less so.  A maximum penalty of £25,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years for a conviction on indictment would certainly give people food for thought.  A new provision, under which polluters will have a civil liability for damage they cause allied to the extension of the right of action to third parties, will certainly extend dramatically the level of penalties available.</P>
    <P>A provision allowing the courts to grant both cash costs and expenses to <Col N="748" /> local authorities and to fishery boards against offenders is also provided in section 7.  That provision is certainly very welcome because it not merely extends the mix of penalties available but has the very beneficial effect &mdash; with which I will deal later &mdash; of assisting particularly fishery boards who on so many occasions have to pick up the pieces after a polluter has done his or her nasty deed.</P>
    <P>These penalties are very strong indeed and should certainly deter any but the most brazen from polluting activities.  I envisage that the provision of a civil liability for damages could provide not just a deterrent to the general body of polluters but could also provide an additional arrow to the bows of residents' associations and householders offended, I would suggest, by the operations of road developers.  I do not think any speaker has mentioned this matter so far.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow, for example, we have suffered greatly at the hands of road developers.  One aspect of road development inevitably is that they install very poor sewerage facilities that inevitably pollute.  Now not only will a local authority have the right to enforce completion of a development but residents' associations and private individuals, under the provisions of this Bill, will have the right to sue such developers and their limited companies for civil damages, which is a worthwhile extension.  I could envisage a situation where, for example, a road developer who installs a faulty sewerage system and then tries to walk away from the problem, or who delays in resolving the issue, will be open to very heavy penalties indeed under this provision.</P>
    <P>Another noteworthy aspect of the Bill is the increase in the powers of local authorities with regard to trade effluents. Particularly welcome in this regard are the provisions in sections 5 to 13.  The new provisions allow the local authorities to undertake on-the-spot reviews rather than to depend on the present system of three-yearly reviews.  This is surely wise because it is very obvious, if you read the papers, that from time to time people let standards slip shortly after they come into operation.  They clean up their act slightly <Col N="749" /> before the review and they go back to their bad habits after the review.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the &ldquo;Net Sales Proceeds&rdquo; return which is submitted to the EC in accordance with Council Directive 76/491/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have responsibility for the compilation of approximately 30 returns, all of which are sent to the EC or the IEA in accordance with agreed reporting procedures.  Only in the case of one return has some difficulty arisen.  In the case of the net sales proceeds return, this is prepared by an outside consultancy firm on behalf of the major oil companies because of some confidentiality concerns by the companies on commercial information. It has been the subject of queries from the EC in the recent past in view of apparently erroneous trends in data.  I also understand that certain of the companies who are a part of the survey have not made returns for some time. However, my Department have recently issued reminders to those companies who have not been making returns and I understand that the major oil companies <Col N="750" /> concerned will continue to submit data. I would hope that the matter can be rectified early in the new year and revised returns can be submitted to the EC shortly.</P>
    <P>I have no desire for my Department to intervene directly in the present <i>modus operandi</i> primarily because I wish to respect the sensitivities of the companies with regard to privileged financial data. However, the companies, together with their consultants, must make a move to resolve this problem sooner rather than later.  If not, my Department will take whatever steps are necessary to revive the data return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the failure to continue to provide information on distribution costs of oil products, which is one of the key elements of these returns, has not made it possible for the Fair Trade Commission, who were hired to look at Irish distribution costs, to do a proper study of this?  Would he not accept that this is not a matter that can be left in the present limbo, with no foreseeable change in the present gap in figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that it is going to be left with no foreseeable attempt being made to provide this information.  I think I made it clear in my reply that unless the companies concerned supply the information, in the form in which it is required, within a reasonable period, I will consider taking other steps to ensure that the information is obtained and sent on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main import of my supplementary is that these data, when they were last provided, showed that Irish distribution costs were two and a half times the average in Europe.  The Minister's colleague set up a Fair Trade Commission to look at this problem and no evidence was available from the Department to the commission although they are under obligation from the EC to provide it.  Would he not agree that that is just not good enough?</P>

It has not been reported to me that the Fair Trade Commission have had any difficulty because of what has happened with regard to these figures.  I assure the Deputy I will take appropriate action to ensure that the required data are supplied as soon as possible, if not through the existing arrangements then I would be prepared to introduce new arrangements to ensure that the information is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement referred to in Deputy Bryne's question was concluded between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the oil companies.  Part of that agreement was that INPC would make available to the companies an additional quantity of petrol at cost, and well below the prevailing market prices.</P>
      <P>The additional quantities of petrol were over and above the normal 35 per cent Whitegate supply produced by INPC during April and May 1989, and amounted to a further 25 per cent of Irish market requirements for a period of six weeks.  This additional volume was supplied to the oil companies on a cost recovery basis, that is, the price supplied ex-Whitegate was equal to INPC's purchase and production costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was part of the agreement, also, that INPC would continue to supply its normal 35 per cent up to 40 per cent below market prices, which for this volume gave rise to a loss for the company in the period in question &mdash; April to June 1989 &mdash; but resulted in consumer prices being lower than they would otherwise have been during the same period.  These losses are being recovered in current prices and INPC's accounts for its normal <Col N="753" /> domestic market supply will have been restored by the end of 1989.</P>

      <P>The diseconomies of the existing oil refining and supply arrangements must be addressed.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 47 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is a statutory body charged with developing and maintaining a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Any proposal for the extension of the gas grid must, therefore, be assessed in this light by the board.</P>
      <P>The board have, accordingly, concentrated to date on marketing gas in areas which are in close proximity to the existing transmission pipelines, which have existing gas grids, and which have a market which would justify the high capital expenditure required to supply gas.  Consideration may be given to the extension of supplies to other areas such as Tallaght in the longer term, but it would be unrealistic to assume the likelihood of supply in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>Further extensions to supply customers adjacent to the network will continue to be undertaken where it is commercially viable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he envisages that at any time there might be regional or environmental considerations outside of a strictly commercial type of assessment which would justify, for example, extending into the west of Ireland on regional grounds or extending into parts of Dublin city on environmental grounds?  Does he envisage that that is a possible direction in which to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that any extension on regional grounds will be based on commercial viability criteria. The question of an extension in Dublin is under consideration on environmental grounds at present by a committee established by the Government headed by senior officials of the Department of the Environment and includes officials from my Department and a number of other State agencies. This committee are looking at the supply <Col N="756" /> of energy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the current smog problem in Dublin and the role natural gas might play in bringing about a satisfactory solution to that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 13, 14 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working group on interconnection in 1988 concluded that an electricity link with the UK appeared to be economically viable and merited consideration of proceeding with pre-contract phase discussions and studies. Detailed discussions and studies have not yet commenced but it is expected that these would take about one to two years to complete at which stage it would be possible to make a definite decision on whether to proceed with the link.  The <Col N="757" /> group estimated that the total capital cost of the interconnector would be approximately £160 million, in 1985 prices, and that there would be a six year lead time to complete the link.</P>
    <P>The report also concluded that there was a strong economic case for restoration of the link to Northern Ireland but that there were other difficulties involved in this regard.  Continuous attacks and threats by subversives have frustrated efforts to restore the line.</P>
    <P>The report centred on the technical and economic feasibility of electricity interconnection but other aspects, including the source of the electricity, would have to be considered before any final decision is made.</P>
    <P>Regarding common carrier rules for electricity, at this stage the Commission is only referring to transit rights between European electricity utilities as opposed to common carriage which would give users the choice of supplier.  The possibility of agreement on this proposal enhances Ireland's interest in interconnection and in the economic feasibility of such a proposal.  At the most recent Energy Council in October, I accepted the general approach of the Commission's proposal as being an appropriate one and in our best interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister two supplementaries.  If an electricity interconnector is going to be the next major provision of capacity for the ESB would the Minister not agree that two years before he is in a position to say whether a decision can be made and six years lead time is too long to meet the rising demands for electricity?  With regard to transit would the Minister say how he believes transit rules and ultimately a common carrier, which the EC would like to see, will affect the ESB who are sustaining peat burning stations at costs which are not competitive with European electricity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the lead time I have given the Deputy the estimate made by the committee who reported on the matter.  However, I have no doubt <Col N="758" /> that if at any stage the Government consider this to be a matter of any great urgency it is possible that the lead time could be reduced somewhat.  As the Deputy is aware there is a difficulty with Britain because of their recent proposal to privatise electricity.  Because of what has happened there it is not possible for our side to advance discussions with the British authorities very far until we find out which authority we will be dealing with on that side.  This is adding some slight delay to this matter.</P>
      <P>The question of common carriage is not on the agenda at EC level.  I believe this is unlikely to be achieved.  I expect that the most which will be achieved through the Council, Commission and Parliament are rights of transit between utilities.  That seems to be as far as that proposal will be advanced in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the discussions which took place at the time the committee reported on the meetings which took place with the British authorities it was, of course, envisaged that there would be a sharing of the costs between the British authorities and ourselves and that it would not be oneway traffic: electricity could be shed at peak times and there would be an opportunity for the Irish to sell electricity to the British system and <i>vice versa</i> whenever it suited either authority.  Following extensive research carried out by the officials who did the work it was deemed that there were opportunities for both sides and that, as well as having the possibility of cheaper electricity being made available to us, which would avoid the necessity of spending large amounts of capital in the construction of new power stations, it would also enable us to have access to possibly cheaper electricity at times and would give us the opportunity of selling back electricity at times when we are off peak and the other side were on peak.</P>

Other countries are making available the information they have. Given our financial circumstances, what we have been doing up to now is satisfactory. We have been encouraging the utilisation of the finance available through the EC.  As I say, Eolas have been playing an important role in assisting those projects.

      <P>If I have time, I would like to outline to the House the projects which are being funded at present.  These <Col N="766" /> include a project to advance the introduction of energy-conscious building into the mainstream architectural design throughout the EC, which is being carried out by the School of Architecture at UCD.  It is a project leader.  Included also are a project to promote the transfer of information from the solar research community to the building and construction profession throughout the EC, a project to assess the suitability of fotavoltaic to Northern European latitudes, being carried out at UCC; a project to examine the possibility of using fotavoltaic as a source of energy for domestic applications at Northern European latitudes being carried out at UCC; a project to identify problems with batteries in fotavoltaic systems and to develop solutions, also being carried out at UCC; a project to study electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties, being undertaken at Trinity College Dublin; and a project to identify the extent to which a glazed street between two buildings due to solar and other gains will reduce energy consumption, being carried out at Dublin City University.  All of these projects are being funded.  Therefore an extensive range of research into solar energy is taking place in this country at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the plans he has to increase the level of research undertaken in this country to provide alternative sources of power in order to reduce the level of air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available show that in the period 1980-87, State expenditure in this area totalled almost £4 million.  I have no immediate plans to increase the level of research undertaken in this country to provide alternative sources of power in order to reduce the level of air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short term alternative sources of energy in Ireland could only be expected to make a helpful but limited contribution <Col N="767" /> to the solution of the air pollution problem.</P>
    <P>The substitution of a significant use of natural gas for oil has already made a notable contribution to the resolution of this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incomprehensible, at a time when Dublin is choking with pollution, that the level of research is decreasing.  Would the Minister agree that the fossil fuel burning power stations are major contributors to the air pollution problem as well as to the acid rain problem, not only in this country but also in northern Europe?  Would the Minister agree, too, that it is time we got down to carrying out some serious research, not just research which is of marginal benefit as he has already outlined in his previous reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The sources of the pollution have been clearly identified and extensive research is not required.  What is required is that we seek to replace, wherever possible, the types of energy causing pollution.  As I said in my reply, there is no harm in making reference to the great benefits we have derived from the use of natural gas, such as a substantial reduction in oil imports, the burning of which contributes to air pollution. I hope with continued exploration and given the possibility of constructing an interconnector with our neighbours and the creation of an internal energy market in the EC it will be possible for us to continue to make progress.  Greater use of natural gas will help in eliminating the air pollution problem.  I have already informed the House, in answer to an earlier question, that a special committee has been set up, chaired by a senior official in the Department of the Environment, to examine the smog problem in the Dublin region which has been referred to to see if natural gas can play a role in finding a solution to that problem. Therefore, much action is being taken on a number of fronts.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="768" /> agree that it is about time there was greater investment in natural gas and that Bord Gáis were encouraged to develop their programme even more?  Would he further agree that we could eliminate the air pollution problem by constructing an interconnector with Britain or the European mainland and reducing the level of pollution caused by the fossil fuel burning power stations?  Finally, would the Minister confirm or deny recent suggestions that his Department are, again, considering using nuclear energy as a possible power source?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel he has been compromised in any way by British policy on nuclear power and on nuclear waste discharges and dumping? Does the Minister think that we should have our own policy for disposal of our waste, especially at a time when we are thumping tables about nuclear dumping by Britain?  We are badly compromised in our dealings with Britain because of a lack of policy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel in any way compromised.  There is very little nuclear waste emanating from this country, as explained in the Nuclear Energy Board report dated December 1988.  The report says that the present system, whereby most of the waste ends up in sewers, is adequate for the moment but that should there be a substantial increase in usage, alternative means of disposal may be required and that if such a situation arose due consideration would have to be given to the provision of a national <Col N="771" /> radioactive waste storage facility and incinerator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware that two years ago a parliamentary delegation went from this House to Sellafield and the British nuclear fuel people were happy to point out that whilst we were complaining about their dumping, they were taking care of our waste.  Will the Minister now take some positive action to eliminate that source of embarrassment and compromise that exists in relation to our attitude to Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts have been made to buy a site and we are awaiting the arrival of specialists in that area to advise us.  I understand that there is a delay because of work they have on hand elsewhere, so we have to wait in the queue before we get the benefit of the advice from these experts.  So far, no site for radioactive waste disposal has been identified here.  Any proposal to build a radioactive waste disposal facility will have to take into account the legitimate concerns of people living close to the site.  The Deputy knows how difficult it would be to find a suitable location.  A consultation process will be necessary and it would possibly include participation by local interests in a trustee monitoring group.  It is not something that we as a Government can just decide.  I see a lengthy process of identification of suitable sites first, based on the recommendations of those suitably qualified, and then a consultation process with residents who may be in the vicinity of the suggested locations.</P>
      <P>With regard to Sellafield, I do not have the evidence suggested by Deputy Allen. I am informed that sealed radiation sources used by the hospitals and the laboratories are currently returned to the suppliers abroad who are contracted to take them away after their useful life. The suppliers' method of waste disposal is not known to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of incidents over the past three years have had no radiological significance for Ireland. Under a typical formal arrangement, which the Deputy seems to be suggesting, we would not have been informed at all of those incidents.  It is better to have the fullest possible information available to me.  I do not wish to sacrifice this for short term gains in publicity or whatever.  The possibility of a formal bilateral agreement has been discussed by the Department with the UK authorities but at present, my view, shared by the UK, is that the multilateral notification agreements established in the EC and the IAEA are a satisfactory arrangement and that the informal agreement with the UK adds considerably to this, so that there is no necessity for a formal bilateral agreement. If the position changes I have not <Col N="774" /> a closed mind on the matter and I will certainly reconsider the present arrangements. Having looked at them carefully, I am satisfied, at present anyway, that existing arrangements are satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks that details and statistics are helpful I can tell him that since October 1985 we have been notified of 114 incidents.  There have been only nine notifications since the beginning of this year.  We took the decreasing number of incidents up with the UK at the meeting of the contact group which was held in November last and we were informed at that meeting that they had refined the reporting arrangements within the UK, and that the operators do not report to the Department of the Environment incidents of an unimportant nature which occur on site. We no longer, therefore, get reports of incidents of a non-radiological nature. However, we were assured at that meeting that there had been no change in the arrangements for reporting incidents to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a recent suggestion by the chairman of BNFL that they would only agree to a European inspectorate of these sorts of incidents and operations if it was at a second remove, not by conducting direct inspections?  Could he give an indication that such type of operation would be totally unacceptable and out of tenor with what we need in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that any improvements we can achieve in the inspectorate area is an advance and something we would welcome.  The Deputy is aware that it will be one of the <Col N="775" /> objectives of the Irish Presidency to work for the establishment of an EC inspectorate of nuclear plants within the Community. I am hoping that we will make some progress in that area.  We have brought it up at preliminary meetings prior to our Presidency and intend to have it on the agenda at EC meetings.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, at his general Councils, will probably bring it forward. That is perhaps the correct place for it.  As President of the Energy Council, however, I will be availing of whatever opportunities present themselves to bring Ireland's concern in this matter to the attention of, and to gain support from, the other member countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that 114 incidents is 114 incidents too many in view of the past cover ups by the British authorities of more serious incidents?  Will the Minister now confirm that there is a major departure by his Government in relation to their policy on the closure of Sellafield and the demands for a European inspectorate?  His previous reply indicates that there is a major departure from Government policy, and what was said in Opposition is different from what is being said now in Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The emissions into the Irish Sea which were the subject of a lot of controversy until recent times, have dropped off dramatically in recent times and I am satisfied that the system whereby we have <Col N="776" /> an arrangement with the British that they inform us of incidents is working satisfactorily. I have no reason at this point to feel dissatisfied with it.  I will keep it under constant review.

I am satisfied, from the information available to me in the Department, that we have a good flow of information from the British authorities in regard to incidents. I would be happier if a stringent EC inspectorate system was in place so we would have the opportunity to check on the spot on some of the matters that are being reported to us.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he has initiated steps to arrange for each Government Department to prepare an energy audit in respect of their buildings with a view to reducing the waste of energy and resources in order to reduce costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Departments generally had individual energy liaison officers to oversee and reduce energy conservation in the early eighties and energy audits were in fact carried out in 23 buildings up to 1986.  This practice has fallen into disuse but it should be noted that investments made then continue to save energy now in many cases.  In addition the installation of new boilers in public offices in Dublin in the context of the gas conversion programme means that many Departments have modern efficient heating systems.  Nevertheless, it has been arranged in 1989 that intensive energy auditing and appropriate economically justifiable investment be carried out in the offices of the Department of Energy and at EOLAS.  A key ingredient of this project is that the energy and price information and return on investment where appropriate will be accurately measured. Benchmarks for energy requirements per head and per cubic metre will also be devised.  The expectation is that this project will create a current data-base which will serve as a tool to promote copy-cat action by other Departments which will be promoted by EOLAS in due course.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the International Energy Agency was very critical of the Government's policy in this area, quoting the poor example that it was providing and citing evidence of up to 20 per cent of costs of energy that could be saved in Government buildings?  In view of that would the Minister not regard this response of an audit soley confined to the Department of Energy as an inadequate response to already established savings that were there to be taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the possibility of achieving further substantial savings in energy costs through the operation of proper conservation methods in buildings and the Government sector has a role to play in this.  I am pleased that my own Department are now undertaking this exercise to provide an opportunity to draw up a programme of action which can be applied in the case of other Government buildings and which hopefully will achieve the level of cost savings that I believe are possible.  It should be possible for us to achieve another 10 per cent in energy cost savings from the introduction of new efficiency methods of conservation. It is an area that I have a particular interest in and I am anxious to give it a lot more attention than it has had in the last five years.</P>

There are people in the market who would provide energy saving investments in Government buildings.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Energy conservation has for many years formed an important part of energy policy.  Conservation is deemed to be the quickest and most effective way of mitigating the environmental problems associated with energy usage.  The Department's conservation programme which was recently modified to take account of the increasing significance of environmental considerations has also targeted specific buildings for attention. These include the Department of Energy and Eolas buildings, hotels and hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of energy conservation is beyond the reach of the vast majority of ordinary people?  Given this, will he accept it was a monumental error for a Government to discontinue grants for insulation of homes at windows, doors, attics, etc.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="780" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme was introduced when there was a great, urgent need for it.  If the Deputy looks back he will see it was very expensive, and all these measures have a cost factor. The economy required that some action be taken in regard to the massive expenditure on home improvement grants. That factor cannot be ignored when considering this matter.  However, I think each person in his own way can achieve savings within his own home if the will and the desire are there to achieve them. It involves prudent management of one's family and household budget.  I think it is possible where, including, as I mentioned, Government buildings and so on, to eliminate waste in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that Ireland's performance in increasing energy efficiency has lagged behind that of our European partners? Will he also agree that if we continue with the present approach to conservation we will have no chance of achieving the 20 per cent reduction in energy intensity which he as our Minister has put his name to in the EC?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The thermal insulation standards in the published draft building regulations, for which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has primary responsibility, were increased in 1984.  Although the regulations are still in draft form they are being implemented in practice and that has achieved substantial improvements in the whole area of conservation.  In addition the energy phone service operated by Eolas on behalf of my Department was relaunched this autumn with a wider remit to deal with energy and the environment.  This is the main means of communicating to the domestic sector energy users.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that we have fallen behind the EC and there is no chance, on the policies the Minister is reciting to us here, that we will achieve the target we have agreed to at European level.  Will he agree that he must look at introducing a conservation strategy as <Col N="781" /> Minister for Energy and not rely on these disparate elements through the Minister for the Environment and other locations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy referred to disparate elements because there are so many different aspects to this whole area.  I am giving thought at present to devising an energy statement. How comprehensive it might be I am not sure yet, but I feel there is need for a clear approach to all these matters.  I am considering undertaking that statement to identify all the areas that need to be tackled.  Of course, there is a cost involved in all these matters and that determines how fast we can go.  A great deal has been done and the building regulations should not be dismissed as insignificant. In time they will help to improve our standing substantially, if one is making international comparisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I hope he will look at the possibility under building by-laws that we can incorporate into the building of both private and public buildings the most modern conservation techniques.  In this way we could deal with it at the outset rather than having to deal with it by costly means later.</P>

I am always supportive of any move to improve the quality of the environment. In this instance I believe the level of emissions of sulphur from gas oil in Ireland compares very favourably with our EC partners.  The Deputy may know that before the takeover of the refinery by the State the sulphur and gas oil volume here amounted to 0.8 per cent. Current sulphur and gas oil volume is just one quarter of those earlier levels.  If there is agreement to reduce the levels by all means we will have to comply, but I am not aware that there is any intention to reduce the requirements in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will outline the Government's policy in relation to the method which should be used for assessing liability for royalty payments when mining licences are issued; if, in light of the Tara experience, he intends to ensure that all future licences provide for a royalty based on each tonne of ore extracted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to settle mining lease royalty terms having regard to the nature, characteristics and projected economic outturn of each particular deposit in respect of which a lease application has been made. In settling future royalty terms my Department will take account of experience gained in operating royalty provisions in previous leases and in some cases royalty will be levied on a royalty per tonne basis.  Such a royalty basis would not always operate in the State's best interests.  In the case of metals, such as zinc and lead for instance, where frequent and substantial metal price and currency fluctuations are a feature of the market a royalty per tonne could yield a poor return to the State when metal prices are high and it could be damaging to the viability of the mining enterprise when prices are low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister I had the opportunity of visiting this particular mine this morning as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Would the Minister agree, having referred to the experience gained by the State, that that experience was disastrous and that the original lease in 1975 was fundamentally flawed as a result of which &mdash; irrespective of the Minister's answer about the price of ore rising or falling on the metal exchange &mdash; the taxpayer got ripped off? Whether the price of lead or zinc rose or fell, virtually no royalties accrued to the taxpayer although some £608 million worth of ore has been exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the <Col N="786" /> Deputy that if we were at this time considering what terms we would apply to a company such as Tara, who were proposing to undertake the development of that mine, those terms would be substantially different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that to permit any multinational company to determine the level of its profits before the State gets any share of the stake is foolish, having regard to the widespread use of the transfer of pricing mechanism in order to present profits in accordance with the wishes of that particular multinational company in any country?  A royalty extracted on the tonnage of ore would be more beneficial to the State than a royalty extracted on profits.  Will the Minister consider this situation in terms of the mining leases he is examining, and to which he referred earlier, and specifically in the case of Galmoy on the Laois-Kilkenny border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I am not here to pass historical judgment on decisions that were made in regard to the Tara Mines operation other than to say that, in my view, they were not satisfactory.

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, does the Minister accept that the present method of levying royalties was so unsuccessful in the case of Tara and the State was so frustrated trying to establish whether royalties were due, that it ended up being forced to sell off the State's stake in Tara Mines &mdash; the largest mine in Europe &mdash; for a knock down price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says we are discussing the present royalties system, there is no present royalties system.  I said that if there was a new find all the various options would be considered by the Minister and the Government of the day before any final decision would be made.  I am assuring the House that a similar arrangement would not <Col N="787" /> again be entered into.  The provision in the State mining lease granted to Tara was for royalties to be levied on profits as computed for corporation profits tax purposes.  The basis was used very satisfactorily in a number of other mining operations in Ireland prior to the granting of the Tara lease, and it is very commonly used in other countries.  As Deputies will be aware, the problem in the Tara case was that significant differences arose on a number of variables in the calculation of the company's profits.  If in the future this royalty basis was used again it would, of course, be necessary to define very carefully in advance how the profit figure should be arrived at or to consider whether an entirely different basis should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

In that areas he has a 12.5 per cent royalty on turnover along the lines suggested by Deputy Rabbitte. Would he agree therefore, that it would be more sensible to establish <i>ab initio</i> or a previous system of royalty in advance of a discovery and that that would be known to be the system and that it would give an equitable return to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be advisable to adopt a set of royalty proposals in advance of any find.  I think the present position is the most satisfactory one from the point of view of the State.  Each discovery should be examined carefully, its value, its extent, its life and the cost involved in extracting the mineral, oil or gas.  Based on the expert assessment of the various costs involved, the State should decide at that point what its take would be.  In relation to the gas deal, to which the Deputy has referred, it is generally recognised that Ireland has done quite well out of the arrangement that has been entered into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of exchanges in this House this morning a remark that I can only describe as being an uncouth and most unworthy remark was made from the Fianna Fáil benches to my colleague, Deputy Austin Currie. It is a remark, a Cheann Comhairle, which I think is most unworthy of this House in that it shows a meanness of spirit and a poverty of political thought that is utterly to be deplored.  I wrote to you, Sir, and to the Taoiseach notifying you of my intention to come in here at this time today to ask the Government to take steps to ensure that the person who made the remark, comes into this House formally to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> I might add that the remark was clearly heard on these benches.  I am given to understand that it was picked up on the recording equipment in the House and I am told also that it is the unanimous recollection of the Press Gallery &mdash; against whom we could not, of course, argue &mdash; that the remark was made.  It may be that one Deputy on the other side of the House was erroneously accused of having made that remark this morning, Sir, but that is all the more reason the Government should take steps to ensure that whoever made the remark should come in here and withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Government's silence merits the same description that I applied to the remark.  It shows a meanness of spirit and a poverty of any political thought that the Government would not have the decency to arrange for a remark as insulting as the one that was made this morning, as partitionist, as ignorant as the one that was made this morning, to be withdrawn in this House. It is to the shame of the Taoiseach and his Chief Whip and every Member of the Government side that that remark is allowed stand.</P>

      <P>I am appalled at the behaviour of Deputy Dukes in making such strange allegations. Any remark that may have been made was not clearly heard on this side of the House and if Deputy Dukes knows who made such a remark perhaps he will communicate with me to let me know. Certainly we did not hear any remark on this side of the House, and indeed Deputy Barry very unfairly accused the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, of making the remark.  He was totally in the wrong but he apologised and we accepted it.  It is grossly unfair of Deputy Dukes to come in here now and try to make capital out <Col N="819" /> of this issue.  As I said, if Deputy Dukes knows who made the remark he should communicate with us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes issued a press release this morning and he wrote to the Taoiseach shortly after 3 o'clock knowing that he had left for Strasbourg.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="820" />
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies on this side of the House, I feel that if Deputy Dukes is not prepared to be specific and put up, then he should do the other.  The sort of exchanges that take place here do not matter greatly but I &mdash; and the majority of Members &mdash; are delighted to have Deputy Currie in the House.</P>
      <P>Earlier this morning I welcomed the legislation and I suggested that the proposals in the Bill allowing for the Government commitment to historically high levels of investment as outlined in the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i> marked a very important step forward in the protection of our environment.  I also made the point that while legislation such as this was welcome &mdash; as well as the Government's investment proposals &mdash; the real guardians of our environment are the people themselves.  I suggested to the Minister and the Minister of State that they might consider the idea of a continuous education programme urging the public to mobilise as watchdogs of environmental standards.</P>
      <P>Before we broke for Question Time I was on the point of suggesting that the increase in the powers of local authorities with regard to trade effluent is a noteworthy provision in the Bill.  I also said that the provisions in sections 5 to 13 were particularly welcome because they allow local authorities to undertake on the spot reviews rather than depending on the present three year review system which requires the local authorities to review at specific points and, therefore, allow polluters to ease up on their standards in the first two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also suggested that the Bill's provisions in relation to the fisheries boards are very welcome.  For a long time the boards operated under something of a shadow.  The Bill recognises the major contribution made by the fisheries boards over the years and to their control of water pollution, especially in the area of fisheries protection.  The boards had a constant anxiety that the Water Pollution Act, 1977, would take away the legislative control they had at their disposal under the fisheries consolidation Act. <Col N="821" /> This would have been a major tragedy in the areas of fisheries protection and in the prevention of pollution generally.  For that reason I specifically welcome the fact that in this legislation not only will sections 17 (1) and 17 (2) of the fisheries consolidation Act be reaffirmed, but that they will be substantially extended in the matter of a penalty.  The increase in fines is welcome but the extension of the law which will allow the board not only to take steps against a polluter and to impose a fine, but will allow the board to redress the damage done by pollution and restore costs to the board is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>In the past the situation was ludicrous in that the boards could certainly take action in the courts against the polluter, especially in relation to a habitual polluter, and could impose fines but the fines &mdash; particularly in the context of major industries &mdash; were regarded as a minor irritant.  An example of the kind of offence which arose in the past and which, I hope, will be addressed by the Bill was the disgraceful case of continuous pollution of the Feale, one of the finest salmon rivers in Europe.  The polluter was a major and wealthy enterprise and simply paid the fines as they arose.  They represented a minuscule imposition on the company's resources and they simply returned to their bad ways.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide that this can no longer be the case.  It will not be possible for polluters simply to pay fines, dismiss all the complaints and walk away from the problem.  The polluters will now have to pay the long-term costs of their activities. In the case of a company such as the one which destroyed the River Feale in Kerry they will have to pay the cost of restocking the river and the other associated costs which had been borne previously by the fisheries boards.  This is very welcome because the fisheries boards have not been adequately financed in the past.  The powers of the board in this area are a very positive aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill, in the context of fisheries protection, is important. <Col N="822" /> Because the Bill will allow private individuals and groups who have a genuine interest to take action where a polluter is destroying an angling river, angling clubs will also be empowered to do something more than simply standing on the bank and wringing their hands in frustration when the river in which they have invested a great deal of resources has been destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Dargle River, Bray, is a fabulous one and many people have put an awful lot of effort into it.  Pollution is not the problem there, it is simply law breaking and poaching.  It is sad to see the destruction that goes on but, at least in the context of polluting a river, the Bill, when enacted, will provide a club, in addition to the fisheries boards, with powers to deal with the problem, which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I commend not only the Minister and the Minister of State for introducing the Bill but particularly the former Minister, Deputy Daly, for his efforts in regard to the legislation. I will conclude soon because I know many other Members are champing at the bit to make their own contributions.</P>
    <P>There is a final positive aspect to this Bill with regard to fisheries protection and the role of the fisheries boards.  I think it was Juvenal, the Roman poet, who asked the question: who guards the guardian?  I welcome the expanded role of the fisheries board under this Bill so far as pollution by local authorities is concerned.  There is no point denying that it does occur from time to time and, when it does, it is important that somebody be there to monitor it and to challenge any guilty local authority.  The provisions of this Bill, in so far as they extend or enhance the powers of fisheries boards are welcome.</P>
    <P>Overall this is a very welcome Bill.  I hope it will have a speedy passage and that we will see its provisions implemented very soon because they have much to recommend them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity <Col N="823" /> to speak on this important Bill, the motivation for which stems from the mid-eighties and the number of fish kills that occurred around that period, which incidents gave rise to much public concern.</P>
      <P>An unfortunate aspect of the debate so far in some quarters &mdash; not in the House at present &mdash; is that it has tended to turn into farmer-bashing.  That is quite unfortunate because it is a misinterpretation of the purpose of the Bill and of public concern which was with pollution and certainly not with being anti-farmer.</P>
      <P>It is amusing, were it not so serious, to watch the political posturing and the exhaustive efforts of many parties concerned with this debate to board the green bandwagon.  The danger is that, in so doing, much, if not all, of their energies will be expended with little being left to drive it and steer the country and its environmental issues into a sound, secure future.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said last evening, it is important to put the issue in perspective.  We have experienced a number of difficult years but, in the European context, we still have quite an attractive and clean environment.  It is ironic and unfortunate that many initiatives have tended to be forced on us by Europe whereas Europe looks to us with much envy with regard to our environmental attractions.  As a country we need to be to the forefront in leading environmental awareness and improvement within a European context rather than being prodded or forced into action in order to safeguard it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill, particularly the principle that the polluter should pay, although there are some sections about which I would be somewhat concerned.  Excessive emphasis on farming and agricultural to the exclusion of other polluters &mdash; be they local authorities, industrial or whoever &mdash; is something that needs to be redressed in the context of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the debate last evening and Deputy Gilmore's contribution on behalf of The Workers' Party, I <Col N="824" /> could not help but note his farmer-bashing approach which appeared to me to tend to divide society in an endeavour to conquer the urban vote on this issue. I could not but remember that Deputy Gilmore is a member of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council which, for numerous years, have spewed raw sewage into Dún Laoghaire Bay.  From my experience of local authorities I know that is something over which somebody like Deputy Gilmore would not have direct control, it being dependent on capital allocation from the Department of the Environment, but as illogical as it was for him to blame all farmers for pollution, it would be equally illogical of me to blame him for the position obtaining in Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  Nonetheless, his attitude is indicative of an approach to divide and conquer.  That type of political posturing on such an important issue is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note the last sentence of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum accompanying this Bill which reads:</P>
    <P>The Bill does not give rise to any additional financial or staffing costs.</P>
    <P>I find that difficult to comprehend because, all of us who have been involved in local authorities since 1985, are well aware that &mdash; given the coincidence of the voluntary redundancy/early retirement package and the embargo on recruitment in the Civil Service &mdash; local authorities have been placed in an unenviable position with regard to many of their statutory obligations.  For example, their staffing levels are now quite inadequate to police the type of policies and laws we are debating here as well as in numerous other areas in respect of which they have a statutory responsibility.  With regard to the financial implications for local authorities I do not agree that any legislation can be introduced without its having financial implications.  Its implementation would automatically suggest an increased volume of work which, on existing staff, can lead to inefficiencies through no fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>One has only to look to what happened <Col N="825" /> in the farm development service where the civil and public service unions members &mdash; because numerous schemes dealing with the control of pollution have been foisted on the farm development service with little or no consideration being given to staffing levels or its financing &mdash; legitimately are refusing to process farmyard anti-pollution grants.  That demonstrates that one cannot foist additional responsibilities and duties on local authorities without providing the requisite finance and personnel.</P>
    <P>That feature of the Bill which deals with local authorities as beneficiaries in any court proceedings is something about which I am quite concerned, given the dependence of local authorities on central Government for funding and the fact that since 1977, when rates were abolished, their annual allocations have been significantly reduced leaving them unable to carry out many of their statutory duties.  Therefore, my fear would be that, in some instances, the provisions of this Bill might be used as a vehicle for raising revenue for local authorities.  From my experience over four or five years of dealing with local authorities I have found that most officials behave in a commendable way.  Nonetheless, my fear is that this Bill could be used as a vehicle to make up for the shortfall in Government funds.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer when dealing with water pollution is the pollution of the Irish Sea &mdash; touched on by Deputy Roche already &mdash; and the question of Sellafield, which has implications for all the bays and inlets, particularly on our east coast which allegedly suffer from one of the most radioactive seas in the world at present. Despite much hype about this Government taking on the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels with regard to Sellafield, the recent decision not to proceed with those court cases is regrettable. In the context of the provisions of this Bill, where will such decision leave the right of individuals, local authorities <Col N="826" /> or fisheries boards to pursue legitimate claims?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a case when the Minister of State was in Opposition but it appears &mdash; in this context &mdash; to have changed significantly when she moved from this side of the House to the Government benches.  That decision is regrettable given the fact we were led to believe there was a case to answer.  Now, for some unknown reason, never published or debated, we are being told there is no case to answer.  In the context of the pollution of our bays and inlets there will be no redress available to people concerned about that pollution which is, indeed, regrettable.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, there is an overemphasis in the debate with regard to farmers as polluters to the exclusion of other polluters.  However, there is a number of specific inclusions which relate in particular to agriculture and farming enterprises.  I have no brief for either the IFA or the ICMSA as was alleged last night by a speaker on behalf of The Workers' Party when he said that we seem to be kowtowing to demands made by vested interests.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Roche that this is an open democracy where everybody, be it trade unions, on behalf of whom Deputy Gilmore would probably like to think he has a monopoly of interest, or farmers, has the right to lobby with regard to legislation, and the IFA have done that in a responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of provisions in the Bill which I am quite concerned about, in particular section 7 which deals with extending to any person the right to seek a court order requiring the person responsible for causing water pollution to mitigate or remedy any effects of the pollution in the manner and within the period specified by a court.  I have reservations about granting to the individual the right to pursue polluters because it may give rise to crank prosecutions in the case of bad neighbours.  That right should be vested solely in local authorities or in <Col N="827" /> the regional fisheries boards who operate an open door with regard to complaints by the public to investigate and, if necessary, proceed with prosecution.  The other system would lead to a certain number of crank prosecutions which, although they would have to be justified in the same way as a prosecution by a local authority or a regional fisheries board, would be pursued for pure nuisance and bad neighbourliness.</P>
    <P>There is another danger in that regard. We are unique in a European context in the openness which Irish farmers have shown to their urban counterparts and indeed to international visitors by giving them freedom to walk through their lands and to fish their rivers.  If this section goes through unamended, the farmer will be forced to protect himself and there could be a closing of access to the Irish countryside which would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>Another section about which I have reservations is section 20 which excludes from civil liability pollutants from certain non-agricultural activities.  That anti-farmer bias needs to be tackled.  The point I would like to put to the Minister of State in this regard is that in the event of a town in this country spewing raw sewage in acceptable levels &mdash; there are supposed to be so-called acceptable levels &mdash; which do not threaten the aquatic life of a river, there has to be some degree of responsibility on the local authority concerned because fish kills or environmental damage may result from a further addition of chemical, industrial or agricultural emissions further up-stream. That is something that is not dealt with in the Bill.  It would appear that local authority and certain other non-agricultural pollutants will be acceptable while other people, particularly farmers in the context of section 20, will have to carry the can.  I also have considerable reservations about section 21 with regard to the introduction of by-laws.  This matter needs to be teased out further on Committee Stage and there should be greater consultation at local level with all vested interests.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I agree with the broad <Col N="828" /> thrust of the Bill.  The principle that the polluter should pay is something which everyone who has an interest in this debate will accept.  It will eliminate the cowboys in the agricultural and industrial areas and indeed in certain local authority areas who have been making considerable contributions to pollution over a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things I have been most interested in all my life has been the environment, particularly the water environment.  I welcome this new Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill.  More regular pollution control of open waters is essential. Clean water is paramount to our wellbeing, to industry, agriculture, recreational activities and tourism.  There has been a spate of fish kills in our rivers and lakes in recent years due primarily to agricultural pollution from silage and intensive livestock units.  An analysis has shown that pollution from these sources has increased by 500 per cent in the eighties. I am not trying to, as the previous speaker has said, knock the farming community. I am just making a statement of fact that there has been dreadful pollution from that particular source as well as others.</P>
      <P>As a city person, I think it is very sad when visiting the country to see nice rivers and lakes fenced off so that the cattle in the fields cannot drink those waters.  The farmer has lost out as much as anyone else.  At this stage I must compliment the Minister for the Environment because I believe that position has improved greatly in the past year or two. This year was a very dry year and great problems could have been created.  There was a time when on travelling through parts of the country you would get a dreadful stench from the water alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agri-industry, industry and local authorities have not been entirely to blame, not by a long shot.  The water management plans for catchment areas, drawn up by the Department of the Environment, and the regulation of water standards should be integrated into the proposed role of the Environmental <Col N="829" /> Protection Agency, in conjunction with the local authorities.  The primary and secondary knock-on effects of developments of our open waters should be looked at more closely by environmental consultants, trained in the techniques of environment predictions.  The demise, through pollution for over a decade and primarily through intensive piggeries, of Lough Sheelin, a priceless asset both at home and abroad, and the effects these intensive units have had on drinking water standards in the area should be a reminder of what can happen when the environment is not properly taken into account at the initial planning stages.</P>
    <P>As stated, river pollution is one of the things we are all concerned about.  The Tolka River flows through my constituency, as does the Liffey.  A short time ago the Tolka was polluted by oil and it was heartbreaking to see swans, ducks and all sorts of wildlife floating around in a dreadful oily substance.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals did their best but after the wildlife were taken away and cleaned they went straight back to the very same environment. There is no point in saying that the people who caused that pollution did not know it was going to happen.  They should have known and they should be prosecuted.  One of the good things about this Bill is that it will not be a defence to say you did not think or did not expect this to happen.  It is up to the polluters to know that what they are doing is dangerous to the environment.  The increase in fines proposed in the Bill may not be a great deterrent in the case of some industries but the idea that whatever damage they do they must replace will be more of a deterrent.  If they pollute the water supply to a main city or town, they will have to pay for that.  They will also have to pay for the replacement of fish stocks in rivers where there are fish kills and to take oil or any other pollutant out of the water.</P>
    <P>One of the things which often worried me was that when a licence was given by a licensing authority it was difficult to revoke it.  Under this Bill a licence can <Col N="830" /> be revoked at any time by a local authority or some other authority.  This is a very good provision.  Under the Bill individuals will be able to take legal action against polluters and it will not be necessary for a local authority or some well meaning fisheries board to do.  This is one of the better provisions in the Bill. If somebody refuses to divulge relevant information about polluters to the relevant authorities they will be liable to a fine or a term of imprisonment.  Many companies do not care about the environment and under this Bill the managing director, secretary or the person directly responsible for the pollution can be fined or given a term of imprisonment.  I look forward to the day when a polluter is put in prison for a few days or months for destroying the environment.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a few points which are indirectly related to the Bill.  Little attention has been paid to our wetlands and the role they play in regulating and purifying our water.  They act as a sponge by holding in water during wet weather and releasing it during dry periods.  The drainage of these valuable wetlands for short term agricultural gain, if any, means that the level of water in many rivers is low and is susceptible to very small amounts of polluting matter, from agriculture industry or sewage.</P>
    <P>I have often worried about the pre-planning in relation to afforestation. Planting conifer in large tracts of land in the west of Ireland will damage our salmon fisheries because of silting and a decrease in the pH level in the water.  In Scotland a direct correlation has been established between a decrease in salmon stocks and increased afforestation which has led to a low pH level in, and an increase in the acid content of the water. I believe salmon eggs cannot be hatched if the pH level in the water is below four.  As we all know not alone is this happening in the west, but in places like Avonmore in Wicklow which supplied a substantial amount of the water for the Dublin area, the pH levels in the water have been lowered.  The lowering of the pH level in water supplies can have an effect on human health also.  In many <Col N="831" /> places in Sweden people cannot drink the water because the planting of conifers, trees which are native to that country, have lowered the pH level and large amounts of lime have had to be added to the water there.  In Australia, one of the places people like to visit and live, many rivers have been destroyed through the misuse of the water.  We must not do the same to our rivers because if we do, we will destroy the wonderful opinion Europeans and Americans have of Ireland as a beautiful, clean and non-polluted State. Basically, Ireland is an unpolluted country and I have no doubt that everybody in this Chamber would support the sections in this Bill which will help ensure that it remains unpolluted.</P>
    <P>We have only had this land for a very short time and we owe it to future generations to make sure that we leave it the way we found it.  Pollution is a bit like war: when people are going to war there is never any problem finding money to buy guns and bombs, it is very easy to pollute a river but it takes a long time to get rid of the pollution.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill we should also address the negative effects of development plans which may well appear to be OK on paper but in the long term will damage the quality of our water and the the environment in general.  The new EC directive on environmental impact assessments and this Bill will go a long way towards tackling the problem of pollution of our rivers and lakes by environmentally negative schemes.</P>
    <P>I would not like people to think I would knock the farming community.  One of the problems they are faced with is that there were no pre-planning arrangements before the vast expansion, particularly in milk production, occurred.  I believe that in addition to farmers there are many other people out there who are damaging our waterways.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, on her appointment.  I know she will do a very good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very serious reservations about this Bill.  It is clear that several sections have given rise to major anxiety among the farming community. It is vital for the Minister to clearly outline the main proposals in the Bill which will seriously impede the farming community and could annihilate a huge number of farmers along the western seaboard from Mizen Head to Malin Head.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the farming community are being made scapegoats for the pollution throughout the country.  Certain sections are very harsh and put a great onus on farmers to prevent any type of pollution for which heavy penalties and terms of imprisonment are proposed.  It seems farmers will have to prove that pollution was unforeseen.  I am dubious about the very wide definition of pollution and the wide powers being given to local authorities under the Bill.  We can imagine the uproar which would be instigated nationally if fines for breaches of the licensing laws were paid directly to the Garda without any reference to the district justice or others in our legal system.</P>
      <P>Water is defined as including a natural or artificial river, a stream, lake, canal, reservoir, aquifier pond, watercourse or inland waters.  The channel or bed of a river which may be completely dry during the summer season can be constituted as a source of water.  If the definition is as the Minister said, then one must conclude that a pond that forms after heavy rain or surface water on any part of a farm which is polluted will leave the owner liable to prosecution.  That, to my mind, will have farreaching consequences for the agricultural community.  I am very dubious about the rules and regulations that will follow the passage of this Bill. If our farmers are to survive we must eliminate a large part of the definition in the Bill.</P>

    <P>I need not remind the Minister that all farms have ditches and dykes that carry water from fields to streams and rivers. Will the Minister &mdash; I presume it would be he who will have the powers to prosecute and not the Minister of State &mdash; exercise his powers under the Bill?  In what way <Col N="833" /> will they affect the agricultural community? I am sure that as far as agricultural interests are concerned, the position in the Minister's constituency of Mayo is similar to that which exists in my constituency of south-west Cork.  Do I take it that work done over many years under the land drainage scheme, partly financed by grants from the Government and subject to the advice of ACOT and the Department advisers, that to remove surplus water to streams and rivers will be considered as a source of pollution to the environment?</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister about the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  Through natural drainage some nitrates and other elements which fall into dykes will flow through the land to streams.  It is not possible for farmers to undo the drainage work they have already carried out. Surely it is not suggested that farmers should block all drains?  If that is the case, land will be waterlogged and I do not think that is the intention of the Bill. There has to be natural drainage from the land and to suggest otherwise is a non-starter for any Minister.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister intend to make the provisions work because while compulsion and prosecution are the easy way for any Department, the implementation of the provisions is a vital cog in the wheel of success.  If we do not get the goodwill of all sectors of the community we will be a long way from solving our pollution problems.  Under the Bill farmers can be prosecuted for polluting the drains or dykes on his own land although his land may be miles from the nearest river.  I do not think that is the right way to tackle the pollution problem.  Will the Minister explain how a farmer who resides four or five miles from a river or a stream can pollute that water?</P>
    <P>In addition to making polluters liable to prosecution the Bill proposes that civil actions may be taken to recover damage against the occupier of the land from which the pollution originated.  Damages may be sought from a third party over whom the occupier did not have any control. In my view that puts the onus on the <Col N="834" /> occupier to prove his innocence.  I do not think this is fair.  The Bill is penal on the farming community.  Insurance companies will be forced to alter their public liability clauses.  In fact, some may try to exclude damage caused by pollution from silage and slurry pits.  It is difficult to fault them if they decide to do that because there are prospects of heavy claims against the farming community for such breaches.  Is the Minister suggesting that it will be necessary in the future for farmers to apply for a licence to farm their land?  Have we reached the stage that we will inhibit farmers from continuing the agricultural activities that his father, and generations before him, carried on on the land?  Those people were the backbone of the economy and it appears that we are going to force them out of existence.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that that is not the intention.  If I do not get that assurance I do not see how I can support the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a direct infringement of the rights of farmers to have such a noose dangling over their heads.  I am disappointed with the contents of the Bill.  If we pass the Bill in its present form I can see farmers being compelled to apply to county councils or local authorities for a licence to farm their land.  Such a procedure failed in the Communist States in Eastern Europe in the last four decades.  It will definitely fail here and any Minister or Government who tries to implement such a harsh directive or law on our farming community is bound to fail.  In no circumstances would such a policy be tolerated by any agricultural community in any democratic country.</P>
    <P>The Minister must explain to the House what the consequences of this legislation will be for the farming community. Under the legislation local authorities will be exempt from prosecution. The restriction on farmers is a most primitive one and should be challenged by every Deputy who represents a rural constituency.  All those Deputies should have serious reservations about this Bill, which is a smokescreen for future hardship and taxation on our farming community. It is for that reason I have my <Col N="835" /> doubts about this Bill.  Deputies representing rural constituencies should try to elicit every ounce of information they can from the Minister and prevent the Minister taking any action which would seriously threaten the livelihood of farmers.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister of State or the Minister not directing their attention at the international powers in Europe who are dumping nuclear waste 150 miles to 200 miles off the south-west coast?  For the past two decades they have constantly been dumping nuclear waste within 200 miles of the beaches off the south-west coast.  This problem has been raised in several fora, including I presume the European Parliament, where the consequences of dumping nuclear waste in that zone have been highlighted.  Has there been any talk about the contamination of our fish stock in the fishing grounds off the south-west coast, and what steps is the Minister taking to prevent Great Britain, Holland, Belgium, West Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and other countries from depositing nuclear waste on the seabed?  The Atlantic Ocean has been turned into an international dump and those countries have been allowed to do so by successive Irish Governments.  We have yet to make an impact or to use our clout to prevent dumping this waste in that section of the ocean.  I deplore the lack of action on the part of the Minister and the Department in highlighting this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I call on the farming organisations to fight this Bill and to make sure that this section of our community, who make a vital contribution to the economy, are protected.  I am not for one moment saying that I condone the pollution of any river or the destruction of fish life in any river as a result of pollution which can be traced back to a farmyard, because I believe that is not the case but if it does happen, it is corrected very quickly by the farmers concerned who take every precaution to prevent pollution.  I am not at all happy about the way in which grants are paid to farmers who are trying to undo the damage done by following the <Col N="836" /> information given by Teagasc representatives.</P>
    <P>What message has the Minister of State got for us tonight?  Is she going to make sure that farmers applications for grants to enable them combat pollution will be expedited and processed as quickly as possible?  These farmers are faced with falling milk prices and a collapse in cattle prices.  I attended the mart in Bandon the other day and one could not give away springers; one could merely raffle them.</P>

      <P>Farmers seem to have been singled out for special mention.  I deplore the attempt to blame one section of our community for the wrongs of successive Administrations who have failed to tackle this problem.  It is ironic that a local authority is allowed to pollute a river or bay with untreated sewage without fear of prosecution while farmers are penalised even though they do not contribute to the pollution problem.  We should ask ourselves if the farmers of Germany, France, Holland or Belgium polluted the river Rhine.  We can be sure they did not.  That river was polluted by numerous other sources, not by the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that Cork County Council will receive ample funding to construct a <Col N="837" /> treatment plant in Bantry where raw sewage is being pumped into the bay and where a mariculture industry is trying to get started?  What money will the Minister allocate to alleviate the problem in south-west Cork?  Cork County Council have made numerous representations to Ministers down the years, and to the present Minister, for the necessary finance to provide a proper treatment plant in Bantry but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  Yet, the Minister comes along here today in a blaze of glory to introduce a Bill that provides not one solution to the many problems that exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed drew attention to the condition of the Dublin beaches where people cannot even go for a swim because the waters are so polluted.  What is the Minister doing to rectify that?  We have the same situation in Cork where the River Lee is completely polluted, but not by the farmers.  The pollution is from other sources.  In Skibberreen a treatment plant is badly needed, but the Department or the Minister have not provided adequate funds to provide one.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his advisers wish to tackle this problem they must go to the root of it, which is that the local authorities are the chief culprits when it comes to pollution.  They have failed hopelessly to tackle the problems and they have not set a headline which can be followed by anyone.  It is a scandal to see local authorities indiscriminately destroying our waters by dumping raw sewage into our bays and rivers.</P>

      <P>The Department should put their own house in order.  Major pollution is being created in our cities and towns by the lack of proper sewage treatment plants and there are major emissions of contaminated fumes into the Environment.</P>
      <P>The only thing we have left is fresh air and cold water.  These are God given gifts and there is an onus on us not to allow them to be destroyed.  We owe that to the future generations.  The Minister owes it to the House to spell out in no uncertain fashion what plans, if any, she has to combat the pollution problems I have outlined.  She should not direct all her energies and tactics towards nailing our farmers to the mast as far as pollution is concerned but she should remember that there are greater polluters than the farming community.  The Minister should do everything possible to meet the points I have raised this evening and take the right steps to get to the root of the problem. The Minister should provide extra money for sewage treatment plants.  If she does, it will be the first step towards combating pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the international situation I need not tell the Minister of the dangers to the Irish Sea from Sellafield discharges and so on.  Do the Department monitor the fish being caught within certain reaches of the Sellafield area?  Do the Department monitor the nuclear dump <Col N="839" /> which is 200 miles off the south-west Cork coast?  The Minister should approach these things immediately.  I call on the Minister to rise to the occasion and to make the money available to combat pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you sincerely, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to bring to the attention of the Dáil what, in my opinion and in that of many learned people in the medical profession, is one of the most serious issues that has arisen in the short life of this Dáil, namely, the practical elimination of all elective and routine admissions to the Mater Hospital on the north side of Dublin as a result of improper provisions and improper planning to provide for the downstream effects of a huge influx of patients to the Mater Hospital as a result of the fire brigade action of the Minister for Health in opening all the casualty departments on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me briefly outline to the House exactly what has happened.  Approximately <Col N="840" /> two weeks ago the Mater Hospital had an in-patient population of 510 The Department of Health provides subventions for only 457.  The board of the Mater Hospital met and decided, in their wisdom, that they would endeavour to reduce the in-patient population.  The following Friday when all the five day wards had been emptied the administrators in the Mater Hospital moved the extra patients into the five day wards.  On the following Monday all five day wards were shut and as a consequence of that the consultants' organisation decided to highlight on the radio what had happened. The Minister came on the radio that day and informed the country at large that his Department had provided a budget of £750,000 when the reality is that the figure was £250,000 which the Department of Health paid over the hospital administration for the extra services. I am prepared, a Cheann Comhairle, in the privacy of your own chambers, to give you the source of my information because I feel it is very important that statements of a misleading nature emanating from the Department of Health should be investigated.  It seems that serious liberties are being taken with the dictionary description of the truth in this House and it is only proper that there should be an investigation into this.</P>
    <P>We have another problem at the Mater Hospital.  Some orthopaedic consultants came to me recently and told me that because of the huge influx of patients at the Mater Hospital a particular consultant's operations for one day consisted of one toenail removal and one bunion operation, despite the fact that he has 200 patients on his elective waiting list of routine admissions for hip operations. This is surely a vast wastage of resources and expertise of medical people who have the highest qualifications.</P>
    <P>Another orthopaedic surgeon was appointed to the Mater Hospital last March to replace Mr. McCauley.  He has yet to have an out-patient orthopaedic clinic.  He has a fracture clinic but he has yet to secure an out-patient orthopaedic clinic solely because the administrators <Col N="841" /> in the Mater Hospital refuse to appoint any clerical staff to run his clinic.  Surely this must be an outrageous waste of resources and one that the Minister should look at immediately.</P>
    <P>I have no particular pleasure in attempting, day after day, to highlight these gross in justices of the health service. I take no pleasure in castigating a fellow general practitioner.  I take no particular pleasure in calling into question the veracity of the Minister's statements. The Minister and I were both educated in the same medical school and trained in the same hospital which is now the subject of this debate.  We both practise in the same speciality.  If the health of this community and the health of the people of the northside of Dublin, and the health of the people in the immediate environs of the Mater Hospital is under attack then I will take any and all means at my disposal to highlight the grave injustice the Minister and Fianna Fáil have inflicted on the Irish population.  I will take any and all means to highlight the reality that now exists, that is, that we have had the development of a two-tier hospital service, a two-tier health service, one for the rich and wealthy where they can avail of all services and one for a certain section of the community which has become marginalised and reduced to the status of second-class citizens, a system where the folding stuff, which now seems to be the word for money, opens all doors.  The Minister and his Government have brought to fruition, for the first time in the history of this State, a two-tier health service and I would say shame on them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to state, in conclusion, that very eminent, highly trained surgeons and physicians have a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning in which they highlight in no uncertain terms exactly what is going on.  They had a straw poll last week in the Mater Hospital, because of the misinformation and disinformation that is coming from the Minister's Department, to find out what percentage of patients were admitted from the waiting list, and that figure was 5 per cent.  In other words, 95 per cent of the people <Col N="842" /> who were in the Mater Hospital last week were admitted through accident and emergency casualty departments.  I do not know what to say to the Minister.  I listen to him on the radio and I listen to him on television and I know what he is going to say.  He is going to speak in vague generalities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will indeed.  He has before.  He will tell the nation we have a great health service and ever more money to put into it.  The Minister said on radio two weeks ago that the majority of patients in the hospital were from the routine admission list.  They were, because the Minister's Department only put the embargo on two or three days before that.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The Department failed to make provision for the downstream effects of opening all the casualty departments on the northside.  Did the Minister employ extra nurses?  Did he employ extra physiotherapy staff?  Did he open extra beds?  He did &mdash; for two to three weeks. Incidentally, when the five-day patients had gone home on Friday week last, the Minister put the extra patients into these beds so that there were then no facilities available for five-day patients.</P>
      <P>Surgeons and physicians have stated that perhaps in the new year they will have to consider the cancellation of all outpatient services in some of these hospitals. This is a horrific development on the north side of the city and the Minister, more so than anyone else, is answerable to this House as to why one set of statistics say that the Department only gave us £250,000 and the Minister says it was £750,000.  There is a difference of £500,000.  In all honesty, the Minister should answer that and explain to the House exactly what is happening.  The personnel involved are very highly qualified people.  They are trying to look after the health of the poorer sections, the marginalised sections of the community, and I would ask the Minister to look at it in that light.</P>

      <P>I am disturbed at the manner in which this subject has been treated by the Deputy and others, including Mr. Finbar Fitzpatrick.  All elective admissions to the Mater Hospital have not been cancelled.  Therefore, Deputy Lee's statement is quite incorrect.  Statements by the Irish Hospitals' Consultants Association on this subject are also incorrect, and I have said so publicly.  Wild statements about the hospital services show no regard for the facts.  They cause unnecessary worry for patients and their families as well as damaging the wellbeing of the service.  I assure the House that patients who are in need of urgent treatment will be admitted and treated, and I reject allegations that people may die as a result of the current situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give the House an indication of the type of resource going into the hospitals on the north side of the city. For the Mater Hospital the amount is £27.5 million, Beaumont Hospital £35 million, Blanchardstown £11 million; 3,700 staff are working in these hospitals and I assure the House that each and every one of them is fully committed to the provision of an excellent hospital service for the area.  One would think to hear the allegations here tonight that I, as Minister, had provided hardly any resource at all for the hospital services in north Dublin.  These are major flagship hospitals which provide an excellent service and I am concerned that the wild allegations should not damage the public's confidence in these institutions.  The Mater Hospital, for example, is an excellent institution, where the quality of care is second to none by world standards. <Col N="844" /> For the secretary of the Irish hospital consultants' association to refer to the services on the north side of the city as a shambles is a disgrace and is a reflection on the staff working in them, having regard to the money provided and the number of staff working there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people seem to regard knocking the health service as a legitimate and profitable exercise.  The factual position is that the Mater is not cancelling all elective admissions.  There will be no reduction in cardiac surgery in the Mater for the remainder of the year. There are 56 in-patients in the Mater today who were admitted as urgent cases via the out-patient department, and this was not affected by the situation in accident and emergency.  Consultants will continue to make decisions on admissions of urgent cases.  Administrators do not make decisions about who is admitted. They convey the board's decisions on an overall amount of service that can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be some reduction in elective admissions during December.  Three of the consultants at the Mater Hospital have taken issue with me on the source of referrals of patients at the hospital. They have dealt with only 244 patients in the hospital when there were almost 500 patients in the hospital on the day in question.  They have taken their figures from the 244.  They have been very selective and have produced figures in respect of only one part of the hospital service. They have not included cardiac surgery, ophthalmology or oncology and they do not reflect the true position.  Today there are 488 patients in the hospital; 285 of them came through accident and emergency and the remainder came from waiting lists through the out-patient transfer from other hospitals, from consultants' rooms and in different ways.  Therefore, of the 500 patients in the Mater Hospital <Col N="845" /> today 285 were from accident and emergency, around 100 planned and 95 were urgent admissions in other ways. Recently I made an additional allocation of £475,000 to improve the services at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>I accept there is an increase in the number of admissions to the north Dublin hospitals as a result of the introduction of the 24 hour A and E service and this has been felt most acutely at the Mater Hospital.  In fact, there has been an increase at the six major Dublin hospitals. This increase shows that Government answered the need in introducing the new arrangement, and large numbers of people are getting a much better hospital service than heretofore.  I hope the Deputy is not suggesting we should refuse to treat the extra patients who require admissions so that less urgent cases are dealt with.  I am sure he does not want us to do that.  The board of the Mater Hospital acted in a very responsible fashion and the decision has had the effect of them living within their cash limits while ensuring that priority is given to those most in need for a limited period.</P>
    <P>A detailed survey of the usage of this service has been carried out and decisions on any further improvement thought necessary will be made when the results of the survey are available.  In the meantime the operation of the service is being regularly reviewed by the standing committee on accident and emergency services under the chairmanship of the Eastern Health Board.  This standing committee include a consultant from each of the hospitals concerned.  I have not been taken unaware by the increase in attendances and my Department and the EHB have had numerous consultations on the matter.  My Department have been involved in the establishment of the survey.</P>
    <P>I had a letter on 30 November 1989 from Finbar Fitzpatrick, General Secretary of the hospital consultants' association inviting me to meet with representatives of the hospitals in Dublin to discuss the issue of accident and emergency cases.  I responded that I would be glad to meet them and I intend <Col N="846" /> to meet them next Friday, but that is not what appears when the association go to press to talk about it.</P>
    <P>Full services will be restarted in the Mater from the beginning of January and I am confident that the institution concerned will continue to provide an excellent hospital service during the coming year.

      <P>I am not sure in which manner I should approach this debate.  I was inclined to think that I should adopt an adversarial approach to condemn the Minister out of hand and make allegations of sharp practice by the Minister. However, I decided it might just about be possible if I made a reasoned argument that the Minister would feel disposed to take on board my suggestions and make the necessary changes in the method of the allocations of national lottery funding under the amenity grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that before I was elected to this House an almighty outcry raged about how national lottery money was being dispersed.  Some people <Col N="847" /> argued that the Minister was making allocations to unworthy projects, golf clubs and the like, others implied that grants were being allocated and credit for successful applications was being claimed by local dignitaries.  The Minister's Coalition colleagues were to the fore in this outcry.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought the opinion of an all-party Dáil committee who reported and recommended an alternative approach in order to remove the feeling of ministerial and political opportunism and patronage.  We in Dublin City Council yesterday debated the circular from Séamus O'Connor on behalf of the Minister outlining the Minister's instructions on how to assist him in the dispersal of £5.5 million under the combined amenities and recreational facilities grants scheme 1990.  The following facts emerged.</P>
    <P>The 177 grant applications in the possession of Dublin Corporation came to a total of £8 million in value.  Dublin Corporation have not as yet received from the Minister's Department or the Department of Education their combined list of some hundreds of applications, I am told reliably, which we are supposed to process and make recommendations on to the Minister on or before 15 January next.  It is possible that these missing applications represent as much as another £8 million, making a possible total of £18 million to £20 million in respect of applications for which only £5.5 million is available to be dispersed nationally.  By the way, these were the numbers we were talking about before we in Dublin Corporation publicly advertised the scheme.  At the moment every local authority, each county council and each county borough corporation are running around in a paper chase absorbing huge numbers of man hours and raising local grant application hopes, all without the benefit of knowing whether their area will qualify for even one penny of the £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to make block grants available to the local authorities who will administer the scheme at local level.  In that way nobody can say the <Col N="848" /> Minister is administering the scheme to his own or his party's political advantage. It would represent a real boost for local democracy.  While he retains the authority of making the allocations himself he will always be suspected of having a vested interest and he will be seen to have local authorities running around doing all the paperwork for him but with no power to make allocations.  I am asking the Minister to make one third of all future allocations to Dublin by way of a block grant. Given the size and population of the Dublin region, this would be a fair allocation of lottery funding.  We in Dublin Corporation have the staff available through our area community officers, field staff and workers in our community development departments, who are used to and trained to impartially grant aid suitable projects.  Because of the financial under-funding of Dublin Corporation the major and minor grants schemes amounting to approximately £300,000 annually, have been abolished.  I hope the Minister will agree that in the case of Dublin Corporation we, the local authority, should administer and allocate out of a block grant the funds from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am arguing for two changes in the new scheme; first, that the Minister should make block grants to local authorities for them to administer and allocate and, second, that the Minister should extend by at least one month the date on which local authorities must make recommendations to him &mdash; that is 15 January &mdash; given that the local authorities are heading into the Christmas period, that they have come out of very heavy estimates debates and that they are short of staff.  They request that the Minister extend the date so that the scheme can be handled effectively by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in late October 1989 that the amenity grants scheme administered by my Department and the recreational facilities grants scheme administered by the Department of Education are to be amalgamated into a single scheme and that grants under <Col N="849" /> this scheme are to be allocated by the Minister for the Environment to projects recommended by local authorities who would be responsible for processing applications.  It was also decided that £5.5 million is to be allocated to the new scheme in 1990.  What has happened since the Government decision which was announced by the Minister for Finance in his reply to a number of parliamentary questions on 24 October 1989 is that all applications already made to my Department under the amenity grants scheme or to the Department of Education under the recreational facilities grants scheme, are being transmitted to the relevant local authorities for consideration under the new scheme.  This necessarily takes time but we hope to have the process completed by the coming weekend.</P>
      <P>The conditions attaching to the new scheme have also been issued to city and county managers.  Specimen fact sheets which are designed to give financial and other information about projects which are the subject of applications for grants have already been sent to local authorities. Therefore, by this weekend each local authority will have the necessary documentation to enable them to process both existing and new applications for grants under the new scheme.  It is a matter for each local authority to consider the arrangements.  It may be appropriate at local level to advise the public of the new schemes.  However, such has been the interest in the amenity grants schemes in recent years that a specific public advertisement may not be required; but under the new arrangements notified on 20 November 1989 to county and city managers, each county council, county borough corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation will categorise applications and prepare a list of all those which they are prepared to recommend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's circular asked that the list be considered and approved by the elected members and submitted with relevant fact sheets to the Department by 15 January 1990.  I do not consider this deadline unreasonable.  In deciding on it I was conscious of the desirability of <Col N="850" /> ensuring early allocations of grants to enable the projects chosen to be properly planned and processed during the good weather.  There is no other significance in the date chosen.  As far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, I have had no representations from the corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances I am surprised at the Deputy's insistence in pursuing the matter today.  The Government have tried to modify the amenity grants scheme to meet the complaints, real or imagined, about the 1988 scheme and the Deputy now appears to be trying to score cheap political points arising from these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Worse, if the Deputy's point was conceded, the effect would be to frustrate local communities in their efforts to get worthwhile projects under way.  The Deputy, of course, wants to tie up the whole scheme in a bureaucratic maze and I wonder what ulterior motive he has in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution he has made here this afternoon has nothing whatever to do with the motion down in his name.  It is all about cheap political shots being taken by him.  When he is further considering <Col N="851" /> the matter he might remember that when a previous Minister for the Environment was dividing out amenity grant schemes under the Department's head, he left out 11 counties with no allocation at all.  I regard that kind of allocation of funds as entirely and totally disproportionate but if the Deputy was to concern himself a little more closely with the kind of funding I provided from last year's allocation, he would see that Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council got a great allocation, way beyond what would be regarded as a fair entitlement considering the total available at my disposal. However, that is the way it is with some Deputies.</P>
    <P>In so far as the processing of applications under the new scheme may cause staffing difficulties, the Deputy is, I am sure, fully aware that the management of the various services and functions of the corporation is primarily a matter for the local authority itself.  The manager has complete discretion as to the most effective manner to deploy staff.  I am sure that the manager makes every effort to ensure that adequate staffing is assigned in particular to priority work areas and that the corporation are continuing to take steps to ensure that staff resources are deployed in the most effective manner possible.</P>
    <P>I have no involvement in the day to day administration of the corporation and, indeed, it would be totally inappropriate for me to assume any such role.  I have every confidence in the ability of Dublin Corporation, both management and staff, to ensure that the relatively straightforward work involved in processing amenity grants applications will <Col N="852" /> be carried out speedily and effectively. What the Minister wants to do is to get on with the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is that this Minister gave a very generous allocation, not only to his constituency but to the whole Dublin area, and the Deputy might be mindful of that when he is casting aspersions on how the money was divided last year, particularly taking into consideration the way it was divided by previous Ministers.  I want to spend the £5.5 million as quickly as possible and to give communities an opportunity to get on with the projects.  Of course, the applications will far outweigh the amount of money available to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 41-45 of the Finance Act, 1986, as amended, provide for tax reliefs aimed at promoting urban renewal and development in the Custom House Docks Area, certain other designated areas in Dublin and certain designated areas in provincial centres.  Under section 27 (1) of the Finance Act, 1987, the designation of individual areas for the purposes of the reliefs is a matter for the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The reliefs provided for under this legislation are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Section 42 provides for the extension of the industrial building allowance available under parts XV and XVI of the Income Tax Act, 1967 to buildings or structures (including <Col N="793" /> multi-storey car parks) which are not themselves industrial buildings or structures but which are either used for the purposes of a trade or profession (e.g. shops, offices) or which are let under a bona fide letting arrangement. The full amount of expenditure incurred is eligible for relief in the Custom House Docks Area and in the designated areas in the provincial centres, including Tallaght, but not in the other designated areas in Dublin where the relief is restricted to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>(b)  Section 43 applies the provisions of sections 23 and 24** of the Finance Act, 1981 to expenditure incurred wholly within the Custom House Docks Area in Dublin.  The qualifying period is the five year period from 25th January, 1988, as appointed by the Minister for Finance, and the expenditure incurred can be set off against all of a lessor's rental income from whatever source.</P>
    <P>(c)  Section 44 provides relief for an owner-occupier for a ten-year period amounting to 5 per cent per annum of qualifying expenditure in the qualifying period on the construction or refurbishment of a qualifying premises situated wholly within any of the designated areas.</P>
    <P>(d)  Section 45 provides relief for a ten-year period in the form of a double rent allowance against the profits of the trade or profession to persons carrying on a trade or profession in a designated area who lease either an industrial building or structure in a designated area or an industrial building or structure which qualifies for the industrial buildings allowance under section 42.</P>
    <P>The original 1986 legislation provided that the reliefs would only be available in the period 23 October 1985 &mdash; 31 May 1989.  Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1988, extended the qualifying period for the reliefs to 31 May, 1991, and section 51 of that Act preserved the 100 per cent accelerated capital allowances for the special incentives under the Finance Act, <Col N="794" /> 1986, for the designated areas.  However, in the case of the Custom House Docks Area in Dublin, the qualifying period for the reliefs generally is the five year period dating from 25 January 1988.  The relief available under section 44 of the Finance Act, 1986, expenditure on owner-occupied residential premises, as amended by section 25 of the Finance Act, 1988, terminates in the Custom House Docks Area, as for all such other areas, on 31 May 1991.</P>
    <P>The extension of the above tax incentives to other areas normally arises following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, who is the Minister responsible for designating these areas for the purposes of rates remission under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>A further relief in the urban renewal context which I introduced this year is section 4 of the Finance Act, 1989.  This section provides for the granting of income tax relief to encourage individuals to come and live in designated areas and renovate houses there that are determined by the Office of Public Works to be historically or architecturally significant. The relief consists of an income tax deduction in respect of 25 per cent of relevant expenditure incurred by an individual in a year of assessment with a further deduction of 5 per cent allowable in each of the following five years i.e. a total deduction of 50 per cent.  The expenditure must be in respect of the repair or restoration, or maintenance in the nature of repair or restoration, of a house which is used by the individual as his sole or main residence.</P>
    <P>**These tax reliefs, for provision of residential accommodation for renting, are now available countrywide, for relevant expenditure incurred in the period 27 January 1988 to 31 March 1991.</P>

      <P>The conditions of the free beef scheme are reviewed each year and, in planning the 1989 measure, my primary concern was to ensure the widest and most equitable distribution of the available beef.  I believe that the scheme this year has achieved this objective and <Col N="797" /> some 120,000 have benefited compared with fewer than 50,000 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The increased allocation of intervention beef which I succeeded in obtaining from the EC for the 1989 scheme made it possible to extend the scope of the measure.  The most needly welfare categories were identified in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and comprised: (1) hostels and day-centres providing meals for homeless people; (2) certain social welfare recipients i.e. recipients of long-term unemployment assistance and equivalent FÁS trainees recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance.  For 1990 I will of course be seeking to extend the scheme even further.  The increase in the numbers eligible for this year's free beef scheme indicates the Government's clear commitment to expand the scheme to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  This person has recently <Col N="805" /> been placed on a waiting list for an out-patient appointment.  I would suggest to the Deputy that if the child's parents feel that her condition is deteriorating they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>I am aware that problems have arisen in the provision of ear, nose and throat services in the South-Eastern Health Board area due to the difficulty in filling a vacant post of consultant ENT surgeon. The post has been advertised on several occasions but it has not been possible to make an appointment.  The local appointments commissioners re-advertised the post on 29 November 1989.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a <Col N="806" /> similar question on 5 December 1989.  As I indicated, it is a matter for each agency to decide in the light of local circumstances on the number of staff who may be at risk and to provide the vaccine free of charge to those staff.  This liability extends to employees of the health agencies.  As medical students are not hospital employees, they are not covered by this arrangement.</P>

      <P>National lottery funding was specifically for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation campaign and EC funding was received for activities connected with the European Year of Information on Cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit is an executive unit within the Department of Health.  The unit's work programme reflects a broad intersectoral orientation. In addition to health service based programmes such as immunisation, the unit is currently involved in developing policies on a range of issues including nutrition, smoking, alcohol, safety and exercise.  In this process the unit is working closely with health boards and is involving other Government Departments and a range of interested groups in the voluntary, commercial, professional and educational sectors.  Briefly, the functions of the unit are: (1) establishing targets for Health Promotion in Ireland; (2) taking the lead role in creating and implementing health promotion policies within the health services; (3) stimulating and fostering the involvement of other Government Departments, voluntary organisations, professional and commercial groups in health promotion; (4) continuing the development of health information and education programmes; (5) undertaking and commissioning research studies in the area of health promotion; (6) servicing the Advisory <Col N="808" /> Council on Health Promotion; and (7) maintaining liaison with Health Promotion agencies in other countries and relevant international organisations.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in January 1988 the health promotion unit has been directly engaged in a range of activities designed to promote health.  A major new anti-smoking campaign was launched earlier this year.  A campaign to eliminate measles, mumps and rubella is at present underway.</P>
    <P>The unit is also responsible for a major food hygiene campaign, called CLEANWATCH, which enlists the support of local health boards, retailers and the general public in promoting greater awareness of the importance of hygiene in food and catering outlets.</P>
    <P>The unit is addressing the drug problem through multi-disciplinary community based programme called &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo;.  It makes available training courses for facilitators in each health board who in turn bring interested people in the community together to familiarise themselves with the local problems and, where appropriate, to engage in follow-up action in their own locality.</P>
    <P>In collaboration with the National Youth Council the unit is developing a special programme on drink awareness and youth (DAY).  The package aims to educate young people about alcohol and to equip them with the skills necessary to deal with choices they will have to make about alcohol during their lives.  The DAY programme is currently being piloted around the country and it is hoped that it will be available nationally in spring of 1990.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Department of Education, comprehensive resource materials on AIDS have been developed for use in schools.  The materials are currently being pilot tested in a number of pre-selected schools around the country. In the meantime, the health promotion unit and the Department of Education are in consultation with relevant interested parties such as school management, teachers unions and parents groups.  The intention is that the materials <Col N="809" /> will be available for distribution nationally early next year.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and in liaison with the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society, the unit is developing resource materials for a community based programme on healthy lifestyles. The programme will be piloted in 1990 in the Mid-Western Health Board.  This project will address issues such as diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol and stress and will be directed at a number of different audiences from the community setting to the workplace.</P>
    <P>During 1989 &mdash; the European Year of Information on Cancer &mdash; Ireland played a very active part in the Europe against Cancer programme and the health promotion unit was involved in co-ordinating a range of activities which were carried out on a national basis.  As well as the unit's own activities, e.g. a cancer education in schools programme, the anti-smoking campaign and the drink awareness and youth programme, this included activities organised by other statutory organisations as well as voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Financial support is provided by the unit for the community-based Kilkenny Health Project &mdash; a pilot programme to modify risk factors for heart disease.  The unit is in contact with a number of voluntary organisations, providing financial and other assistance for health promotion activities such as producing health information materials and running health related seminars.</P>
