      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, could I ask you if there is any action you could take in order to prevent distorted pictures of events being given to this House?  Yesterday, for example, in the course of his statement, the Taoiseach said increasing employment and reducing unemployment and emigration are the central objective of Government policy. When he was speaking to this House the rest of the country was being given information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Chair.  It is something that can be resolved in this House in the ordinary way.  It does not arise now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask you if you, Sir, can prevent the Taoiseach giving a totally distorted version of actuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said not a word about the fact that the labour force <Col N="442" /> last year fell by 17,000 and that emigration rose to 46,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must find another way of raising this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in an hour's speech to this House said not one single word about any of that.  Is that not a distorted picture to present to this House?  Can you do anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to point out that the Leader of the Opposition did not feel it worth his while either to listen to my speech in the House yesterday or to reply to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that up to ten minutes before the beginning of those statements yesterday his Chief Whip had given my Chief Whip to understand that the debate would be opened by the Minister for Finance. The Taoiseach would want to get his act together a bit better than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to permit a rehash of yesterday's debate. The debate to which the Deputies refer is ongoing.  It is about to resume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement the Deputy made was totally untrue.  I did not speak to his Chief Whip about the statement yesterday and I made it quite clear two days ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it was much easier and more orderly when they were working together.  I did ask the Taoiseach yesterday if he would provide time next week, if possible, for a debate on a range of matters associated with Anglo-Irish affairs and, given the further startling disclosure this morning about <Col N="443" /> the collection of evidence in relation to the Birmingham Six case, has the Taoiseach considered the matter now and will time be provided for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still considering the situation and I will be glad to communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if he will confirm that the promised legislation in regard to the statutory authorisation of work already being done by regional technological colleges in co-operation with industry which was to be introduced in this session will not now in fact be introduced, if then, until after Christmas?  Will he comment on the implications of this delay for the valuable work that is being done by the colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's office will be communicated with today on that matter.  Draft heads of a Bill are being finalised and in fact some of the matters were covered in the legislation dealing with the establishment of the two new universities.  Further legislation is being drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the information has already been provided to me privately but as it is information of public interest that the Government should be tardy in its activities in this regard, I felt it was necessary to get it on the record here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, what news has the Minister for Agriculture got for the beef producers? I understand that he was in Brussels for the last few days.  Perhaps he would care, on the floor of the House, to tell beef farmers what is going to happen to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would raise that matter at another time.</P>

      <P>Is it intended to reconvene the Committee on Procedure and Privileges today to discuss any developments that have taken place in regard to the threatened industrial dispute within the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the gardaí investigating the allegations of irregularities in the Dublin city and county planning department have concluded that there is no substance to these allegations and have terminated their inquiries, could I ask you, Sir, if I would be in order to ask the Minister for the Environment to make a statement to the House as soon as possible in relation to the exact position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put down a question in relation to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the question of the Taoiseach passing questions which are clearly his responsibility to other Ministers to answer in this House.  Under Standing Orders 32 and 33 you, Sir, have responsibility for questions, their format and their amendment. It was not communicated to me at any <Col N="445" /> stage yesterday that my question was being amended to be answered by the Minister for Health.  One of the questions I asked was about the removal from office of the deputy chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board and the allegation by the Secretary of the Department of Health that that was done on the express instructions of the Taoiseach.  It seems quite clear, in the public interest, that the Taoiseach should answer in this House to that because the Minister for Health would have no knowledge of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing Deputy Barry some latitude again in this matter this morning.  I think I made my views on his allegations quite clear yesterday. They are on the record of this House.  I wish to add that I will be communicating with the Deputy by letter within an hour or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, in respect of this matter you had better communicate with me by letter because I had tabled the same question to the Taoiseach and it was diverted to the Minister for Health.  I want to raise that same issue on the Adjournment tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if he intends to make time available to this House now that a cloud hangs over the entire planning process in Dublin to debate the serious allegations that have been made and the conviction that all is not well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if it is the Government's intention to introduce legislation this term to reform the financing of local authorities and to abolish the local charges, as promised by Fianna Fáil prior to the last election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach when it is proposed to have the Child Care Bill debated?  I understand there was a commitment to have an all-party committee examine the Bill during the summer recess, but that did not happen. That would have expedited the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, Sir, why Deputy Quinn, whom I congratulate on getting an answer, got an answer when Deputy Allen put down exactly the same question and the Taoiseach muttered under his breath that no legislation was promised on this.  I heard him.  The Taoiseach muttered under his breath that no action was being taken but yet we have it winkled out of this Minister for the Environment, God help us, that he is going to do something. I put it to you, Sir, that it is a very real cause of grievance that one of my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches should have been asked to leave the House over a matter to which we have already got an answer.  I suggest you invite Deputy Allen back.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason, Sir, was that the Deputy could not get an answer because neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for the Environment would say anything but yet when the matter continued &mdash; and I congratulate Deputy Quinn on his persistence &mdash; we finally got an answer after a Deputy had been asked to leave the House.</P>

      <P>I think it is obvious to everybody in this House, except perhaps Deputy Dukes, that Deputy Quinn was asking a different question from Deputy Allen.  Deputy Quinn was within order in the questions he asked.  There is a lot of talk here about the reform of Dáil procedures but, with some temerity, I suggest to the Fine Gael Party, in particular, that the best reform of Dáil procedures would be that they would show some respect for the Chair and obey the Chair's rulings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing which needs to be said in relation to the European Community is that the current theoretical underpinnings of the single market being proposed by the 12 member states is that if countries combine to form a free trade area they can have a higher level of economic progress because all obstacles to free trade from tariff barriers right through to State purchasing policies will be removed, leading to so-called distortions in the market being eliminated. This it is claimed leads to a market where so-called perfect competition exists and so all firms are free to compete equally and the most efficient, those with the lowest prices and best quality, will win out.  In addition economic integration stresses economic gains which come from economies of scale because of cost reduction and the rapid rate of technical change.  That is the theory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States, Italy and Germany <Col N="455" /> only achieved political unions in the 19th Century and each of these had a developed north and under-developed south.  Economic unification led to the acceleration of the economic development of the already developed areas and indicates that the naive belief in benevolent workings of the so-called invisible hand is misplaced.  It is only with active interventionist economic and social policies that the disparities between the poorer regions and countries in Europe, specifically the south of Europe and Ireland, can be rectified.  It is in this context that the NESC report is important because the NESC effectively shreds the theory I have just mentioned and points out that, in fact, the open market on its own will create and increase divergences between the regions and will not close the divergences.</P>
    <P>The report on Ireland and the European Community produced by the NESC is an exceptionally important one, and indeed is a valuable document.  Unfortunately all recent Governments seem to have operated a rule of thumb which says that the better the report the less chance there is of it being implemented.  On that basis I would suspect that there is, unfortunately, very little prospect of the more important recommendations in this report being acted upon.</P>
    <P>This report is not just a thorough assessment of the country's prospects in the post-1922 period; it is also one of the most comprehensive reviews of our economic and industrial performance since we entered the European Community in 1973.  It is, in fact, a damning indictment of the inept policies of successive Governments since then, especially in regard to industrial policy, and makes many logical recommendations for policy initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>It should bring a dose of reality into the debate about 1992.  It shows clearly that while 1992 will bring certain opportunities for Ireland it will also bring many threats.  It shows that unless we take certain crucial decisions at national level the problems of 1992 will be far greater and <Col N="456" /> the benefits far less than the Government have led the public to understand so far.</P>
    <P>For the majority of Irish people the European Community has not delivered in the way we were given to understand during the debate on our application for membership.  The lavish promises of improved living standards and extra jobs have been largely undelivered primarily because neither Fianna Fáil nor Coalition Governments pursued the policies at national level which were essential to maximise the opportunities presented by European Community membership. When we joined the European Community in 1972 our income per head was 61.8 per cent of the Community average. today it is virtually the same at 62.3 per cent.  Unemployment was at 80,000 in 1972 with no emigration.  Now unemployment is almost three times that level with emigration running close to 50,000. If this disappointing performance is not to be repeated in open market conditions after 1992, then the crucial recommendations in this report must be taken on board and acted upon.  There are seven key conclusions and recommendations in the report which The Workers' Party consider to be crucial.</P>
    <P>These are, first, that true integration involves a lot more than simply removing trade barriers &mdash; negative integration &mdash; and must include the establishment of various common policies and agreements over many areas of economic and social life.  Negative integration of itself will not bring convergence of income but will in fact increase divergence between the regions and in relation to income.</P>
    <P>The second point is the failure of indigenous industrialisation which is one of the major structural weaknesses in the Irish economy, according to the NESC report.  Third, there must be a far more active interventionist industrial policy by the Government.  The scale of firms must be a far more important concern of industrial policy and there must be far greater emphasis on specialisation and innovation based on indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the completion of the internal market will not on its own narrow the <Col N="457" /> income disparities between regions in the EC and the Structural Funds as currently constituted will not be sufficient to create convergence, let alone establish equality in regional economic structures and income.  Fifth, the CAP has been used as an excuse for failure to develop separate and different national agricultural and food processing policies and there is a need for what the report describes as a &ldquo;national agricultural programme&rdquo;.  In this specific regard it is regrettable that the Taoiseach, both in his address to the Irish Council for the European Movement about ten days ago and in his speech yesterday, indicated that it is not the intention of this Government to introduce any national programmes to deal with agriculture.  He has stated quite clearly that he regards the development of our agriculture as a direct responsibility of the European Community.  The sixth point refers to the major weakness of our tax system as the narrowness of the tax base and the related high income tax rates.  The seventh point is that the Community must have an active social policy.</P>
    <P>Some of the report's most valuable conclusions and recommendations are in the area of industrial policy and many of them are similar to the findings of the largely ignored Telesis report which was published almost ten years ago.  The NESC report is just the latest in a series of similar documents which have pointed to the total failure of native Irish industry to compete successfully in international markets.  Generally speaking, the successes in terms of international trade performance have been the foreign firms based in Ireland and the failures have been the Irish firms.  There has been what the report describes as &ldquo;almost continuous output and employment decline in along list of exposed industries and their replacement by foreign firms in a narrow range of manufacturing activities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report shows that multinationals have not and are not going to establish in this country labour intensive, high added value type manufacturing projects.  It also points out that the hoped for linkages <Col N="458" /> between multinationals and indigenous Irish firms have not generally materialised. The report points to the necessity of developing large scale indigenous firms and emphasises the potential of economies of scale which only large firms can provide.  It effectively demolishes the &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo; philosophy so beloved of many Fianna Fáil Ministers and disposes of the myth that the unemployment problem can be solved if enough people start making chocolates or biscuits in their garages or mending bicycles in their back garden.</P>
    <P>The authors are quite rightly critical of the inappropriate industrial and development policies pursued by successive Governments since we entered the EC. They were too short term orientated and ignored some fundamental problems. Their task, among other things, the report says on page 216, &ldquo;should have been to foster activities in which Ireland could develop a genuine, sustainable and indeed renewable competitive advantage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report argues effectively for an extremely active interventionist industrial policy in each of three areas: in relation to the size disadvantage of Irish firms, to improve the innovational orientation of indigenous firms and to monitor and, where appropriate, prevent the take-over of indigenous firms by foreign firms.  The degree of intervention by the State envisaged in the report is much greater than that operated by either Fianna Fáil or Coalition Governments. Indeed, it is a weakness of the report that it fails to emphasise that despite the NESC's call in a number of previous reports for a more active industrial development policy, Governments and the IDA have been, to say the least, very slow to pursue such policies.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the Commission have indicated that they are quite happy to see member states whose average income is 75 per cent or less than the average European income introduce specific measures to assist industrialisation and the development of the economy.  This Government and previous Governments have shown a marked <Col N="459" /> reluctance to take these kinds of initiatives.</P>
    <P>There are two broad areas in which state intervention is called for in this report.  The first is by the Irish Government in developmental policies of manufacturing, services and agriculture.  The second is by the Community at budgetary level.  As such the report is an indictment of Government policies over the entire period since 1973.</P>
    <P>First it says in relation to industrial policy that the failure of indigenous industry in a free trade environment, heavy job losses in grant aided projects, a life cycle in foreign firms involvement and profit repatriation made themselves felt increasingly over time, but in a way which was not essentially different in the boom years of the seventies or the slack years of the eighties.  What this boils down to is that even while we have apparently been doing well, indigenous industry was not, and industrial growth was based almost entirely on foreign direct investment.  This dependence on foreign direct investment is not sustainable over the long term, and the dangers of reliance on foreign firms were revealed in the early eighties when even employment in foreign firms was insufficient to keep up with the decline.  There is a warning in this that is not adequately brought out, that now there has again been an upturn and additional new foreign projects are being established, industrial policy may again be considered successful.  It will, however, not be successful unless it develops indigenous firms capable of competing internationally.</P>
    <P>That is perhaps one of the most important points in this report.  It is easy to say we had a boom in the seventies and a decline in the eighties and that the decline was due to external factors, which by and large it was, but that kind of simplistic analysis does not address the underlying failure of indigenous industry to develop. The probability is that the boom and bloom which is being talked about now may well create an air of satisfaction that things are on the up and up, but unless the underlying structural problems in <Col N="460" /> relation to developing indigenous industry are dealt with, we will enter another period in recession in a few years' time, we will not have dealt with the underlying structural failures and therefore, will have no capacity to deal with the recession which is inevitable in the cyclical way that capitalism operates.</P>
    <P>The appropriate industrial development policies may actually contravene EC regulations.  This is not mentioned in the report.  The Commission have said they will not object to such policies for regions where the standards of living are less than 75 per cent of the EC average and Ireland is clearly in this category. Why then are Fianna Fáil so reluctant. The simple answer is that they are ideologically opposed to such intervention.</P>
    <P>In other words, we have a great deal of freedom to initiate national development policies, and although, for example, through the IDA, we have implemented some, we have not gone nearly far enough.  One area where policy initiatives are needed is the question of multinationals and their failure to develop linkages with indigenous firms and to use Irish inputs.  There is a need for a carrot and stick approach.  Government policy to date has been all carrot and no stick. Why not, for instance, let the level of grants payable to a multinational, or even the tax it pays on its earnings, be determined by the extent of the Irish inputs it uses.</P>

      <P>To the extent that it is possible to define them as neatly as the Deputy is suggesting.  I should like to refer to the degree to which multinationals are repatriating their profits. I understand that this year alone their repatriated profits will be in the region of £2.5 billion.  That represents a massive outflow of capital from the State.  It is estimated that that figure will rise in the next few years to something like £4 billion. I do not think the country can sustain such an outflow of capital.  The Government must see how they can deal with this matter.  I recognise the difficulties in dealing with multinationals and how footloose they can be.  That is why it is important that we have, in tandem with dealing with the outflow of their repatriated profits, a method of coping with their linkages to Irish firms. Clearly, if they are tied into the Irish economy to a greater extent the possibility of them pulling out overnight is reduced.  However, the country cannot afford the massive outflow of wealth which takes place annually and looks like growing to a greater extent.  The Government should address those fundamental points as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC state that at Community level redistributive policies are called for. <Col N="462" /> It is not clear that this is likely to occur, even with a great deal of pressure being applied on the Community by Ireland and other peripheral economies.  But if we are to emphasise the need for policy at Community level, and if it is clear that industrial policies are necessary for the development of industrial and other economic activity at the periphery, then why should we not also emphasise the need for a common Community industrial policy or strategy which would assist underdeveloped regions to attract investment and avoid cut-throat competition between them for job creation projects which can occur when development agencies, such as the IDA, are chasing multinational companies.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the report that the doubling of the EC Structural Funds will not narrow the gap in living standards between the richer and poorer regions is ominous, especially in view of the fact that the Government did not even get the amount they sought under their National Development Programme.  The whole process was handled very poorly by the Government, but the reality now is that there is unlikely to be any increase in the structural money allocated to us.  Against this background the question of how the money is now to be spent becomes even more crucial.</P>
    <P>We welcome the warning in the report on the dangers of over-concentration of infrastructural development.  The Workers' Party also emphasised this point in our submission to Government prior to the publication of the <i>National Development Plan.</i>  Infrastructural projects do, of course, develop the country's potential for investment and provide short term employment, but with unemployment running at more than 220,000 and emigration at almost 50,000 per annum, the number one priority must be industrial development which will create permanent, sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>We believe that at least 60 per cent of available Structural Funds should be invested directly to create jobs, and given the appalling record highlighted by the NESC of the private sector, semi-State <Col N="463" /> companies should be entitled to a significant proportion of this money.  Certainly the priority in Dublin is manufacturing jobs and not motorways, but the Government seem determined to give us more motorway madness and do little about the jobs.  It is something of a joke that on the one hand Dublin has been designated European Cultural Capital for 1991, while EC Structural Funds will be used to tear the heart out of Dublin with the completion of the inner tangent Ring Road associated with the Eastern by-pass.</P>
    <P>We welcome the support expressed in the report for a Community social policy, but unless the proposed EC Social Charter is binding on member states it will not afford adequate protection for workers in the open market conditions after 1992. The economic aspects of the internal market will be binding on member states and it is essential that the social aspects should be similarly binding.  The Irish Government should press for a commitment to this effect at the meeting of the Heads of Government in Strasbourg in December.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the Social Charter there is reference to social development and social cohesion having the same importance as economic and monetary union but the Charter does not proceed to give it the same binding effectiveness as the proposals in relation to economic and monetary union.  The Charter should set a high level of minimum rights, including a commitment to the right to work, which was not included in the official draft.  We cannot accept the creation of an internal market which will produce even greater profits for the multinationals but tolerate a huge level of unemployment, diminish the social rights of workers and create even wider income gaps within different regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the almost inevitable outcome of competition whether in national economies or in the wider European context is to put pressure on the conditions of work. <Col N="464" /> Indeed, the higher the levels of unemployment the greater the pressure is.  The net effect of the integration of the European market would be to put pressure on conditions.  Far from arguing for the harmonisation upwards of social conditions in the least developed regions, and of certain sectors of the developed regions, we may be faced with a battle to maintain the conditions which have been established in the more developed regions unless we have a binding social charter.</P>
    <P>It is clear from comments made on Friday last that the Federation of Irish Employers will join with employer organisations and right wing forces in other member states in an attempt to block the implementation of the charter.  For this reason it must be made binding.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he accepted the charter in principle, but spoke of the need to have regard to cost competitiveness.  This is an extraordinary statement and is indicative of this Government's half-hearted approach to the charter.  We were told on the one hand that the purpose of the integrated market, of doing away with tariff barriers and harmonising taxation and so on, was to create a level field for companies to compete.  How can you create a level field for companies to compete if you have in one part of the EC wage levels and conditions which encourage companies to move to that area at the expense of areas which have established a higher level of income or a higher standard of safety and health at work?  It is nonsense to talk about bearing in mind the competitiveness of the industry and at the same time talk about creating equal conditions for industry to compete.</P>
    <P>I read recently in <i>The Guardian</i> about a contract which has been granted to a company I think from Portugal &mdash; I am not sure of the exact details.  In any event, the effect is that a company from outside Britain tendered for a street cleaning contract in a town in Britain and got it because they had the lowest tender.  The reason they had the lowest tender was that wage rates and conditions which <Col N="465" /> would apply to the workers in this contract are way below the wage and conditions of work which would apply in Britain itself.  That is not fair competition and it is using workers and their conditions as a battering ram to improve profits for specific companies.</P>
    <P>The social charter must first be binding, but it is essential that where public procurement contracts are being made and applied there will be a clause in those contracts that the wage rates and conditions applicable to the employees who may be brought into a country from outside the country where the contract is to be implemented must be the same as the wage rates and conditions of the workers in that country.  We cannot have a situation where wages and conditions are used as an element in the battle between companies across Europe for dominance in the EC.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil want to appear to be more progressive than Mrs. Thatcher and the various employer bodies, the Government are taking the same reactionary line.  As far back as July 1988 the present Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan, made it quite clear that the Government were totally opposed, for instance, to giving workers the right to elect directors to the boards of private companies.  If we are serious about having a social dimension in Europe and about having a Europe for all the people of Europe, a Europe which will have the support of the citizens of Europe, we cannot give all the rights to capital and restrict the rights of people who work for capital.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have made it clear that we will co-operate with the EC trade union movement and other political parties and the citizens of all member states to ensure that 1992 is about social progress as well as economic integration.  We are well aware that the social charter is a small part of the solution to our social and economic ills but any failure to strengthen it and implement it fully will worsen the position of weaker social groups within the Community, especially in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of aspects <Col N="466" /> of the social charter which need to be dealt with and strengthened.  For instance, the charter should as a general principle set a high minimum level of social rights at Community level and this should be done without prejudice to the standards or the collective conventions which are more favourable to workers already acquired or to be acquired in each member state and it should include the right to work.  It should include also a commitment to a Community programme to combat unemployment, for instance, the implementation of a growth strategy.  In none of the sections of this charter is the word growth even referred to.  It just does not exist.</P>
    <P>The guaranteed implementation of the right to vocational training has to be included, as must ongoing training, retraining for both wage earners and the unemployed, and the right to have knowledge acquired earlier recognised in determining remuneration.  Standards must be set that would prevent or limit the trend to make employment more insecure.  I have just given an example of the kind of thing I am talking about.  We must also ensure through the social charter that flexible work and part-time work are not used as a means of undermining secure employment.  There must be guaranteed freedom of movement of workers from any member state and the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host country.  There must be a ban on wage and other types of discrimination. For instance, it should be borne in mind that Articles 5 and 6 of the charter make it quite possible that there will be discrimination on the basis of wages.  I quote Article 5:</P>
    <P>The working conditions as well as social protection shall be guaranteed to all Community workers engaged in non-temporary gainful employment in a Member State other than their country of origin in particular when awarding public works contracts on terms identical to those enjoyed by workers of the host country. </P>
    <P>In other words, contractors getting a contract and using temporary employees can <Col N="467" /> do anything they like with them.  They can give them any conditions they like. They can treat them any way they like. That is not a satisfactory section of the social charter.  Article 6 is something similar.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this social charter has to have a binding nature and should include a guarantee of equal treatment and nondiscrimination towards non-EC nationals.  There has to be progressive harmonisation in the social security system.  There has to be a maximum on the number of hours worked per week, ensuring there is real progress towards satisfying the claim of 35 hours per week while respecting the economic differences between the States.  There has to be recognition of a fair wage level according to the principle of equal work for equal pay and a guarantee of the actual payment of this wage.  I cannot remember the precise section of the charter which refers to the payment of wages being guaranteed, unless this is precluded by national legislation.  In effect, it ensures that if a State has legislation which precludes people from getting wages under certain conditions, the EC will stand back from that and will not attempt to impose the EC's will on it.</P>
    <P>There has to be an improvement in the standards aimed at guaranteeing the rights of workers in the case of individual or collective lay-offs, bankruptcies and restructuring.  There has to be the creation of material conditions for the equality of men and women.  I am talking here specifically of child care facilities, equipment and so forth.  There has to be a ban in the Community on child labour and labour by adolescents and the elimination of any national provision which is covered in paragraph 2.26 of the draft charter.  There has to be a guarantee of compulsory schooling.  Section 26 of the charter enables countries to avoid that where they do not already provide it. There has to be a guarantee of the right to health and safety in the workplace and the corresponding modification of relevant directives recently adopted by the council.  There is no recognition in <Col N="468" /> the charter at present of the right to join a trade union or to carry out union activities at the place of work or, indeed, the guaranteed protection of union representatives. There has to be the recognition and guarantee of the right to collective action including strikes without, as is done at present in the charter, legitimising the position where some states deny the right to strike to some of its workers.  There has to be the definition of a judicial Community framework ensuring information, consultation and full participation of workers and their representatives in the company for which they work.  There has to be the introduction of standards guaranteeing the respect of social rights in all Community directives, for example, on public works.</P>
    <P>At the initiative of the group of which I am a member in the European Parliament &mdash; the Left Unity Group &mdash; the Parliament recently requested the Commission to include in future a description of the social and regional impacts of all new directives.  There has to be the introduction of a clause prohibiting social dumping, to which I referred earlier; this European jargon refers to the pulling out of companies from Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Britain or wherever, in order to move to a more salubrious climate in terms of wages and conditions.</P>
    <P>The social charter should also include a binding commitment to fight racism in the Community and all forms of discrimination linked to racism.  To give the charter a binding effect I would argue that the social dimension must be included in the inter-Governmental conference on economic and monetary union.  The European Council in Strasbourg must commit itself to applying the charter in a binding way especially providing for judicial means of ensuring that it can be challenged if companies in member states flout the charter.  There is a whole range of things which should be included in the charter.  For the Taoiseach to stand up in this House and say: &ldquo;We support the charter in principle but it must have regard to cost competitiveness&rdquo; effectivley gives him a backdoor through which he can escape <Col N="469" /> from the kind of obligations which should be in the charter &mdash; and which need to be in the charter &mdash; if we are seriously talking about social cohesion as well as about economic cohesion and the integration of the market.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the NESC report is an excellent one.  Unfortunately, the likelihood is that it will probably be largely ignored in its main recommendations. It is important that we grasp the nettle, that we challenge many of the things which are being done at European level in relation to the integration of the market, not as a means of blocking the integration of the market because as the NESC report states it is important that the market is opened up and that we are involved in it, we must ensure that it happens in a way that does not result in the denuding of this country of its people, of destroying whatever manufacturing industrial infrastructure we have already developed.  It is important to bear in mind one of the most crucial findings of the report, that is, that we should not take a simplistic view of the period 1973-79 and say that worked successfully because jobs increased, that the years 1980-86 were bad because jobs did not increase and that therefore, we must assume that because the underlying trend according to the Government is that jobs will increase everything is fine and we have no need to tackle the basic structural problems which face Irish industry.  It is important that we do not take that simplistic view.  It is important that we take on board the recommendations of the NESC report and seriously set about creating the linkages between the multinationals and the Irish companies that exist here, or which may be established here, and that we ensure that Irish companies which have the capacity to grow and innovate are assisted even if, as Deputy Bruton said, it may be in breach of EC regulations.  I believe we have the freedom to do that and we must utilise whatever such freedom we have.  It is important also that we tackle in a serious way the question of the repatriation of multinational profits.  I am not talking about doing this in a way that would drive <Col N="470" /> the multinationals out of this country &mdash; I am talking about ensuring that they stay &mdash; but that the benefit of the £2.5 billion which could be used here is not lost to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The NESC report on Ireland in the European Community is a sobering but useful document.  The basic thrust of the report in so far as it deals with the future is that our destiny is in our own hands.  It calls into question the optimistic forecasts of overall employment growth contained in the Cecchini report.  It disputes Cecchini's conclusion that the smaller member states would benefit disproportionately from European integration. It also indicates that European integration on its own will not lead to a narrowing of the income disparities between the richer and poorer peripheral countries. Indeed, NESC conclude that the Structural Funds in themselves will not be sufficient to create convergence in regional income.  After all these approach less that 0.5 per cent of Community GDP.</P>
      <P>The analysis outlines what we in Ireland must do in order to improve our living standards and catch up with other member states.  The lessons apply not just at national level but also to the formidable challenges for industry and particularly for services.</P>
      <P>The NESC approach to the challenges facing us is a comprehensive one.  In particular its urging of a radical, forceful and ambitious policy of integration, merits study.  In the debate today, however, I would like to concentrate on the aspects of the report which are closest to my own areas of responsibility as Minister for Labour.  These areas relate to the social dimension of the Community including employment and unemployment, free movement of workers, harmonisation of labour standards, the Social Charter, Training and the European Social Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the economic situation and outlook first I would like to set the economic scene.  Even the most casual observer would not fail to notice the air of confidence and new found optimism. <Col N="471" /> This confidence is founded on the economic policies pursued over the last three years.  Order has been restored to public finances.  Indeed the Exchequer borrowing requirement for this year should be less than 4 per cent of GNP.  At the same time the economy has entered a period of rapid growth.  Some commentators are forecasting a growth rate of 5.75 per cent for this year, and expect it to continue into 1990 and beyond.  Export volume is always a good indicator of growth.  In the first five months of this year the volume of exports was up by an estimated 17 per cent year-on-year.</P>
    <P>Membership of the European Community has had a large impact on this growth.  Ireland's export dependency on the United Kingdom market has contracted from 61 per cent in 1972 to 35 per cent in 1988.  Conversely our market in the Community, excluding the UK, increased from over 17 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period.  Furthermore, we are now members of the European Monetary System.  The current sterling crisis and credit squeeze in the UK is, therefore, having a much lesser impact than it would have had 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>However, as pointed out in the NESC report, Ireland has not done as well as it might have from membership of the EC. All of the blame cannot be laid at Europe's door.  For example, domestic economic policy did not take sufficient account of the <i>de facto</i> interdependence of Ireland and other EC economies and too often short-term goals were given precedence over long-term national and Community priorities.  These lessons have now been learned.  While some of the decisions taken may have been unpopular, these decisions have clearly provided the foundation for the growth now being experienced.</P>
    <P>Against this background NESC identified two prime requirements for Ireland with regard to EC membership.  They are: (i) a clear national strategy for European integration which will provide a guide to external negotiations and domestic decision making; and (ii) continued consensus among the social partners, <Col N="472" /> both at the national level and at the level of the firm, to ensure a swift and flexible response that is conducive to the objectives of fuller employment, higher living standards and a better social framework. The Council believes that if these requirements are met, as I am confident they will, then Ireland will maximise the development opportunities afforded by the current phase of European integration.</P>
    <P>The social dimension of the single market is a major concern to me.  The idea of the social dimension to European Community policy is not a recent development.  As the NESC point out in their report, it represents a continuation of the social policy contained in the Treaty of Rome.  Central to that policy is the promotion of improved working conditions and living standards for workers and the harmonisation of these conditions and standards between the member states.  Under the Treaty, the Commission was given the task of developing close co-operation between the member states in the social field, with a particular focus on employment, safety and health, training, social security and workers' rights.</P>
    <P>The social dimension is difficult to define &mdash; a fact which is recognised by the NESC in the report.  It is also true that it is not a static concept; it is open to development.  We may, however, at this stage, identify six major elements. These are: employment and unemployment; free movement of workers; harmonisation of worker protection; the social dialogue between management and workers and the establishment of a charter of workers' rights and improved vocational training opportunities.</P>
    <P>The development of these elements will proceed on a continuous basis, parallel with the economic steps being taken towards the single market.  Because of the potential changes envisaged in the single market, economic, financial, commercial and fiscal measures need to be matched or paralleled by social policy measures.</P>
    <P>The growth in the economy mentioned earlier is beginning to have an effect on <Col N="473" /> the number of unemployed.  Unemployment has declined steadily on a year-on-year basis for the past two years and the September 1989 level is the lowest unemployment rate since November 1984.  Job losses as measured by redundancies are down 40 per cent on last year. Commentators have forecast further job increases in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Access to a job which is satisfactory and fulfilling to the individual, and which provides a standard of remuneration which will give that person a reasonable standard of living, is a basic social objective. That will remain the cornerstone of my efforts within the Social Affairs Council and particularly in my period of office as President of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers in the first six months of next year.</P>
    <P>I intend, during Ireland's Presidency, to continue to press hard for further initiatives aimed at combating unemployment, with particular stress on long-term unemployment.  I made this point strongly in my discussions last Friday with Commissioner Papandreou on the programme for the Irish Presidency. Measures to help the long-term unemployed will be central to the Irish Presidency programme on social affairs.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, enough that Labour and Social Affairs Ministers should strive to pursue measures designed to promote employment.  It is my view, and the view of the Government, that action to increase job opportunities should permeate all aspects of Community policy. An obvious area which can have a direct impact on employment is that of economic policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and all my colleagues in Government are determined to keep employment to the forefront of all Community discussions.  We will make no apology for using any opportunities offered by the forthcoming Irish Presidency to further that objective.</P>
    <P>The free movement of workers within the Community is already a fact of life. We must, therefore, see how best we can maximise the benefits.  It is Government policy that no one should feel they have been forced to emigrate.  The main thrust <Col N="474" /> of Government action is to create an environment conducive to economic development and in that way, increase the level of employment available here.</P>
    <P>However, many of our citizens will still emigrate for a variety of reasons.  I have directed FÁS to develop their services for persons wishing to seek employment elsewhere in the EC and in particular to develop bilateral arrangements with the employment services of the main receiving member states.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I have instructed FÁS to pursue a policy of discouraging unplanned or impulsive emigration. Their emphasis is to help the vulnerable and unskilled to improve their educational qualifications and raise their skills levels before seeking work abroad. FÁS are developing their advice and information service accordingly.</P>
    <P>The EC has spearheaded many developments in worker protection. Occupational safety and health is one area in which the impact of Community policy on developments in this country is very evident.  Irish law in this whole sphere was limited to protection of physical working conditions in industrial-type establishments.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, now gives substantially extended protection to the entire workforce.  This is a development parallel to, and clearly influenced by, initiatives at Community level.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on occupational safety and health is an important part of the Community's policy of ensuring social cohesion through development of the social dimension of the internal market. A fundamental element of this policy is to ensure that disparities in levels of worker protection among member states are removed in order to avoid the risk of exploitation by multinational or national companies.</P>
    <P>I have not lost sight of the fact, however, that special consideration must be given to small and medium-size undertakings to ensure that they are not overburdened with requirements that would place them at a disadvantage to their larger competitors.  This is an issue which I have been pressing at European level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> In this regard, Deputy De Rossa made useful points, with which I do not disagree, in regard to social dialogue. However, my argument in relation to small and medium-size companies is that if they were to adopt the full rigours of, say, German legislation in all its aspects over a short period it would probably create more unemployment.  I am not saying that these standards should not be accepted but it should be over a period and the first steps in the area of safety and health will be covered by the new Act and Authority which will be effective from 1 November.  If all the regulations and directives at present applying in Germany were adopted straightaway by our workforce it would create genuine fears &mdash; not just for the employers &mdash; but for the workers.  We must get the balance right and have the necessary protection for the workers but not put too many burdens on employers all at once which would create huge problems for them because so much of our industrial base is small and medium-size companies which could very quickly be wiped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing for an overnight levelling up of all social security, protection and so on but where a German company comes to Ireland to fulfil a contract they should pay the rates and observe the conditions which apply here and when an Irish company goes to Germany to fulfil a contract they should pay the rates and provide the conditions which are applicable in Germany so that the workforce in Germany, Ireland or any other country do not find themselves competing with conditions which are lower in other states as a result of the social charter or the integration of the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  Equally I would ask him to accept that one of the arguments advanced in the social charter is not that confined merely to the United Kingdom's principled objections to part of the charter. Rather is it the German objections that anybody in the Community should not be <Col N="476" /> obliged to adhere to their high standards. In that respect I say the best of luck to them; I do not argue against that contention. However, to expect our industrial base, our small and medium-sized companies to attain that level within a very short period would create enormous difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to refer briefly to another area of worker protection, that for part time workers.  I share the concern expressed by Deputies that the exclusion of part timers from the benefits of a wide range of protective measures must be remedied.  On the basis of consultations with the social partners, Deputies will be glad to know that I am now finalising proposals for legislation which will offer a much greater degree of protection to part timers.  I hope to have a Bill ready for introduction to the Oireachtas next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the social dialogue the importance of maintaining good relations between employers and unions has been recognised both in the Single European Act and the draft social charter where it is stated that European level dialogue will be developed.  I have always encouraged <Col N="477" /> participation and consultation at all levels.  I have no doubt that the development of a closer working relationship between employers and workers at European level, leading to a better understanding of each other's positions, will be of value and benefit at national level also. Indeed, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has already demonstrated the value of involvement at national level.</P>
    <P>We are going through a time of rapid change involving increased internationalisation of trade, a more competitive environment and new technologies.  In such a situation, firms can forget their greatest asset, namely their workforce.  The key factor in the achievement of success is the quality of the workforce.  Management should, therefore, recognise that above and beyond finances, production and so on, what counts is people.  They must put into practice appropriate systems to get the best from their employees.</P>
    <P>The EC gives recognition to the need to have an enlightened attitude towards employees and encourages the development of a sound working relationship through the provision of information in the establishment of consultative and participative arrangements.  While the exact form of these arrangements is to be decided, it is accepted that they should reflect the different practices and systems in existence in member states.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the draft Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights has now assumed considerable political momentum as a major Community issue.  The French Presidency is most anxious that the matter should be settled at the European Council in Strasbourg.  Opinions are divided, with one member state implacably opposed to the Commission's idea of a charter and, at the other extreme, others who demand concrete, far-reaching, legally binding minimum standards.  The Government have given their full support at the European Council at Madrid to the conclusion that the same importance should be given to social aspects as to economic aspects and that they should be developed in a balanced manner.  This <Col N="478" /> support is entirely in keeping with the co-operation which exists in this country between Government and social partners.</P>
    <P>We have been able to give that support because of the affirmation in the Presidency conclusions that job development and creation must be given top priority in the achievement of the internal market.  This remains the highest priority in our domestic policy.  The impact on employment will be high among the criteria which we will use in the further development of the social dimension.  The Government have also supported the development of the charter as part of the social dimension.  We can agree to a charter specifying commitments provided that they do not bear too heavily on small business.</P>
    <P>In this context, as the Taoiseach reported to this House following the European Council of Madrid, apart from the employment impact of the various measures, we assign particular importance to the principle of subsidiarity, providing clear and balanced responses to the question of what is appropriate for national legislation or collective bargaining and what is appropriate for Community action.  Many spheres of social and labour policy are better if left to the local or national level, unless there are convincing arguments for Community action.  Such studies as have been presented to the Council testify to the diversity of practices and institutions.  In these matters due weight must be given to national practice and traditions.  We are pleased at the emphasis which is being given to subsidiarity in the ongoing discussions of the draft charter in the Council's working group.</P>
    <P>We will be seeking sufficient flexibility in the text to ensure that convergence of trends and social policies in an upward and progressive direction will be at a reasonable pace which will not inhibit other aspects of cohesion.</P>
    <P>As is evident, the social dimension is continuing to evolve.  It will include, refine and develop policies for the <Col N="479" /> improvement of living and working conditions, training and retraining, employment equality and issues concerning worker participation and information.</P>
    <P>We must, however, be conscious of the need to maintain a balance here between what is desirable and what is realistic, between what we would like and what we can afford.  I am taking an active and constructive approach to this issue.  I propose to continue to work hard to achieve positive and beneficial progress during my period as President of the Social Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>I propose to turn now to the European Social Fund.  This Community instrument is specifically designed to support employment/labour market measures, particularly training opportunities.</P>
    <P>Article 123 of the Roman Treaty puts the objective and role of the European Social Fund in a clear context.  The Article says:</P>
    <P>In order to improve employment opportunities for workers in the common market and to contribute thereby to raising the standard of living, a European Social Fund is hereby established.  It shall have the task of rendering the employment of workers easier and of increasing their geographical and occupational mobility within the Community. </P>
    <P>We attach particular importance to the European Social Fund not only because of its benefit to this country but because of its targeting towards employment promotion and help to the individual to take advantage of employment opportunities. The primary role of the fund has been to support vocational training measures but it also assists other employment related measures.</P>
    <P>Ireland was fortunate in that the first real expansion of the European Social Fund coincided with our accession to the European Community in 1973.  Before that, the European Social Fund had a small budget which operated almost automatically to return to member states what they had contributed to it, the <Col N="480" /> system of &ldquo;fair return&rdquo;.  In the early seventies the European Social Fund became for the first time a dynamic instrument of Community labour market policy.  Over the years it has grown in size and in influence.  This country was able to take good advantage of this development. Indeed, it has been said in Brussels that the results of the European Social Fund can be seen more clearly in Ireland than in any other member state.  This is because we have made maximum use of opportunities which the fund presented.</P>
    <P>A feature of the European Social Fund is that over the years it has developed a very strong regional emphasis, with certain percentages of the fund reserved specifically for the less advanced Community regions.  Higher fund intervention rates are set for those regions.  A regional bias has influenced the guidelines under which the fund has operated.  Ireland has been to the forefront in promoting the regional priorities of the fund as an essential demonstration of Community solidarity. The recent review of all the funds incorporates, of course, very specific provisions in favour of the least developed Community regions.  Ireland argued strongly for this in the course of the fund negotiations.</P>
    <P>I myself was very much involved in the discussions with the Commission regarding the level of Structural Fund assistance that will be available to Ireland in the period up to 1993.  These discussions were difficult.  Unlike 1973 when we entered the Community, we are now in competition with Spain, Portugal, Greece as well as the less-developed areas of France, Italy and Northern Ireland for the finite Community assistance available. Despite the difficulties, the final outcome of the discussions are regarded as an exceptional success for Ireland by foreign commentators.  Criticism has been confined to some ill-informed domestic scources only.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for the Structural Funds provide a guarantee of increased resources from the funds for the less developed Community regions, including Ireland.  The Government have decided that the largest percentage <Col N="481" /> increase in Ireland's share of the Community funds should be allocated to the ERDF with the specific objective of stimulating job creation through infrastructural and other investment.  Nevertheless, training is recognised as a central element of national development.  We have received £1,035 million since we joined the Community in 1973.  Over the next few years we expect to receive a further £900 million.  Next year alone we should get some £220 million, a rise of £50 million on 1989.  Funds will also be available from the Regional Fund for expanding and improving our vocational training infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the specific question of human resource development in the future.  This is vital to the Community's future prosperity.  In addition, it plays a crucial role in facilitating structural adjustment.  A greater emphasis on vocational and in-service training will make it easier for the unemployed to enter working life and the employed to meet structural changes.</P>
    <P>The development of this country's human resources has been a central element in our national development programme since the mid-sixties.  Over the period the quality of the Irish workforce has improved.  The labour force has become more skilled and highly qualified and, in general, skills shortages have been avoided.  The quality of our workforce is highly regarded by employers abroad but we need to retain the maximum benefit from the heavy investment we have made in education.  To prevent skills shortages emerging, we need to keep our highly qualified and skilled labour.  Irish employers must not be slow to offer these graduates good opportunities here.  There is no reason Irish development should lag behind the countries of mainland Europe or be restricted by a lack of highly qualified manpower.  This is a particular challenge facing Irish managers.</P>
    <P>I would like here to mention specifically the area of management training. Following detailed analysis, the advisory committee on management training outlined <Col N="482" /> the factors that will affect the role and response of the manager in the future.  NESC also recognise the importance of management training.  They endorse the recommendation of the advisory committee that both business and Government increase their commitment to management training. However, I must stress again that the primary responsibility for management development, as other training, rests with individual employers in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of the danger of failure to develop.  Despite undoubted progress, there are still basic weaknesses in our workforce.  Not least of these is the failure of Irish companies to provide enough training and development for their employees.  Data available from the 1985 Labour Force Survey shows that only 6.5 per cent of all employees had received education or training in the four weeks prior to interview.  The corresponding figure for Britain is 10.4 per cent.  This is particularly worrying given the small scale of Irish industry and Cecchini's conclusions that most small companies lack the skills and qualifications needed by the single market.</P>
    <P>The State is playing its part in providing manpower opportunities for the priority groups.  Early unqualified school leavers now benefit from the Youthreach programme introduced jointly with my colleague the Minister for Education.  Older longterm unemployed benefit, through the Jobsearch programme, from advice and referral to an appropriate programme. A network of some 20 FÁS training centres has been set up nationally to provide essential skills development to underpin economic progress.  CERT's services are a necessary element in achieving the Government's targets for the tourism industry.  In this, the contribution of the ESF has been crucial.  Quite frankly, given the difficulties of the Irish budgetary situation, we could not have done what we did without the ESF.</P>
    <P>The extra assistance we will receive from the ESF will allow us to expand existing courses and mount new courses <Col N="483" /> in the education and training sectors.  Our approach will be a balanced one between improving the skills of the workforce, helping the less advantaged who leave school without qualifications and assisting the long-term unemployed.  We will continue to provide a package of measures combining training, aids to recruitment and temporary employment.</P>
    <P>Our situation on the geographical periphery of the Community will always involve costs for our enterprises above those of most other Community countries. This places a greater need on us to develop those areas and key sectors where we could have a comparative advantage.  Our workforce is such an area.</P>
    <P>This places crucial importance on both the social dimensions as a whole and the development of our human resources.  I am satisfied that both current directions in the EC and the level of assistance from the ESF will enable us to achieve our aim of increasing employment, raising living and working standards and improving our social framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the first Member of this House to call for a debate here on this NESC report.  I am very glad we are having a debate but I am sorry the debate is attended by so few Members of the House.  That is in the nature of the type and series of monologues that constitute debate in this House.  The boring character of this discussion this morning results from the format of the discussion and Fine Gael are absolutely right to look for a committee of this House to look at this massive report.  The Government's rejection of that proposal is foolish and this debate, however welcome, is no substitute for a chapter by chapter analysis by all Members of this House of what the NESC report seeks.  That is what Fine Gael suggested when last year they proposed an economic accord for 1992 involving all the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil yesterday the Taoiseach said he supported the economic and monetary union of Europe.  The Taoiseach supported a large scale increase in <Col N="484" /> the Community budget from 1.2 per cent of GDP to about 5 to 7 per cent of GDP. Support for economic and monetary union means that many Irish economic decisions now taken in this House or in Merrion Steet will be transferred to Europe.  It means that the entire Irish annual budget will have to be drawn up within an agreed macro-economic framework laid down in Brussels and will be subject to binding procedures and rules. It will also mean that Ireland will gradually lose the freedom to pursue independent budgetary and monetary policies in many areas.  For example, the freedom to adjust our currency within the EMS would quickly disappear.  The eventual disappearance under European monetary union of exchange rates for individual countries and national current account balances would deprive policymakers of important indicators of what might be going wrong at a national level in the European economy.</P>
    <P>Will economic and monetary union work?  There are two big question marks hanging over it.  Not until July 1990 will restrictions on capital movements in Europe be abolished.  Will the existing EMS be able to withstand the unpredictable pressures that might arise through instantaneous computer-aided transfers of money from one European currency to another after July 1990?  Will the other states in Europe be prepared to proceed to economic and monetary union without Britain?  It is clear the present British Government regard EMU as an unwarranted diminution of British sovereignty.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Taoiseach has no such reservations about the diminution of Irish sovereignty involved in EMU. Is the Taoiseach prepared to go ahead without Britain?  If he is not, and if his other European colleagues are not prepared to do so, EMU will be yet another political aspiration intoned gravely on ceremonious occasions but without conviction. It will become the European equivalent of the twin national aims, useful at Bodenstown but not elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that European <Col N="485" /> heads of state first declared their intention to create a monetary union in Europe as far back as 1969.  Has the Taoiseach embraced economic and monetary union out of a conviction that it is the right policy for Europe or simply because he believes it will never happen and he would like to gain some Brownie points by genuflecting to it as an aspiration?</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union would certainly be a most radical departure for Ireland.  It is interesting that it is the Taoiseach who embraced it so positively yesterday.  Has the Taoiseach thought it out fully?  Certainly his attitude has changed dramatically in the past three years.  I will illustrate how much the Taoiseach's attitude to matters European has changed by quoting what Deputy Haughey said in this House on 9 December 1986 in the debate on the Single European Act.  He expressed serious worry about the Single European Act proposal for the greater use of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, because, and I quote, &ldquo;we will not be able to defend our interests from as strong a base as we now do&rdquo;.  He also said on that occasion that the new co-operation procedure with the European Parliament would &ldquo;diminish our position&rdquo;.  He said that the small number of our MEPs would militate against their having any influence in what he described as &ldquo;a consumer interest Parliament&rdquo;.  He was worried about the delegation of extra powers on agriculture by the Council of Ministers to the Commission which he said would &ldquo;be hardly to our advantage&rdquo;.  He even went so far as to demand, in column 1933 of the Official Report of that date, that the then Government &ldquo;should have used this opportunity to conduct a fundamental renegotiation of our position within the Community.  They have not done so, preferring apparently as much for personal kudos as anything else to posture as good Europeans...&rdquo;.  Who is posturing now? Was the Taoiseach posturing yesterday?</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, now Taoiseach, then went on to worry about how Ireland's reputation in Africa, Asia and South America would be adversely <Col N="486" /> affected by &ldquo;our membership of the new Community that will emerge if and when this Single Act is ratified by all the member states&rdquo;.  He claimed that &ldquo;Other small European countries who are not members, like Sweden, Norway, Austria ...have fared far better and survived the ravages of the world recession with much less damage than the member states of the Community&rdquo;.  That was what he said three years ago, yet yesterday he was prepared to hand over macro-economic policy making for this State, lock, stock and barrel, to the same Community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should, in view of this divergence in his opinions within such a short space of time, spell out in clear language what economic and monetary union means for the role and functions of Dáil Éireann.  Will it require a further series of constitutional amendments and referenda, and what attitude will Fianna Fáil take to those constitutional amendments and referenda?  Will it be an attitude similar to the one they took in regard to the Single European Act when they were in Opposition?</P>
    <P>Let me make myself clear.  I am in favour of economic and monetary union in Europe, but before we proceed with it we should have a clear understanding of what it means.  Ireland has, for example, proclaimed a policy of military neutrality. Military neutrality is only possible if it is backed by strategic independence in economic terms, in terms of available stocks of goods, etc. in the event of a disruption of traffic.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the policy of self-sufficiency pursued by Mr. de Valera in the thirties was a necessary prerequisite for military neutrality in the last war.  Yet economic and monetary union embraced by the Taoiseach yesterday is the precise opposite of self-sufficiency. Has the Taoiseach worked out the political implications of economic union which he embraced so enthusiastically yesterday?  Indeed, it would be fair to say that on economic and monetary union the Taoiseach embraced the conclusions of the NESC report with almost touching <Col N="487" /> ardour, but other aspects of the report seem to have passed clear over his head.</P>
    <P>He seems to have ignored altogether the devastating criticisms in the report of Irish industrial and agricultural policy. The NESC report rejects the industrial policy which the Government are now using, and use in this plan, to obtain the private component as a counterpart to EC aid.  All the figures in that plan would fall flat on their face were it not for the inclusion of private money in IDA grant aided projects.  Indeed, the Government have only enabled themselves to achieve their financial targets in their national development plan by including large sums of private sector money bought with IDA grants.  Without this artificial use of private counterpart money for IDA grants, the financial targets in the plan would fall apart.  Yet this is the very policy of IDA grant-giving that is rejected by the NESC in the report we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>The NESC say bluntly that &ldquo;grants towards capital costs of location in designated areas has come under considerable criticism&rdquo;.  They also say that &ldquo;research on the economic impact of grant-aided plant investments has demonstrated that they have not greatly stimulated industrialisation&rdquo;.  Yet this is exactly the policy that the Government are using to underpin their national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach even boasted in his speech yesterday of some of the branch plant investments, namely Intel and Motorola, and of a growing interest by Japanese companies.  In other words, he was boasting about the continued implementation of a policy which had been condemned by the NESC.  Has he read the report?  All he could say about domestic industry was to refer back to the national linkage programme which I started some six years ago when Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats seem to have no ideas of their own on policy to develop Irish-owned firms as recommended by the NESC when the only reference to a specific policy that the <Col N="488" /> Taoiseach could make was one initiated by me some very considerable time ago.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the Taoiseach and officialdom generally in Ireland are criminally complacent about the threats to the Common Agricultural Policy in Europe at the moment.  This policy is being progressively scaled down as part of a policy to strengthen the Community budget and concede to international pressures in the current round of trade negotiations, the Uruguay round.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in cattle prices is due in no small measure to the progressive and long planned cut in export refunds. This is going to continue and it is very dangerous for Ireland.  By far the most vital policy for Ireland is the Common Agricultural Policy.  Table 5.8 of the NESC report showed that Ireland has received 73.6 per cent, three-quarters, of all the money it has got from the EC since 1973 through the price guarantee mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy, and those are currently being undermined as we can see in the marts of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Our vulnerability as a nation lies in the fact that Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that gets more than it loses from the Common Agricultural Policy.  The International Monetary Fund recently analysed the welfare effects of the Common Agricultural Policy, taking into account on the one hand benefits to farmers as against on the other hand costs to consumers and taxpayers.  It showed that Ireland was gaining a net $546 million a year from the Common Agricultural Policy, but it also showed on the other hand that the Community as a whole was losing $15,388 million a year, half of which was being lost by Germany.  In other words, Germany was losing about £14 for every £1 that Ireland gained.  Only the Netherlands and Denmark were net gainers from the Common Agricultural Policy along with Ireland, and Ireland was by far the biggest proportionate gainer.  Yet in all the debate about the Structural Funds and the money we are going to get from Brussels, not a word is being said about the potential losses that will possibly come on a much greater <Col N="489" /> scale from the apparent policy of dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy.  Against that background the threats to the Common Agricultural Policy in the current GATT talks must be taken seriously but they have not been addressed by the Taoiseach in this debate.  Our promised gains from the Structural Funds must be set against the potential losses on the Common Agricultural Policy.  This may be a taboo subject but it must be faced.  Farmers would not be the only losers in that scenario; those employed in our food industries would also see many of their jobs put at risk.</P>
    <P>This is a political House and we should consider the political practicality of some of the NESC recommendations.  They argue strongly that Ireland should push for a full economic and monetary union both to generate money to compensate poorer and peripheral regions and to ensure that Europe as a whole enjoys rapid, non-inflationary growth.  The European Commission has been proposing economic co-ordination of this type for some time.  It made a detailed proposal for a co-operative growth strategy in 1985.  This involved a package of wage restraint and fiscal expansion.  This co-operative growth strategy bore a strong resemblance to the now abandoned Keynesian policies pursued by various Governments prior to the 1973 oil shock.  Does a sufficient common interest or understanding of common interest exist between British trade unionists, Spanish farmers and German taxpayers for such a sophisticated European policy, advocated yesterday by the Taoiseach, to work in practice?</P>
    <P>As the NESC point out, it will require a very high level of &ldquo;political homogeneity&rdquo;. Therefore the NESC conclude that it is not realistic to see cohesion, as the Government seem to do, as a purely economic phenomenon, economic and monetary union is a political matter.  If we want to build a sense of European common political unity the only way this can be done is through the adoption of a Europe wide constitution, adopted by way of a referendum held simultaneously <Col N="490" /> in all member states.  That is precisely the approach that has been advocated by the Christian Democrats in the draft European constitution they tabled in the European Parliament in recent weeks.  It is an approach I strongly urge on the Government as it would create a means of giving political flesh to the theoretical concepts of economic and monetary union which will not survive in real life without a political vindication of that kind.</P>
    <P>As far as Irish domestic policy is concerned, the NESC report tells a very sad tale.  They have over the years analysed and re-analysed our problems but very little has happened.  Our tax structure, our housing, our industrial and land use policies are all seen in this report as unsuitable.  Indeed they have been unsuitable for quite some time, but in practice policy makers have been very reluctant to do anything about the NESC recommendations made over the years. In a way this is quite surprising when we recall that the NESC is a widely representative body.</P>
    <P>Why have politicians and civil servants not acted on the, apparently, so sensible advice being offered by the NESC?  I would suggest, four reasons NESC reports are left languishing unimplemented on the shelves of Government Departments.  First, NESC recommendations are too generalised, too vague.  Second, the NESC contains no politicians.  Therefore there is nobody with elective responsibility to implement their recommendations so that the practical difficulties of implementation are frequently just brushed aside and the buck passed.  Third, we have too many State bodies which diffuse and dilute responsibility for action on any recommendations made.  Finally, we have a national characteristic, not foreign to this House either, of enjoying analysis and discussion but disliking causing offence by making decisions.</P>
    <P>To deal with each of those four points the NESC should, in the first place, and as the Law Reform Commission do, produce draft legislation setting out how to achieve some of the objectives they <Col N="491" /> desire.  This would certainly be appropriate in regard to their recommendations on subjects such as housing and industrial policy.  It is only when we get down to the level of drafting the changes that have to be made in the law that real problems are confronted or even identified. Second, I believe that politicians of all parties should be involved in the deliberations of the NESC and I suggest this can be done through a national forum on 1992 or a special committee on this report, whichever approach is preferable.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have argued against this Fine Gael proposal because they see it as the Opposition trying to perform the role of Government &mdash;&ldquo;pretension&rdquo; I suppose is a word they might apply to it.  I disagree with that criticism.  Consensus, if we really mean consensus &mdash; occasionally we hear a lot from the Government benches about consensus when it suits them, when they want to wrap a protective cloak around themselves to shrug off criticism &mdash; must include everybody, particularly Opposition politicians because they have considerable negative power, they may not have positive power but they do have considerable negative power, to mobilise public opinion against particular proposals.  The experience of the 1981-86 period illustrates this quite well, when everything was opposed by the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>I believe that in that environment of confrontation which the Government create by refusing to accept an offer of consensus from us in the form of an all-party committee on 1992 there is a real risk that political timidity on the Government benches will lead to the indefinite postponement of hard decisions on a whole range of issues dealt with in the NESC report.  Indeed these are the very matters which were listed by Fine Gael in the terms of reference for a proposed national forum on 1992.  Why are the Government not prepared to take this on?</P>
    <P>I would say, furthermore, that inertia in Ireland, and the reason therefore for our failure in Europe, is not confined <Col N="492" /> either to the political arena.  There is paralysis in public administration.  Why did we have to wait 15 years for an outside body, such as the NESC, to marshal all the strategic arguments about the theory of economic integration and Ireland's position in Europe?  Surely, this is exactly the type of analysis which should be done on a routine basis by the Civil Service? This has not happened because the available talent in the Civil Service is dispersed too thinly through too many Departments, agencies, councils and institutions of all kinds.  We have a system of administration that would do justice to the United States in terms of its complexity, but we do not have the same volume of talent that they have in the United States. As a result, talented people are in positions where they cannot co-operate with one another.  Consequently, we waste efforts in interdepartmental rivalries rather than concentrating our talents. It is no wonder good ideas get lost in the Irish system of public administration.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about our preparations for 1992 a Government reorganisation Act is needed to amalgamate Departments and agencies, reduce the number of grades in the Civil Service and improve public service morale by giving rewards as the White Paper on the public service recommended for excellent service by particular public servants.  We are a small country and we need to use the talents in our public administration more effectively. We will not be able to respond to the challenge posed in the NESC report unless the Civil Service is reformed and talent used more efficiently.  We cannot afford to waste it in the way the present administrative system does.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must recognise that hard political decisions will offend some people.  This cannot be avoided but once a decision is taken it is often accepted quite quickly unless, and this is where the Government are wrong in refusing to accept an inter-party committee on 1992, the Opposition come along and promise that if elected, they will reverse that decision.  Then, the decisions are never accepted.  This is why I believe the <Col N="493" /> Government are making a serious mistake in their unwillingness to accept a Fine Gael proposal for a national forum or committee, or whatever one wants to call it, on 1992.  Perhaps I would be speaking to more receptive ears when speaking to the Minister who is present in the House, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats.  Perhaps he will be able to use his very considerable influence to get a change of view in the Government's own interest on this subject.  If we want to guarantee that we do not respond to the challenges of 1992 then on all accounts we should go straight back to the adversarial politics which dogged the progress of this country from 1973 right up to 1986.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of Irish life will be in competition with other aspects in Europe.  One area which will be particularly in competition is our education system.  There is a general view in this country that our education system is the best in Europe and that is a proposition beyond question.  I would have to tell the House that that is not the result of research.  A recent study was carried out by the educational testing services of the IAEP which is an international body specialising in international testing.  They tested the ability areas in science of 13 year olds in a range of areas.  The list includes British Colombia, Korea, UK, Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, Spain, United States and so on.  There were three categories: those who scored well, those who scored in the middle, and those who scored badly in terms of ability in science.  Irish-13-year-olds came out in the latter group, scoring least well in terms of ability in science.  As everybody knows, science is what drives economic growth, and if our school children are performing badly in terms of scientific ability then that is a serious challenge for the long-term growth of Ireland towards 1992 and beyond.  That is something the Government should look at in the context of 1992.  In particular they should be looking for European Funds to assist them in dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a provision whereby the EC will give assistance towards education in <Col N="494" /> the secondary sector &mdash; not in the primary sector &mdash; where it is being devoted to vocational training.  I believe that creates an unnecessary bias in our system.  If EC money is available only for vocational training in the education system at second level and none at primary level that means the Irish Government would have an incentive to put more money into vocational training at secondary level and to ignore both conventional secondary education, which would include science because it is not a strictly vocational subject, and ignore primary education.  I believe the European Community should aid education in general in category one regions right across the board and should not introduce an artificial bias of the kind introduced by this half-baked directive that they produced to try to meet Irish demands.</P>
    <P>There are a few other issues that should be referred to and that the Government should deal with in this debate.  The council of the NESC said that Irish agricultural policy should give priority to effective land use rather than maintaining the maximum number of holdings.  The Government did not say whether they agreed with that proposition.  If they do agree with it it means that the number of farmers in the country would be radically reduced.  The Government, given that it was an important recommendation of the NESC, should reply to it.</P>
    <P>The NESC further said that the direct income aids should be paid by the State to farmers and that this</P>
    <P>should give the State as the agent of society at large a say in the use of the land which is occupied by those in receipt of income support.  To exercise this say the State will clearly need a well formulated land use policy as advocated above'. </P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Does it mean that civil servants are going to tell farmers how they should use their land?  If it does, it is a very radical departure from existing practise.  Do civil servants or experts in Teagasc actually know better than the average Irish farmer how he should use <Col N="495" /> his land?  Have we that degree of confidence in the ability of our civil servants and our State bodies to make those decisions?  If not, is it wise to give them that power?  It is important that that aspect of the NESC report should be addressed head on.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Government have failed to deal with is the recommendation by the council that domestic tax reform should concentrate on shifting the burden of taxation away from mobile factors such as labour to immobile factors such as property.  Does the Government agree or disagree or do they just not know in regard to that recommendation?  If we are having a debate on the subject, the Government should state their position. I would like to know what is the Government's position on that.  The only thing the Taoiseach had to say on the subject was to make a sort of sideways attack on the Opposition spokesman on Finance in regard to this issue, but he made no attempt to declare what was his own view on tax reform.  I am sure it would be interesting to many, perhaps even to the Minister in the House, to know what the Government's attitude is to this shift in policy.  If he does know perhaps he will tell us and if he tells us perhaps he will distinguish between that and the policy of his own party which I think is a policy that is a good deal more straightforward in this matter than what we can glean of the Government's policies from their statement so far.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton made a strong plea for the reform of the public service here on lines that I have talked about myself quite frequently for quite a number of years.  I think he is absolutely right.  We have a huge talent which is underutilised.  Many years ago I identified a major part of our difficulty as the jurisdictional disputes that go on between different Departments and agencies in this country and which are fought out with such incredible vigour to the detriment of the real tasks that should concern us. We have talent dispersed widely throughout the service and the various agencies which, if it were brought together, would be hugely beneficial.  I certainly agree with the concern expressed by Deputy Bruton because I think that our public administration in this country is surely at least as important as any of the other major resources which we discuss at great length and sometimes with great passion but we hardly ever discuss the public service here and certainly do not discuss it in terms of what it can, could and should achieve if it were given the opportunity to do it.</P>
      <P>The NESC have played an influential role in Ireland in recent times in addressing important and complex economic and social issues.  Their work on industrial policy in the early 1980s was instrumental in challenging conventional wisdom on the subject.  Their more recent &ldquo;Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo; underpinned the national consensus to tackle our economic difficulties and led to the successful negotiation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  We now have the benefit of the Council's authoritative assessment of EC membership.  The importance of the report lies in identifying the key issues which arise for Ireland from the process of economic integration within the European Community. It sets out a thought-provoking agenda for this and future Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has long been a committed member of the European Community but <Col N="497" /> the pace of economic development and integration within Europe was stagnant up to the mid 1980s.  This was in marked contrast to the performance of the other two major economic power blocs, the United States and Japan.  Recent years have seen a dramatic turnaround within the EC, due to the dynamic of the Single European Act, the steps to complete the single market and the wider movement towards European economic integration.</P>
    <P>NESC take the view that Ireland's strategic approach within the EC should be the objective of creating a European economic and monetary union based upon a substantial Community budgetary mechanism which would help to maintain macro-economic balance and achieve economic convergence.  I believe that the emphasis on economic convergence &mdash; or cohesion as it is now widely known &mdash; is correct.  It is a sobering reality that after more than 15 years of full EC membership, there has been no convergence towards average EC income levels which stand in Ireland at some 60 per cent of the Community figure.  Moreover the enhanced Structural Funds &mdash; although significant in absolute terms &mdash; are equivalent to less than one half of one per cent of Community GDP.</P>
    <P>To deepen European union and support advanced economic integration, the Community must develop policies far broader than the Structural Funds and the creation of the single market.  Macro-economic policies must be co-ordinated in order to take the necessary positive steps to lift the performance of peripheral regions such as Ireland.  The larger and more powerful Community member states have a common interest with us in this area as their own future prospects are critically dependent on the emergence of a strong and unified Community of Europe if they and we are to compete successfully with the US and Japan in market and technological terms.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have matured as an economy in recent years and this has been attributable in no small way to the discipline of EMS membership and the associated imperative of adopting sound economic policies.  Notwithstanding our <Col N="498" /> serious problems in regard to unemployment and involuntary emigration, our overall economic performance is improving and our future prospects are good.  Can we not realistically aspire to an even better economic and social performance as part of a process of European economic and monetary union?  I believe that we can, and for that reason it is important that the current debate on EMU within the Community is not bogged down by taking a strictly monetary-related view rather than considering the wider economic benefits that may arise.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the pace of development within the Community is quickening.  The programme for the realisation of the internal market is already half completed and the momentum to achieve the target date of 1992 has increased.  Over 50 per cent of the 279 specific proposals involved have so far been adopted.  Progress has been satisfactory so far in capital liberalisation, standards, deregulation of air transport and road haulage, recognition of higher educational diplomas and company law. Progress has been slower in the areas of frontier formalities, animal and plant health, free movement of people, intellectual property and particularly, in tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's Presidency of the European Community in the first six months of next year will present us with the opportunity to give an added impetus to the internal market process.  But several sensitive areas have yet to be settled.  As a result our Presidency of the Community in 1990 may prove both for Ireland and for Europe to be the most important of our Presidencies.  Our task in heading the Community will not be easy but our approach will be positive and I am confident that we will make good progress.</P>
    <P>One of the most sensitive sectors is tax harmonisation.  We have, of course, legitimate concerns about the impact of proposed harmonisation of VAT and excise rates on the flow of Exchequer revenues and this rightly has been at the forefront of our position in Community negotiations.  We need at all times, <Col N="499" /> however, to strike a balance between the Exchequer interest and possible wider economic benefits.  The Commission's new approach to this dossier which incorporates the prospect of greater flexibility in setting tax rates reinforces the need for us to move in a phased and orderly way towards a harmonisation with UK rates as part of an overall harmonisation process.</P>
    <P>In regard to personal taxation, the current phase of European integration greatly increases the urgency of reforming our domestic tax system.  Otherwise, our skilled workers will increasingly move to what we call lower tax regions but which really are normal tax regions, as labour mobility increases after 1992. This is one of the reasons my own party placed such emphasis on this matter in the four year programme for Government and that we are jointly agreed with Fianna Fáil on a programme of pro-jobs tax reform leading to a 25 per cent standard tax rate and a single higher tax rate by 1993.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on Ireland's contribution under the enhanced Structural Funds have been virtually completed and, on balance, constitute a satisfactory outcome for the country.</P>
    <P>The Community support of over £3 billion which we will eventually secure places Ireland, from an EC point of view, on top of the recipient list.  The Structural Fund spending <i>per capita</i> proposed for Ireland is the highest of all the priority regions in Europe and provides an irrefutable answer to criticisms of the final package negotiated.  The <i>National Development Plan</i> strikes a good balance between infrastructural and developmental expenditure and I am confident that the money will be effectively used to further national objectives.  For example, the National Operational Programme for Industrial Development, for which my Department are responsible, envisages a marked increase in investment in marketing and technology, in line with broadly accepted priorities for future industrial development.  However, we must continually strive to ensure that the <Col N="500" /> policies and programmes put in place are the most appropriate to Ireland's developmental needs and that they are not driven, as has too often been the case in the past, simply by the availability of EC support.</P>
    <P>In so far as the regional dimension to the Structural Funds is concerned, the Government are committed to maintaining an ongoing link with the regional groups already established and they will have a role in monitoring the implementation of the operational programmes and advising and commenting on them.  On a broader level, my own party believe that if in the future, we wish to have a more enlightened attitude towards planning at a subnational level, we need to have fewer regions, better structures and firmer goals to make the process of regionalisation more effective.  Equally it will become desirable in the future for the regions in this country to develop stronger powers of initiating proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to industrial policy, the NESC report concludes that Ireland has since 1973 specialised out of the industrial sectors where the larger indigenous producers were previously found, into a narrower range of overseas dominated sectors.  At the same time much of the employment growth in manufacturing was in small scale activities; this runs against the general trend of concentration in larger units which usually follows integration.  NESC believe that the long run benefits of market completion are likely to be unevenly distributed, with the greatest benefits accruing to regions in which industries with economies of scale and highly innovative sectors are most prevalent.  It points out that Ireland is not such a region.  Consequently NESC recommend that scale and innovation should be <Col N="501" /> important elements in Ireland's industrial policy.  The council stresses also the overriding importance of maintaining a favourable overall economic environment and its pivotal role in promoting industrial growth, investment and employment.</P>
    <P>While I would agree broadly with the NESC analysis, I think it is important to record the significant improvement in industrial performance which has taken place over the past two and a half years. Annual industrial output levels have been growing at a rate of 12 per cent.  Industrial exports continue to do well and there is evidence that they are more broadly based at sectoral level.  Profits are recovering within industry and the CII estimates that investment in equipment could grow by up to 20 per cent in 1989. Direct employment in industry is growing for the first time since 1980 and, according to the ESRI medium-term review, will accelerate over the next five years. This is confirmed by yesterday's figures from the CSO Labour Force Survey preliminary results for April 1989.</P>
    <P>We have made considerable progress in improving industrial competitiveness as well, through controlling costs generally and, in particular, in reducing inflation, interest rates and charges by the major public utilities.  In regard to pay, the consensus in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is of paramount importance and has brought real benefits to all sections of society, including workers, employers, the unemployed and those on social welfare.  The advent of 1992 should, in general, enhance this favourable environment through cost reductions arising from the dismantling of trade barriers, improvements in our transport infrastructure and more open public procurement.</P>
    <P>While I accept the overriding priority to build up our own indigenous industry, I believe that our overseas owned manufacturing sector is now a vital and permanent part of our economy, directly employing over 80,000 people and spending a total of over £3 billion in 1988 in the Irish economy.  The overseas sector <Col N="502" /> has brought improved management practice and skills to Ireland and has introduced us to new technologies.  The advent of 1992 is opening up new opportunities for overseas investment in Ireland as EFTA, US, Japanese and other Far-Eastern firms are positioning themselves for the reality of the Single European Market.  I believe that we are particularly well placed to capture a disproportionate share of that mobile investment as is evidenced by major recent project announcements such as Intel and Motorola from the US and Brother and Fujitsu Isotec from Japan.</P>
    <P>What is important to grasp is that the direct State support provided to encourage such overseas investment is critically appraised on a cost-benefit basis and in terms of jobs actually delivered on the ground.  Moreover, safeguards are now included in virtually all grant agreements which protect the State's interest in the event of closure or failure to deliver the promised performance.</P>
    <P>Such State support is not at the expense of support for the development of the indigenous sector.  This is a popular misconception. Already the State industrial promotion agencies have a range of schemes and programmes to assist Irish firms to meet the essential requirements for international growth that is excellence in marketing, management, product development and technology.  Such schemes are constantly being changed and adapted in the light of policy developments. If we have failed in the process of &ldquo;indigenous industrialisation&rdquo; as NESC puts it &mdash; and I would agree that our performance leaves much to be desired &mdash; I doubt if it has been for a lack of agencies, programmes and State supports and, in fact, <i>au contraire</i> is the fourth.</P>
    <P>I agree with NESC that scale is an important issue for Irish-owned industry but the appropriate policy response will need to vary from case to case and from sector to sector.  In the case of the food sector, for example, economies of scale in the marketing and production areas are clearly of vital importance.  The Irish dairy and beef industry is changing dramatically in anticipation of European <Col N="503" /> needs through mergers and acquisition within Ireland and worldwide.  Some progress has been made in the pigmeat sector as well where, as a result of restructuring, the scale of operation is now much larger than before.</P>
    <P>While many other Irish companies are small by European standards, I believe that they can nonetheless prosper in an enlarged Europe through achieving excellence in products, services or particular market niches.  Our efforts in the context of industrial policy will be geared towards encouraging indigenous companies to think in strategic terms with the aim of increasing export sales to build up to large companies generating sufficient cash to invest in new product development and innovation.  Agencies and programmes will be directed towards that goal.  Another way to successfully tackle scale is for firms to put in place partnerships with other European companies involving sub-contracting, licensing, technology acquisition, joint ventures or outright acquisition.</P>
    <P>NESC take the view that there is a strong case for attempting to inject an innovation orientation into Irish industrial policy.  This view is based on the well documented lack of innovation in firms located in peripheral regions of the Community and on the growing Community interest in research and technology.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that these two factors are spoken of together.  Innovation, after all, can be defined quite simply, as a firm's ability to design, develop and manufacture the right product at the right price.  The vast majority of new products today are themselves high-tech in nature.  Without a well developed technology base, innovation in industry is almost impossible.  The Government have already taken significant steps to address the technological needs and shortcomings of Irish firms through the science and technology development programme operated by my Department.  This programme contains initiatives to develop specific technologies to the marketplace in university-industry centres and to transfer those <Col N="504" /> technologies through joint projects, technology audits and placement schemes.</P>
    <P>The report also points out that management have a crucial role to play in identifying the opportunities for innovation and concludes that industrial policy should, therefore, take steps to enhance management ability in firms. The company development programme which is operated on an interagency basis is one important initiative to develop the strategic management capability of medium-size Irish firms.  A scheme of management development supports is available also.</P>
    <P>I have said earlier that under the national operational programme for industrial development, considerable emphasis is being placed on developing the management, marketing, and technological capability of firms.</P>
    <P>Taken together these measures form the basis of an innovation-orientated industrial policy recommended in the report.  We will continue to build on what we have done to date.  Ultimately however the innovation process is two-sided. Before determining his capacity to satisfy the opportunities, the entrepreneur must first identify the market opening.  While the State can play an important role in the downstream aspects of the innovation process, the first steps are very much the province of the individual.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the open, outward looking environment, which will be fostered by the completion of the internal market should act as a stimulus to innovation in the peripheral countries.  The various industrial policy measures which we have put in place and which will be strengthened under the enhanced Structural Funds will provide strong support for those who have the willingness and ability to exploit them.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's strategy for developing the indigenous sector is the creation of a strong marketing capability within Irish industry.  The focus is to prepare industry for the competitive single market by closing the gap that <Col N="505" /> exists between Irish firms and other Community firms in terms of marketing skills, information and organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe all this stuff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The structure of indigenous Irish industry puts it at a severe disadvantage.  For example, nearly two out of every three Irish internationally trading firms employ fewer than 50 people, while only 6 per cent of such firms employ more than 300 people. In addition, the Irish indigenous sector is relatively new to international trading with about 50 per cent of firms having commenced exporting only since 1980. The picture of disadvantage facing Irish SMEs is reinforced by figures showing small firms having a lower percentage of full-time sales-marketing executives overseas and being less likely to be involved in product development than larger firms.  For reasons of history, proximity, language and culture, the UK has been the major target of Irish firms. However, even there very few Irish manufacturing companies have established a sales or distribution office.  In the rest of continental Europe, our absence is even more pronounced.  This lack of overseas representation severely limits the capacity of firms to participate fully in international markets and to grasp opportunities when they arise.</P>
      <P>We cannot afford to continue to ignore the reality of the commercial environment in which we find ourselves.  The opportunities of the internal market must be exploited to the full and we will only be capable of doing this if each individual firm adopts a market-led approach to its development.  This requires detailed planning and research into the market; its requirements, its trends, the competition and the firm's own capabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise the major task which firms must face.  However, the performance of our indigenous industry in international export markets over the last two years gives some reason for confidence in our capacity to meet the challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> In the National Development Plan, a series of support measures were outlined with the objective of helping Irish SMEs to increase their export performance from £2.5 billion in 1988 to £4.5 billion by the mid-nineties.  This target forms part of the wider objective of doubling Ireland's share of imports by other EC countries from 1.2 per cent in 1988 to 2.4 per cent by the mid-nineties.  In order to help industry to achieve those targets, it is intended to substantially increase the State's input into the marketing development area both domestically and overseas. Already, in 1989, additional funding was provided to CTT to introduce a new regional marketing-international linkage programme.  Under this programme selected regions in Europe which are displaying exceptional growth potential are being targeted with the objective of identifying suitable opportunities for Irish firms.  The thrust of the action is general business development covering the full range of possibilities from the sale of existing Irish products, through reciprocal marketing and distribution arrangements, to joint projects in the region selected or in third markets.  Areas already targeted are Catalonia and Milan-Turin and these will be followed by other selected regions.</P>
    <P>The removal of barriers to trade in the run-in to the single market is accelerating the pace at which businesses are restructuring in the Community with the object of enhancing their international competitiveness. Such concentration of industrial and economic power has, on the one hand, beneficial effects, for example greater efficiencies resulting from economies of scale.  On the other hand, greater concentration of economic power reduces the number of players in the market place, and increases the possibility for monopolistic and collusive behaviour with detrimental effects on the consumer.</P>
    <P>NESC have stressed the need for a close relationship between mergers policy and industrial policy.  The issue is whether Irish owned companies developed from start up over a period <Col N="507" /> can make the fundamental leap in scale necessary and, if not, whether they should be taken over.  It is a fair question as to whether more could be done to maintain indigenous control of such companies, but it is unrealistic to insist that a change of ownership should never occur. There will certainly be cases where new external ownership will bring additional resources or new market opportunities to a company whose development would otherwise be constrained.</P>
    <P>Until now the EC Commission has rarely applied its powers under Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty in mergers. This is principally because of the absence of clear guidelines.  Against this background and the fact that merger control has gained increasing prominence in the context of the Single Market, extensive discussions have been held over the past 15 months by the EC Council on the Commission's proposal for the control of mergers and take-overs.  This proposal provides for a regime whereby all mergers and take-overs having a significant effect on intra-Community trade, are appraised by the Commission with a view to establishing whether they are compatible with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>A welcome consensus is now emerging among the member states on the need to reach early agreement on this regulation. Businesses generally need legal security as the number of cross-border mergers increase, and it is now accepted that this can only be achieved through the creation of a Community-wide legal framework.</P>
    <P>For consumers the effect of the regulation may not be felt immediately, but because it is aimed at preserving and strengthening competition in the rapidly evolving European Internal Market, it shall and must operate in their favour in the longer term, and particularly in a situation where a single company or a small number of companies have market dominance.</P>
    <P>New legislation in the area of competition policy is necessary to bring about conditions which will enable market forces to promote efficiency and pass the <Col N="508" /> benefits on to the consumer.  The <i>Programme for Government</i> recognises this and contains a commitment that the required legislation will be brought forward. The existence of restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and professional services impose heavy and unsustainable cost burdens on the economy.</P>
    <P>A major defect in current legislation is that there is no general prohibition on anti-competitive practices.  At my request, the Fair Trade Commission are urgently looking at how provisions on a general prohibition system, similar to those of Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty, should be incorporated into Irish legislation.  In parallel my Department are working on the preparation of the necessary implementing legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of considering whether we should go this route but rather how.  Those sectors of the Irish economy which are involved in trade within the Community, as distinct from purely domestic trade, are already affected by Articles 85 and 86.  There is no good reason to shelter the other parts of the economy from this discipline. Competition is a spur to efficiency and its absence is detrimental to economic development.</P>
    <P>I believe that NESC have done us a great service in producing their most recent report.  I have no doubt that it will continue to provoke widespread debate on the key issues which it raises but, more importantly, I believe that it will inform future policy developments.  For my own part, I am arranging for the key industrial policy issues to be fully examined in the context of my Department's Triennial Review of Industrial Performance which is due for publication early next year.  In Ireland, there has been far too much emphasis on squeezing funds out of Europe, something at which we have been particularly successful.  What we need much more is to focus on our long-term requirements within Europe and to develop the policies necessary to be at the forefront of the exciting and profound changes which are currently taking place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> The NESC report did not have the opportunity of considering what effect the profound changes now happily occurring in Eastern Europe might have on the future development of the Community of Twelve.  I personally hope that, notwithstanding their significance, they will not divert the existing Community from the path on which we are now set.  It is in the interests of those in Eastern Europe whom we wish to encourage that the existing Community should become more cohesive and more united.  It is from that position of strength that we can best help and nurture newly emerging democracies in the eastern part of Europe. After all, that is the fundamental purpose of the Community; its economic development is simply the best and most effective means to that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in the tasks ahead of him.  I, like Deputy O'Malley, have just taken over as spokesman on Industry and Commerce.  It is very evident that there is need for dramatic change in this country if we are to tackle the main problems facing us, particularly in the area of unemployment. The National Economic and Social Council should be congratulated in laying out the stark reality of the choices which face us for the future.  Whilst the group who put together this report are not elected public representatives, they represent various facets of Irish life.  The question always raised in relation to such reports is &ldquo;what are the politicians going to do about it?&rdquo;  I sincerely hope our discussions here will be only the beginning of a process of teasing out the challenges which face us in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to decide what type of society we want, what type of role we intend playing in the future in the greater European Community and whether we are to <Col N="510" /> adopt the begging bowl attitude all our lives or a positive approach in terms of recognising that this market of over 300 million people affords us a tremendous opportunity if we are prepared to grasp it.  Basically this is the challenge we face.</P>
    <P>We have grown up as a republic used to doing things our own way, going about things in a very casual way on many occasions and treating our agricultural industry very often as a sort of hobby, a form of existence for a family, without getting down to developing a strong agricultural industry.  The choices facing the Irish farmer in this report are quite enormous. Are we prepared to allow the State to intervene and tell people how to use their land in the future, paying the farmer a form of basic income to subsidise his income from agriculture?  These sorts of challenges go beyond making speeches about what is contained in this report.</P>
    <P>We had a report not long ago represented by the Commission on Taxation. The commission suggested ways and means of changing our tax structures. However, when those suggestions are highlighted by commentators the standard political response is, &ldquo;we cannot make one change; we need to reform the whole system&rdquo;.  Since I was first elected to this House I have been asking when it is proposed to reform the entire tax structure.  What is the point in commissioning such reports if we are not prepared to make changes so that the benefits can be passed on to the people we represent?</P>
    <P>When the NESC report was published Fine Gael, in their response, suggested that the Government establish a national forum for 1992.  That proposal was made in good faith and it was an indication that we recognise that we can block changes proposed by the Government by drumming up opposition to them.  That is a problem that Governments have had to face for many years.  When in Government we had to listen to criticism from the Opposition about measures we took to improve the overall scene.  The Opposition did not accept that there was a need to cut public expenditure and the main party in Opposition told the public that <Col N="511" /> there was no need for the cuts.  They accused us of pursuing Thatcherite policies and of ignoring the plight of many people.  We were told that we were more interested in balancing books than in looking after people.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of how difficult it was to get the public to accept that there was a need to cut public expenditure.  It was not until 1987, when we were in Opposition and when there was a form of consensus between the Government and the main Opposition party for two years, that the community accepted the need for change.  I challenge any Member to deny that the improvements that have taken place in the economy could not have taken place without consensus politics. Those who are honest will admit that.  I accept that the Government from 1987 to 1989 had the difficult task of implementing harsh decisions.</P>
    <P>I accept that under our structures the Government are the only people who can implement policy changes, but they need help.  The challenges facing us cannot be met by the Government on their own.  It is for that reason that Fine Gael have suggested the setting up of a national forum for 1992.  It should consist of representatives of all political parties, of industry, the trade union movement and the farming community, the sectors that will be involved in implementing the changes that are necessary if we are to compete with others in the European market.  We will have to make every effort to create employment, to keep our young people at home and become a real player on the European scene.</P>
    <P>Are the Government prepared to face that challenge?  The debate yesterday and today will be rendered irrelevant if the Government do not take action in regard to the NESC proposals.  It is not true to say that the Opposition are interfering in the work of the Government.  It was a load of nonsense to make that suggestion. We have all been tripping around for the last 15 years doing things in a haphazard manner and not having a proper approach to industrial development, our <Col N="512" /> social policy and our agricultural industry. The NESC report shows that in the last 15 years we have stood still.  The report highlights the value of the CAP but that is under threat.  What in God's name have we done with all the money that came to us through the CAP in the last 15 years?  Can we point to where that money has been invested?  Can we say that as a result of the CAP we have made many changes in the agricultural industry?  Can we point to job opportunities for our school leavers and graduates as a result of that policy?  In fact, nobody knows where the money has gone to.  There is no doubt that we received a lot of money but there has not been a dramatic improvement in that industry.  Unemployment continues to rise and emigration is at a disgraceful level.  As politicians we have failed miserably to give the proper leadership and encourage the creation of jobs.  We have failed to build up a society that we can all be proud of.</P>
    <P>I switched on my television by accident last night and watched the BBC News-night programme.  I watched an interesting report on a famous photographer who spent many years in Vietnam during the war.  That person, who has returned to London, said he was upset to see the big increase in the number of people sleeping in doorways or in broken down warehouses in the back streets of London.  He was prompted to ask, &ldquo;What sort of a society are we living in&rdquo;.  He has used his tremendous skill as a photographer to highlight the failure of modern society to provide every human being with a decent standard of living. He presented a wonderful series of photographs which were a true illustration of life in London for thousands of people.  Unfortunately, a high percentage of those people come from Ireland.</P>
    <P>That programme prompted me to ask, &ldquo;What in God's name are we about?  Do we want a society where a few will have plenty but many will not have anything&rdquo;? It is time that politicians realised what their job is.  We may argue with each other, as is the way in any democracy, but we have an obligation to agree on <Col N="513" /> certain basic principles one of which should be that every human being brought into the world should start with an equal chance.  Every child should have an opportunity to get a decent standard of education.  All our people should have an opportunity to make use of the skills and talents they were blessed with and helped by our education system, they should be able to obtain gainful employment. I accept that some people have more ability than others, that some have a talent to create wealth and that, unfortunately, some people for various reasons will not be as successful as others. However, there are basic principles that all political parties can share, but there are still basic principles that every human being is entitled to some sort of decent standard of living and the chance to use his or her talents and not spend life walking the streets in a degrading situation of being unemployed for the past six years with no prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>In order to pursue the sort of challenges this report contains we must start with ourselves and have the structures that will enable proper debate to take place as to whether we want to face up to these challenges and decide what type of society we want and what structural changes are needed to bring it about.  Of course, if you have such a forum there will be differences of opinion between perhaps The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the PDs and Independents.  There are differences of opinion, but if we could even agree on some basic principles that would be a beginning.  The system we are trying to operate at the moment is not capable of bringing about the changes required here to allow legislation to be brought in and passed quickly.  Changes should be made efficiently and effectively so that we do not have to wait two or three years for legislation to come into the House.</P>
    <P>We must change from the way we are more concerned about who spends the Structural Funds than how they are spent; the great debate is who should spend them, not how they should be spent.  Of course, we all like to get our hands on money and deliver good news, but from <Col N="514" /> this report it is quite evident that some of the proposals we have are totally contradictory to what is in the report.  Here we are setting out looking for Structural Funds to spend in areas where the NESC are telling us that is not the way we should be spending them at all.  We are insisting that money is going to be spent and they are telling us in this report for God's sake not to do it that way.  The debate has been about who is going to spend the money.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on the blockages in relation to employment.  Again, the figures are all available in the report and I will not waste the time of the House by quoting them.  They are all there for everybody who has an interest in this report.  The report has identified serious structural deficiencies in order to bring about certain changes that are required if we are serious about looking for full employment for our people.</P>
    <P>I am sure the public are blue in the face listening to politicians talking about the need for tax reform and are wondering when we are going to do something about it.  I speak here as somebody who is in business and employs people and I can speak as someone who once was in receipt of a PAYE salary.  I know what is happening out there in the marketplace. As long as we have the taxation system we have we just will not get the extra productivity, commitment and enthusiasm for the deveopment required at this point in our history.  If you talk to any employed person and ask if he will work overtime and whether he is prepared to come in on Saturday and work hard and help us achieve our targets, perhaps he will do it for a short while but when he gets his pay packet and looks at the net take-home pay he will say to himself that he has wasted his time, he spent his Saturday away from his family, worked six days a week and he will not do it any more.  That is the simple language spoken in the marketplace.  People just will not produce and expand as long as that situation remains.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about looking ahead and thinking about competition in Europe, part of our problem is that <Col N="515" /> instead of looking for ways of producing more, working harder and getting a fair reward for effort, we are now talking about reducing the working week.  That is the latest.  Then we look at the Far East and ask how they are doing it.  They are doing it because they set about, through their proper structures, to develop their economy and give people rewards for what they do.  People in the Far East do not work five days a week; they work five and a half days a week.  They do not get four or six weeks holidays; they get two weeks holidays.  I am not saying we should all revert to two weeks holidays. Like anybody else, I enjoy my holidays, but we are trying to produce a standard of living and to compete on industrial terms with these countries which have a different system, a different method of reward and a different approach to life. Then we wonder why we cannot export our goods to these countries, why we cannot avail of their markets and why our country is being flooded with their imports.  You do not need to be an economic genius to work it out.  The basic cost of the product is far less there than it is here, and we are consistently going on the line of less work, more pay, slow to change, afraid to tackle the reality of tax reform and to face up to it.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House in all good faith on numerous occasions said to the Government of 1987-89, &ldquo;If you want to set up an all-party committee to examine tax reform Fine Gael will be the first people in there to participate&rdquo;.  The response was, &ldquo;No, that is the business of Government; we are interfering&rdquo;.  What did Government do since 1987 to date? Precisely nothing in relation to tax reform.  Next year we will be facing into the local elections.  The NESC report states clearly that we need a property tax. I do not know whether property tax is the real answer, but that is what they are saying and this is the report we are debating.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, would appear to be the next speaker.  Since they have rejected the offer of the Opposition Party to participate in an all-party committee to deal <Col N="516" /> with tax reform and our suggestion for a national forum for 1992 and they regard our suggestions as an interference in Government, and in view of the fact that they are now accepting total responsibility themselves, perhaps they will tell us whether they are going to introduce a property tax.  What proposals have we for reductions or a reform of the taxation system?  It is grand to be able to say we will bring down income tax next year but bringing down income tax next year is not the real answer to this problem.  It is not a question of whether you pay tax at 56, 54, 35 or 33 per cent, it is a question of recognising effort, of having a structure which provides that if you do that extra bit our taxation system will not take as much from you, because it is a bonus structure or a profit-sharing structure, as if you were just getting an increase in salary.</P>
    <P>We could start in our own commercial State bodies with this one.  There is no reason on this earth why BTE, the ESB, Telefís Éireann or any of the commercial State bodies should not have profit-sharing and bonus schemes introduced for employees provided those State bodies achieve certain targets.  There is no reason those bodies could not produce a tremendous amount of wealth for this country.  They have the personnel, the skills and the professionalism available in industry.  We have engineers who today are working in one of the largest multinational telecommunications companies in the world and where did they come from?  The engineers, the people chiefly who brought about that situation of that company, are ex-P and T engineers, ex-employees of the State.  These people go to private industry and build it up.  They are working for multinationals but, unfortunately, all the profits go out of this country.  Why can we not have the same in BTE and the ESB?  Why must we wait until they go to one of the multinationals before they can use their real talents?  Their ability and talents are recognised there and it is our system that prevents those talents from flourishing.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree then that recent events would indicate that he should take a more active part in this matter?  For example, is the Taoiseach not aware that Mr. Molyneaux said recently he does not believe it would be proper for parties to talk behind the backs of the Governments &mdash; to use his own phrase &mdash; but that the Governments should speak about further progress and then that the parties should take it up from there?

      <P>Is the Taoiseach unaware of the fact that as recently as last Saturday, the Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland delivered himself again of the opinion that devolution is the only way forward? Would the Taoiseach not further agree that this Government's total inaction in relation to devolution &mdash; this goes for the previous Government, too, so far as we can see &mdash; is in a very real sense giving aid, comfort, sustenance and support to the integrationist view in Northern Ireland thereby selling out the very national objective which the Taoiseach himself claims to adhere to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the Government's current plans for bringing the National Museum, Dublin 2 up to an acceptable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable amount of progress has been made in recent years in improving the level of resources and accommodation available to the National Museum at a cost in the region of £2 million.  I am sure the Deputy has had an opportunity to admire the work done on the Treasury.  The Natural History Museum has now been substantially <Col N="520" /> renovated and will be re-opened next month.</P>
      <P>Major works currently in progress involve: (1) the improvement of the Rotunda entrance area by the creation of an expanded museum shop and visitor reception/information area; (2) the restoration of the Central Court (or Great Hall) of the Museum and the planning for the display there in May, 1990 of a major exhibition on the theme of early Christian metalwork; and (3) the planning for the provision of improved conservation laboratories.</P>
      <P>All these works are part of a progressive programme of improving conditions in the National Museum which is housed in a beautiful building but which has required extensive renovation and is too small to display all the collections.</P>
      <P>Plans are, therefore, under consideration for the creation of a new museum of decorative and folk art in the Custom House Dock site.  This museum will contain nearly 100,000 square feet as compared with 66,000 square feet in the Kildare Street building.  Arrangements have also been introduced to increase the commercial earnings of the museum in common with museums generally around the world.  The proposed shop is nearing completion and a wide range of replicas and artefacts modelled on museum objects will be on sale.</P>
      <P>The new Director of the National Museum has recently submitted to my Department proposals for the further improvement of the museum's services. These will have to take account of present limitations on public funds and staffing but it is hoped that a programme can be devised to continue the work already on hands to enable the museum to fulfil fully its role as one of our major national cultural institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, indeed, aware of the work that has been carried out in recent years and I welcome the comprehensive statement from the Taoiseach.  May I ask the Taoiseach to clarify, from what he has said, the number of items that are available for display in the National Museum because it would appear that <Col N="521" /> they are in excess of what they will ever be able to display at any one time?  Are there any proposals to decentralise some of the functions because I am sure he is aware that there are many areas throughout the country were local museums are being built and where this could be considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is always a matter that can be considered appropriate but the main outlet that we would foresee at the moment is the new museum down in the Custom House Docks site. If we can get that into operation we would have an extra 100,000 square feet there.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Will the Minister agree that the substantial percentage increases year on year his own figures show indicate an abject failure of Government policies in the economic field in relying almost totally on the private sector to create employment for these young people who are now forced to leave our shores, and that it constitutes a most appalling blood letting of the people and population of this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask a statistical supplementary, since it is a statistical question.  The Minister is no doubt aware that yesterday's publication of the labour force survey up to April last showed a drop in the labour force of 17,000.  The Minister is also aware that his Government's national plan says that the natural increase in the labour force is 25,000.  Adding 17 and 25 the total is 42.  Children under 18 years of age and women who are not on the live register do not appear in the labour force figures. In view of that will the Minister agree that the estimate for emigration of 46,000 up to April of last year is understated and that it is quite clear that emigration was somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000? Will the Minister ask the CSO to revise their emigration estimates and give us the real picture for emigration?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>It is my objective that the marine resources of the State should be exploited in a manner which is environmentally and economically sound and takes proper account of existing users and established rights.  I intend to use the instruments and resources at my disposal to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the purpose of the management strategy described by the Deputies is to solve the problems of conflicting interest which arise in relation to the use of marine resources between developmental interests on the one hand and environmental and amenity considerations on the other.  While I do not have any plans for the large scale advance exercises envisaged by the Deputies, my Department have a substantial capacity to evaluate particular proposals and their impact on the marine environment and other water users.  In relation to aquaculture, for example, the Fisheries Act, 1980, provides for the formal designation of suitable areas following public inquiries held locally.  The Foreshore Act, 1933, <Col N="542" /> provides that projects involving use of the State foreshore &mdash; which for the purposes of the Act extends to the limit of the territorial sea &mdash; should be advertised locally in order to bring forward full information on potential conflict.</P>
    <P>My Department have established administrative procedures to reconcile conflicts which may arise and to evaluate, in conjunction with project promoters, the level of environmental impact.  This process is in some respects similar to the planning process operated on land by local authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department also work closely with those local authorities which are drawing up water quality management plans under the terms of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act of 1977.</P>
    <P>In addition to the processes which I have described, my Department carry out marine environmental monitoring programmes in the areas of sea fisheries, aquaculture and quality of the marine environment.  While I am reasonably happy that existing processes are adequate given present demands for the proper management of our marine and coastal resources, different processes may become necessary as demand for the utilisation of these resources increases. As this happens, the adoption of different strategies may become desirable and this is something which will be kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that all these facilities are available at present in the Department of the Marine but would the Minister not agree that what is happening at the moment is rather haphazard, that each application received is treated as an individual application, that there is a need to have a look at the entire coastal area and to decide in a planned way what is the most suitable development for respective areas?  Rather than having a conflict of interest when individual applications are made would he not agree that there should be an overall strategy of the policy direction to be taken?  In relation to the issuing of fish farm licences, does the Minister consider it appropriate to issue <Col N="543" /> salmon growing licences in areas that are highly suitable for shellfish development, knowing that it would cause damage to shellfish areas?  The Minister must consider this matter.  There are also a number of wider areas to be considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy's questions are becoming overlong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather extensive area and a wide subject and there is a lot to be dealt with in it.  In relation to the drawing of materials from coastal areas and the degree of coastal erosion that is taking place through natural processes and through persons taking sand and gravel from the coastal areas, what plans have the Department of the Marine for the entire coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have outlined to the House the general strategy in my Department and the powers available to me in this regard, which are quite considerable powers.  I think there is a separate question down about aquaculture, and particularly one in which the Deputy has an interest, which I will be answering later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.  I am aware that he has wide powers under the Fisheries Act and the Foreshore Act but would he not agree that, given the state of coastal erosion and the fact that no work is being undertaken at present in any part of the country in relation to protecting the coastline and also that most of his powers under the Acts mentioned are reactive, it is necessary that at this stage his Department and the Department of the Environment, together with the local authorities, would set up some committee or body which would be responsible for activating maintenance and drawing up development plans for the long term?  Otherwise the Minister will only get involved and make decisions when requests come to him from the various local authorities or from private <Col N="544" /> bodies.  I would put it to the Minister that the present position is not good enough and that a coastal zone management study by his Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take what the Deputy has said into consideration.  I know the Department of the Environment have responsibilities in this area, as have the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's reply on protecting the Irish coastline, can he tell the House if his Department officials have prepared any legislation similar to the British legislation to protect the right of citizens to have access to the coast, particularly in the light of 1992 when private ownership of the coast by non-nationals is possible and access to the coast itself may be prohibited, and if he intends to bring the Irish legislation into line with other, for example British, legislation to put the coastline in public ownership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual access to the coast falls under the remit of a different Minister but I understand precisely what the Deputy is speaking about because not today or yesterday but some decades ago problems have arisen through the purchase of sites near the coast by foreigners. I know that problems may arise in the future in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister considering legislation in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that at present he has adequate powers to deal with the four main types of damaging activity that is occurring around the coast, namely, coastal development which includes the in-filling and draining of marshes and the removal of sand and gravel, the discharge of toxic persistent wastes such as pesticides, the discharge of biodegradable wastes beyond the point at which the natural <Col N="545" /> degradative system can cope, and over-fishing? Does he feel that at present his Department have the necessary powers to deal with these factors which are accepted worldwide as being the most damaging to our coasts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the list the Deputy has read out contains most of the factors which are causing worry and anxiety among environmentalists throughout the world.  With regard to some of them at least, I am aware that I have power, particularly with regard to the foreshore, but with regard to others the Deputy has mentioned I want to check what the position is and I will let her know.  I can assure the Deputy that if there is any loophole in the law I will direct my attention to that and bring legislation before the House for the protection of the environment.</P>

      <P>There may be a tabular statement but the question did not ask for a reply in the form of a tabular statement. Normally there is a differentiation between the closing dates for different types of salmon licences, be it drift net, draft net, drag net or snap net.  It was brought to my notice that this year there was no differentiation, that fishermen who use draft nets, that is up-river fishermen, were told that they would have to close down and stop fishing at the <Col N="547" /> same time as drift net fishermen, be it at sea or in the outer part of estuaries.  I ask the Minister if he sanctioned this course of action by the fishery boards, in particular by the Southern Fishery Board. Does he realise that there have been different closing dates?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 25, 26, 37 and Priority Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office I have held a series of meetings with various interested parties regarding the difficulties that have arisen in relation to angling licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 July 1989, I met the chairman and chief executive officer of the Central Fisheries Board.  On 27 July 1989, I met members of the national committee of the anti-rod licence campaign.  On 1 August 1989, I met representatives of the National Anglers Representative Association. On 3 August 1989, I had a second meeting with representatives of the anti-rod licence campaign.  On 24 August 1989, officials of my Department met representatives of the anti-rod licence campaign.  On 15 September, I met the members of the Central Fisheries Board, which include the chairpersons of the seven regional fisheries boards.  On 5 October 1989, I met representatives of <Col N="549" /> the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 13 October 1989, I met a delegation representing various tourist organisations including: Bord Fáilte, Western Regional Tourism, Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, Irish Hotels Federation, Town and Country Homes Association, Fáilte Tuaithe, Irish Country House and Restaurant Association, Irish Caravan Council, Incoming Tour Operators' Association, and the Western Game-fishing Association.  Apart from these meetings with representative groups, I have also met a number of other groups and individuals who have an interest in this issue.  In addition, I have had a large volume of written submissions on the subject.</P>
    <P>The detailed matters raised at these meetings are of course confidential and that was the basis on which discussions were conducted with all groups.  The discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere and I detected a general desire that this particular dispute should be deescalated and a normal atmosphere restored.</P>
    <P>I am now in the process of arranging what will hopefully be a final series of consultations.  My aim is to have these completed within a matter of weeks.  It is, therefore, timely that I outline for the House my general perception of the problem and the objectives I have set myself.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies who are most familiar with this dispute will be aware of how complex it now is.  There are significant groups of anglers vehemently opposed to the licence concept for trout and coarse fishing.  There are also major groups who are equally strongly supportive of the licence.  The Central Fisheries Board and the majority of the regional fisheries boards have also pressed strongly that the licence be maintained.</P>
    <P>All the groups I have met, whether pro or anti licence have pressed for increased funding for the fishery service and most are conscious that a contribution by anglers to the financing of the overall level of the service is important.</P>
    <P>There is grave concern which I share <Col N="550" /> about the social divisions &mdash; and this has impacted most severely on me &mdash; caused in some communities by the different stances local individuals and groups have adopted on the licence.  I am very anxious that these divisions be healed.  I am also very concerned about the impact of the dispute both on angling tourism and tourism generally and the impact of the dispute on the visitor friendly image of some localities.</P>
    <P>I have stressed to all the groups I have met that I am anxious to achieve an outcome which will bring about reconciliation within the angling community and between the fishery service and anglers in those areas where divisions have arisen.  I have also stressed the need for revenue from anglers for the financing of the fishery service.</P>
    <P>There is, in the view of many groups, a clear need for an effective mechanism for raising revenue from anglers.  To be effective such a mechanism should aim to overcome the perceived difficulties raised by the licence concept and should be capable of being implemented in a fashion which is tolerant of local feelings and traditions.  Many have also pressed that there should be a clear and visible incentive for anglers to contribute and this too is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>I am now in the process of finalising specific ideas taking account of these considerations. It would be wrong, however, to underestimate the difficulties of getting the various parties involved to come to agreement.  Considerable persuasion will have to be applied and there must be give and take on all sides.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns in this whole exercise has been to reduce the temperature, so to speak, and to avoid confrontational language or exchanges.  In this regard I would appeal to all sides of the House to avoid using this issue as a political football or pushing their case from a partisan perspective based on the outlook in their own particular constituencies.  The problem is much too serious for that and I hope that all Deputies will bear this in mind.</P>

Now, as Minister for the Marine, he has failed since taking office to have this matter resolved.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than 12 passengers to sea or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  Such vessels are required to hold a valid passenger certificate and are subject to annual surveys conducted by marine surveyors of my Department.  Random inspections are also carried out in order to ensure compliance with various rules and regulations relating to life-saving and fire appliances and other safety equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forty vessels now hold valid passenger certificates and steps have been taken to ensure that overloading does not occur on such vessels and that all vessels carrying more than 12 passengers hold valid certificates. First, regular publicity campaigns are launched in conjunction with the National Safety Council and in particular during the summer bank holiday weekends in order to warn the public of the dangers of travelling on board <Col N="556" /> unlicensed or overloaded passenger vessels. Secondly, increased liaison has been effected with local gardaí who now maintain an active presence at piers and at other passenger boarding points in order to ensure the carriage of the required safety equipment and to prevent overloading. Finally, reported cases of overloading are vigorously pursued.  In this year alone proceedings have been taken against the operators in 32 cases of reported overloading.</P>
    <P>Vessels which carry 12 passengers or less are outside the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts but may be licensed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts.  However, the token level of fines under these Acts and the absence of any statutory safety requirements in respect of such vessels has resulted in the legislation being less than effective.</P>
    <P>As Minister with overall responsibility for safety of life at sea, I am anxious to introduce new safety and certification requirements in respect of vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers.  I have, therefore, asked my officials to prepare the heads of a Bill which would bring the licensing and regulation of such vessels within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  With the assistance of this House, I would hope to have the legislation in place before the 1990 summer season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome what he said in relation to introducing legislation to bring operations with fewer than 12 passengers within the ambit of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  This is the area about which I am particularly concerned. As the Minister is aware a number of accidents have occurred around the coast, particularly this summer, and there are no adequate facilities available to either the Minister or the local authority to take sanctions against these operators. I would ask the Minister to ensure that all boats are included under this legislation. It is imperative that all sorts of sea transport is licensed, as is the case with all types of road transport.  That must be done because it is our only possibility <Col N="557" /> of closely monitoring what is happening. Too many lives have been lost.</P>
      <P>In relation to the existing licensed boats and spot checks that have been done, what is the nature of the defects found and what areas have not been complied with under the Acts in relation to this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Our checks cover a wide range, in particular to ensure that the operation is licensed, second, that the vessel is not overloaded and, third, that there is safety equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the present position in relation to damage done to Irish trawlers by submarines; the number of trawlers damaged since 1980; the number who received compensation; and the sanctions at EC level which he is seeking to protect our fishing community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On three occasions it has been established that submarines have been involved in incidents involving Irish-registered fishing vessels, that is the MFV <i>Sharelga</i> on 18 April 1982, the MFV <i>Oriel</i> on 8 March 1984, and the MFV <i>Carraig Buí</i> on 17 July 1989.</P>
      <P>Claims for compensation in respect of damage to fishing vessels caused by submarine activity are essentially a civil matter and the Government have no involvement.  However, in the case of incidents involving unidentified submarines, the Government take whatever action open to them to assist in identification, thus facilitating any action for damages that might be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following widespread concern at the danger posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines the Irish Authorities brought the matter to the attention of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) which is the London-based United Nations specialised agency <Col N="558" /> responsible for safety at sea.  A resolution was as a result passed by the IMO Assembly, and therefore accepted by European Community maritime states, in November 1987, recommending that if a submerged submarine were to become aware of the presence of a fishing vessel and its gear it should, as far as possible, keep out of the way of that fishing vessel and any gear connected to it unless the submarine were disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined three incidents, but there was a recent incident where a Skerries based trawler, the <i>Contestor P,</i> which is not an Irish registered boat, was involved.  The Government have lodged a complaint with the British authorities in regard to that incident.  Can the Minister say if compensation has been paid to the owners of the trawlers concerned? With regard to the Skerries based trawler what is the state of play in relation to the British authorities or is there a final outcome to this complaint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the second question first.  As the Deputy rightly states the <i>Contestor P</i> was not Irish registered. It was a UK registered boat.  The report is that on 12 September 1989 her nets had become entangled in some gear about 25 miles off Skerries.  The skipper reported that the vessel was being towed backwards by a submarine.  However, it recovered an object which was about 12 feet long and 6 feet wide and landed it at Skerries.  The object is believed to be a British communications buoy.  It was examined by the Naval Service and the owner of the vessel is now seeking compensation from the UK authorities for the damage done.  As the House knows, the Minister for Foreign Affairs took some action in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any reason to believe that submarines operating within the 12 mile limit do not comply with the rules governing their movement within these waters? Does the Minister have any reports that the submarines do not surface on all <Col N="559" /> occasions and fly their flags.  If he has had such reports has he any means of dealing with this through the Government process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean within the territorial waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence of submarines refusing to surface within the territorial waters.  The laws of the sea would apply in general in that area. However, I must say that I am not 100 per cent satisfied at present with the situation, particularly in the Irish Sea where it is known that submarines from four different countries use the Irish Sea continually.  My Department have got in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs to see if on a bilateral basis we could have some discussions apart altogether from the IMO initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm if there is any truth in the report that the British Navy is planning to build a nuclear submarine base in Swansea in Wales?  Reports have been circulating that that is happening.  If it happens there will be much more submarine activity around our southern coast and this could cause problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is enough activity by nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea and along the northern part of the country towards Scotland to cause concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any sanctions the EC can take in relation to this and have the Department or the Government made any special recommendation or appeals to the EC on the overall presence of submarines in Irish waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC automatically adopts the IMO, a United Nations organisation, resolutions.  The problem so far as my Department are concerned is that <Col N="560" /> the submarines belong to the Ministry of Defence of some one or other of the countries that operate in the Irish Sea so the question is really one of defence, which brings in several other problems, so far as the EC is concerned.  While the Community is an economic community, many of its members are members of NATO, but we are not.</P>

      <P>I found the NESC report a very interesting document which has great significance for our country and our economy.  It is obvious from the report that Ireland has not fully benefited from our 15 years' membership of the <Col N="597" /> EC.  Therefore, it is important that as many as possible of those in business read the report so as to be able to appreciate its great importance for the future of the economic and social life of this country.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to one specific comment in the report, that is, that there is a strong case for a Community role in the policies of direct income aids which are necessary for maintenance of a viable rural economy in many areas of the Community, including parts of Ireland.  It is recognised that many of our farmers have low incomes.  I do not think we have addressed this issue in the past.</P>
      <P>When one considers that the guidance fund during the period 1973-86 was only 5.5 per cent of the overall grants and subsidies to Ireland and that this guidance fund covers expenditure in different areas such as providing grants to improve the productivity and structure of farming, assisting investment in fish and fish processing industries and providing direct income support for disadvantaged areas, one can appreciate the low level of grants allocated to this specific sector.  There is a very small amount spent in providing direct income aid in the disadvantaged areas.  The Government have an excellent chance to address this situation in the near future by way of a further extension of the disadvantaged areas.  As the Minister is aware a lot of the survey work has now been completed and soon the Government will be making a submission to the EC.  One would hope that the details of the areas which will be included or excluded will be revealed prior to our submission.  This is an area which is of interest to us in County Limerick and indeed to many other areas of the country also.  I would encourage the Government to move swiftly in making their submission so that the direct income will be paid as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also encourage the Minister for Agriculture and Food to remove certain restrictive clauses such as the population statistic of 27 adults to a square kilometre and the rigid stocking level which are insisted on in the existing criteria.  The Government can give credibility to this document and assist farming by moving <Col N="598" /> swiftly and looking for a maximum extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on this specific area because I know it is pertient and very important.  Over the past year a lot of survey work has been done and at this stage farmers are looking very critically at what is happening.  A sense of mystery prevails in this area at this stage in relation to who is in, who is out, or whether we will qualify.  I would encourage the Minister &mdash; it is timely that it is the Minister for Agriculture and Food who is present &mdash; to move with great haste in order to remove this uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There were many other interesting areas in this document which I have read from cover to cover, but, unfortunately, due to time constraints I will not be able to dwell on these various issues.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Deputy on his maiden speech and to point out to him that the issues he referred to are the responsibility of the Council by way of Council regulation.  I am conscious of the constraints involved and hopefully, as in other areas, I will try to persuade 11 other Ministers from 11 other countries to change the regulation in relation to stocking rates and population criteria.  If that is not possible the regulation as it stands now will be very limiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that I welcome the opportunity to comment on the NESC report. This report represents a major stocktaking of our performance since we joined the European Community and outlines the challenges we will face in the coming years.  It can only be positive that the challenges, risks and strategic options are spelled out in this report &mdash; and that <Col N="599" /> they should be debated in the Dáil and as widely as possible outside the Dáil. The agenda which has been set out for 1992 and beyond represents such an important set of issues for our future that they need to have the backing of a well informed and committed public opinion if they are to gain full acceptance.</P>
    <P>My remarks on the NESC report will focus primarily on its comments on the agricultural and food industry and in particular on its references to the problems of low income farmers and the slow development of the food industry.  I welcome the detailed discussion in the report on the industry, even if there may be some of the report's conclusions about which I would be reserved or would have qualification.</P>
    <P>The report sets out in clear terms the performance of the agricultural and food processing industry since we joined the European Community in 1973.  It has been &mdash; and I think this is worth saying &mdash; a tale of a number of periods; the accession years which saw farm incomes per head double in real terms between 1970 and 1978; the sharp fall in farm fortunes between 1978 and 1981 due to the severe price/cost squeeze; the recovery in the years to 1984, followed by a sharp downturn again in 1985 and 1986; and finally, the last two years, 1987 and 1988 which have seen a remarkable recovery in farm incomes and I am confident that 1989 will also register a further increase on 1988 incomes.</P>
    <P>For the period as a whole, the report concludes that the performance in the agricultural and food sector was not as good as might have been expected and it outlines the reasons for this as it sees them.  I will deal with this judgment and the various factors which led NESC to arrive at it in a moment.  However, even if there have been some disappointing aspects in the way the CAP has developed over the years, there is no gainsaying the major contribution it has made to this country.  In the period from 1973 to 1986, total receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee and Guidance Funds <Col N="600" /> amounted to £5.5 billion, which represented 4.3 per cent of total GNP over the period.</P>
    <P>But these direct transfers are only part of the picture.  When account is taken of the higher prices at which trade in agricultural goods is possible by virtue of the CAP, the value of the CAP to the economy is much more substantial.  The NESC report shows that taking both FEOGA transfers and the trade transfers into account, the net value of CAP transfers over the 1979-86 period amounted to £6.1 billion or 6.1 per cent of GNP for this period.</P>
    <P>This is the starting point for any discussion about the CAP, the European Community and Irish agriculture.  Whatever disappointments, policy deficiencies or other criticisms can be made about the CAP, the scale of the resource transfer it has brought about has been of critical importance to this country's economic welfare since we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the main problems identified in the agricultural sector related to the persistence of low incomes for a large segment of Irish farmers and the slow rate of development of the food industry.  The problem of low income is correctly attributed to the structural problem within Irish farming &mdash; mainly due to the existence of a large number of small farms.  Many of these small farms are operating enterprises at low levels of intensity, which do not give very good returns.  In many cases, there is a further link to a disadvantaged demographic structure on the farm, in terms of the age and educational status of the farmer and the high proportion of the farmers who are unmarried.  This structural problem is a very real and major difficulty for the agricultural sector and there is little point in pretending that there are any easy answers to it.</P>
    <P>The NESC report contends that the lack of a socio-structural policy at Community or at national level is one of the reasons for the persistence of the structural problem.  The criticism is valid only up to a point.  It has taken a considerable time for Community structural policy to address itself to many of the problems <Col N="601" /> and the level of the Community funding for actions in the structural field has only been a fraction of its funding for the measures for price support which were funded 100 per cent.  Thus the signals being provided to national policy makers and to national Ministers for Finance were not necessarily helpful in moving to a greater concentration on structural policy.  But again, due to our success in the negotiations on the Structural Funds, we can look forward to a better and more balanced structural policy in the future.</P>
    <P>The increase in the size of the European Community Structural Funds and their co-ordinated action should help us to tackle some of the major economic and structural problems in agriculture and in the rural areas.  The single most serious structural problem in these areas is the lack of jobs.  The only solution to the problem is the provision of more jobs and income opportunities.  This can best come through an integrated form of development and through a diversification of the rural economy.  This has to be a major objective of Community and national policy.  As Deputies are aware, I anticipated the Community's move in this direction when I set up the pilot integrated rural development programme in 1988.  The NESC report states that we should be one of the leaders in the analysis and in the provision of solutions for our own and for Europe's rural regions. We are already fulfilling this role of leadership in that we were the first country to initiate a pilot programme for integrated rural development.  This is being supported by the Commission.  I am hopeful that its results can serve not only to assist us in the formulation of national policy, but can also feed into Community policy on rural development.  The maximum development of the productive base in rural areas naturally has to be our primary objective but, as the NESC report points out, more off-farm employment will not solve the income problems of some farmers.  This leads the report to advocate direct income aids.</P>
    <P>To date, direct income aids take the form of payments under the disadvantaged <Col N="602" /> areas scheme (mainly headage) and social security payments.  There has also been agreement at Community level that member states may introduce a direct income aids scheme for farmers. The terms and conditions of this scheme are currently being negotiated in Brussels. A decision as to the application of this scheme to Irish conditions cannot be made until we see the final outcome of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In terms of the areas of policy which are under domestic control, I am glad to see the acknowledgement in the NESC report of the progress made in the field of agricultural education and training. The fact that almost all young farmers entering the industry now receive this training through Teagasc's certificate in farming, and that grants are linked to this certificate, is a major step to addressing the problem of inadequately trained human resources in the sector.  As recently as eight years ago fewer than 20 per cent of those entering farming had this background qualification and there has been a dramatic change in recent years.  I would also have to point out that I have consistently followed the recommendation made in the 1986 NESC report, <i>Strategy for Development</i> that production opportunities and quotas should be directed towards low income farmers.</P>
    <P>I have from the beginning of my term of office been very concerned about the difficulties of producers with small scale quotas.  For that reason I secured agreement from the Council of Ministers in 1987, within months of joining that Council, to introduce a restructuring scheme giving special priority for the purchase of quotas, without land, to small scale producers.  I decided that the scheme here would, in fact, be restricted to producers with quotas under 50,000 gallons and of these the first priority category is confined to producers with less than 30,000 gallons.  I have also sought to help this category of producers by giving them priority under the scheme for temporary leasing of quotas introduced in 1988-89 and in that year I further amended the rules on flexi-milk in their favour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> Furthermore, I introduced in December 1987 a clawback system under which a percentage of quotas transferring with a lease of land will be retained in a national reserve, if the lessee's total quota exceeds 50,000 gallons.  This is designed partly to add quota to the national reserve for distribution to small scale and young farmers and, more importantly in the way the scheme works, to give smaller producers priority access to quotas becoming available for leasing with land.</P>
    <P>It was also as a result of a request made by me at the EC price fixing negotiations last spring that the Commission brought forward their proposals for the allocation of an additional 1 per cent in quotas to small scale producers and other farmers who were particularly hard hit by the quota system.  These proposals are currently being considered by the Council of Ministers.  I would hope we would conclude at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers in November.  I consider that within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations I have made every effort possible to assist these producers as recommended in the NESC report.</P>
    <P>The second main problem identified by the NESC relates to the slow progress of the food processing industry.  One thing needs to be said first on this question.  We are accused of having greatly over-used intervention as an outlet for our produce. This is simply not true.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 we have produced annually between 5 per cent and 6.5 per cent of the Community's manufacturing milk. Despite the fact that over two-thirds of what we produce is in excess of domestic consumption, our sales to intervention over that period amounted to less than 6 per cent of the Community's total.  The Netherlands, a surplus producer like ourselves, accounted for over 11 per cent of intervention and 13 per cent to 14 per cent of milk production.  The UK, a deficit producer, accounted for 12 per cent of intervention and had normally less than 10 per cent of the manufacturing milk pool.  In the case of butter intervention, the Netherlands and the UK <Col N="604" /> accounted for almost 15 per cent and over 13 per cent respectively.  Our share was 5.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is true that in regard to beef intervention we accounted for more than our relative share of production might be thought to justify.  In this decade we produced over 7 per cent of Community beef but accounted for 18 per cent of its intervention.  But we have, by a long way, the largest beef surplus in the Community, exporting a proportion of output nearly three times that of Denmark, the next most export-oriented country. France, with less than 120 per cent self-sufficiency, normally accounted for under one-quarter of production and almost one-third of total intervention.  In some years we have been close to 700 per cent self-sufficiency.  All of this suggests a greater ability to market successfully than we normally give ourselves credit for.</P>
    <P>It was the unlimited possibility of intervention rather than its excessive use which influenced our production pattern. The need &mdash; especially in the milk sector &mdash; to handle rapidly increased production concentrated in a highly seasonal way inevitably meant that processors manufactured bulk products for which there were, if it was necessary to avail of them, clear intervention outlets.  It was the combination of a rapid rise in production, a small domestic market and the availability of intervention which pushed the industry to concentrate on the safer bulk production.  This is in any event changing.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry has been moving gradually away from bulk commodities towards added value manufacture. This process would have happened to some extent in any event but has been given a substantial impetus by the changes which have taken place in Community support arrangements in recent years.  The introduction of milk quotas has highlighted the need to maximise the value of a limited milk pool.  The weakening of intervention mechanisms has removed the overwhelming incentive to concentrate on bulk products for which there are intervention outlets.  This is critical.  Intervention was originally <Col N="605" /> intended to be a safety net; it became an insurance policy.  It is now simply a safety net again.  This has important implications for the industry and how it approaches the years up to and after 1992.  It is also important to note that certain other EC policy measures which have hindered the development of food processing &mdash; especially the way in which the MCA system applied &mdash; have now been eliminated as a result, at least partly, of sustained Irish pressure.</P>
    <P>This greater emphasis on added value processing was, of course, given a further fillip by the Government's decision to bring agriculture and food together in one Department.  This meant that ultimately policy for all sections of the food chain are the responsibility of one Minister, assisted by a Minister of State with special responsibility for the food industry.  This is the type of integrated approach that the NESC report demands.  The pity is that this approach &mdash; followed by many of our Community partners &mdash; was not adopted earlier.  By taking this action the Government were indicating that they share the NESC disappointment at the slow pace of the development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>Of course in an integrated agriculture and food strategy increasing the rate of development depends also on the primary producer and the pattern of production he engages in.  For that reason I have given special emphasis to gearing production patterns to market realities. This has been particularly true in areas that had perhaps received less attention in the past, that is pigmeat and sheepmeat where a new vigour and confidence has now emerged.  Integrated breeding programmes in the pigmeat sector with producer and processor involvement, the code of practice in the sheepmeat sector from the producer to the end of the chain all encourage consistency and quality based on consumer requirements.  Agricultural production must now be geared towards the consumer as a main priority.</P>
    <P>The increased emphasis given by the Government to the food industry since 1987, as well as the reaction within the industry itself, provides considerable <Col N="606" /> ground for hope.  The NESC report points out the importance of developing those industries with &ldquo;a genuine, sustainable and renewable competitive advantage&rdquo;.  A key to gaining this competitive advantage is through innovation in our food industry, greater application of science and technology and better marketing and distribution.  In an increasingly environmentally conscious world, our green image is also a vital part of this potential competitive advantage.  The importance of pressing home our advantage in the agri-food sector was further highlighted in a report produced this week by Teagasc, which showed that in 1988 the agri-food industry contributed 42 per cent of foreign exchange earnings from exporting.  That is an enormous and unique figure, which was arrived at having made the necessary adjustments for import content and profit repatriation for the agri-food industry and for other exporting industry.  It also showed that each £100 in additional export earnings in the agri-food sector was worth a net £90 to the economy whereas for manufacturing industry the corresponding net figure was £28.</P>
    <P>The need to focus on innovation in our food industry and our industry generally is one of the crucial messages which emerge from the NESC report.  It is vital that the whole of our natural resource based industries is adequately underpinned by the type of scientific and technological development which will be vital if they are to remain competitive in the future.  The same comment applies to our efforts at regional and rural development. We must be fully aware of, and use to the maximum effect, the various programmes for scientific and technological development which the Community has been promoting in recent years.  Furthermore &mdash; and this is where leadership in policy analysis must play its part &mdash; we must be willing to encourage the Community to invest in forward looking programmes which are of particular relevance to the regions of Europe &mdash; programmes such as the forthcoming STRIDE programme, Science and Technology for Rural Innovation and <Col N="607" /> Development in Europe.  I will be advocating that the agri-food and natural resource based sectors will receive due attention within this and other such programmes.</P>
    <P>I have reacted to the major comments made about the agri-food industry in the NESC report.  It concludes its discussion on Irish agriculture by emphasising the need for long-term national policies &ldquo;concerning the role of agriculture in the overall development of the economy, and the need for national policies to achieve agricultural objectives which were not addressed by the CAP&rdquo;.  We are all very much aware of the scale of change which has occurred in the CAP and in the agri-food industry in recent years.  Further major changes are ahead.  The outcome of the current GATT round will shape the trading and policy environment for the nineties.  Thus, the need for a fresh look at the type of policies which we advocate in EC and GATT fora, as well as that policy which remains exclusively our domestic concern, is obvious.</P>
    <P>In order to meet this need, I intend to establish within my Department a small group of senior officials who will have the task to carry out this review.  They will consult with other Departments and with the major interested parties outside the Department.  In addition to receiving the views of the main farming and agricultural organisations on matters of particular concern, I would expect this group to draw upon the expertise of the resources in our institutes and universities to examine particular policies.  I have chosen this path to conduct this policy review as I think it is the most expeditious way to arrive at a conclusion. I would expect to obtain the group's report in the first half of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the European Community is being conducted in a dishonest and misleading fashion.  The reasons for this are obvious.  If the implications over Ireland's EC membership, and the problems associated with European integration, were seriously addressed, they would undermine the <Col N="608" /> fundamental principles of the right wing parties here.  Rather than face that, underlying realities are ignored and what we get instead are aspirations and vagueness, unsubstantiated optimism and intellectual dishonesty.  Concepts like convergence and regional strategy are thrown about, but for fear of their political implications many are loathe to put any flesh on them.</P>
      <P>The NESC Report, <i>Ireland in the European Community,</i> could have been an important instrument in challenging this dishonesty.  In many respects it succeeds. However, by its own criteria it fails to make any contribution towards confronting the underlying obstacles to convergence and regionalisation, on which it puts so much emphasis.  It fails to draw the logical conclusions from its own well informed and well argued analysis.  It succumbs to a defeatist policy for future EC strategy.  Because of this it unintentionally contributes to the dishonesty of the EC debate.  The report becomes one more obstacle to clear thinking and courageous action.</P>
      <P>Let us first acknowledge the enormous service the report has done.  It has laid to rest a number of important myths surrounding European integration.  The first myth is that completion of the Single Market will reduce national and regional disparities in the EC and help weaker economies catch up with stronger ones. The second myth is that integration will assist new and emerging industries, especially in the weaker regions, to break into larger markets.  The third myth is that the Single Market will facilitate the pooling of economic assets such as investment, information and corporate skills. One by one, the NESC report challenges these myths.  Its own words are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After consideration of all the arguments our general conclusion must be that the long run benefits of market completion are likely to be unevenly distributed &mdash; with the greatest benefits accruing to regions in which industries with economies of scale and highly innovative sectors are most prevalent. <Col N="609" /> Ireland is not such a region.  Consequently, completion of the internal market should not be expected to narrow the income disparities between regions in the EC, let alone bring about convergence.  This is the fundamental conclusion which informs the rest of the report. </P>
    <P>The NESC report shows that not only will the completion of the Single Market fail to end regional and economic inequalities, it will, in fact, concentrate economic assets and skills in the richer economies of Europe, leaving the poorer nations and regions in greater poverty.</P>
    <P>The Single Market will deprive poorer regions of the ability to break into new markets.  It will deprive them of the ability to acquire new skills in research and development, marketing, distribution, innovations and product differentiation through the operation of economies of scale.  The emerging economies of scale will concentrate these factors in a few regions and firms, which, in turn, will provide a greater profit advantage over competitors in weaker regions, which, in turn, will reinforce the economies of scale and so on in a spiral leading to greater concentration of wealth and power.</P>
    <P>In short, integration and the Single Market will give full licence for market forces which are concentrating wealth, skills and information technology in richer economies, leaving poorer ones to pick up the scraps.</P>
    <P>This is not idle conjecture.  The NESC report accurately describes Ireland's performance in the EC.  We have the second highest unemployment rate and one of the worst gross domestic product figures in the Community.  Our position, in terms of wealth has not changed since 1973. Our growth rate has declined in comparison to the EC average and smaller European economies.  Since 1980 we have the worst record of any country in the important categories of gross domestic product growth, private consumption, and investment.  In a word, our performance has been disastrous.</P>
    <P>We cannot lay all the blame on our membership of the EC.  Policies pursued <Col N="610" /> by consecutive right wing Governments have completely undermined our ability to compete effectively in the international marketplace, and would have done so despite membership of the EC. Our failure to pursue policies to create a strong native industrial base, our blind reliance on multinational intervention, neglect of our physical infrastructure, combined with the failures to overcome our structural defects in agriculture, have all meant that Irish industry and agriculture are ill-equipped to compete effectively in post-1992 Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention another feature that the report refers to indirectly and that is the role of corporate and multinational interests.  The reinforcement of regional inequality cannot be separated from the changing nature of international and European corporate activity.</P>
    <P>There used to be a time that corporate growth meant new factories, new offices, new lines of production and more employment and wealth.  That type of activity is changing.  Corporate growth is characterised more and more by acquisitions, mergers and take-overs.  An increasing amount of scarce resources are being tied up in financing this type of activity, an activity which does not produce one extra product or service, does not employ one extra worker, which does not increase by one pound or franc the total amount of wealth to society.  It is an economic cannibalism practised by corporations which are trying to gain a competitive advantage in anticipation of 1992.  It is this type of activity, accumulating vast sums of corporate debt, that has precipitated the recent destabilisation of the international stock markets. The result of this activity is to concentrate financial resources, skills and information into the hands of fewer corporate entities.  This, in turn, fuels the regional and economic inequalities in the European economy.</P>
    <P>After all this, after describing the operation of the Single Market and the history of Ireland's economic performance, after concluding that the Single Market and economic integration will not bring about <Col N="611" /> convergence but actually reinforce economic inequality, the NESC report turns its back on its own analysis.  Instead of attacking the underlying forces behind the economic concentration of power and resources inherent in the Single Market, it throws up its hands and puts forward proposals which not only ignore the very issues it raises, but confines Irish options to damage limitation.  This is done through the recommendation for an economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union, as advanced by the NESC, will not create the structural basis for convergence.  It will not halt market tendencies towards concentration and centralisation.  It will not provide access for weaker economies and regions to the decision making process that determines enterprise location, investment, and research and design functions.  It will not make corporate and multi-national activity more accountable to democratic institutions.  It will do none of these things that might lay the basis for real economic and social convergence in the EC.  And yet, these are the very issues which the NESC report highlights as the fundamental problems confronting Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fundamental rationale behind its proposals for an economic and monetary union are not that it would confront the economic forces of inequality and regional disparity.  Instead, the NESC report seemingly accepts this as inevitable. The proposals for an economic and monetary union are advanced as the only way we can claw back some of the wealth that other nations will be creating.  It proposes to establish a re-distributive mechanism through an enhanced Community budget, capable of pursuing and financing public expenditure programmes in the areas of health, education, and pensions.  In other words, we give up on the fight for convergence and argue for money.  Again we present our begging bowl.</P>
    <P>The NESC's reasons for advancing economic and monetary union are welfarist in nature.  It is nonsense to suggest that a Community budget, pursuing <Col N="612" /> social expenditure programmes, can somehow bring about convergence.  We only have to look at our own country to see this is not so.  Otherwise, we would not have the disparities between Ballymun and Foxrock.  The Single Market will reinforce economic inequalities in the peripheral nations.  An economic and monetary union is about spreading someone else's wealth, not creating our own.  It is not about exercising power in the EC to create the conditions for real equality and participation.  That the NESC report tries to dress up its recommendation as a strategy for convergence is misleading and is directly contradicted by its own analysis.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the desirability of an economic and monetary union and a Community budget &mdash; certainly there is much to commend a more interventionist role in enhancing the social conditions within the EC &mdash; the NESC's proposals mark the end of convergence as a concrete strategy for Irish policy.</P>
    <P>This is the politics of defeat.  Under these recommendations Ireland's dependence on free market mechanisms and subservience to the political power arising from those mechanisms becomes complete.  Instead of proposing strategies to undermine the economic concentration of power and restore the primacy of convergence and real regional control as our main political priority, we are asked to opt for a strategy merely content to mitigate the worst aspects of an inevitable concentration of economic power.</P>
    <P>There may be sound reasons for economic and monetary union, but the NESC's reasons are fatalistic and defeatist. What Ireland needs is a strategy to confront economic concentration, and provide a real basis for economic participation in the EC, to establish a democratic framework of accountability over European market forces and create Community institutions which involve a real devolution of economic power to the regions.</P>
    <P>No blueprint for convergence exists, but ironically the analytical content of the NESC report provides the basis for <Col N="613" /> future action.  Let us take the agricultural sector.  The NESC has identified four key issues.</P>
    <P>First, the CAP has failed to address the issue of low farm incomes.  In fact it exacerbates regional inequalities through the distribution of price support mechanisms. Seventy five per cent of CAP subsidies go to 25 per cent of the top farmers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the lack of a land policy effectively means that the fundamental problems confronting land structure &mdash; farm size and fragmentation, age, education, under-utilisation and land neglect &mdash; are not confronted.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, seasonality of supply &mdash; arising out of the operation of the CAP, out of date practices by traditional farming, and lack of investment in farm modernisation &mdash; continues to inhibit the development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the massive concentration of the food industry on a global scale means that our food sector is ripe for multinational takeovers and buy-outs.  Ireland will be reduced to being a supplier of raw material to non-Irish processers, who will then export the wealth out of the economy.</P>
    <P>Any future agricultural strategy must address these issues on the national level. We need a strong land authority and land policy to intervene in the land market to ensure the twin goals of maximum productivity from the land and the largest number of people working on the land. We need to campaign for Community policies that will re-direct CAP subsidies away from ranchers and large farmers and into direct income and structural support for progressive family farms.  We must also ensure that we do not end up with the situation that subsidies to Irish agriculture are reduced in exchange for a temporary increase in regional funds which will melt away once the Single Market has been fully established.</P>
    <P>We need substantial investment in farm technology and modernisation, as well as education and advisory services to overcome the problems of seasonality. We need to establish a strong public enterprise presence in the food industry, <Col N="614" /> through new enterprise developments, expansion of the Irish Sugar Company, and joint ventures with Irish private firms.  This would safeguard the ability of the Irish economy to retain the wealth created through exploitation of our native resources.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the steps we can take at the national level to ensure that our agriculture sector and food industry can survive European integration.  At the Community level economic and monetary union is not and should not be the priority in EC policy.  The immediate priority is to establish a real strategy for convergence and regional control.</P>
    <P>First, Ireland should propose the establishment of a democratic planning framework at the regional level.  This would allow weaker economies to supervise corporate activity and ensure that the distribution of enterprise location, investment, research and design functions, marketing and distribution is done in everyone's interest, and not just in the interest of a few shareholders and directors.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the tax treatment of companies must be harmonised to end the debilitating competition, usually among the weaker economies, over tax relief incentives.  A minimum 15 per cent tax on all corporate profits throughout Europe would limit the ability of multi-nationals to manipulate and play off one country against another.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a significant portion of the investment portfolios of financial institutions &mdash; banks, building societies, insurance companies and pensions funds &mdash; should be directed into an industrial investment bank which could then be redistributed at low interest to new economic projects in weaker economies.</P>
    <P>Fourth, if economic and social cohesion is to have any meaning then a massive transfer of wealth should be effected from the richer to the poorer nations-regions.  I would propose that I per cent of the gross domestic product of all nations should be levied by the Community and redistributed to weaker economies to supplement industrial, infrastructure and labour policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Lastly, the Social Charter must be implemented.  Workers' access to corporate information, participation in management decisions, protection for part-time workers, must become a reality if the principles of equality and participation are to override the market imperatives of European integration.</P>
    <P>These proposals do not constitute a total solution to the problems of inequality, but they would begin to counter the concentration of power and resources into the richer nations, and bring economic decisions under some political, democratic accountability.  The issue of convergence must take priority over proposals for economic and monetary union.  Indeed, advance on economic and monetary union must be conditional on the implementation of a profound structural reform that can create convergence and cohesion.  It is only through radical structural reform that we can begin to address the issues raised by the NESC report, but subsequently abandoned in their welfarist proposals for an economic and monetary union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this very valuable and timely report from the NESC and on the subject with which it deals, I want to address three issues: (1) the effects of the completion of the internal market on Irish business and on our economy and the Government's efforts to promote the necessary preparation for the single market; (2) the strategic approach that guides the Government's approach to the common policies of the Community, to Ireland's place in it and to its future development; and (3) arrangements for the co-ordination of Ireland's position and policy in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, let me first note that the report under discussion responds to the specific terms of reference set by the Government in areas which are germane to the NESC's general remit.  As such it does not deal with wider political, institutional or cultural aspects of Community membership.  This does not mean that <Col N="616" /> the Government lack interest in these domains.  On the contrary, they are of intense interest to us &mdash; and many of them are closely related to aspects dealt with in the NESC report.  Indeed, a nation's approach to these domains must be informed by its concrete economic and social interests and concerns &mdash; not exclusively but certainly substantially. The NESC, in line with their functions and the request submitted to them, have concentrated on a range of issues in the economic and social sphere.  I shall largely do the same and while my remarks on the future shape and nature of the Community may beg institutional and political questions, I shall not be able to deal with these today and indeed it would probably be somewhat premature to attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government launched their EUROPEN Campaign to promote both awareness of the Community's programme to create a single market by 31 December 1992 and, of course, the preparation necessary to seize the opportunities and to minimise the risks posed by what is a major change in the economic environment, especially when account is taken of the changes in business behaviour to which it has led internationally. The campaign started with an initial phase of Ministerial speeches, seminars, advertising and information leaflets on the various parts of the single market programme and other initiatives focused on sensitising economic operators to the importance and major implications of 1992 and to the need to take full account of it in their business planning.  This aspect of the campaign was deliberately front-loaded.</P>
    <P>This year saw a change of direction in the campaign, with the emphasis more on the necessary preparation at sector and firm levels.  This is, of course, primarily a task for economic operators themselves but the Government have sought to assist the process in every way possible and appropriate.  This is being done primarily through the particular Departments and State bodies responsible for the various sectors and functional aspects, such as standards, export <Col N="617" /> and domestic marketing and so on.  These are working with industry and sectoral bodies and with individual firms on planning for new conditions already taking shape.</P>
    <P>At the central level, we have sustained the flow of information on the adoption of directives and on other significant developments affecting the internal market, through the publication, in co-operation with the Irish Business Bureau in Brussels, of a monthly <i>Europen News in Business and Finance and Irish Business</i> magazines, thus reaching up to 21,000 people concerned with business. This is a cost effective method of sustaining awareness and conveying information to the business community and the feedback, both to the Irish Business Bureau and to the European Bureau in the Department has been positive.  The other central activities have aimed to give support to the work of preparation at sectoral and firm levels.</P>
    <P>The main initiative here has been a series of sectoral studies, now almost ready for publication.  It had emerged from discussions with a number of Departments, sectoral organisations and representative groups that there was a need for studies that would examine in some depth the implications of the single European market for certain sectors likely to be significantly affected.  It was agreed that such sectoral analyses should examine the scope of Community legislation on the single market for the sector concerned and assess how this will impact upon it having regard to the markets on which it is dependent and its competitive position.  The results, it was felt, would be useful for strategic planning at the level of individual firms but would also be of value in such areas as training and industrial and sectoral support and development programmes.</P>
    <P>In proceeding with the studies it was recognised that the responsibility for responding to change and the implications of the single market ultimately rests with the sectors and industrial firms concerned.  Nevertheless, it was accepted that, very probably, such analyses would not always be made and was certainly <Col N="618" /> beyond the scope of many individual firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.  It was, therefore, felt appropriate that the Europen campaign should assist in providing targeted information on what impact the Community's programme will have on particular sectors. The aim was not, however, to obtain very detailed studies but rather to have the issues brought to attention without undue delay in a medium degree of detail with the purpose of alerting firms in the various sectors to the issues of greatest concern to themselves.</P>
    <P>Studies have been undertaken for ten important sectors of industry or the economy at large.  The authors are distinguished economists with an extensive knowledge of the sectors and issues concerned. The ten sectors selected are the food processing industry; electronic, electrical and instrument engineering; metals and mechanical engineering; distribution; textiles/clothing/footwear; transport; tourism; chemicals/pharmaceuticals/healthcare; financial services; and construction industry.</P>
    <P>Drafts of most of the studies have been received and discussed with the consultants and it is intended to publish them progressively over the final two months of this year.  I do not wish unduly to preempt the studies and the position and assessment is, of course, different for each sector but on balance, there seems to be a certain degree of cautious optimism about the impact of the single market on Irish industry.  The authors of the studies also point to the importance for firms to be conscious of the indirect effects of the internal market on their operations.  Economies of scale, the need to keep abreast of technical and structural changes in their respective industries are of equal importance in assessing the impact of the single market on their firms.</P>
    <P>Most of the authors of the sectoral studies stress the importance of informed and well-planned preparation in order to take full advantage of the opportunities of the single market.  The studies also recognise that, because the economy has <Col N="619" /> been open and because we have scarcely any non-tariff barriers in operation in our domestic market, a large part of Irish industry has already had to adapt to maintain its competitive position.  Considerable emphasis is placed on the overriding need for management to keep abreast of technical and structural changes in whatever industry it is involved in, and to monitor the evolving needs to their customers in particular.</P>
    <P>This ties in with the conclusion reached by the NESC in their very valuable analysis of the effects of the single market on various sectors of the economy.  They concluded &mdash; and this also comes out, as I have indicated, from the Europen sectoral studies &mdash; that the direction and size of the direct and indirect effect of market completion depend on very specific characteristics of industries, products and firms.  The NESC assessment, again in agreement with the Europen studies, is that the direct effects of the specific single market measures are likely to be positive for most, but not all, parts of manufacturing industry in Ireland.  They say &mdash; and I believe that this is of tremendous importance &mdash; that the indirect effects will be more substantial than the direct effects.  We are already seeing these effects in the marked intensification of merger and take-over activity, especially across national frontiers, in the Community, a process from which, as we have seen, Ireland is by no means immune.  This is but the more visible evidence of an entire process of industry and market restructuring to adapt to the new dimension of the single market which, of course, is also making economic a whole new wave of technical innovation.</P>
    <P>The NESC note that these indirect effects can, in certain circumstances, pose threats wherever manufacturing in Ireland is vulnerable to competition based on scale economies or to intensified competition based on innovation. They conclude that the net effect on manufacturing in Ireland will depend on the success with which the beneficial direct effects are turned into dynamic <Col N="620" /> gains based on new or enhanced competitive advantages.  The Council make specific recommendations, including action to make scale an even more important focus of industrial policy, to inject an innovation orientation into that policy and to upgrade management development. These are matters with which other Ministers will be dealing but it is worth underlining the NESC point that even where economies of scale are not significant, the strategy of being more innovative than larger competitors, while viable, is highly demanding.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I refer here to the third main initiative taken centrally under the Europen campaign this year.  This was a major survey carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys in May-June last, based on a representative sample of 414 telephone interviews with chief executives and senior managers in manufacturing and service companies and the professional services.  The respondents came from wholly-owned Irish companies as well as subsidiaries of foreign and multinational companies and results were computed for eight broad sectors, a number of which coincide with those now the subject of sectoral studies.  The results, which were made public at the time, showed that the Europen campaign had achieved satisfactory penetration in raising awareness of the single market.</P>
    <P>They also showed a significant but still insufficient improvement in respect of planning and preparation for the single market as compared with an earlier survey for the Marketing Institute of Ireland in October 1988, when the Government campaign was only getting into its intensive phase.  In the more recent survey, 15 per cent of companies had already carried out a formal assessment of the implications of the single market for their company and 28 per cent said they were planning to do so. Together these amounted to 43 per cent of respondents.  This contrasted with the finding the previous October that over three-quarters of firms were making no attempt to assess the implications for them.</P>
    <P>As I say, even the more recent figures <Col N="621" /> fall short of what is needed.  Moreover wholly owned Irish firms produced a low figure &mdash; 35 per cent, in contrast to the 59 per cent of multinational firms.  This worrying contrast also emerged in response to a question as to whether someone within the company had been given specific responsibiluty for evaluating and co-ordinating the company's response to the single market programme. Of all firms interviewed, 30 per cent had done so but this dropped to 19 per cent among Irish-owned firms and was highest among multinational firms &mdash; 56 per cent.  While I was happy to note the improvements effected by the Europen campaign, the results are far from affording any grounds for complacency.  Even when one allows for the relatively small extent to which many firms will be affected, it is clear that a major task of preparation remains for Irish business and for the Government agencies assisting it.</P>
    <P>The survey also yielded responses to such other questions as what type of market situations firms perceived themselves as being in, the kind of strategies they had adopted or intended in order to ensure that their business can obtain the best results from the single market, their competence in Community languages and what kinds of information and advice the Government should be providing. The results have been supplied to the various public agencies and industry bodies as an aid in planning their programmes. The most frequently cited need was for more specific information for different industries and sectors and, as I have outlined, the Europen campaign is responding to this.</P>
    <P>The work undertaken under the aegis of the Europen campaign serves to reinforce the message emerging from the NESC report &mdash; that the single market calls for a substantial and well thought out response here in Ireland from the corporate sector and in terms of public policy.  The Taoiseach has broadly sketched the Government's response while other Ministers, who are speaking over these two days, will deal with issues falling within their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> NESC is a little unkind in the implication that the policy of successive Governments towards the Community and its development has lacked a common guiding thread.  I would suggest that on the general thrust and spirit of Irish policy, there has been a consistent thread that I would characterise as &ldquo;communautaire&rdquo; or &ldquo;conditionally intergrationist&rdquo;. Put more directly, we have been supportive of progressively closer integration within the Community provided it is on a basis that ensures that the benefits of integration will be fairly shared and will extend to all regions of the Community.  This is, of course, the strategic approach recommended by NESC and as indicated in the statement issued on the publication of the report, the Government agree with this.  We had no difficulty doing so, precisely because this has been our strategic approach.  That approach has guided our attitude to the completion to the internal market, to the elaboration to its social dimension, to development of the Community's environmental and research and development policies, to its response to the concerns of the EFTA countries and to the economic needs of Poland and Hungary. Our approach is, as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, one of the fullest participation by Ireland in every facet of Community activity. Ireland will not be a barrier to further integration in the Community but we insist that it be a Community that cherishes all its citizens equally and that fully discharges the Treaty obligations to promote the achievement of greater economic and social cohesion by reducing regional disparities.  We want no two speed or two tier process in Community integration.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the Treaty obligations on economic and social cohesion.  Over the past two years, attention has concentrated overwhelmingly, both in Ireland and at Community level, on the doubling and reform of the Structural Funds.  There may be a certain tendency in the Community to think that this disposes of responsibilities in regard to cohesion, but, of course, as the Taoiseach <Col N="623" /> has recalled, there is also an obligation, under Article 130B of the Treaty, inserted by the Single European Act, to take account of the cohesion dimension in the implementation of the other common policies and of the internal market.  There has been some trend in recent years towards the differentation of common policies to cater for particular features of the less developed member states but we are far from seeing a fully purposeful and systematic application of Article 130B. We need this at the stage when the Commission is formulating proposals for Community policies.  This is a subject we have been studying and which we will be pursuing with the Commission and with other member states.</P>
    <P>The NESC report has brought out that it would be wrong to expect that the play of market forces will, left to itself, bring about regional convergence.  They underline the need for stronger measures of positive integration in the Community. They also emphasise that the social dimension of the internal market is an important aspect of this positive integration. It seems to me that if we are for economic and social cohesion, we have to be for a worthwhile and balanced social dimension.  Ireland fully suported the conclusions of the European Council meetings in Rhodes and Madrid which put the matter well, saying that, respectively,</P>
    <P>Completion of the Single Market cannot be regarded as an end in itself; it pursues a much wider objective, namely to ensure the maximum wellbeing of all, in line with the tradition of social progress which is part of Europe's history.  This tradition of social progress should be a guarantee that all citizens, whatever their occupation, will have effective access to the direct benefits expected from the Single Market as a factor of economic growth and as the most effective means of combating unemployment </P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> in the construction of the Single European Market, social aspects should be given the same importance as economic aspects and should accordingly be developed in a balanced fashion. </P>
    <P>In discussions with our French friends, we have indicated that we support the broad thrust of their Presidency programme in this area.  Too often, the social dimension is spoken of as if it were liability, purely a factor increasing costs.  I believe that it is more productive to look upon it as an investment in human resources, in social harmony, both basic conditions for successful economic policies and development.  We share this French approach of accentuating the positive, while not overlooking possible problems.  For us, the social priority is employment.  We have stressed this crucial aspect in the past and will continue to do so.  We welcome the French proposal to initiate regular ministerial discussions on the subject and, as the succeeding Presidency, will certainly support continuation of this useful initiative. But much more is required and this brings us back to the role and responsibility of the Community in the future, the need for greater positive integration and the whole question of assignment of policy functions, all of them matters dealt with persuasively by the NESC in their analysis of the requirements for stable integration and, specifically, for a stable and durable economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>There have been a lot of references in recent Community discussion to the principle of subsidiarity, according to which, as defined in the report of the Delors Committee on Economic and Monetary Union, the functions of higher levels of Government should be as limited as possible and should be subsidiary to those lower levels.  That report said that adherence to this principle would be an essential element in defining the appropriate balance of powers within the Community in an economic and monetary union.  As specifically noted by the NESC the Delors Committee report says:</P>
    <P>Thus, the attribution of competence to the Community would have to be <Col N="625" /> confined specifically to those areas in which collective decision making was necessary.  All policy functions which could be carried out at national (and regional and local) levels without adverse repercussions on the cohesion and functioning of the economic and monetary union would remain within the competence of the member countries. </P>
    <P>As the NESC report says, Ireland need have no difficulty with this as a principle. We certainly do not support any excessive centralisation of powers or functions in the Community.  We espouse a Community in which, as President Delors said in his speech in Bruges last week, diversity and pluralism are upheld.  We agree with him that integration in Europe, a Community of ancient nations, has to be a <i>sui generis</i> process.  We agree with the Commission President that we should add to Jean Monnet's aim of uniting peoples, the parallel aim of bringing together the nations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach specifically supported the invocation of the principle of subsidiarity in the conclusions of the Madrid European Council on the social dimension of the internal market but, as the NESC rightly point out, the issue is the application of the principle.  It would appear from other references in President Delors' speech and, indeed, from the report of the Delors Committee, that there is a tendency to apply the principle so as unduly to restrict the areas in which the Community and its institutions would have competence and responsibility.  It is to be welcomed that the President now sees a Community budget rising to 5 per cent of Community GDP but other references appear to leave to the exclusive competence and responsibility of the member states a number of policy areas where we would feel, with the NESC, that the Community should have a parallel involvement.</P>
    <P>The NESC report rightly points out that there are economies of scale, externalities and spillovers attaching to the provision of certain public activities which provide reasons for the fact that <Col N="626" /> these activities might be assigned to a higher level of government.  Examples might be, respectively, air traffic control, environmental regulation and education provision.  They note that an additional criterion is political homogeneity or the feeling of belonging to the same political grouping and sharing the same interests and destiny.  It would be foolish to suggest that the commonality of identity and interests between people from different member states is yet anywhere as strong as that which exists among the peoples of the individual member states, but I note that, again in his Bruges speech, President Delors looked to every European having the feeling of belonging to a Community which would, in some sense, be his or her second motherland.</P>
    <P>I share this vision but if it is to happen, it will be necessary that the Community, as I have said, cherish each of its citizens equally.  Certainly, the member states have, as also recognised in Article 130 B of the Treaty, their own responsibilites for their development and for the welfare of their citizens but, with increasing integration, it will also be necessary to give fuller practical expression to the Community's obligations under that Article. Here it is relevant to recall that, as NESC point out, the theory of fiscal federalism strongly suggests that the redistribution and stabilisation functions should be carried out at the highest level.</P>
    <P>They reminded us that in their report, commissioned by President Delors himself, the Padoa-Schioppa Group expressed the view that &ldquo;greater Community involvement in stabilisation and redistribution policies is the indispensable complement of the ambitious project of complementing the internal market&rdquo;.  It might be felt that in current circumstances it would be unrealistic to envisage that the Community should exercise these functions.  The situation should be different in an economic and monetary union but, even there, it is scarcely realistic or even perhaps desirable, to contemplate the Community exercising exclusive responsibility in such areas as social security or regional policy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned fiscal federalism a <Col N="627" /> moment ago and in his Bruges speech President Delors spoke of the merits of the federal approach to the further development of the Community.  If we look at models such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the United States, we see that a prominent feature of such federal unions is the concurrent exercise of competences in various fields. I do not necessarily suggest that the future Community has to be a federation or that we should slavishly follow any particular federal model but there is nothing, I suggest, against taking from them the elements that are appropriate to the Community's unique circumstances. One can imagine a situation in which major parts of the responsibility for decision making in regard to such areas as educational provision or unemployment compensation remain with the member states but, where this is paralleled by an active Community role in ensuring minimum standards of provision and welfare, including through financial support in areas such as these, which go beyond the boundaries of what is covered by the Structural Funds at present.</P>
    <P>This implies a larger Community budget.  Whether 5 per cent of Community GDP is enough is perhaps a question for another day.  The important point of principle is that the NESC are right that application of the Delors Committee's own criterion in regard to the cohesion and functioning of an EMU suggests that the Community will need to exercise a competence, concurrent with the continuing competence of the member states, in a wider and deeper range of policy areas than is, apparently, being contemplated in certain quarters. By reference to Articles 130 A and 130 B of the Treaty, the effectiveness of the functioning of the EMU must be judged by, <i>inter alia</i>, the effect on economic and social cohesion; and if real convergence of the different economies is retarded rather than advanced by EMU, the cohesion and stability of the union will, sooner or later, be adversely affected. The Community must have the policy competences and financial resources <Col N="628" /> required in order effectively to promote such convergence.</P>
    <P>Some commentators on the NESC report have picked up its own comments on the question of the degree of political homogeneity needed before there can be agreement to assign policy functions to the Community level and especially to expand Community budgetary support into fresh fields, extending beyond those concerned with structural development of the component economies.  These commentators have suggested that this degree of political homogeneity is unlikely to emerge in the Community in the near future and that consequently the NESC analysis and prescriptions on European integration provide little basis for practical policy purposes.  It is certainly well that we should be under no illusions as to the extent of the task of persuasion that lies before us but as the NESC itself points out, the degree of political homogeneity changes and develops over time and, as experience shows, sometimes in discrete leaps.  This is certainly borne out by the experience of recent years.</P>
    <P>I disagree with NESC that Irish Governments have tended to see cohesion as a purely economic phenomenon. I come back here to what I said earlier about our embracing a consistently communautaire thrust in our broad strategic approach.  This is exemplified by our generally positive approach to fresh steps in integration such as the EMS and the Single European Act, which had much more than an economic significance, in our understanding for the concerns and interests of other member states &mdash; whether it is Iberian accession or German concerns about developments in Eastern and Central Europe &mdash; in our constructive participation in European political co-operation and in our respect for Community law which provides an essential underpinning for Community legitimacy.</P>
    <P>In the light of the unprecedented changes occurring all around us, particularly in Eastern Europe, we should not be too pessimistic about the prospects for further significant steps forward in the readiness of Europeans to identify with <Col N="629" /> and accept an enhanced role for a Community that is so clearly a factor for progress in the world and is on the move. There is no future in trying to hold back the tide or in standing aside from a process that has such momentum.  Even if our ambitions in regard to the assignment of policy competences or the strengthening of the Community budget are less than fully realised, the strategic approach I have outlined will provide the best political context for making the maximum achievable progress at any particular time, thus providing successive staging points from which we can aim at further progress.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to our respect for Community law.  A Commission communication of 7 September expressed concern that only seven of the legal Acts adopted up to now with a view to creating the single market had been given legal effect in all twelve member states.  After referring to those member states with the greatest backlog, the Commission referred to &ldquo;the smaller but equally worrying backlog on the part of Greece, Italy, Belgium and Ireland&rdquo;.  As I pointed out earlier this month, this comment is not supported by the correct data for Ireland.  The Commission indicated that Ireland had, on the reference date in question, implemented 46 of the directives studied for which the implementation date had passed.  In fact, at that time, Ireland had implemented 51.  Out of the 63 studied, two are not applicable to Ireland.  Thus Ireland had implemented 51 out of 61 directives applicable to it &mdash; 83.6 per cent.  On this criterion of percentage of applicable directives implemented in national legislation, this record was second to France and ahead of the UK and Denmark, two member states often singled out as particularly conscientious in transposing Community law into national law.</P>
    <P>We are in arrears on only ten directives. This is due to the accelerated pace of decisions by the Council, combined with reductions in the public service.  In the face of these factors, we need to take specific steps to maintain and even further improve on a record that is <Col N="630" /> already good and, under the aegis of the co-ordinating committee I chair, consideration is being given as to how best to do this.</P>
    <P>With this committee, the Europen Bureau and the regular meetings of the Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries chaired by the Taoiseach, our co-ordination arrangements have been considerably strengthened as compared with most of the period reviewed by the NESC.  The arrangements are working well but we are now considering how they can be specially enhanced to ensure optimum effectiveness in conducting our forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In regard to the domestic policy response, we have, in addition, the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and we have reactivated the Sectoral Development Committee. These arrangements bring together those with executive responsibility in and under the Government and the representatives of economic operators and are proving quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to exclude the valuable role that is open to Members of this House and of Seanad Éireann through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community.  Last year the Taoiseach indicated that we saw this important committee playing a complementary role in the campaign to promote awareness and preparation for the single market.  There were some queries as to what was meant by this.  What we envisage here is primarily the committee's discharge of their classical role of assessing and reporting on draft Community legislation which is what the completion of the internal market is all about. I believe that with a constructive approach a way can be found to ensure that the committee's reports lead more often to debates in the House.  I look forward to a constructive relationship with a reconstituted committee.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that the Government are giving the most serious attention to the NESC report.  I believe it constitutes one of the most significant <Col N="631" /> Irish contributions for a long time to European debate on the future of the Community.  Already it has provided a basis for a debate in various fora on the position and future of Ireland in the Community, a debate I hope will continue and which I shall follow with interest.  It is, I believe, only fitting that this new session of the Dáil should commence with this important discussion.  I look forward to studying the various contributions from the different sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I want to afford Deputy Currie as much time as possible as this will be his first very welcome contribution in this House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State has already said, there are certain aspects only of the NESC report and indeed the whole question of harmonisation and integration within the Community with which we can deal within the time allocated for this debate.  I welcome this NESC report and the fact that it has been taken so seriously by the Government and various political parties in this House, as I am sure is the case with all interested agencies outside this House.  I welcome the fact also that the Taoiseach said yesterday that he had circulated the report widely, particularly at European level.  It was a realistic appraisal of not just the problems but the advantages we will have from 1992 onwards if we prepare in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to integrating the European Community I have been struck again and again by what President Delors said about the cohesion and solidarity of <Col N="632" /> the European Community.  In a speech in Strasbourg on 17 January 1989 President Delors emphasised that the Commission had already started work on a charter of fundamental social rights to give concrete form and life to the European model of society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Social Charter this week and I also hope there will be a positive implementation of it by the other states as well.  The Taoiseach said that this is not just about economic and monetary integration but also about social integration at European level.  The Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, said we must have a much wider objective to ensure the maximum wellbeing of all, in line with the tradition of social progress which is part of Europe's history.  The Minister of State also said that in the construction of the single European market, social aspects should be given the same importance as economic aspects and should accordingly be developed in a balanced fashion.</P>
    <P>I agree with NESC where they say that Irish Governments have tended to see cohesion as a purely economic phenomenon. Up to now we in Ireland have not recognised the social cohesion that must be as important as the economic cohesion.  In relation to the policy issues and the implications for such policy issues in the social dimension, NESC point out that equality is not just about geographical regional equality but about equality of citizenship for all of our citizens. I applaud the European Community for its outright acceptance of the fact that we do not have equality of citizenship at the moment.  Were it not for the European equality directives, particularly those relating to equality in employment for women, we would not be as far forward in this country in our struggle towards equality.  With our galvanised and positive approach towards Europe in 1992 I hope we will not be seen to be lacklustre and slow in fulfilling the directives in the social areas.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said we were only ten directives behind at this stage but I would remind the House that the directives <Col N="633" /> which we are slowest to implement relate to equality for women.  We have only to go back to the debacle relating to our attempts to get a derogation on equal pay and to remember the successive Governments who failed to make the necessary arrangements to introduce equal treatment in social security for men and women in this country to realise how we have fallen down.  Going towards 1992 we should progress more rapidly in accepting and positively implementing these directives. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said in her speech that sometimes it could be said that the social dimension is spoken of as if it were a liability.  In this country and in this House that is usually the way the social dimension is looked at.</P>
    <P>The whole point of European integration and harmonisation has been to give a sense of wellbeing, equality and total acceptance to all citizens of Europe. All of our directives and arrangements, both formal and informal, must be directed towards that end, otherwise this NESC report and 1992 will be a sham.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government if they are setting up an all-party forum to deal with these issues.  I and others will demand that this suggestion be given consideration. The NESC report highlights the fact that in Ireland we could incur disproportionately high costs in conforming to Community initiatives particularly with regard to bringing women into the mainstream of employment and social life in this country.  NESC say in their report that:</P>
    <P>For example, Ireland at present has virtually no direct public provision and management of child day care, in contrast to many other EC countries, and the social security/parental leave regime in Ireland is less comprehensive. A valid case can therefore be made that countries such as Ireland with less developed, more vulnerable economies, which are attempting to accelerate the development of the social framework of the labour market, should do so with some Community financial support. </P>
    <P>It is up to the Ministers at every European <Col N="634" /> forum to consistently and insistently make that point.  There is a spirit of goodwill and when 52 per cent of the population of Europe are composed of women, we are not talking about marginal or minority interest but about majority interests.  Because women are not equally represented, we will demand solid reporting from all our Ministers that at every meeting from now until 1992, the case for women is well put.</P>
    <P>What will happen at European level should be advanced at national level.  The NESC report also poses a challenge for us in Ireland.  They say in their report:</P>
    <P>In the light of the repeated commitment of the EC Commission to pursue the question of women's participation in the labour force, the important issues for Ireland are to determine what particular policies are now most likely to be effective and what policies will require, or justify, European financial support. </P>
    <P>When we are talking about Structural Funds and the extra funds we will get as a peripheral country, not just geographically but economically and socially, those funds must be seriously looked at and channelled into raising conditions and support systems that we have not got to the extent that they are present in other European countries.  I would like to write into the record that from a statistical point of view this is a real problem for us.  There is a very high level of participation of married women in the workforce at European level whereas in Ireland only 21 per cent of married women work outside the home.  That represents only 13 per cent of the total workforce. Statistics for other European countries show that 80 per cent of mothers with one child work outside the home.  The figure for France is 64 per cent.  That is so far ahead of this country that we have to give serious consideration to the reasons.  For instance, in Denmark 44 per cent of the child care services offered to mothers with children up to two years of age are Government supported but in Ireland the figure is less than 1 per cent.  I do not think any group <Col N="635" /> in this country could put forward a stronger case than the one being put forward on behalf of women.</P>
    <P>As regards the whole area of training, women come out at the bottom of the pile.  In 1988 less than 1 per cent of apprentices in FÁS training centres throughout the country were women.  At European level there has been positive action in this area that would leave most of the Members of this House breathless. I have great difficulty in even getting these people to accept the significance of that much less accept the introduction of such training.  This is the first of many debates we will have on this matter between now and 1992.  Now is the time when our case must be made.  The Structural Funds must be divided on such a basis as to ensure equality for our most vulnerable, most marginalised and least equal citizens.  That is what the Structural Funds are about.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the members of Government, and indeed any others who have an input at European level, will make that case again and again so that we will reach the stage that has been foreseen by the architects of Europe and that we positively endorse it, that is &mdash; and I will end with a quote again from Jacques Delors &mdash; that our foremost concern with regard to the future of Europe is to champion the renewed flowering of democracy, to champion human rights and pluralism.  If we achieve that we will have what we can call a house of Europe where we do not have special rooms designated to the servants or the lower paid.  A Europe less than that would be one we would be ashamed of and I know none of us in this House would like that.</P>

      <P>With very great pleasure I now call on Deputy Austin Currie to address the House especially as this, I understand, is his maiden speech. Gura fada buan tú in ár measc, a Theachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your kind introduction.  I also thank Deputy Barnes for sharing her time with me so equitably. <Col N="636" /> I welcome this detailed report of 550 pages.  It is impossible, of course, to cover everything in the time available to me so I will concentrate on four or five issues. I agree with whoever said that anything worth saying should be said in less than 20 minutes.  I am not sure what that same person would have had to say about 15 minutes but here goes.</P>
      <P>I share the disappointment expressed by everyone about the lack of convergence which is so obvious in the report.  I am, of course, a strong supporter of the ideal of European integration that has been central to peace in Europe since the end of the last World War and central also possibly to peace in the world.  Of course I am inspired by the vision of Monnet and Schuman but that vision has to be translated into reality and I am afraid the reading of this report would lead one to have suspicions that that is not happening.</P>
      <P>Progress has not been good enough. There is divergence rather than convergence. The difference between the rich and poor areas of Europe, as the report indicates, is increasing rather than diminishing.  To come down to brass tacks, it is the difference between rich and poor in the community.  I would suggest that it is not really necessary for us in this country to read the report, or to read other reports, to recognise that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  We only have to look around this State, around Dublin, including areas of my own constituency, to recognise that truth.  My fear is that in a comparatively short period of time when these things start to happen, words like &ldquo;alienation&rdquo; and &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo; may become much more important and much more influential in this community as indeed they have in another community not too far from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1988 report of the Combat Poverty Agency comments on the last major research study by the ERSI which showed that 34 per cent or one in three people are surviving on an income of less than £48 per week for a single person and that 23 per cent or one in four people are on an income of less than £40 per week.  As <Col N="637" /> a newcomer to the political scene here, I find those figures surprising and appalling.</P>
    <P>There is more to that in terms of child and family poverty.  As the report points out, the increase in the number of children being brought up in poverty since the early eighties is significant, all the more so in view of the decline in the birth rate since 1980, which might have been expected to reduce the prevalence of child poverty.  There are children in over six out of every ten households below the poverty line, according to the recent ESRI research.  It is especially noteworthy that the risk of poverty increases as the number of children in a household increases and the risk of poverty is between two and three times as great for households with children as for those without children.  That would appear to be a factual assessment of the situation and I find it appalling.  It is something which all of us must view with great concern and bear in mind when we are considering the future.</P>
    <P>This is not just an Irish problem.  As the report makes clear, poverty in Europe has increased during the eighties. The number of people living in poverty in Europe is now 44 million plus.  Yesterday the Taoiseach was asked about his Government's plans for the Presidency of the European Community next year and he was reluctant to establish particular guidelines on the basis that the French Presidency is still in existence.  I would like to make a suggestion to the Taoiseach and to the Government that in our Presidency from January next year the Government should put tremendous emphasis on the third anti-poverty programme which is due for establishment during the Irish Presidency.  As one who was involved in a very small way with the creation and implementation of the second anti-poverty programme, I would suggest very strongly to the Government that this is something they might do.  It is something that can motivate us all.  Here is something that could give the necessary amount of idealism to our involvement in Europe.  Here is something that could put a stamp on our contribution <Col N="638" /> during our Presidency of the Community which, while helping Europe, will also help our own country.</P>
    <P>The great majority of people in this country, whether they are on the poverty line or among the affluent section of the community, are committed to and believe in social justice, and wish to see a situation in this State where there is equal opportunity for all.  It is also important that during the Irish Presidency we go full steam ahead with the social dimension of the Single European Act.  I believe the report entitled &ldquo;Social Dimension of the Internal Market, which was produced in September 1988 as a working paper says it all.  With reference to the social dimension of the internal market it says:</P>
    <P>The Single Market would be pointless if the standard of living and of social protection attained by the average European were called into question. Indeed, its justification in economic and political terms is to be found in increased social progress and in the advantages which it offers to all citizens of the Community. </P>
    <P>I do not think the social dimension, or indeed the internal market, means very much unless the social dimension is implemented in the way suggested.  I suggest very strongly to the incoming Presidency of the Community that they take that as a starting point.  This is linked to the point I made earlier in relation to the contribution which the Government could make to the elimination of poverty in this country and in Europe.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to make under that heading but time restricts me from so doing.  Let me say that they relate, first, to the protection of the environment and, second, to educational opportunities.  I think the Ireland of the near future, as well as the Europe of the future, is going to require greater emphasis on both aspects.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be a one issue politican, even though the peaceful resolution of the Northern problem is, in my opinion, the greatest priority facing us, <Col N="639" /> North and South.  I owe it to my constituents in Dublin West to deal with the problems directly facing them in their day to day existence, but, of course, some of those problems relate to the Northern problem.  For example, law and order in Dublin West and other inner city areas would be less of a problem if more gardaí were available and did not have to help provide security on the Border.  More money would be available to tackle the problems of areas like Dublin West if the taxpayer did not have to pay what amounts to, on average, a greater amount per head towards security than does the average British taxpayer.  The problem of unemployment in Dublin West might be lessened if the American industrialists who are thinking of setting up in the Republic of Ireland, when they turn on their televisions and see the awful events occurring in Belfast and elsewhere, could differentiate between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Then there might be a better chance of attracting industry to Dublin West and other areas.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong relationship referred to in this NESC report and an obvious case to be made for the closest possible co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland, between the Government in the Republic and the Northern Ireland Office, because if there is no convergence in the Republic's position in Europe as a whole, then that is even more the case in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In the three minutes left to me, I will make one or two further points directed at the Government on the co-operation that is possible.  I regret that there were no joint cross-Border proposals in the recent application for Structural Funds.  If such a joint application had been made, the Governments would have been knocking on an open door and would have been welcomed in <Col N="640" /> Brussels.  Even at this late stage I believe that position can be rectified.  The Commission has retained power to allocate part of the overall Structural Funds for special Community projects.  This Government and the Northern Ireland Office should get together and make joint proposals to the Commission.  I believe that such proposals would be welcome in Dublin and additional money from the Social Fund would be made available not just for areas contiguous to the Border but on an all-Ireland basis.  This work can be done through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I will concentrate on one final point.</P>

      <P>May I advise the Deputy that the Minister for Tourism and Transport who is happily with us in the House has been magnanimous enough to suggest giving you some of his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to do that if the Deputy wishes to continue for a further five to ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister very sincerely.  This is in line with what I know of him.  Nevertheless I will try to bring my remarks to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have suggested here is another way in which there can be fruitful co-operation on this island on a joint approach to Brussels for additional money for cross-Border purposes.  I would like to refer specifically to that part of this island which requires major attention, that is, those counties both north and south of the Border, which have traditionally been deprived of their hinterland, which have suffered from the troubles of the past 20 years and which have suffered the image for example of south Armagh on one side as being bandit country and Dundalk on the other as being some form of El Paso.  They have also suffered from the differing economic and fiscal policies pursued by the two Governments.  Over the years when Derry, Strabane, Enniskillen and Newry were up, then Donegal, Monaghan, <Col N="641" /> Castleblayney and Dundalk were down and <i>vice versa.</i>  I hope this will come to an end.</P>
    <P>The only people who have gained over the years from this difference of economic and fiscal policy between North and South have been the smugglers.  I have a lot of time for the old decent smuggler who operated on the Border.  In terms of their entrepreneurial instincts they were the archetypal entrepreneurs.  If the initiative displayed by the smugglers over the years had been displayed by business and manufacturing interests here this would probably be the most prosperous country in Europe and possibly in the world.  Unfortunately there is a different type of smuggler about now connected to the paramilitaries, sinister people.</P>
    <P>The test of the Single European Act, of the success of 1992, of the success of harmonisation and of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people, is the extent to which after 1992 smugglers will be out of business.  That will be one of the real tests.  That means there has to be harmonisation.  There cannot be variation on either side of the Border which would enable the smugglers to continue to make a living.  We have to decide what percentage is necessary to put those people out of business.  As we know, smuggling affects not only the Border counties but people on the whole island.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that apart from the economic consequences, in terms of political implications if the Irish Border remains the only part of Europe with customs posts, that will have major political implications.  If this State, with its national aim of reunification, were to be responsible for preserving the Border as anything but a political boundary, that would be a major political statement too.</P>
    <P>I hope I have indicated in a positive way some of the lessons which can be learned from the NESC report and ways in which the Government can contribute and even give the lead in holding the presidency of the Community next year. Thank you for your patience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by congratulating <Col N="642" /> Deputy Austin Currie on his excellent maiden speech to this House.  I am sure I speak for the whole House when I say that his very fine, thoughtful speech augurs well for his time in this House.  While he is new to this House I know that nevertheless he is a very experienced public representative and I have no doubt that this Dáil will be far better for the presence of Deputy Currie and for his very thoughtful remarks which we heard here today.  A maiden speech is always an important, almost historic occasion in this House.  I can say honestly from what I have heard from Deputy Currie today that he will be an excellent addition to debate and discussion in this House, and I wish him well during his time here.</P>
      <P>I would like first of all to join with other Members of this House in commending the members and staff of the NESC for their excellent report on <i>Ireland in the European Community.</i></P>
      <P>The report provides a comprehensive analysis of Ireland's performance since we joined the European Community back in 1973 and clearly identifies the challenges which this country has to face up to in competing in a unified European market.  Above all, for me it highlights the difficult choices and hard decisions that still have to be taken in the process of integrating and participating more fully in the EC.  In this regard, the NESC maintains a fine tradition of providing consistent and sound advice to Government on national economic and social policies.  In particular, it maintains a consistency with a statement it made nearly fifteen years ago that a small economy such as Ireland cannot escape the economic effects of international developments. As NESC put it &mdash;&ldquo;It is not possible to stop the world and let Ireland off&rdquo;.  How right they are.</P>
      <P>The current report provides a series of considered and practical recommendations of the action that is required to prepare Ireland to play a full and effective role in the European market place of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is timely.  It comes when we <Col N="643" /> are beginning to seriously focus on 1992 and what we have to do to prepare for it. Work has been going on for many years but now as the magic figure of 1990 appears it is necessary to seriously prepare for 1992.  The run up has commenced in a serious way.  The NESC report could not have come at a better time because we are now mentally attuned to concentrate on it in a real way.</P>
    <P>As the European Community moves towards the completion of the single internal market we in Ireland have to continue to develop innovative policies to offset the many disadvantages associated with our peripheral location and other unique structural characteristics of our economy.  At the same time we have to strengthen the competitiveness of our economy and further develop the key sectors where we have the products to compete effectively in international markets. With increased mobility of goods, labour, investment and financial capital, all of our policies and activities need to be considered in a new light.  Changes which increase the exposure of our economy to external forces must be met headon by measures which increase the internal efficiency of the Irish economy.  This will call for change and adaptation in all segments of our economy.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of the NESC report is to highlight the fact that we now need to adopt a more explicit, coherent and fully articulated European policy or strategy. Following detailed analysis of the relative merits of different levels of economic integration, NESC has unanimously concluded that Ireland's interest lies in advanced economic integration and a monetary union.  It advocates that we should support the concept of a Community which will have sufficient resources and policies to create a genuine economic union and manage a unified European economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the House that while the Government would not necessarily accept each and every finding and recommendation in the 574 page NESC report, we accept its central thrust.  In particular, we agree with <Col N="644" /> NESC's argument that Ireland's best interests are likely to be served by the fullest measure of economic integration provided that this is accompanied by the necessary measures to strengthen cohesion.  Side by side with economic integration we have to ensure that the Community &mdash; and the Taoiseach and Ministers insist on always putting this view forward, as do most Members of the House &mdash; take Ireland's peripheral location into account in a substantial way while we progress with economic integration. For us the two are inextricably linked.</P>
    <P>The report is clearly concerned that if sufficient measures are not envisaged by the EC to correct regional imbalances, the prospects of establishing economic and monetary union on an unacceptable basis will be put seriously at risk.  The Single European Act recognised the need for more active cohesion policies in the European Community, and the European Council has already taken decisions on the reform and expansion of the Structural Funds as one of the steps towards that cohesion.  The decisions included a doubling of the funds' contribution to the less developed regions by 1992 and an overall substantial increase, a doubling, by 1993, together with a special effort to be undertaken for the least prosperous regions, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with the rest of my colleagues in Government in pointing out that in our view Ireland has done extremely well in the share-out of the Structural Funds.  In a bargaining situation nobody gets all they ask for.  If they did they would have to ask whether they went into it in a negotiating position in the first place, but all things considered Ireland has done extremely well from the Strutural Funds.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised, however, that the EC Structural Funds are but one of the instruments for promoting economic cohesion.  As provided in Article 130 of the EC Treaty, the conduct of all member states' economic policies and the implementation of the common policies must also take into account the objectives of strengthening economic and social <Col N="645" /> cohesion and reducing regional disparities. It was for this reason that the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> submitted to the EC Commission last March placed the measures to be aided by the Structural Funds in a broader socioeconomic context.</P>
    <P>The reduction of regional disparities which has been Community policy for some time past assumes greater urgency as the Community moves towards the completion of the single internal market. The NESC have concluded that the long run benefits of market completion are likely to be distributed unevenly, with the greatest benefits accruing to regions in which large scale industries and highly innovative sectors are more prevalent.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market of itself should not be expected to narrow the income disparities between regions in the EC, let alone bring about full convergence. This is a fundamental conclusion which underpins the entire NESC report.  It is a conclusion which the Government had also reached and which was a major influence in preparing the National Development Plan.  The plan was designed to prepare the Irish economy as a whole to compete in the single internal market.  To that purpose, the measures in the plan are directed at remedying disadvantages associated with peripheral location and other structural characteristics, at strengthening the competitiveness of the economy and further developing those key sectors where we can compete internationally.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, broad agreement has now been reached between the Government and the EC Commission on the Community support framework for Ireland.  This is the framework in which the greatly increased structural funding for Ireland will be invested up to 1993. Within this framework a series of operational programmes on agreed areas are being discussed with the European Commission. Tourism and transport, for which I have specific responsibility, are included among the agreed headings. These two sectors have a crucial role to play in strengthening the productive capacity of the economy because of their <Col N="646" /> sheer size and scale, their pervasive nature and their important and crucial linkages to other sectors in the economy.</P>
    <P>I would like first to outline for the House my views on the major problems facing the transport sector and what we intend to do about them.  In the EC context, completing the internal market is very important to transport because I do not believe you can have a genuine 1992-type internal market without a fully integrated transport policy within that Community. The very essence of an internal market is that one can move around it whether by air, rail, road or sea in a free and easy and as standardised or similar fashion as possible.  It is that particular philosophy I will be trying to pursue during my chairmanship of the Transport Council of Ministers during our Presidency of the EC.  I will be trying to bring about a genuine internal market in transport in the Community.</P>
    <P>As the NESC point out in their report, there are undoubtedly gaps in Ireland's infrastructure and systems which are the proper subject of structural policy investments. The quality of transport infrastructure influences not only, perhaps not even mainly, the cost of access to foreign markets, but also the internal efficiency of the economy in both traded and non-traded sectors &mdash; a point which is forcibly made in the NESC report.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Ireland suffers from major cost disadvantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EC member states.  These disadvantages are due to two factors.  First, our peripheral and island location, with a consequent heavier reliance on air and sea access transport services and, second, the fact that the quality of our internal transport network does not match that of our partners in the Community.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe are still unfortunately approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.  It is important to realise that as an island nation, getting on and off our island safely, efficiently and economically must be a major priority in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> Following the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993, Ireland will be the only EC member state without a land link to the Community mainland.  For that reason we have advanced the case that investment in our air and sea links is equivalent to investment by mainland Community countries in cross-border road and rail links to other member states.  Accordingly, the transport measures in the National Development Plan submitted to Brussels were oriented towards the development of an adequate internal transport structure which is fully integrated with improved access transport services.</P>
    <P>Good roads, it goes without saying, are crucial in servicing the other sectors of the economy.  As the NESC put it in an earlier report in 1981, there are &ldquo;very strong reasons for improving the Irish road system which does lag behind that of broadly comparable nations&rdquo;.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will no doubt give the House specific details of our policies and proposals for the development of our roads.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some key considerations for the areas of transport for which I have responsibility.  First, I will refer to airports.  Existing airport capacity is reaching a limit because of a dramatic increase in travel to and from Britain and mainland Europe on foot of radical Government initiatives in relation to access air fares into Ireland.  As a result of the increase in traffic numbers there is now an urgent need for an accelerated capital investment programme at the State airports.</P>
    <P>Major elements of the programme of investment at the State airports which we are currently finalising include: a major extension of the passenger terminal facilities at Dublin airport, together with new car parking facilities; extension and upgrading of the passenger terminal facilities at Shannon and Cork airports; extension and upgrading of runways, taxiways, aprons and other airside facilities at the three State airports; modernisation and upgrading of navigational aids at the three State airports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> We also have ambitious plans for the development of our regional airports.  I regard the development of the regional airports as an essential feature in a properly integrated transport network for the promotion of tourism and business access.  The regional airports have a crucial role to play in reducing Ireland's peripherality in the context of the completion of the internal market. Recently I had occasion to visit a number of them.  I am more concerned than ever that further improvements in regional airports are both warranted and essential. This is particularly important if rural areas of the country are to be linked satisfactorily and efficiently with both Dublin and the rest of Europe directly. During my visit to the regional airports at Waterford, Farranfore, Galway and Connaught I assured the respective airport boards and the regional tourism organisations that the Government were committed to making substantial investment in the regional airport network commencing next year.  I also emphasised that the Government would look with particular favour on airport projects that involved local private financial investment.</P>
    <P>It is important that the private sector look to the regional airport structure as an important area in which they should consider investing further.  During this round of visits to the regional airports, I have told them I would be particularly interested in working to develop the airports in conjunction with further private investment in the airports themselves to the extent that the regional airports can come forward with exciting plans involving some private investment, we will not be found wanting in supporting the development of regional airports. Already a major development programme launched by the Government last year, involving total expenditure of £5 million, is now complete.  This, together with the Government's policy on air fares and intense competition has already facilitated the development of a wide range of services at the regional airports.  Indeed I know the House will be pleased to know that traffic is booming <Col N="649" /> through these regional airports.  Four hundred thousand people are now passing through that network and I am told by the airports that a substantial increase in passenger traffic at these airports can be expected in the years ahead.  A very important and central development in the context of preparing Ireland for 1992 is the full development of these regional airports and ensuring they receive every support possible.</P>
    <P>The NESC commented on the efficiency of Irish ports and they noted the significant portion of Irish freight trade going through Northern Ireland. The NESC report went on to argue that Ireland's access ports must have the capacity to handle freight and passenger movements both efficiently and competitively. We have specific plans to ensure that they will have this capacity, details of which the Minister for the Marine can deal with.</P>
    <P>The development of adequate sea and air access freight facilities is an essential prerequisite for this economy if it is to maximise the export growth which we need to underpin sustainable economic development and job creation.  In mainland European terms investment in such facilities is equivalent in nature to investment in cross-Border road and rail links to other member states.  That is the comparison we would make here.  The main policy priority will be to improve transit times and reduce access costs to Europe. We are currently arranging, in conjunction with the European Commission, to have feasibility studies undertaken to determine the optimal organisational and commercial structures for such sea and air freight services, having regard in particular to their commercial viability. Account will have to be taken in these studies of the report's recommendation that our transport policy must encompass not only investment in transport infrastructure but also the efficient management of major transport facilities.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that improved air services can only be optimised if air traffic delays are reduced.  In my role as current President of Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control organisation, <Col N="650" /> I have been pressing my fellow Ministers for Transport in Europe to devise a long-term strategy for integrating European air traffic control systems.  It is imperative that we have a long term strategy to complement the action taken by European Governments in the past year.  That action has been on short and medium term measures which have been needed to reduce air traffic delays this year, as it were.  The longer-term measures are equally important, and more important in many ways.</P>
    <P>While something has been achieved &mdash; including the publication of Europe's Common Medium Term Plan for harmonising air traffic control systems and the preparation of a detailed plan for a Centralised Air Traffic Management Unit, which is being implemented on a phased basis already &mdash; much more is required if long term solutions to air traffic delays at a European level are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards Ireland's contribution to the solution of air traffic problems in Europe, action is being taken on two main fronts, which I announced during the summer.  First, we are investing £30 million in new communications, navigation and landing aids and radar systems.  Secondly, we are training new personnel for the air traffic control services and the Department of Tourism and Transport are consulting with the relevant trade unions &mdash; under Labour Court mediation &mdash; on addressing the long-term personnel and structural issues of Irish air traffic control.</P>
    <P>Let me just say to the House that on completion next year of this £30 million investment in technology at State airports they will be as good as, if not better than, most international airports in regard to air traffic control equipment.  It has become very important that we complete this programme, particularly at Dublin Airport, which will be coming fully on stream perhaps in January or, at the latest, February of next year.  When that equipment is fully switched on we will have the finest air traffic control equipment and this should go on a long way towards reducing air traffic delays which <Col N="651" /> again do not affect holidaymakers only; it is something which will be essential to the business life of the only island nation in the new internal market of 1992.  This is why sorting out this area is very important.</P>
    <P>In the context of rail and bus transport, it is proposed to develop the mainline rail network through improvements in existing stations, expenditure on the network to facilitate more container traffic and renewal and completion of the rail signalling programme.  Plans are also being prepared for the introduction of new diesel commuter services on existing rail lines in Dublin.  It is also proposed to invest in the introduction of improved local and provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the transport area I want to say to the House that during our Presidency from January to June next year apart from trying to alleviate air traffic control difficulties &mdash; Ireland cannot alleviate those on its own, it is a European problem; Europe has many more control points and air traffic centres throughout it compared to similar sized areas in, for example, the United States which would have far fewer traffic areas to deal with &mdash; the Government will be pushing strongly ahead with the second package of airline liberalisation to ensure greater competition and an opening-up of markets in the airline business throughout Europe.  It is still somewhat sad and hard to grasp why, in trying to build a 1992 internal marketplace, the airline industry throughout Europe are still hidebound by tradition, old fashioned agreements and substantial bureaucracy.  If this continues and we are unable to make progress in this area during our six months of the Presidency it will be a pity because as I said earlier the essence of building an internal market is that one can move around it, particularly in the air, freely, openly and without all of these restrictions which bedevil European airline transport at present. That will be a major priority of the Government in chairing the Transport Council during the first six months of 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> I referred earlier in my speech to the Government's strategy of developing key sectors of our economy where we can compete effectively in international markets. Tourism is one such sector.  The Government's decision to identify the tourism sector for special development has been wholeheartedly endorsed by the European Commission who see it as a major axis for economic development and employment creation.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, we are currently finalising with the Commission an Operational Programme for Tourism in Ireland which will fully articulate our proposals for the development of this sector.</P>
    <P>The House knows, of course, that the tourist industry worldwide is now arguably the fastest growing industry there is. It is growing at something of the order of 5 to 7 per cent worldwide.  In Ireland we are trying to perform something of an economic miracle in this regard, and thank God we are succeeding so far. Tourism here is growing at the rate of 15 per cent per annum which is three times the rate of growth of world tourism. Granted we are starting from a smaller base but it is a credit to those involved in the tourist industry that they have managed to achieve this growth.  I should tell the House that we are still on target to meet that 15 per cent growth this year but we are talking about making 15 per cent on 15 per cent over a four to five year period.  That is a very ambitious target but so far we are on target &mdash; this target was set by my predecessor Deputy Wilson &mdash; to double the number of visitors coming to this island between 1987 and 1992.  We are something like half way through that now and we are on target to meet that figure, so it is very important we continue with that programme.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of our tourism policy are to harness our natural advantages, to increase the capacity of the sector, to strengthen its competitiveness and to market it more effectively abroad.</P>
    <P>The core strategy for the development of tourism over the next few years will be significant capital investment in the Irish tourism product.  That capital investment will be complemented by a specially <Col N="653" /> designed marketing scheme to capitalise on new amenities provided as a result of this investment.  In the light of the constraint which budgetary imbalances impose on the Government's ability to finance this investment, the Structural Funds' moneys allocated to tourism will be used to a greater extent to lever out the maximum amount of private sector investment in amenities for which there is an international demand.  My approach to dealing with the Structural Funds allocated to tourism will be to use what is available to attract the maximum amount of compatible private investment to more than match what the State can provide. The best use for the Structural Funds in the tourism area is to use them to prime the private investor and to lever out the maximum amount of private investment.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a more integrated approach to tourism at Community level. This is a matter we will be raising during our Presidency. There must also be a greater tourism input by the Commission in the formulation of policies in other areas within its competence.  During our Presidency we will be laying substantial emphasis on the air liberalisation package and trying to get a more integrated approach to tourism at European level. This is sadly lacking at present.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined to the House, we have very specific development plans for the transport and tourism sectors.  My colleagues in Government have throughout this debate given considerable details as they affect their own areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In addition to macro-economic or sectoral development policies, a crucial requirement for success in the single internal market is, as the NESC have noted, the maintenance of a domestic economic environment conducive to growth and competitive enterprise.  This requires that we continue the sound macro-economic management in which we have been engaged.  The creation of the correct economic environment needs to take on a new meaning in the completed internal market.  It is very important that in keeping our eye on the 1992 <Col N="654" /> marketplace we do not take our eye off the ball at home.  There is a need to continue discipline and order in our own public finances and in the management of our economic affairs.</P>
    <P>The run up to 1992 will be very exciting in the areas of transport and tourism.  I see it as a time of investment and opportunity, not as a time of difficulty but as a time when Ireland's transport and tourism policies will come of age in the new markets of Europe.  I am fully confident that our tourism industry and our transport sector will be as good as, if not better than, those of any of our partners by the magic date of 1992.</P>

      <P>The series of statements we have been having would not have taken place without the insistence of my party.  I am bound to point out to the House that the same was true of an earlier debate on the Cecchini report, the analysis carried out for the EC Commission into the advantages of greater European integration.  The signs are that without Fine Gael pressure this Coalition Government, just like its Fianna Fáil predecessor, would wish to avoid fundamental and searching debate on these issues which are vital for our future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This two day series of statements can be nothing more than the beginning of a process of detailed political analysis and unless the Taoiseach changes his view on consultation in this House that will be a stormy process.  I put the Government on notice that my party will want to have each stage of this negotiation fully debated in this House because of the crucial importance of this European endeavour to the wellbeing of our people. It is absurd for the Taoiseach to pretend as he did yesterday that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community, important though that committee is, can provide an adequate forum for parliamentary debate on European integration. I would strongly urge the Taoiseach and the Government to reconsider the proposal made yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, for a special committee to deal with these issues.  They will not be dealt with properly in the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="656" /> on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community.  That is not their job.</P>
    <P>I most warmly congratulate the NESC on this report.  It is a work of major proportions and of great importance, although perhaps we would not all agree with everything that is in it by way of recommendations and conclusions. There is no doubt that its production is a signal service to us in this House and to everybody else who has responsibilities for and an interest in these issues.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday of that report that it can give the European Commission, to whom he has sent it, a keen insight into the concerns and goals which determine Ireland's negotiating position within the European Council in the run up to 1992 and beyond.  That is true, but not only the European Commission can benefit in that way.  The Taoiseach and his Government might benefit and it seems, indeed, that they need to.  Nothing the Taoiseach or any member of the Government has so far said about the report or the issues it examines gives me any confidence that they have any sense of direction or purpose about what they should be doing on the wide range of important issues involved.  The Taoiseach had no policies to offer, no strategy to propose.  The same can fairly be said of the Ministers who have intervened in this debate.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Agriculture and Food both talked about areas where in all conscience, as they themselves have pointed out, greater European intergration should give us room for growth, but they have no strategies to propose, no prescriptions to lay down and no answers to the questons raised in this report.</P>
    <P>The only guideline the Taoiseach had to offer was the very tentative statement in relation to agricultural policy that &ldquo;the Government will seek to influence the evolution of Community policy along the lines recommended by the NESC&rdquo;.  He went a little further and said that the Government are in agreement with the basic thrust of the report.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>That just is not enough.  We are now <Col N="657" /> approaching the end of October 1989 and we have been talking about 1992 for two years, if not longer.  We have had the Europen campaign and we have had debates in the House going back over two years but we still find that when a major report of this kind is brought forward &mdash; it was done very carefully and, clearly, with a great deal of consultation &mdash; the Government are still not putting before the House even the outlines of what they plan to do in order to adapt the Irish economy to what is going to happen over those years or to shape what is going to happen over those years to suit the needs of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had something else to say, that continued progress must not be put at risk by abandoning the consensus that has worked so well.  That is a most admirable sentiment but it is a bit ironic when we think that the Taoiseach had to put his party, and his partners in Government, through the humiliation of losing 12 Dáil seats between them before he came to that understanding.  The Taoiseach should know by now that he can expect a constructive approach in this House if he and his colleagues approach this openly and with a proper appreciation of the role of the House, and if they put aside the arrogance which they have displayed in abundance in the House over the last two days on other items of business.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have much to say about the issues or the approaches we should adopt to the questions outlined in the NESC report.  Let us look at what we need.  What we need to do has been very cogently expressed in the three fundamental conclusions set out on page 534 of the NESC report.  I should add that the Taoiseach and the Ministers who spoke in the debate have not referred in any way, good, bad or indifferent, to any of those conclusions or said what they think about any one of them.  The first of the three fundamental conclusions in the NESC report is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Economic integration in the narrow sense &mdash; the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers &mdash; will not serve <Col N="658" /> to reduce regional disparities and may unleash forces which tend to reinforce existing advantages and disadvantages. </P>
    <P>We would all agree with that.  That is the type of suggestion that an eminent official in our system, the Governor of the Central Bank, had in mind some time ago when he said that we did not want the process of integration to turn Ireland into the Appalachia of the European Community. We want to avoid that.  Indeed, that danger has been very much in the minds of my colleagues and myself since the late sixties when we first began to debate and prepare for membership of the European Community.  It has taken quite a long time to bring the Community to the point where it now has a clear and determined policy that it must avoid these effects.  In fact, it was the Liam Cosgrave Government of 1973 to 1977 which participated in the development of the first European Regional Development Fund although it was not part of the Treaty at the time.  It was Deputy Garret FitzGerald's Government that assisted in and helped to shape the Single European Act which, for the first time in the history of the Community, wrote an obligation to take these factors into account into the Treaty basis of the Community. The conclusion I have quoted from the NESC report is a very pertinent one but little has been said about it in the series of statements by the Government.</P>
    <P>The second NESC fundamental conclusion was:</P>
    <P>(2)  The European Community has developed in an unbalanced manner: the considerable degree of negative integration has not been balanced by sufficient measures of positive integration. This inhibits both the achievement of genuine economic integration and of regional convergence. </P>
    <P>That is fair comment and it is something that should give us food for thought when we look at how the Community is going to develop from here.  The Taoiseach referred in passing to the need to ensure <Col N="659" /> that we have mechanisms in the Community that will offset the natural centralising tendencies in an economic union.</P>
    <P>He referred briefly to the McDougall report of 1977 which put forward the proposition that the European Community's budget could never be an effective redistributive mechanism unless it was covering between 5 and 7 per cent of the Community's gross domestic product. I remember that particularly well because at the time that report was published I was working in the Commission and I had an opportunity to see at first hand in both the Commission and the Council the approach that was being adopted to that proposal.  I can say without exaggeration that among all the interest groups represented at European Community level at the time, industry, trade and agriculture, there was a clear and ready acceptance of the logic of that statement.</P>
    <P>However, at the time very few Governments of the member states would have adopted that view.  Things have not changed a lot.  Today I would suspect that the United Kingdom Government would not be at all happy to accept that proposal. I suspect that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany would be very unhappy with a proposal of that kind and I doubt whether the Government of The Netherlands would go that far.  Of course, we can write the rest of the script.  An Irish Government in their proper senses should be an advocate of that approach.  The Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek Governments equally should be advocates of an approach like that.  I do not know what position the Danish Government would take on such a proposal; they tend to be rather difficult to fathom from time to time because, although it is a small country and a little peripheral, it is so near a big country that perhaps it does not make an awful lot of difference.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there is a valid point of view in that proposal and it is one which underlines a great deal of what the NESC has <Col N="660" /> said and a good deal of what the Commission, and President Delors, are trying to bring about.  What does that mean? My colleague Deputy Noonan pointed out yesterday that we have to look at the implications for the way we do our business of many of the things we would wish to see done in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Community's budget today accounts for a little more than 1 per cent of Community GDP.  To make it an effective method of distributing growth around the Community we would have to multiply its volume by about four.  It does not sound an awful lot to say that you have to get 5 per cent or 7 per cent of Community GDP into the Community budget but when you think that it has to be multiplied by four you can see that there is the beginning of a major political argument there.  That has some implications for us.  Firstly, would we accept, as a natural corollary of this if proportions were to remain about the same, that our contribution to the Community budget should be multiplied by about four? Would we accept the diplomatic effort required of us to get other member states to do that?  Would we accept handing over that amount of responsibility for what are, after all, national taxpayers' funds to the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>My belief is that we should be prepared to do that but I have not seen any indication over the last couple of days, or even going back further, that the Government have any understanding that that is what is involved if we want to make the process of European integration give us the result that we need.  Unless and until this Government wake up to that fact I have not a great deal of confidence, I am sad to say, that we are going to see a concerted, well informed and collective Irish approach to the decisions that are going to have to be made by the Council of Ministers and the European Council over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The third fundamental conclusion in the NESC report is that Ireland's strategic approach to the EC shall be based on the objective of creating a genuine European economic and monetary union <Col N="661" /> that would have the characteristics to suit Ireland's social and economic needs and aspirations.  I agree with that.  There is no arguing whatsoever with it but we have not had either yesterday or today from this Government an indication of any such approach.  There has been nothing like a systematic review or even an outline review of the kind of things we need to do in that regard.</P>
    <P>It might help if we could express the objective in a simpler way.  I put it like this: Ireland's interests will be best served by developing the Community so as to maximise its ability to produce wealth. We must ensure then that the distribution of wealth within the Community is consistent with the commitments in the Single European Act to economic and social cohesion.  We must ensure that the Community as an entity gives due weight to its responsibilities to the rest of the world and to the Third World in particular. Finally, we must ensure that our institutional framework, political, economic and administrative, is adapted to the objectives we set.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at what is going on and see whether it is in any way in accordance with that criteria.  I am looking at what the Government are saying and doing.  Let us look at the area of tax harmonisation, surely an essential part of the development of an economic and monetary union.  The Taoiseach claimed yesterday that the Government had adopted what he called a &ldquo;prudent and responsible approach to adjustment of our own tax system to Community developments&rdquo;.  I challenge anybody on the Government benches to identify for me any single move made by this Government or by the last Government since March 1987 that does anything to adjust our tax system to Community development. Have they reduced the rate of VAT?  No.  Have they brought any excise duty down near the rates of excise duty in any other member state?  No.  What have they done?  They have increased the gap between levels of excise duty and VAT in this country and those in the other Community member states.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement that policy <Col N="662" /> has been prudent and responsible would be laughable if it were not made seriously in our Parliament.  That was not a prudent policy.  It has been a supine policy.  The Government have just plainly lain down on the job and done nothing.  That policy could be called responsible only to the extent that its supine nature has been responsible for bringing about some of the very difficulties the Taoiseach outlined yesterday when he talked about a shift in the Commission's proposals between August 1987 and the early part of this year which has made the whole thing much more difficult, as he rightly says.  However, a large part of the blame has to be laid at the door of the previous Government here and of other governments in the member states who did nothing to bring about the realisation of the objectives set out by the Commission in 1987, objectives which, although they had their difficulties and their warts, were moving in the right direction for us.  It was a system that was going to make sure that the Community operated as a Community to bring about tax harmonisation and that we did not fall into the trap which the Community is in danger of falling into now of giving in to the Lawson-Thatcher-German doctrine of saying we are going to let market forces harmonise taxes and the devil take the hindmost.  This Government have conspired in allowing that to come about, and the Taoiseach has the brazen effrontery to come in here and call the Government policy on tax harmonisation prudent and responsible.  All we had was silence punctuated only by the occasional moaning of the then Minister for Finance, now Commissioner MacSharry, and the occasional very opaque statement by the current Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach saying that any move of that kind would cost the Exchequer here £600 million a year, as if the whole thing were going to happen overnight in one leap.  Quite properly, no other member state, no responsible member of the Commission would take that seriously as a contribution to bringing about tax harmonisation in the EC, a tax harmonisation that we need perhaps even <Col N="663" /> more urgently than is the case of any other member state in the Community because no other member state has a land frontier with a neighbour where the differences between tax levels are as large as they are between ourselves and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I listened to my colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, who made a very weighty maiden speech here this afternoon, and I must say I shivered a bit when I heard Deputy Currie say he had a certain regard for the old style smugglers.  Of course he was talking about the old style, but that whole business exists only because we have those tax differences.  I and many of my colleagues know that in the 30 miles and even more away from the Border &mdash; the Minister sitting over there should know as well as the rest of us &mdash; business has been devastated by the difference in tax.</P>
    <P>I have the distinction &mdash; I consider it a distinction &mdash; of having moved in one substantial area to reduce those differences and it worked.  Yes, we lost revenue for the first 18 months, of course we did.  There was no way of avoiding that, but after a while revenue began to come back because we began to get the volume of sales back here.  The same logic applies to overall tax harmonisation especially if it is done on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>We look at what is required in relation to agriculture.  We had a very brief intervention here this afternoon from the Minister for Agriculture and Food who seems to suffer from jetlag even when he goes no further than Luxembourg, but we have what the Taoiseach said yesterday about agriculture. He said, and there is a little plug in here, &ldquo;We are fortunate that the brief of the Commissioner for Agriculture now extends to responsibility for rural development.&rdquo; If it is the same kind of responsibility that we have in taxation policy then the Lord save us all.  The Taoiseach thinks this signal a recognition on the part of the Commission of the importance of rural development and that this will be of positive significance for us in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said also: &ldquo;I agree with the NESC that Ireland should be to the fore in promoting constructive developments in this area.&rdquo;  What constructive development have the Irish Government or our current Minister for Agriculture proposed in Brussels to deal with the many problems facing Irish agriculture, the effects on Irish agriculture of the alignment of Community prices to world <Col N="665" /> prices, or the effects on Irish agriculture of an emerging agreement fuelled and driven by the US, the most protectionist economy in the world, to get rid of all export subsidies?  Those effects are going to be dramatic.  As far as I can determine, and I keep in fairly close contact with my friends in the Commission &mdash; and they are many I am glad to say &mdash; the sum total of what the Irish Government and the Minister for Agriculture have proposed in order to meet those problems is nil.  It is a problem that the last Governemnt and this Government have.  They react.  They wait for somebody else to propose something.  They do not come forward themselves with any proposals. That is dangerous.  Not only is it dangerous, but it is pure folly in the situation that is facing us.</P>

      <P>There is just one little glimmer in the 29 pages of the Taoiseach's script of yesterday that indicates that perhaps there might be an opening over there.  He said and I quote:</P>
      <P>We wish to ensure that, as endorsed in Madrid, only those tasks that can be better achieved at Community level will be subject to Community regulation, with other tasks left to national legislation and collective bargaining; </P>
      <P>That is the one part of the Taoiseach's speech of yesterday that I liked because it encapsulates something which is dear to my heart, and I know it is particularly dear to my colleague Deputy John Bruton.  It expresses what we call the principle of subsidiarity which I am happy to tell you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is one of the key principles of the Christian Democrat Movement and one which, if followed, even belatedly now by this Government, will help us to guide the integration of the European Community in a way that would be of benefit to our people and to the rest of the people of the European Community but, as I said, yesterday and today can be only the beginning of this House's consideration of these issues.  We will have to come back on issue after issue, on topic after topic, to dabate these matters and we had better see at least the beginning of some understanding on the Government side of what their role in the whole process should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that it is to be regretted that the analysis in the NESC report has tended to be regarded, in some quarters at least, as calling into question the wisdom of joining the EC.  It should, of course, properly be seen as much as an assessment of the way we, all of us, responded <Col N="667" /> to the challenges that membership posed, and especially the performance of domestic economic policy, as it is an appraisal of the impact on the economy of our membership of the EC.  With this knowledge, we will be better placed to deal with the fundamental changes which are envisaged for the Community.  Moreover, it will assist in ensuring that our own actions and those of the Community will lead to further cohesion and the type of economic development which will benefit all members, both big and small.</P>
      <P>It is, you will realise by now, impossible to segregate the effects of EC membership in itself from the changes which were taking place in the world generally in the period of our membership.  It is also impossible to look at our own behaviour and policies in isolation during this period.  There is no doubt that EC membership created pressure for structural change.  It is clear also that this country, like any other for that matter, is not immune to outside influences.</P>
      <P>As an open economy we must be adaptable.  I cannot stress this enough. This means that we must recognise that our own economic destiny is determined by our capacity and willingness to deal effectively with the changes which are taking place in the global economy.  We must be open to change, change in new technologies, to new work practices and to new management techniques.  Rather than seeing these as difficulties, we should actively seek to identify the best of these and apply them for ourselves. Our aim should be to protect what is vital, to preserve what is unique and to retain what is worth while.  To seek to prevent all change is neither socially desirable nor economically justifiable. We must simply aim to recognise the trade-offs and to get the balance right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Success depends, not only on a favourable external environment, but also on correct domestic macro-economic policies. We now know that expansionary fiscal policies, especially when they are financed by massive external borrowing, <Col N="668" /> do not work.  While they may give a temporary boost to demand and employment, they lead to balance of payments deficits, put upward pressure on interest rates, create domestic inflationary pressure and, eventually, force higher taxes upon us.  In the final analysis, such policies crowd out private investment, undermine competitiveness and price away jobs.  Whatever short-term gain that is obtained in terms of employment and demand is undoubtedly quickly lost.  This is a scenario we were all too familiar with up to the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it was only after the budgetary problems were seriously tackled that confidence began to be restored in this economy. In turn, as interest rates began to fall, inflation reached a 30-year low, and international competitiveness began to improve.  Employment then started to expand and unemployment to fall.  As we all know, this process has gathered momentum in 1988 and 1989.  Our growth rate has exceeded the EC average since 1987 while our EBR has been reduced from almost 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to about 3½ per cent this year.  Employment in the private sector, the main vehicle for sustainable jobs, has shown strong growth of between 30,000 and 40,000 in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Since joining the EC we have learnt very useful but at times costly lessons about how we, as an open economy, should conduct macro-economic policy. We are now seeing positive results from the application of these lessons during the past few years.</P>
    <P>We know that the key to economic success in a small open economy such as ours is competitiveness and flexibility. Again I cannot stress this sufficiently.  If we are competitive, others will want to buy our goods and Ireland will be an attractive location for investment.  In this way we sustain the productive cycle which generates further increases in output and more jobs.  The Government have a very important role to play in fostering competitiveness, but they cannot do what is necessary by themselves. The response of other sectoral interests is also essential to improving <Col N="669" /> our competitiveness.  Wage moderation is vital in this regard.</P>
    <P>We all know of the invaluable contribution which the national understanding, between the Government and the social partners, has made to our economic recovery.  The recommendations of the NESC report &ldquo;Strategy for Development&rdquo; were incorporated into the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and thus underpinned the successful macro-economic policies being pursued by Government. These policies are not the offspring of any ideology, rather they are based on practical necessity and have the full support of the social partners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the NESC's view that in order to maintain an environment conducive to growth the consensus embodied in the national understanding must be continued and deepened.  The NESC's view that a domestic environment which encourages growth and enterprise is a significant requirement for success in the completed market is one that few will dissent from.  It is clear that this requires responsible Government, which can demonstrably provide the type of sound macro-economic management that has been pursued over the past few years.  The Government's response to the challenges posed by 1992 is crucial because of the bearing it has on the response of the social partners.</P>
    <P>Changes which increase the exposure of the economy to external forces must be accompanied by measures which increase the internal efficiency of the Irish economy. This can be done most effectively through co-operation, and so a most important aspect of strengthening the economic environment is the continuation of the current consensus which exists between the social partners and Government.</P>
    <P>The real message from the figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office has been lost on some of the participants in today's debate.  That message is that our economy now has a job creating potential of which few thought it capable.  Over the two years to April last it delivered a net increase in <Col N="670" /> sustainable jobs of at least 30,000, that is 15,000 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy listens he will recognise the truth of what I am saying.  The manufacturing sector, which had been widely written off as a source of employment growth, moreover, provided 6,000 of these extra jobs.  The indicators available for the period since last April, in fact, show that employment is still rising strongly.  There were 2,000 more at work in manufacturing in June than in March.  Employment in the building industry, that time-honoured barometer of the domestic economy, is also on the up-an-up.  The larger firms, which is all that the recent statistics cover, have some 2,500 more workers now than a year ago.  Job loss has been the bane of our employment performance in the eighties, and the sharp fall in its incidence this year &mdash; down 40 per cent in the first nine months &mdash; is especially welcome. This indeed proves, if proof were needed, that conditions are now more favourable to employment in all sectors than they have been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This remarkable turnaround in the underlying employment situation is due, without question, to the courageous decisions taken in March 1987 and followed up since, in the face of criticism from the benches opposite.  We never made any secret of the fact that if this economy was to be enabled to grow the disastrous budgetary situation had to be remedied, and that this inevitably meant fewer jobs in the public service.  We took no satisfaction in what had to be done, but we knew it was essential if there was ever to be growth in the number of self-sustaining jobs.  The experience of the early eighties, when the issue was avoided and an effort was made to save jobs in the public sector, at the cost of incurring insupportable debts and levying heavier taxes with which Deputy Bruton is familiar, shows that this is not the way to increase employment.  The gain of 10,000 in total employment over the past two <Col N="671" /> years may be modest but it is a dramatic improvement on the drop in the number at work over the preceding seven years: 76,000, or an annual fall of 11,000.</P>
    <P>The growth in self-sustaining jobs in the private sector is a clear vindication of the Government's economic strategy, and of the responsible attitude of our partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It shows, whatever the critics may say, that the renewal of economic growth on a sustainable basis is yielding the employment benefits we expected. There is no denying the enormity of the challenge we all face, given the scale of the inflow of new job-seekers.</P>
    <P>This year's prospective growth rate of 4 per cent will ensure that the number at work rises further from last April's level. I am confident that, with the continuing upswing in the private sector, and the impact of the necessary cutbacks in public employment diminishing, the net employment situation will improve progressively over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The continuation of the current macro-economic strategy is a necessary condition for growth and employment, particularly as we approach 1992 and the completion of the internal market.  There is, of course, a danger that the benefits of internal market completion will be distributed unevenly, with the greatest benefits accruing to regions in which industries with economies of scale and highly innovative industries predominate. The main benefits may flow to the centre, with the weaker and peripheral sectors losing out.  The NESC report argues that the structural funds, as currently constituted, will not be sufficient to create convergence, let alone establish equality, in regional economic structures and incomes.  The Government share that view.  However, the increased level of funding available from the Structural Funds will, of course, make a significant contribution to our economic development.</P>
    <P>On 20 September last the Commission of the European Communities allocated <Col N="672" /> a total of 36.2 billion ECU to the Objective I Regions of the European Community. Ireland's share of this initial allocation amounts to £2.86 billion.  An allocation of a proportionate amount from the reserve retained by the Commission for Community initiatives will give Ireland an amount in excess of £3 billion which would be consistent with a doubling of our EC commitments by 1993.</P>
    <P>The allocation made to Ireland will represent a major boost for our economic development prospects.  Discussions on the completion of the Community Support Framework for Ireland are now virtually concluded and formal approval by the Commission is expected shortly.  The Community Support Framework will be published after it has been approved by the Commission.  Discussions on the operational programmes are now taking place between the European Commission and the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to a lack of Community involvement.  The Government have also been anxious to ensure that sub-regional representatives be given a real role in overseeing the implementation of the plan and supporting programmes.  This is essential if progress in meeting our economic development needs, as outlined in the plan, is to be achieved in a balanced way.  In the negotiations with the EC Commission on drawing up the Community Support Framework, to govern disbursements from the Structural Funds over the period to 1993, considerable attention has been given to devising appropriate monitoring arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Government considered that the sub-regional and advisory working groups should be maintained and should have a role in monitoring the implementation of the plan and programmes.  The Commission shared this view and I am pleased to say that the monitoring arrangements envisaged in the Community Support Framework include provision for sub-regional review committees comprising the existing <Col N="673" /> advisory and working groups.  These sub-regional review committees will meet on a regular basis to consider reports detailing progress to date and measures proposed in or significantly affecting the subregion concerned.  The sub-regional review committees may convey views on any aspect of implementation of the plan and programmes to an overall review committee which will include representatives of the Commission, and which will be responsible for overseeing the implemetation of the Community Support Framework.  My Department will be responsible for ensuring that the sub-regional review committees are kept informed.</P>
    <P>I believe these arrangements meet the requirement for a genuine involvement at sub-regional level in monitoring the implementation of measures under the Structural Funds.  They will guarantee representatives of the sub-regions up-to-date information on a regular basis, regular contact with the Government Departments and State agencies responsible for implementation of measures, and access to the Commission, through the Commission's involvement in the monitoring committees, should the need arise.</P>
    <P>The NESC report presents a coherent and well thought-out strategy for the development of a Community which, even now, is slowly but surely advancing towards full economic and monetary union.  In addressing this issue, the report is challenging, even radical.  The approach it advocates is founded upon the premise that a successful EMU requires Community wide intervention mechanisms and, in particular, a much greater role than exists at present for the Community budget.</P>
    <P>From our point of view the report was most timely.  It offers a useful adjunct to the Delors report on economic and monetary union in the European Community. Indeed, in many ways it goes well beyond the confines of that report. In this debate tonight, however, I should like to concentrate on the ground common to both reports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> The two reports are united on one crucial matter, viz. that EMU will not be successful unless based on and accompanied by greater economic cohesion.  To this end, the Delors report clearly recognises that Community policies in the regional and structural field are necessary in order to promote an optimum allocation of resources and to spread welfare gains throughout the Community.  This is a clear recognition that people matter in the Community, not just statistics.  The importance of this awareness in the Delors report should not be underestimated.  The members of the committee which produced the document came from widely differing backgrounds and philosophies and the fact that the report was agreed unanimously gives it an added strength and significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis of the fundamental requirements of economic and monetary integration which is put forward in the NESC report is very useful and will provide a valuable input to our overall negotiating position.  However, we need to remember that the Delors report is likely to be the reference framework within which the Community debate on EMU will be established at the outset.  We shall endeavour to expand that framework, but that can only be attempted if we provide a solid basis for our future work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has happened at Community level since the Delors report was published last April.  The European Council <Col N="675" /> meeting in Madrid last June acknowledged the report as a good basis for further work and determined that the first stage of EMU would begin on July 1990. Work on that first stage, which primarily involves closer co-operation in the economic and monetary areas, is already well advanced.  Indeed, decisions in the relevant areas are close to being finalised. Regarding the latter stages of EMU, a high-level group composed of representatives from Finance and Foreign Affairs Ministries is at present considering the main issues which will need to be addressed in the context of the intergovernmental conference which will eventually meet to consider the Treaty changes required in the final stages of EMU.  Ireland is participating actively within this group and, indeed, within all the relevant fora.</P>
    <P>When the NESC report was published, there seemed to be a suggestion among commentators that Ireland, until then, did not really have a strategy directed towards the wider goal of European economic and monetary integration.  Looking through the debate I note that Deputy Bruton and Deputy Noonan, among others, echoed this view.  That, of course, is and was absurd.  We have had a clear position on the matter all along based on a vision that saw the benefits for the Community as a whole but was equally alert to the dangers for the poorer regions.  Our response to the Delors report has been very positive and rooted in the two balances outlined in that report, namely, the need for balance between developments in the economic and monetary spheres, and the need for an effective policy to promote balanced development throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The requirements of pragmatism and parallelism in the policy approach to EMU are vital.  That is why we have cautioned against too rapid an advance in either the monetary or economic area at the expense of the other.  This caution derives not from any lack of support for the concept of union but from our firm belief that any move into the relatively <Col N="676" /> unknown must be made with due care and circumspection and with an eye to the balances essential to the process. Detailed preparatory work, which inevitably takes time, is required if the union is to be well constructed and built on secure foundations.  If this course is not followed, the danger of failure would be greater as would the risk to the advances already made by the Community.</P>
    <P>Our support for closer economic and monetary integration is at once principled and pragmatic.  There will be gains but there will also be losses.  Our concern is to maximise the former and to minimise the latter.  We are deeply aware of the problems which our peripheral status may pose for us in a more integrated Community.  For this reason, we have stressed, and will continue to stress, the need to promote measures which are designed to strengthen economic and social cohesion within the Community. In making this emphasis, we are not isolated. We have the support of the Treaty itself as amended by the Single European Act.  Our concerns in this are not, however, narrow and sectional.  The welfare of the Community as a whole &mdash; and I mean the European Community &mdash; demands that all its constituent parts experience broadly similar standards of living and enjoy, to the full, the benefits which will spring from closer integration. Thus convergence of levels of development is as essential to the durability and sustainability of EMU as convergence of budgetary balances, inflationary trends, levels of indebtedness, etc.</P>
    <P>In raising our voice in favour of EMU in the various Community fora, it is important that we demonstrate our support for the ideal itself.  We must not give the impression that we favour it only in so far as we see it as a source of additional transfer payments.  That would be counterproductive and, indeed, would do less than justice to our actual position.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister of State for European Affairs have already referred to the Government's support for the development of the EC budget.  The Government concur with this NESC view that the EC budget should be developed, <Col N="677" /> concomitant with the extension of Community policies.  Not all of our partners in the European Community share that view.  Our task in the years ahead must be to convince them of the correctness of our approach.</P>

    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Noonan suggested in this debate, the stance taken by the Government on indirect tax harmonisation &mdash; perhaps Deputy Bruton <Col N="678" /> agrees with us; I do not know whether that is the case &mdash; has been coherent and consistent.  We have participated positively in all the discussions and have demonstrated throughout our willingness to work towards a position that would accord with the needs of the internal market while safeguarding our vital budgetary and economic interests.  It is noteworthy that, while Deputy Noonan had much to say on this topic, he was short of views or advice as to how Ireland's problems on harmonisation might be overcome.  In fact, his comments displayed a total lack of understanding of the process of negotiation under way and of the Government's responsibility to protect the economic and financial interests of this country.</P>
    <P>Some would have had us endorse and implement the earlier Commission's VAT and excise proposals from the word go, even though it was abundantly clear that no other member state was prepared to jump in at the deep end in this way &mdash; as many Opposition Deputies had suggested &mdash; and that these proposals did not in fact constitute a viable basis for a Community agreement.  Would that not have been a terribly foolish thing to have done, jump in at the start without anybody else, and then find that those proposals were not acceptable to other member states?</P>

      <P>In these circumstances it would have been nothing short of folly for us to have implemented the earlier proposals when so much is at stake for this country.  In the same way we must not plump unilaterally for the package now being put forward. Decisions to be taken in this area could have a crucial bearing on our scope over the medium term, to continue our programme of reducing borrowing and debt while, at the same time, achieving our objectives for lower rates of personal taxation. Unlike NESC, Deputy Noonan fails to make the crucial connections between tax harmonisation and these other policy objectives.  He has not even considered the implications of the savings tax and its present position in Brussels. He left it aside and forgot about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We come now to the sums involved which are very large indeed.  On quite realistic assumptions my Department calculate that the revenue loss for Ireland in the latest proposals could be of the order of £600 million annually.  That is on the basis that, under the Commission's revised approach &mdash; and in the absence of frontier controls &mdash; we would have little alternative but to approximate our VAT and excise rates very closely with those obtaining in the United Kingdom if we were not to suffer a major distortion of trade.  The NESC report is in agreement with that analysis.  While the figure of £600 million is different from earlier estimates prepared by my Department there is in fact no inconsistency between the two forecasts.  The earlier forecast was based on different assumptions that derived from the 1987 Commission proposals. The Deputy can figure that one out; I stress the 1987 proposals, not the latest ones.  That is where the Deputy is getting the two different figures and two different sets of proposals.  Of course, as a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton should know well that the Department do not produce fancy figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The £600 million figure is consistent with the new approach in the latest Commission proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Deputy Bruton should recognise that that figure represents approximately 3 per cent of our GNP and should not be brushed aside as he would like to do. Clearly, of course, precise costings cannot be finalised until the Commission has brought forward its new proposals on excise rates which are expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The Commission's new approach is intended to give flexibility, by setting only minimum rates of VAT and excise, so that member states could select the rates they want.  However, the reality is more complicated.  A member state could suffer huge trade and budgetary losses, with severe damage to its economy, if its rates were kept significantly above those of neighbouring countries and, at the same time, its border controls were removed completely for commercial trade and purchases by private individuals. Some way has to be found to avoid such budgetary losses.  Either the proposals must be modified or other measures must be built into them to help countries such as Ireland.  While the problem is most severe in our case, due to the land frontier with the UK, some other countries have similar problems.  Indeed as I said at my most recent meeting of ECOFIN, if we had nothing but water between us and the UK, perhaps it would be quite easy to solve a lot of the problems we are now encountering.</P>
    <P>In the ongoing negotiations we are actively seeking solutions that will allow the objectives of the internal market to be achieved without imposing such damage on our economy.  Our clear preference would be if the package could be modified so as to enable us to approximate our rates with those in the UK. There must be a fair distribution of the burden of adjustment between the various countries.  Some member states, and indeed Deputy Bruton and Deputy Noonan seem to concur with this, suggest that all the adjustments must be from those with the high rates down to whatever might suit other members.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on Tuesday, 24 October 1989:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to provide an adequate dental service to medical card holders, with particular reference to the lack of provision of dental maintenance and dentures for adults and the extremely long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment; and calls on the Government to meet its obligations under the Health Act, 1970 to urgently provide a proper national dental service. </P>

    <P>&ldquo;notes the recent announcement by the Minister for Health of the distribution of £300,000 in the current year to commence the treatment of 500 priority orthodontic cases and commends the resolve of the Minister for Health to concentrate further resources on improving the dental services generally in 1990 and subsequent years&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said a few things in relation to the fact that we had started off the new Dáil session with yet <Col N="683" /> another Private Members' motion devoted to the health services.  The fact that that is the case is an indication that the crisis in the health services that I and my party have underlined for three years still exists despite the very clear message given by the electorate in the June election. Despite the shock given to the Fianna Fáil Government and the belated awareness of the Taoiseach that a crisis exists in the delivery of the health services, precious little has been done in the intervening few months to put a halt to the crisis or to redirect significant or relevant funding to the areas of need in the health services.  Once again we will face into a Dáil session where week after week it will be necessary for us on the Opposition benches to point out to the Minister the responsibility which he has so obviously neglected.</P>
      <P>Last night I listed a number of cases to give a vivid example of the crisis that exists in the delivery of dental services. The evidence I cited related to one narrow aspect, orthodontics for children. I listed children who are in dire need with no hope of treatment, whose parents are in despair and I read letters from health workers who are unable to provide the service and who are forced to write to parents in the terms I described last night. Because of time allowed tonight I will not reiterate those cases, but children of 11, 12 and 14 who urgently need dental care simply have not that facility available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Minister agreeing last night that the dental care system was inadequate and despite further agreeing that additional funding must be found, what funds has the Minister found and what money has he provided?  The Minister has provided £300,000 to cater for 500 priority cases in orthodontics, when in my area alone there are 700 on the waiting list.  One can realise the waiting list throughout the country.  Every health board is forced to implement a draconian system whereby priorities are arrived at and two out of every three children presenting themselves are denied a service because they are not judged to be severe <Col N="684" /> enough or acute enough in their needs. An additional £200,000 is to be provided for water fluoridation.  That is the Minister's total response.  It is not good enough to address the problem which the Minister is surely aware of by now.</P>
    <P>Last night I was beginning to look at the report on health funding in so far as it dealt with dental services.  Basically, the commission recognise that the scheme is in crisis and acknowledge that the health boards are failing in their statutory obligation under section 67 of the Health Act, 1970 to provide dental treatment for eligible adults.  The report was a disappointing one but some of the statistics that were published in the report are most revealing.  The total cost of the schemes has risen from almost £9 million in 1979 to over £25 million in 1987, but the number of people treated by health board dentists has risen in the same period from 213,000 to 380,000 and the number of claims under PRSI dental benefit has risen from 150,000 to 308,000.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the scheme at least provides value for money for the State.  There is no other service where so many people can be treated for so little money.  That is the good news.  The bad news, confirmed by the commission report, is that most adults now treated under the schemes can only get emergency treatment as a result of the growing size of the waiting lists.  In the four years covered from 1983 to 1987 the number of cases where treatment was confined to emergencies only goes from one-third of all cases to precisely two-thirds of all cases. The commission in response recommended the abolition of the PRSI scheme and the transfer of funds to the health boards, the employment of more dental auxiliaries and the introduction of charges. Then, of course, the whole system could be taken over by the new administrative structures proposed by the commission. This response is typical of a commission that is committed to the notion that we can run a health service without a single extra penny being spent on it.  It is a ludicrous approach in the face of the major crisis that is clear to everybody in the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I wholeheartedly support many of the recommendations in the Commission report.  I support the notion recommended in the report at page 228, chapter 14.3.6 which recommends the appointment of dental hygienists for health education, hygiene instruction, the application of fluoride solutions and fissure sealants and cleaning and polishing of teeth.  The Minister has pointed out that since the enactment of the Dentists Act, 1985, that is possible and I know he is taking some steps to bring dental hygienists into the system.</P>

I support the fluoridation of water, fissure sealants and all the positive recommendations but the bottom line has to be that the service demands and deserves more funding.  We have already pointed out that the system has saved more than £6 million because of the dental dispute and this should be put back into the system.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith páirteach anocht sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo faoi sheirbhísí fiaclóireachta ár dtíre.  I am very pleased to come in here tonight to participate in this important debate.  I have listened with great interest to the Opposition speakers last night and again tonight.  Listening to them you would think there was no dental service at all as they have painted a very black picture indeed.  We are well aware that there are problems.  Indeed why else <Col N="686" /> would the Minister have established the working group to review the delivery of dental services last year.  There are nevertheless many positive aspects to the health board dental services at present.</P>
      <P>There are about a third of a million attendances by children at the health board dental clinics every year.  Until recently the different health boards had different methods for selecting children for treatment.  Some boards used a school-based system, where they visited the schools on a rotational basis and screened all the children before setting up a course of treatment for those who had caries or other problems.  Other health boards target specific classes and screen all the children in those classes.</P>
      <P>One health board has relied on selfreferral by patients.  This last approach has been less than satisfactory, because it is widely believed that some children never visit the dentist because the parents may not put dental treatment high on the priority list for whatever reason &mdash; lack of knowledge of its importance, bad family circumstances or otherwise.  It was in the light of this problem that the working group recommended a standardised approach, based on the targeting of specific classes.  The working group recommended that first and sixth classes should be the target classes but on reflection it became obvious that in most instances second class would be more appropriate because at that age the first molars would have grown.  As a result of this recommendation, the health boards have now adopted this approach to the delivery of dental services for children. The Eastern Health Board which had the self-referral method is piloting the new approach in three community care areas.</P>
      <P>In this health board area it will of course be necessary to re-educate the parents to come to accept that this new approach is more advantageous to the population at large and that their children will be examined and treated at the appropriate times rather than on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some health boards have already introduced fissure sealant programmes.  The application of fissure sealants to the <Col N="687" /> molars reduces the incidence of dental decay in those teeth and as these are the teeth most prone to decay the application of the sealants can help to keep the mouth decay free.  We are hopeful that more health boards will introduce fissure sealant programmes to the routine treatment programme of the second class children.</P>
    <P>In targeting the sixth class group, the health board dental service can ensure that each child is made dentally fit before he leaves the care of the public dental service.</P>
    <P>I cannot talk about children's dental services without referring to the tremendous improvement in the dental health of our children which was noted in the national survey of children's dental health.  The survey found that there was a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries in all our children. However, that decrease was most significant in the children who had been lifetime residents of fluoridated areas.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another great success story of the health board dental service &mdash; the water fluoridation programme which celebrates its silver anniversary this year &mdash; 25 years which have seen this country as a European pioneer of the addition of fluorides to the public piped water supplies.</P>
    <P>This major contribution to oral health was not introduced without a considerable amount of opposition, which some Deputies may remember.  But it is clear that those who were far-sighted enough and determined enough to push ahead with its introduction have been fully vindicated.</P>
    <P>To listen to the Opposition here last night, you would get the impression that the water fluoridation programme was a shambles.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  About 65 per cent of the population are served by water supplies which are fluoridated.  I must emphasise that it is not possible to fluoridate every water supply and, as I speak, every water supply which is suitable for fluoridation has had a fluoridation plant installed.  Some supplies are too small.  We consider it viable <Col N="688" /> to fluoridate supplies which serve a population of over 1,000 persons.  Some supplies have a number of water sources, which make the installation of fluoridation plant impossible.  However as every small supply or group of water supplies is replaced by a new regional water scheme, the water fluoridation plant is installed, bringing the benefits of fluoridation to an increasing number of people.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out yesterday, we have made an additional £200,000 available this year to the health boards for projects in connection with the water fluoridation programme.  The health boards were asked for their own proposals in this regard.  In some cases they wanted to fund new schemes, in other cases they found it necessary to purchase stand-by plant &mdash; new pumps to serve in the event of pump failure.  At this moment the health boards are engaged in the purchase and installation of this new equipment.  In drawing up their plans for the present year, they were also asked for their needs for the coming few years and thus we have been able to draw together the material to enable us to put together a strategic plan for the further development of the water fluoridation programme in the future.</P>
    <P>In talking about the water fluoridation programme, I feel compelled to refer to the improvements in the results returned by the health boards in recent years.  In 1988, over 80 per cent of tests taken showed fluoride levels of at least 0.7 parts per million.  Four years previously only 67 per cent of tests reached this broadly acceptable fluoride level.</P>
    <P>In many areas where the water supplies are unsuitable for fluoridation for the reasons I have already instanced, the health boards have introduced and maintain fluoride mouth-rinsing programmes. These target in on school children and are usually administered in the classroom setting.  When the new grade of dental hygienist is introduced to the health board dental service there will be scope for a further extension of the mouth-rinsing programmes, which must be administered under close supervision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Much has been said here about the orthondontic service.  The Opposition have put forward a figure of 24,000 awaiting treatment.  The most recent figure is that there are 12,250 children awaiting orthodontic treatment.  Of course, the fact that such a number of children are still on the waiting lists is far from satisfactory. Many of these children are awaiting the most expensive fixed appliance therapy.  Again there is an on-going orthodontic programme in all health boards.</P>
    <P>All dentists can fit the basic removable orthodontic appliances, which can be used to treat the more basic orthodontic conditions.</P>
    <P>It is when we come to the more complicated treatments using the fixed appliance that the services of a consultant orthodontist are required to advise on, oversee and on some occasions actually carry out the treatment.  The House is well aware of the difficulties which have been experienced in attracting consultant orthodontists to the health board dental service.  The high rewards available in private practice are well known.  Because of these problems we have decided to reexamine the conditions attached to the post before we re-advertise them.</P>
    <P>You will also be aware that the one consultant orthodontist in the health board service is involved in the provision of a training programme for a number of health board dentists who will reach specialist level.  There are two trainee consultant orthodontists in the Dublin dental school and it is known that there are eight Irish trainees in higher training pathways in orthodontics in the United Kingdom at present.  It is understood that many of these are interested in returning to Ireland in the future.  Thus the long-term availability of highly qualified orthodontists looks very promising.  Rather than the gloomy picture painted by the Opposition spokespersons, I want to emphasise that the problems are recognised, the solutions &mdash; the long-term solutions &mdash; have been determined and we are now taking decisive action.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already told the House that the Government have made <Col N="690" /> £300,000 available to the health boards to enable the treatment of 500 top priority cases to begin immediately.  These cases will supplement the cases already underway in the health boards.  Indeed it may well be that the Opposition are unaware that about 5,000 children conclude courses of orthodontic treatment provided by the health boards each year.  A full course of treatment can take as much as two years and thus there are many thousands of children under treatment at any one time.  This fact, too, I want to emphasise.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I are, of course, confident that, in the future, as recruitment problems are solved there will be a great improvement in the level of the orthodontic service, which the health boards can provide.  In the meantime, we are confident that the health boards will continue to use the guidelines, issued by the Department of Health to ensure that priority in the provision of treatment is granted to those children, who have the most serious handicapping conditions.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there have in recent times been some problems in relation to the highly sophisticated orthodontic treatment required by children who have been born with a cleft lip and palate and we are actively reviewing this service at present.</P>
    <P>The dental hospitals also make a major contribution to the health board dental services.  The two hospitals, in Dublin and Cork, provide routine treatment for adults and children as part of the training programme for undergraduate dentists. Specialist services are provided for particularly difficult cases.  Each year about 28,000 patient visits are made to Cork Dental Hospital and about 75,000 patient visits are made to the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in excess of 100,000 people are treated at these two dental hospitals each year in the public sector.  At this point I wish to pay special tribute to the directors and staff of these two dental hospitals.  I saw at first hand recently the tremendous work being done in the Dublin Dental Hospital, in the public sector, with regard to education, research <Col N="691" /> and science and AIDS patients.  We can be proud of the tremendous cadre of professional staff who work in these two hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition, the senior lecturer consultants in Dublin are involved in the training of health board dentists in orthodontics. Special arrangements are also provided for the treatment of AIDS patients, haemophiliacs, and other special categories.  The Cork Dental Hospital provides a special clinic for the treatment of the handicapped who require special conditions for their dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Dentists Act, 1985, the dental council was introduced to replace the dental board.  The council has more far-reaching powers than the old board.  It also has a wider membership.  The council regulates the dental profession.  It also has powers to create classes of dental auxiliary and to specify the training required by persons seeking registration.</P>
    <P>The council began its deliberations on the creation of grades of auxiliary dental workers by looking at the grade of dental hygienist.  A hygienist can carry out a number of procedures such as the scaling and polishing of teeth, the provision of education in dental hygiene, the application of fissure sealants, the administration of fluoride mouth rinsing programmes and other services.  In some countries the hygienist can also administer fillings.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for the dental council under the Act to specify the tasks which is considers appropriate for the dental hygienists to fulfil in Ireland.  The Opposition last night asserted that the newly registered dental hygienists would be confined to the private dental sector.  This is not our policy.</P>

      <P>There is an important role for hygienists in the health boards, not merely providing dental hygiene instruction but also in the administration of many of the preventive dental programmes such as fluoride mouth rinsing and the application of fissure sealants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the fact that the working party on the elderly made a recommendation in relation to the establishment of a class of denturist <Col N="693" /> who would supply dentures directly to the public.  If, of course, the dental council were to create a class of denturist then the position would change.  Under the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1985, it would be possible for the dental council, with the Minister's approval, to establish such a class of dental auxiliary.  As I said earlier, the dental council has been given the Minister's approval to proceed with the establishment of dental hygienists. However, the position with regard to other classes of auxiliary dental workers, including denturists, has yet to be clarified by the council.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, the creation of grades of auxiliary dental worker is cost effective in that it releases the dentist to carry out the highly skilled tasks and permits the auxiliary to concentrate on carrying out the often time consuming but less specialised tasks appropriate to the grade.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House last night that he has the question of allocating funds, specifically for the provision of a routine dental service for adults, under review at the moment.  We are all aware that that adult dental service has been fraught with problems for years. Indeed it was on account of the adult dental service, or lack of it, that the present Taoiseach established a working party back in 1977, to review the delivery of dental services.  That working party recommended the use of dentists in private practice to treat eligible adults.  The acceptance of the recommendation led to the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme whereby eligible adults were referred by the health boards to the dentist of their choice, from among those who had agreed to provide services for the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At its peak, about 32,000 persons received treatment annually under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme.  However the health boards found that the scheme was very expensive to operate and that it was eroding funds required to maintain the other health board dental services, notably the services for children.  The <Col N="694" /> main problem stemmed from the age treatment need of the medical card population. A particularly high percentage of applicants required dentures.  Indeed the cost of providing a full course of dental treatment under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme was considerably higher than the cost of an average course of treatment under the Department of Social Welfare's dental benefit scheme, because although the fee scale under the two schemes is identical, the treatment need of the medical card population is much greater and in particular the need for dentures is very great and, therefore, the scheme was very expensive to operate.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out last evening, the health boards have now almost entirely curtailed their use of dentists in private practice to treat eligible adults.  In order to maintain the services for children they find themselves unable to provide routine dental treatment on demand for adults.  Indeed, in most areas they can only provide emergency treatment for the alleviation of pain.  Where the health board dental surgeons have spare work capacity, they provide limited routine treatment for persons in high priority groups such as the elderly and pregnant and nursing women.  We are aware that this situation is inadequate &mdash; but it is not a new problem.  It is a problem that has been growing through successive Governments.  However, this Minister and I are committed to seeking a solution to the problem and will continue to give the fullest consideration to the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the working group chaired by our Government colleague, Deputy Terry Leyden.  As with the orthodontic problem, we cannot hope to have an instant success but we are committed to the goal of a steady improvement in our dental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, I do not think there is cause for the depressing picture which the Opposition paint of the dental services. We continue to provide a good service for children.  We have in place a number of preventative measures, including our highly successful and much praised water fluoridation service.  We have put in place <Col N="695" /> the first measures to tackle the problems of the large numbers awaiting highly sophisticated fixed appliance orthodontic therapy.  We are aware that there is a need to provide additional funds and we accept that.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to the Opposition speakers.  I have seen their attitude while we were in Government in the last two and a half years and since we came back into Government a few months ago.  Deputy Howlin and his party said we need £245 million more for this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The admission by the Minister for Health in this debate last night that our public dental service was not providing the full range of treatment procedures which eligible people need is a shameful indictment of the appalling record of successive Governments in this vital health area.  It is important to emphasise that dental health is not a minor health issue or a cosmetic exercise. Apart from causing considerable pain and discomfort, poor dental health can damage the overall health of an individual through digestive problems and leave people prone to infection.  Dental health and dental care should form an essential part of an overall health system particularly for our children.  Instead, our dental services have been very much the poor relation of the overall health service.</P>
      <P>The public dental service has never been allowed to develop properly because it was starved of adequate cash and resources and the development of the service for insured workers and their dependants has been blocked by the vested interests of the dental profession. When speaking last night the Minister said that it is doubtful if such a level of service could ever be obtained given the need to prioritise the essential services in the context of our resources.  He said that in that context it was never intended that the service provided for under the Act would be provided for in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does that Act say?  Section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, says that a health board shall make dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, ophthalmic and aural appliances available for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility.  Subsection (2) of section <Col N="697" /> 67 says that a health board shall make available without charge a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending a national school or a school to which this section had been applied under the subsection.  In this State at present children who have been assessed and deemed in need of dental treatment are kept on that waiting list until they leave the national school and consequently they do not get the dental treatment that they are entitled to under that Act.  That is happening in the community care area I represent.  That is not an exaggeration of the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the working group.  What did the working group established by him in 1988 say?  The working group strongly recommended the adoption of a national strategy for the delivery of dental services to ensure that an equal standard of service is available to all persons.  Can we say that that is the case at the moment?  On page 13 of that document it says that the working group believe it is desirable to initiate a more structured approach to the health board dental service and that at present there are wide variations between health boards and even within health boards in their approach to the delivery of dental services.  The working group strongly recommended the adoption of a national strategy for the delivery of dental services to ensure that an equal standard of service would be available to all eligible persons.</P>
    <P>The last report we got in the community care area in which I reside was at the end of 1987.  Referring to national school children it said that the interval between school inspections is far too long and this delay gives rise to demands for emergency treatment for children in such schools still waiting to be seen and this provision of emergency treatment means there is less time for the school programme. The result is that the numbers needing treatment get larger.  That is the situation we have at present.</P>
    <P>It states in the same report, and this was referred to by the Minister, that for many years the service operated by default on a priority basis and the service <Col N="698" /> to adults has never achieved a high rating. In 1981 an <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme was introduced whereby the treatment of adults was referred to private dentists on a fee per item basis similar to the Department of Social Welfare scheme and the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme was suspended in the board's area in 1984 for financial reasons.  If that was the case, is the Minister carrying out the obligation that he has under the Health Act, 1970, to provide dental treatment for people with full or limited eligibility?  The present situation is that a person who may be badly in need of dental treatment must first go to a general practitioner.  The general practitioner has to state that for the person's health it is urgent and necessary that the service be provided by the board. That is not good enough and that type of dental service is not acceptable.  The Department of Health guidelines on orthodontic treatment should be scrapped. When young people are recommended for orthodontic treatment it is invariably stated that it is merely cosmetic and thus does not come within the guidelines.  This creates great problems for parents and young people.  The Minister's representatives on the board of the health board area which I represent have been very vocal on this matter and I am surprised that they have not brought it to his attention long ago.  I suggest that such guidelines should be withdrawn and a more realistic approach to orthodontic treatment for children should be adopted.</P>
    <P>It is not as if successive Ministers for Health have been unaware of the problems in the dental service.  The Workers' Party have repeatedly raised the issue and in Parliamentary Questions have drawn attention to the appalling extent of waiting lists.  For example on 6 December 1988 the Minister gave Deputy De Rossa details on the number of children awaiting treatment at health centres in the Eastern Health Board area.  In some clinics, Blessington for instance, the waiting period was 20 months and in Blanchardstown, Dublin, there were no fewer than 3,000 children awaiting treatment and in the Roselawn clinic in Naas there <Col N="699" /> were 1,600 on the waiting list.  It is not only under Fianna Fáil that these difficulties have arisen because in 1985 when Fine Gael and Labour were in Coalition the then Minister for Health disclosed that there were more than 12,000 children awaiting dental treatment for up to two years in the South-Eastern Health Board area and that in the Western Health Board area 11,000 children were waiting between 12 and 18 months for treatment, and in the community care area that I represent, which is just one section of County Cork, there are 3,000 on waiting lists this very day.  These people are entitled to the service under sections 66 and 67 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Workers who pay significant sums in PRSI are statutorily entitled to a certain level of dental service.  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that this service is provided.  The members of the Irish Dental Association are clearly far more interested in protecting their economic interests than in promoting the dental health of the public.  Their blackmail must be resisted.</P>
    <P>The cost of dental treatment needs to be addressed urgently.  Fees charged for private treatment can vary enormously. In many cases the waiting time for public treatment is so long that people have no alternative but to seek private treatment. The Irish Dental Association does not have a recommended standard rate of fees.  The cost of dental care in the Republic is believed to be about twice that charged in Northern Ireland.  It was suggested that dental practice is so lucrative that dentists from Northern Ireland were coming down to set up practice here.  I understand that a dentist in Britain could expect to receive £30 sterling for extracting 32 teeth while a dentist here would be likely to receive £170.  A single filling costs the Department of Social Welfare approximately £8.50, while in Britain the DHSS would pay only £4.80 sterling.  There is similarly a huge gap in the cost of other dental services.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party want an extension <Col N="700" /> and improvement of public dental care together with controls and safeguards in private care.  We favour a totally free dental service for all in the long term with payments to dentists on a capitation system.  We also support the demand for a new dental hospital and for the immediate improvement in the staffing levels, equipment and facilities in the health board clinics.  We also favour the introduction of more trained graduates, who should be required to spend at least one intern year working in the free dental scheme.</P>
    <P>We want to see more emphasis on preventive dental care which would involve routine checks and monitoring of the entire population.  However, this can only be successful within a fully comprehensive system where dental services are freely available to all.  In the short term we believe that the Government should establish a representative commission on dental services whose main remit would be to investigate and report on the fees and charges, the question of coverage and access to adequate services for all citizens; the desirability of price control and the need to adjust the allocation of resources and State subsidies as between public and private provision of such services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude very shortly.  A report produced by the Eastern Health Board painted a dreadful picture of the collapse of the dental service in their area with 35 people, aged 16 or over, in the high priority group waiting up to ten months for treatment, 8,868 adults waiting up to two years for routine treatment and only 84,000 children from a case load of 250,000 receiving treatment in 1988.  There is up to a two-year waiting <Col N="701" /> period for elective surgery such as on impacted teeth and more than 500 cases are awaiting assessment at the Dublin Dental Hospital.  These figures apply to the Eastern Health Board area but a similar service can be found in almost every health board area.  While in theory we have a free dental service for those with medical cards, in practice there is only an extraction service with no preventive care.</P>
      <P>There are many on low incomes who do not have a medical card and are dependent on the dental service for which they have paid through the PRSI.  The Irish Dental Association have been trying to suggest that they are concerned about the plight of those on low incomes and that they object to having to provide free services for well-off people.  In fact only 2 per cent of PRSI claimants earn more than £20,000 and this shows quite clearly that ordinary middle and low income workers are dependent on these services.</P>

      <P>It is not very long ago, immediately prior to the summer recess, that the Minister and the Minister of State tried to defend the state of the health service which we all know, and which the people proved in the General Election, was in a terrible state.  Nonetheless the Minister tried to defend the indefensible.  It is some indictment of the State of the dental service &mdash; and every Deputy in this House agrees with the Minister &mdash; that it is in a state of collapse. Every single one of us has horror stories of children and women waiting for care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are wonderful people, but too few of them.  Too many are attracted into lucrative private practice and are not working in the public health service and I intend to deal with that point.  I think all Deputies in the House know the state the dental services are in.  In every clinic around the country citizens cannot get access to orthodontic care because dentists do not have access to the specialisation necessary.  I understand that in Deputy Roche's constituency or nearby there is a litigation pending by a citizen who is attempting to assert her constitutional right to care under the Health Act.  In my constituency for example, it is estimated, from the latest figures available, that about 400 people are taken off the waiting list every year but some 700 people are added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity at this stage in the debate to refute the argument that orthodontic care is merely elective or cosmetic; it can be a very serious matter for a great number of people.  We now have the situation where the &ldquo;new poor&rdquo;, if I may call them that, cannot afford this <Col N="703" /> treatment while those who are eligible can no longer get access to the service.</P>
    <P>Why is there this crisis in the orthodontic service?  It is simply because orthodontic specialists will not be attracted into the public health service while there is such a lucrative private practice.  Private practice increases the access to cash payments.  It is one of the notorious areas of tax evasion.  It is not subject to retention tax and the more money which is available to these people in the private sector the less attractive the public sector will be.</P>
    <P>I must say I agree with my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, that the dental lobby and the Irish Dental Association in particular, are not in the least interested in the public sector, as the lockout of patients by 75 per cent of their membership proves.  Depriving PRSI workers of tooth extractions unless they pay for them and depriving their spouses entirely of any kind of dental care is scarcely the action of any trade union.  Indeed, an entire generation of women have been neglected as a result of the disgraceful state of our dental services.  It is the utmost in hypocrisy for the dental profession to couch their action in terms of positive discrimination in favour of the poor.  I am in agreement with the Minister on this point.  I regret very much that the commission on funding in the health services seem to have bought the bogus argument that transferring many citizens with PRSI cover eligibility at the moment into the private sector is going to release moneys which can then be better targeted to social welfare recipients and the poorer sections of the community generally.  The only reason the dental association are putting forward that bogus argument is that it will release 1.3 million people into the private pool, thereby enhancing their practice, etc. and further running down the public dental service.</P>
    <P>Equally congratulations should be offered to the minority of dentists who refused to join in this selfish and misdirected action, the dentists who continued to work the system with all its imperfections and dentists who, it seems <Col N="704" /> to me, are badly paid in the public dental service area, and certainly badly paid by comparison with their colleagues in private practice.  Perhaps this point should be addressed directly rather than by way of the Minister's statement last night when he said he was addressing the question of the difficulty of filling posts in the orthodontic area by bringing in amendments to the contracts under which consultant orthodontists are employed by the health boards.  It seems that introducing the common contract system operable for consultants generally throughout the health service is not the way to address this problem.  We will merely have the situation where the element of private practice will predominate and the two tier dental service we have at present will be exacerbated.  I do not think that is the way the Minister should approach this problem.  Dentists should be paid commensurate with whatever it takes to attract the best young dentists into the public health service.</P>
    <P>The Government should address the question of those in the private sector who are using the strike weapon to direct into the private sector PRSI workers, who have been paying insurance all their lives in order to have cover, thereby enhancing the earnings of those dentists operating in that sector.  While earnings in the private sector remain at the level they are at the public sector will always be the poor relation.  The only way to address this problem is through the taxation mechanism where there is wholesale tax evasion.  The professional area is generally acknowledged as one of tax evasion and it is very specifically the case in regard to this particular area.</P>
    <P>Of course, the dental association have always done this.  The Minister should have a discussion on this matter with the Taoiseach who, when he was Minister for Health in 1979, introduced a very worthwhile reform which allowed medical card holders into the social welfare scheme.  That was a very worthwhile reform at the time but it was fought tooth and nail by the dental association and the representatives of the dental lobby.  If the Minister was to take a leaf out of that <Col N="705" /> book there might be some relief from the difficulty we are now in.  How long can this go on?  How much longer can we allow the queues which my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, and others in this House have spoken about to continue? How much agony do young children have to endure before the Minister breaks this log-jam?  Are we going to continue the neglect of an entire generation of women right into the future?  It is a disgraceful situation and unless the Minister tackles the power of the dentists' lobby there will be no improvement in this situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to underline the point about tax evasion and to repeat the policy commitment made by my colleague that the public dental service is under resourced, that more resources will simply have to be made available if the crisis we are in now is going to be successfully addressed.</P>

The agreed programme for Government between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, and a special allocation of £15 million this year for the health service, reflect the anxiety of the Progressive Democrats on this issue.  The programme specifically commits the new Government to taking urgent action which will tackle problems in the area of acute hospital services, with special reference to waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> In that context I am glad to see that the Minister and his Department recognise the extreme problems facing the dental service.  I welcome their action on two fronts, the allocation of an additional £300,000 this year to begin to tackle the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment and the additional money for the extension of the fluoridation of our water system, which I hope will improve oral hygiene.  This service is an excellent one and is paying dividends among children especially since they are most receptive to this kind of oral hygiene.</P>
    <P>Welcome as these measures are, much more is needed in terms of extra financing and improved management if serious progress is to be made in tackling these problems. It is vitally important to ensure the employment of more professional orthodontists by the health boards.  Only one such persons is employed at present in the health service and this is totally inadequate. I urge the Minister as a matter of urgency to employ more people or at least to ensure that such services are provided through the private sector for the 750,000 people who rely solely on the health boards for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are determined during the coming months to try in Government to ensure improvements in the dental service and in the health services generally.  I understand that one million of our people are under the age of 16 years.  It is assumed that at least one-third of them need orthodontic treatment. This is statistical information from an excellent hospital, the Cork Dental Hospital.  I would pay a very special tribute to Professor Hegarty and the tremendous work he is doing there.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the schools inspection service.  It is vital that dental diagnosis should be made at an early stage but the service is practically non-existent in our health board area.  At least school inspection would detect problems at the very beginning.</P>
    <P>Excellent statistical information in the field of dentistry is now available and I would hope for more time on another <Col N="707" /> occasion to engage in a fuller contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the dental services leave a great deal to be desired.  The private service costs are ruinous, as any family person knows.  The public dental service is, as always, the victim of a voracious lobby.  I agree with many of the points I have heard this evening.  The position in regard to orthodontic treatment is extremely disquieting and the news that the Minister is injecting an additional £300,000 for the balance of this year &mdash; effectively it has only a few weeks to run &mdash; to help move some of the more urgent cases from the orthodontic waiting lists is very welcome.  Equally welcome is the news that the Minister intends concentrating further resources on improving the dental services generally in 1990 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Whatever the motivation for the original motion, this debate is welcome in that it affords us a chance to consider what is wrong with the dental service. Fatuous analysis is not sufficient in this regard.  One obvious answer which has been suggested several time tonight is to push endless amounts of additional resources into the services.  Clearly putting more resources into the services is one answer and the Government have given an indication that they are putting in more resources, but in the real world where resources are finite this is a limited answer.  There is a limit beyond which the taxpayer will not go.  For this reason I found much of Deputy Rabbitte's analysis compelling and very interesting.  I do not find myself in disagreement with many of the points he made.  The problems which exist call, however, for a more intelligent and a broader response than politicians simply calling for more money while at the same time pressing for lower taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A first step must be the prioritisation of the services we provide.  If there is a limit we should say honestly what services we intend to deal with as a priority.  We are spreading a very small cake over a very large area and we are not achieving <Col N="708" /> the level of service or penetration, particularly in the public service, that one would desire.  We all know that funds are in short supply and it is untruthful for any of us to suggest that they are not or that they can readily be conjured up from somewhere.  If funds are in short supply they should be concentrated on those areas where they can be used to most effect.  They should be spent to yield £1 in value for every £1 spent.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies present are members of health boards.  Deputy Sherlock referred to the situation in his area and Deputy Rabbitte referred to an issue I have raised in the health board. Many of us who are members of health boards have a great concern as to the value we are getting from the dental service. A clear area of focus is the children's dental service.  The Minister has noted that there has been a maintenance of dental staff numbers in the health boards. The Minister also pointed out that there is now keener competition for positions within the public dental service.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>While we hope those welcome trends will continue, it poses the question as to how the health boards utilise the staff resources which they have.  There is no doubt that a comparison in the throughput of private and public dental health clinics would reach the inescapable conclusion that the throughput from private clinics would be far greater than the throughput from the latter.  The reality is that the throughput from some of our public dental health clinics is lamentably low.  While the waiting lists grow the output has tended over the years to diminish. I am suggesting that tighter management of staff resources within the health boards would help to provide a marginal improvement but nonetheless a very worthwhile improvement.</P>
    <P>More flexibility in how clinics draw their patients is another aspect.  I will illustrate this point by reference to the position in County Wicklow.  As Deputy Sherlock mentioned, the waiting lists at some clincis in Wicklow are absolutely unacceptable.  There is a waiting list of something like 20 months in Blessington <Col N="709" /> and even greater in Bray.  When one examines the statistics right across the health boards one finds vast differences in the length of waiting lists and, therefore, differences in the level of services being provided.  The reduction of the longest lists is within the scope of the existing services if we had more flexibility and better management of resources.  For example, in population centres in County Wicklow such as Bray and Greystones there have grown over the years unacceptable waiting lists and it is not for the want of investment.  I recognise that not only the last Government but preceding Governments invested a great deal of money in a new clinic in the Greystones area but the problem is that there is an inflexibility in the staffing arrangements which means that that clinic is not fully utilised.  At a time when we have waiting lists growing as they are that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is a problem with the professional association and this has been referred to by a number of speakers.  I do not want to be verbal bashing the Dental Association because every organisation will look for a better deal for their members.  While that is to be expected some flexibility should be forthcoming from that organisation.  The second area where there is a screaming need for rationalisation is in the use of dental hygienists and dental auxiliaries. The Minister of State, and the Minister in his contribution last night, referred to that matter.  Many basic services currently provided by trained dentists within the public dental system could be provided by dental hygienists.  I am not sure what Deputy Yates had in mind when he referred to the capacity to train hygienists in Ireland but certainly the staff of the Dublin health clinic, and staff that I have discussed this matter with, are only too anxious and happy to get such a scheme underway but the profession, again, are dragging their heels on that.  Seeking to lay blame at a Minister's door is what politicians do best but in doing that they are helping to confuse the issue and maintain something that is unacceptable.  If in private practice here, and in practice in <Col N="710" /> other developed countries, dental hygienists and auxiliaries can be used for treatment such as the fissure sealant treatment, a valuable treatment for young children which helps to prevent the incidence of dental cares, there is no reason on God's earth why it cannot be done in the public service in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many basic services can be provided by dental hygienists.  We do not employ hygienists and auxiliaries here and I do not see us employing them to anything like the extent we should in the foreseeable future.  Since the Dental Act went on the Statute Book in 1985 it has been possible to employ hygienists and auxiliaries in a wide number of areas but that has not happened.  Talks on this have been allowed to drag on for far too long. The fact that they have dragged on is to the eternal disgrace of the profession which, after all, is supposed to be a caring profession.  If they seek continuously and selfishly to consider their own interests then the entire population will suffer but ultimately the profession will suffer also.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to press ahead with all the vigour he can muster.  He has shown in this and other areas that he is capable of exercising considerable vigour and that when it comes to standing against vested interests there is no better man.  The Minister should push this issue and I hope the association will be more accommodating than they have been.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to orthodontic care is a public scandal and there is no point in mincing words about it.  The simple unadorned fact is that while the Minister has given the green light to the health boards to recruit new staff that recruitment has failed in several health boards because the pickings are better elsewhere.  I do not disagree with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte in this regard but I am not sure where his analysis led.  He suggested that there should be an increase in salaries but the salaries I saw advertised in the last six months were not small by any means; they were very substantial indeed.  What is Deputy Rabbitte suggesting?  Is he suggesting that we should increase the salaries to £50,000 or £70,000?</P>

      <P>That is an avoidance.  The issue is being clouded when such statements are introduced.  I do not disagree that everybody should pay their fair share of tax.  I doubt that one of the 166 Members would disagree with that but that is not the issue now.  The issue is that a group has been allowed to hold the public dental service to ransom.  If we start squabbling with each other as to which side is more macho we will never solve this problem.  What we need from all sides of the House, and those involved in the dental service, is a little bit of logic and concerted action.  The Minister and his Department are trying to rectify this by amending the contracts with the consultant orthodontists.  That would allow a degree of private and public health practice.  I have some personal doubts about that and I hope that abuses which are obvious elsewhere are not allowed to crop up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the dental service is in some difficulties.  The problems of the service will only be resolved by taking practical steps such as those announced by the Minister.  They will only be resolved by goodwill from the dental profession which has been strangely lacking as we all know.  They will only be resolved if Members, and politicians on health <Col N="712" /> boards, show a little bit of common sense and common purpose on the issue.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I should like to highlight the inadequacy of the dental service in County Kerry and emphasise the importance of the promotion of an effective dental hygiene programme in primary and post-primary schools.  There is no doubt that if young people take greater care of their teeth the financial burden on the State will be decreased considerably now and in later years.  Th school dental service in Kerry is stretched to its limits. In most cases it is totally inadequate.  For example, the three primary schools in Killarney town with a pupil population of 1,500, have been without a dental service since July 1987 when the private dental scheme which was part of the school dental programme had to be suspended because of cuts in funding.  There are 565 pupils attending the two primary schools in Castleisland and they have been without a dental service since 1987.  Those examples reflect the general level of the school dental service in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The orthodontic service in the county is almost non-existent.  There are more than 1,000 patients on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment and 400 of them are classified as having severe problems. Some young people between 17 and 18 years are still waiting for orthodontic treatment and it is doubtful if they will ever receive it.  The £300,000 allocated by the Minister for treatment of the worst cases while welcome will have very little impact on the waiting list.  I understand that the Southern Health Board will receive £30,000 of that figure and that that will go towards treating 50 severe cases.  I hope that 25 of those cases will <Col N="713" /> be from Kerry.  When one considers that there are 400 severe cases in Kerry one realises that the Minister's proposal will do little to reduce the waiting list.  The figure allocated is just a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>Adult medical card holders in Kerry must wait between 18 months and two years for dentures.  There are more than 400 people on the waiting list for dentures. There is also a long waiting list for extractions although I accept that emergency cases are dealt with, I am not exaggerating when I say that the public dental service in Kerry has almost collapsed because of the lack of adequate funding. I appeal to the Minister to provide increased funding in 1990 so that we can start to correct this unacceptable neglect.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Yates for giving me some of his time and to commend him on the motion before the House.  I am sorry the Minister is not present but I hope his colleagues will convery to him my view that he should not be reacting to a Private Members' motion which suggests that more money should be made available for our disastrous dental health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's actions should be active as opposed to reactive. If one reads yesterday's edition of the <i>Evening Press</i> one will get the impression that the Minister was reacting to our motion.  Why is it that he had to be prompted to take action?  He, more than anybody else, is aware of the problems. An article in that paper states he is considering a scheme to make parents pay in future for the thousands of other children who need corrective dental treatment. All those who could in any way find the money to have the corrective dental treatment done have done so and the people remaining on the list needing that care just cannot stretch to the high costs of orthodontic work.  Perhaps I am the <Col N="714" /> most appropriate person to speak tonight on this because less than six hours ago I collected my 13 year old from orthodontic treatment on which we eventually decided.  I know how much it costs, but we are among the lucky parents who can afford to pay for it.  Despite what the Minister says, that he is taking the most urgent cases, many more cases have to be dealt with and many parents cannot afford to pay.</P>
      <P>I understand from a number of dentists I have spoken to that a large number of the 24,000 on the orthodontic waiting list could be dealt with if the will was there to allow ordinary dentists to do so.  One dentist told me that many children are assessed for orthodontic work.  It can be done now with the specialised training with which dentists are coming out of college.  Only special cases, of which there are a large number, need the full skill of an orthodontist.  The Minister could clear that list tomorrow if he wanted to and would make the money available to allow that.</P>
      <P>The Minister is neglecting and has neglected in the dental service a large range of women particularly during the years when they can be pregnant.  It is well known, and he as a doctor will know, that during pregnancy women's teeth suffer and it seems shortsighted for him to say to women who are on medical cards and require dental service: &ldquo;Sorry, you will have to wait two or three years&rdquo;. Two or three years is too long.  They lose their teeth and eventually the cost is a great deal more than it would have been if they could have had their treatment immediately after pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a waste of money in the dental service.  Picture if you will, Sir, a new building in the north city suburbs where there are four highly equipped dental surgeries with only two dentists working in them and two empty surgeries with thousands of pounds worth of equipment in them.  Picture a town like Swords with 25,000 people and one dentist working from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. five days a week to cover that population.  There is waste of money.  It would have been better if a better assessment of the needs of the <Col N="715" /> north side suburb I have spoken about was made and the money had gone elsewhere to provide better facilities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have a question for the Minister. It is my information that a sneaky &mdash; that is all I can call it &mdash; little rule has slipped into the national school dental service.  Up to now children at national school could be assessed for orthodontic or further treatment and once the need is recognised during their primary school time they can get it later if it is to take two or three years.  I understand that a rule has come in &mdash; I want this confirmed or denied here tonight &mdash; that only children under 12, irrespective of whether they are still in the national school, are eligible now to be assessed for work to be done even after they leave.  Many children stay in national schools after 12 years of age for many reasons and it would be disgraceful if they were being excluded from the dental service because they have reached 12 while still in sixth class.  I would like the Minister to confirm or deny that and, if it is true, to change that rule.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that some people who are not too long in the Department have not taken the time to read all the lengthy documentation there is in the dental service.  I would remind some of those who are a short time in the Department, of their own Department's documentation in relation to the dental <Col N="716" /> service.  Let me quote first from what the Minister of State said tonight:</P>
      <P>To listen to the Opposition here last night you would get the impression that the water flouridation programme was a shambles.  Nothing could be further from the truth. </P>
      <P>Let us turn to page 19 of the Leyden report on the dental services and see what it says about water fluoridation:</P>
      <P>The Working Group acknowledges that the water fluoridation programme does not always function at optimal levels due in the main to the age of the equipment, some of which is now in place for over twenty years; to the lack of stand by or short term replacement pumps which can be called into service during a pump failure and finally to the lack of adequate storage capacity for fluoride in some water supplies. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the Minister's speech shortly, let him not worry. The Minister of State tonight referred to the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme that operated from 1979 to the mid-eighties.  This was a scheme whereby poor, unfortunate medical card holders who could not afford dental treatment would go to their county clinic and be referred under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme to a private dental surgeon.  The Minister said that at its peak 32,000 persons receive treatment annually.  A particularly high percentage of applicants require dentures and, indeed, the cost of providing a full course of dental treatment under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme was considerably higher than the cost of an average course of treatment under the Department of Social Welfare scheme. <Col N="717" /> He said the need for dentures was very great and therefore the scheme was expensive to operate.  The Minister of State blamed poor old age pensioners for the fact that they have no teeth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not able to find the money to maintain that scheme simply because so many pensioners require dentures, while only this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I received a phone call from a denturist who is prepared to go on hunger strike outside the gates of this building because this Minister will not direct the dental council to remove the restrictive practices of dental surgeons who charge £300, £400 and £500 for dentures which can be provided at between £50 and £120.  If the Minister has any concern for the cost of dentures he will use the powers he has under the 1985 Dentists Act to do something about that.</P>
      <P>The Minister last night said that the health board dental service for children is in pretty good order and has not been affected to any great extent.  That is not at all what the Leyden report said.  It said the pressures and the massive increase in demand for emergency treatment for eligible adults is hampering the development and in certain cases the maintenance of dental services for children.</P>
      <P>We go to the most telling part of the report where it says the Minister is acting in defiance of the law.  I quote from page 27:</P>
      <P>The Working Group considers that the health boards are failing in their statutory duty to provide dental services for eligible adults.  As the table below shows, fewer than 39,000 eligible adults received routine dental treatment in 1987.  This represents only 6 per cent of the adult and adolescent population... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then the position has got worse, <Col N="718" /> and if the Minister is going to take a different tack in this Dáil and say that in some way he is not prepared to carry the can and his Government colleagues are at fault, as he suggested last night and as this token amendment suggests when it &ldquo;commends the resolve of the Minister for Health&rdquo;, implying that the Minister for Health has more resolve than the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, let me say this type of avoidance of collective responsibility is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Right across the country the type of health service you get depends on where you live.  That is disgraceful.  The Minister has presided over a patchwork quilt of health services where nothing is being done to provide a national strategy for the dental service to give guidelines to each health board to ensure a uniform level of service to which people can look forward and appreciate.</P>
    <P>Much talk has been made about the role of hygienists.  No provision whatsoever has been made to train Irish hygienists.  There is some discussion and some improvement in relation to the dental council availability of hygienists. You have to go to Britain if you want to be a hygienist and you have to be a former dental surgery assistant.  The Minister has taken no steps to bring hygienists into operation in this country.  The Minister is evading his responsibilities.  He is trying to blame the Government for what is his own neglect.  He is trying to evade his responsibilities under the 1970 Act.  This is unacceptable.  In this debate we could have looked forward to some initiative. Instead, we are told we have to depend on his efforts around the Cabinet table. The £300,000 for orthodontic services is a joke in the context of what is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>I do not accept that the waiting list is 12,250 as opposed to the figure given by him by way of Dáil questions, that the waiting list for orthodontic services was 24,000.  The only reason it is changed is that in some health board areas the service has been suspended and <Col N="719" /> the waiting lists have been abandoned because it is futile trying to maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, who have shown a great <Col N="720" /> interest in these areas in the past, to support this motion if Deputy Leyden's signing of this report is to mean anything. Again, I thank the Opposition Deputies and I hope the Government will not delay any further before providing a basic dental service for all our population.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Clonmel Plant Industrial Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing the debate and the Minister for attending to reply to it.  Deputy Davern has just asked me to allow him some of the limited time available to me.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his record in settling disputes of a difficult nature.  His record is one of the reasons I wanted to bring this matter to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than 20 years Barlo Heating in Clonmel, enjoyed one of the best man-agement-labour relationships in the country.  The good employer-employee <Col N="725" /> relationship was encouraged by the trade union movement in Clonmel including the Trades and Labour Council. However, a major rationalisation programme at the plant last year led to a dispute.  The company's plan was to rationalise the factory in Clonmel and develop another factory in England.  This caused much concern among the employees who were told that a reduction in their workforce would be required.</P>
    <P>At that time we, as Members of the Oireachtas, asked the Government to use every incentive to allow the company to develop and maintain their workforce in Clonmel and to give every grant assistance that would be available to every non-national company to encourage this company to remain in Ireland.  This request was not granted and there were protracted discussions with the union which led by agreement to 40 redundancies, a two year wage freeze and a 25 per cent increase in production plus a change in work practices which involved putting 25 members of the workforce on permanent night shift.  It was also agreed to operate new technology.  That was a tough agreement for the union to accept but the company as a result agreed that the Clonmel factory would remain the major plant in the group securing the jobs of the 156 remaining employees.</P>
    <P>The company were then launched successfully on the stock market.  It was over subscribed.  Everybody was pleased at their success and we wished them luck.</P>
    <P>The company have now broken all their agreements with the union.  They have broken the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the workforce are working on a week-on week-off basis. They have eliminated the productivity clause that was agreed, reduced the take home pay of the workers and demanded that English work rates should be accepted, disregarding the different regimes in the two countries in relation to the level of income tax and the cost of living.  They have also refused to honour payments that were already agreed with regard to redundancies.  To add insult to injury the company have increased their <Col N="726" /> workforce on the English mainland to 154 while expecting the Irish workforce, in spite of the previous agreement to work shorter hours and on a week-on week-off basis.  That is the background to the dispute which has led the union by an overwhelming majority vote to have this dispute.  They feel that the company have put their jobs at stake.  A total of 156 people are on the street in Clonmel now, and £2.5 million has been taken out of the economy because of this action. Because of the Minister's expertise in difficult disputes I appeal to him to use his good offices or an appropriate officer from the Department to bring the parties together so that agreement can be reached, the workforce can return to work and Barlo's in Clonmel can return to their previous level of production and once again enjoy the respect and support that has been generally forthcoming for that company among the people of Clonmel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank Deputy Ferris for allowing me a number of minutes to speak on this issue.  As a TD living in Clonmel I am extremely concerned at the potential loss of employment in the Barlo industry there.  There is grave concern that this plant may close altogether this time.  We cannot afford to lose these skills because most of the products manufactured in this plant are exported.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his initial response when I raised the matter with him and indeed for his response in general and his sympathetic hearing and understanding of the case today.  I am anxious that the Minister would arrange, under his good offices and through the Labour Court, conciliation talks and that they be started immediately to safeguard not just the industry itself but the jobs of the people concerned. As you well know, a Cheann Comhairle, this plant is vital.  Many of the people working there have commitments &mdash; mortgages &mdash; to the town and community, and there is grave danger that many of them will not be re-employed anywhere else should this plant close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> I appeal to both sides to co-operate with the Department of Labour and the Labour Court to try to reach some consensus. I will not go into the ins and outs of this agreement because I do not see it as my role, that is for more professional people.  However, I would urge the Minister to arrange immediate conciliation talks to ensure that that thriving industry, and its tremendously skilled workforce will remain to benefit not only Clonmel but to Ireland as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Ferris and Deputy Davern for outlining the background to this dispute.  I share and appreciate their concern.  For the record, the strike at Barlo Limited, Clonmel, commenced on 12 October 1989 and the workforce of over 150 people, who are represented by the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, have been employed on a week on-week off basis since June and are seeking a return to full time work.  The union claim that as part of an agreement made last year the 150 or so workers were given a guarantee of full-time employment provided production was maintained at a certain level.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ferris has outlined, the company have commenced operation in the UK and the workers in Clonmel fear their jobs might be at risk.  I share the anxiety of both Deputies.  In instances like this, people can develop entrenched views which can create great difficulties for both sides.  Clonmel, like any other part of the country, cannot afford to lose good and substantial employment. Whether the facts are exactly as outlined by Deputy Ferris, or perhaps slightly different, is not a matter for us to adjudicate. However, I appreciate the request of Deputy Ferris and Deputy Davern that both sides cool tempers slightly and try to resolve their differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand people's fears when the company moved into the UK, but at the same time I would ask both sides to show restraint and responsibility and not to allow these jobs to be lost.  The number of jobs concerned is substantial and it <Col N="728" /> would cost a lot if we had to pay the IDA to bring that type of industry to Clonmel or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed this case during the day and I know it is a matter of concern to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Deputies.  I have asked the Labour Court to invite both sides to a conciliation meeting which has been arranged for Friday, 27 October.  I hope both sides will consider what has been said in this debate, that they will have open minds, will endeavour to try to come to a resolution of the matter and will take the opportunity on Friday, which the conciliation service will provide, to try to resolve their differences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter appertaining to the operation of the higher education grants as they affect County Limerick students attending UCD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter which is urgent.  I was informed this morning by the parent of a student from County Limerick who has applied for, and is eligible for, a higher education grant that registration of this student and others in University College Dublin had to be put back on a number of occasions in this term because notification had not come through to University College Dublin that Limerick County Council had, under the terms of the Higher Education Act, approved students and in particular this student &mdash; for a higher education grant.  In the absence of communication from Limerick County Council to the effect that these students were eligible for a grant, the college was unable to register them, unless the students paid the fees out of their own pockets.  Given that the means limits for qualification for higher education grants are extremely low, in some, and probably most cases, the students <Col N="729" /> would not be able to pay these fees out of their own pockets, even if they knew they would eventually be refunded, because they would not have the cash available.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter urgently in this way because I understand a decision has to be taken on the matter and arrangements made specially to deal with it before Friday because that is the final date for registration of students generally.  I would be interested if the Minister could let me know in her reply to this debate whether this problem is first as I have described and, secondly, if it arises in any other counties.  It seems to be a matter of quite serious concern that county councils should leave students in a position of not knowing for such a long time whether they qualify for grants or not.</P>
      <P>The provision of the higher education grants are laid out by each county council in accordance generally with a specimen scheme laid down by the Minister.  The clause dealing with this matter is clause 7 which states that the appropriate lecture fee will be paid by the relevant local authority in advance of registration &mdash; registration in this case is Friday &mdash; to the institution concerned in respect of eligible students on receipt of invoice for the lecture fee from the appropriate third level college.</P>
      <P>I would like to know where communications have broken down between this county council and the university and whether the Minister will make arrangements not only to deal with the matter before Friday but to ensure that this sort of problem does not recur, because it is extremely distressing for students to find themselves in this position.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is here in person and I hope she will be able to deal comprehensively and satisfactorily with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me, first of all, apologise to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Bruton for my late arrival.  This was due to my having to go and get more up-to-date and relevant information.  I also thank Deputy Bruton for raising this <Col N="730" /> matter and congratulate him on his appointment.  I look forward to having many more debates with him in the future.</P>
      <P>The position is exactly that outlined by Deputy Bruton.  In the course of giving the information which I have just received I will outline how it was arrived at and the steps we have now taken. This has been a recurring problem, of a minimalist nature, in some counties during the past few years and to obviate it various steps were taken.  In the course of the summer officials of the Department of Education secured the agreement of the County and City Managers Association, in full meetings, to an arrangement governing the payment of lecture fees for first time entrants.  This arrangement was, naturally, agreed with the third level institutions, including University College, Dublin.  The objective was to put our house in order.</P>
      <P>The effect of this arrangement was conveyed, as Deputy Bruton correctly said, in clause 7 (a) of the 1989 higher education grant scheme, the details of which are available to everybody.  We held meetings and made an arrangement to obviate the difficulty about which Deputy Bruton has spoken and informed the colleges of this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department only became aware today of the difficulty which exists between Limerick County Council and UCD.  So far it is confined to UCD. Apparently, UCD require the county council to provide a list of grant applicants proposing to enter UCD in 1989-90 so that UCD may invoice them.  This requirement appears to be the cause of misunderstanding between Limerick County Council and UCD.  Why it should be the cause of misunderstanding between that local authority and that third level college is at this point a bit of a mystery.  Officials of my Department were in contact today with UCD and Limerick County Council with a view to facilitating the resolution of any difficulties.  UCD have indicated that students generally are not put at a disadvantage and will continue to attend lectures pending the resolution of any <Col N="731" /> difficulty relating to registration.  If difficulties persist up to this Friday, UCD will point out that there is a further late registration day on 6 November.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that point in a few moments.  We understand that Limerick County Council will provide &mdash; tomorrow, I suppose &mdash; conditional letters of grant approval to students who request them.  I have to emphasise that this was one of the steps we were taking in an effort to smooth out difficulties which had appeared in other years.  The Department took action in the summer to prevent further difficulties this year which had arisen in other years. As Deputy Bruton is aware, day-to-day administration of the higher education grant scheme is entrusted by statute to local authorities.  We hope they will put their house in order particularly when practical solutions are put in their way. As I say, it is a mystery why only one college and one county council are involved.  Whether there was a misconception on the part of a particular person in one of the offices I do not know but the Department are now actively involved, thanks to the Deputy's good offices, and have been in contact with UCD and Limerick County Council to iron out the difficulties which have come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying to you, a Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Bruton, and the <Col N="732" /> House is that I am not happy that it is going to be conditional on Friday or the following Friday and I intend tomorrow morning to point out to UCD and Limerick County Council that they both have a statutory obligation to immediately deal with this small number of pupils.  To the student who has been put out, and to the parents, it is the most major thing in their life.  Therefore, I intend to have this matter put on a much more firm footing and find a solution to the difficulty tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The North Sea situation is different in a number of important respects from that of the Irish Sea.  The Irish Sea does not have the same pollution problems as the North Sea, which are caused by rivers and outfalls from highly urbanised and industrial areas in northern Europe.  A wide variety of countries contribute to the problems there, and that makes the Conference approach more effective.</P>
      <P>I believe that in the first instance progress can be achieved by pursuing bilateral contacts which have already been established at ministerial and official level between Ireland and the UK. Agreement has already been reached with the UK to draw up a co-ordinated monitoring programme and to pursue other areas of co-operation in relation to the management of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government are also actively supporting the work of the Irish Sea Study Group, which is made up <i>inter alia</i> of scientists from both the Irish and UK Governments.  They are studying various environmental aspects of the Irish <Col N="562" /> Sea.  Their report will be presented to an international conference hosted by the Isle of Man Government in late 1990. The Government are supporting this conference and will be actively participating in its work.  Nuclear pollution is a matter for the Minister for Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would take the view that designation and licensing should proceed as expeditiously as possible, but that adequate care must be taken to ensure that projects are properly considered by my technical experts before they are licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> The problem really arose because the industry developed ahead of the licensing and designation process &mdash; before the Department of the Marine was set up. Technical considerations, public attitudes, certain judicial decisions and the new requirement under EC legislation to have specific environmental impact assessments carried out in a defined format have all had an impact.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these factors, considerable progress has been made over recent months in relation to the licensing of projects in the 16 areas which have been designated for aquaculture to date. In addition, and in response to the developments which I have outlined, a new programme of designation is being drawn up.  In this connection my Department and BIM are working on the assembly of the necessary scientific data to underpin further decisions in relation to designation and licensing.  A sum of £100,000 has been earmarked for this purpose.  I envisage the expenditure of similar sums in future years in order to provide a sound base for the development of aquaculture in harmony with the environment: other water users will also be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 38, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I have established the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Review Group with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>To recommend to the Minister for the Marine the sea-fishing boat licensing policy that should be adopted to ensure the optimum development of the Irish sea fishing industry; and</P>
      <P>the procedures that should be adopted to ensure that licence applications are processed in a consistent, efficient manner and in conformity with the stated policy. </P>
      <P>The terms of reference also provide that in considering these matters the group should take account of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (i)  all aspects of the Irish sea fishing industry including the present fleet, employment opportunities, stocks, safety and downstream industries (fish <Col N="567" /> processing, boat construction and ancillary services); and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the implications of present and possible future EC policy in relation to fleet restructuring and management.  </P>
    <P>The group comprises the following officials from my Department:</P>
    <P>Mr. Brendan Cahill (Chairman), Mr. John O'Connor, Ms. Deirdre O'Keeffe, Mr. Sean O'Donoghue and Mr. David Griffith.  Mr. Alex Heskin of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is also a member and Mr. John Moloney of my Department acts as Secretary to the group. </P>
    <P>My hope is to have the review completed before the end of 1989.  In the meantime consideration of applications in respect of vessels wishing to enter the fleet has been deferred pending completion of this review.  All applicants for sea-fishing boat licences have been advised of this and have been invited to make submissions to the group.</P>
    <P>Some specific commitments to grant licences had been made prior to the setting up of the review group and I shall honour these.  I think it important to draw the Deputy's attention to the long standing practice of advising licence applicants not to enter into any financial commitment prior to their individual cases being determined.  The application forms contain a warning to this effect.  I should, perhaps, explain that the policy review was initiated in order to establish a sound and equitable basis for processing licence applications in the interests of existing fishermen and potential new entrants to the industry.  As you are no doubt aware, some of our fish stocks are under severe pressure and it would make little sense to allow additional capacity partake in such fisheries thus undermining the livelihoods of established operators.  In respect of other fisheries the number of actual applicants may exceed what could reasonably be accommodated. In these cases, I am most conscious of the need to ensure that the best applicants will be chosen on the basis of <Col N="568" /> objective criteria and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The last licences to facilitate the registration of vessels were issued at the end of August.  The current position is that 127 applications are on hand.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the applications by county is as follows: Clare, 1; Cork, 32; Donegal, 19; Dublin, 17; Galway, 7; Kerry, 13; Limerick, 2; Louth, 8; Sligo, 2; Waterford, 8; Wexford, 14; Wicklow, 4.</P>
    <P>Indications from an initial assessment of these applications are that 90 per cent are involved or have been involved in sea-fishing or in some activity associated with the sea-fishing industry.  Precise information will not be available until the applications are assessed in full.</P>
    <P>I am determined that there should be full consultation and in that regard the group has sought written submissions from interested organisations and from the public.  In addition, the group has met organisations representing various sectors of the industry and I am informed that some have started a process of internal consultation with their members.  I should add that representatives of the fishermen's organisations generally accept that the review is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Indeed, to facilitate full consultation, an advertisement appeared in the national and provincial press as well as in industry related journals in early September inviting submissions to the group. Some fishermen and associations associated with the sea-fishing industry have been in communication with the group. Others have indicated to me that the timescale for submissions was too short and I have agreed, as an exceptional measure, to extend the closing date from 13 October until 1 November.</P>

      <P>On 8 September last, Bonamia disease was diagnosed in native oyster samples submitted to the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department three days earlier by a Galway Bay shellfish farmer. Local growers, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, BIM and local fishery officers were notified later that day.  All movements of native oysters in and out of Galway Bay, except for direct human consumption, were immediately suspended by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Fish Pathologist visited the area two days after his diagnosis and initiated a comprehensive oyster sampling survey in the Galway Bay area.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the results of this survey indicate that the outbreak is confined to one holding site in the St. George Oyster Bed.  In accordance with my instructions, this site is being closed down and destocked of infected oysters.  I will not be allowing the restocking of this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this outbreak has fortunately been contained, I would urge all those engaged in the oyster-growing industry to comply with my Department's regulations governing the movement of shellfish, in order to minimise the possibility of a repetition of this potentially catastrophic incidence of Bonamia.  Bonamia <Col N="570" /> can, and has in other countries, actually devastated oyster fishery beds.</P>

The table, which I will make available to the House, lists all incidents of shell fish contamination recorded in 1989 in the course of the Shellfish Monitoring Programme carried out by the Fisheries Research Centre. The cause of contamination in each case was algal bloom, and in all incidents where toxicity levels posed a threat to human health, the regional health board was advised.</P>
      <P>The contaminations indicated in the table were caused by the occurrence of phytoplankton in the water; this is a natural phenomenon which may not be prevented. When it occurs, the objective is to protect human health by means of a thorough monitoring programme.</P>

      <P>To explain the background to the designation of ports let me clarify the objectives for the Celtic Sea herring fishery.</P>
      <P>My primary objective is to establish a regime of management which can protect the livelihood of fishermen from over-fishing and consequent collapse of the stock.  This happened in the recent past and led to the closure of the fishery for a number of years.</P>
      <P>My secondary objective is to ensure that with available quotas the fishery is conducted in a fashion that maximises the amount and duration of sustainable income and employment in fishing and fish processing.  It is against this background that my Department met representatives of fishing organisations in an effort to agree a regime for management of the Celtic Sea herring.</P>
      <P>Designating ports of landing is, as I have explained, an integral part of effective management regimes.  Unfortunately the different interests representing the industry could not agree on the ports which should be designated.  I thus chose six ports &mdash; Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Cobh, Dingle and Baltimore: Fenit is designated from 22 October to 4 November 1989.</P>
      <P>I regret that it was not possible to designate more ports on the south coast, but this would make management considerably less effective, and the future of fishing interests considerably less secure. I have no plans at this stage to approve landings of Celtic Sea herring in Schull between now and Christmas.  This is in line with the general trend where the herring stocks move eastwards and fishing during December-January is concentrated off Dunmore East and possibly Cobh.  My Department would be happy to examine any agreed alternative ports to those designated on the south coast that may be suggested and agreed by representative industry groups.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if his attention has been drawn to the report that mussel growers in Bantry Bay, County Cork have been <Col N="573" /> forced to dump mussels when, in fact, a Swedish University confirmed that the mussels were safe to eat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the report referred to by the Deputy.  Before referring to this specific episode, I would like to outline the background to the shellfish monitoring programme carried out by my Department.</P>
      <P>There is a significant risk of illness from eating contaminated mussels.  To protect consumers and markets the most stringent controls must be applied.  Since my Department initiated the Shellfish Monitoring Programme in 1984, there have been no reported cases of related human illness due to DSP, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, despite high levels of the organism which gives rise to DSP being recorded in the waters in the south-west in 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1989.  Additional results of this policy are that the reputation of Irish mussels is excellent and the growers accordingly command the highest prices.  This programme has been highly successful and it depends for its success on taking no risks that contaminated fish products should be put on the market for human consumption.</P>
      <P>As regards this specific case, no samples were sent by my Department to any Swedish University.  I am aware that certain growers did send some samples for testing.  I am obviously in no position to comment on what transpired from these tests.  For my part, I can inform the House that during the week commencing 21 August 1989 the routine screening by the Fisheries Research Centre of mussel samples taken by officials of my Department from Bantry Bay indicated a toxicity level which justified advising the Southern Health Board to ban harvesting of mussels from Bantry Bay, until such time as subsequent samples showed their toxicity levels to have abated.  This led to a closure for one week.</P>

      <P>Staff numbers at the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department &mdash; in common with most other areas of the Public Service &mdash; have been declining for some years now in line with the necessary policy of containment of staff costs generally.  At the same time, remaining staff have been under pressure to provide services which are necessary to underpin, for example, the growth of aquaculture.</P>
      <P>It is my objective to see to it that my Department is in a position in which it has the necessary scientific resources to support economic growth and the marketing of our fishery products whilst at the same time protecting human health and the environment.  My Department is pursuing this question with the Department of Finance in this context.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 8 (a) of the Hillsborough Communiqué of 15 November 1985 highlighted the importance of the application of the principle that the Armed Forces, which includes the Ulster Defence Regiment, operate only in support of the civil power.  This was one of the issues discussed at the most recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 18 October, which reiterated the principle that it is the police who have the primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in Northern Ireland and that the armed forces, including the regular Army and UDR, operate in support of the police and only for so long as the threat from terrorism makes that support necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conference, it was agreed that a working group of officials should make early recommendations, in accordance with the recent review of the agreement, on further effective development of the policy of ensuring as rapidly as possible that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, there should be a police presence in all operations which involve <Col N="577" /> direct contact between the Armed Forces and the community.</P>

      <P>My Department have received the representations referred to and a reply has now issued.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations on the quota system, quota can transfer under a land leasing transaction if the lease is for a minimum period of three years.  In this case as the lease of land is for a period of three years from 1 April 1987, the quota transfers to the benefit of the lessee up to 31 March 1990.  On 1 April 1990 the quota reverts to the lessor or on her death to the next of kin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of old age non-contributory pension at the rate of £40 per week, pension having been awarded with effect from 27 April 1984.  This is the rate appropriate to a person with weekly means of £15.38. Means were assessed on the basis of income from the letting of land.</P>
      <P>In July 1987, the person concerned applied for an increase in pension on the grounds that he had transferred the family holding to his son.  It was decided that an increase was not payable, however, as it was considered that the transfer of the family holding was undertaken in order to qualify for a higher rate of pension.  This decision was upheld on appeal dated 23 May 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> The person concerned made a further claim for an increase in pension in May 1989.  A deciding officer decided on 21 July 1989, following reinvestigation of the case by the local social welfare officer, that no increase in pension was payable as the person's means remained unchanged.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, a person may not deprive himself of pay, income or property in order to qualify for old age non-contributory pension.  If it appears that a person has deprived himself of income or property in order to qualify for pension, the yearly value of that means or property is still taken to be part of the means of that person for the purposes of determining entitlement to old age noncontributory pension.</P>
