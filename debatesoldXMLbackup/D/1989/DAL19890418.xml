      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has satisfied himself that the Central <Col N="1790" /> Statistics Office is adequately staffed and equipped to provide the State with an accurate and up-to-date flow of statistical information which is essential to the efficient and economical functioning of the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Central Statistics Office provide the State with an acceptable modern statistical system.</P>
      <P>The CSO, operating on the basis of the strategy set down by the National Statistics Board and clearly within the Government's general policy on public service staffing, have made significant efficiency gains through increased investment in computerisation and improvements in dissemination procedures.  Two important practical improvements that have been possible as a result are: the preliminary estimates of the 1988 Labour Force Survey were published in October 1988, some nine months ahead of what had been experienced up to then, providing important information on employment developments; and this year, for the first time ever a census of services was undertaken.  Provisional results are expected to be available by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the staff of the CSO and the members of the National Statistics Board whose combined efforts have resulted in considerable improvements in our statistical system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will agree that the Central Statistics Office have gone through some difficult times in the recent past.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied therefore that the changes that have been implemented are of themselves sufficient to bring the office up to the level of performance that we require, or does he envisage any additional measures being taken by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a matter for the CSO, who are very much involved in improving their performance and efficiency.  Anything they come up with <Col N="1791" /> will certainly be considered favourably. The good doctor up on the backbenches over there must deserve his fair share of credit for those improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="1792" /> tax terms applying to any new commercial developments by Marathon are provided for in the existing agreements which are subject to Irish taxation laws. Corporation tax on profits will therefore apply.  The agreements also provide for a 12½ per cent royalty on the value of gas production at the wellhead, less allowances for costs involved in delivering the gas to the point of sale.  Details of the price to be paid to Marathon for gas are the subject of confidential commercial contracts the terms of which I am not at liberty to disclose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate a fair degree of business acumen with the Bruton family and the Deputy would not expect me in a situation where perhaps I could be negotiating with another company exploring the same seas and having a <Col N="1793" /> discovery, to publicly debate an arrangement which I had entered into with a previous successful company.  That would tie my hands and, in the national interest, the Deputy would not wish me to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 19 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>INPC prices are usually set for a quarterly period and include price and exchange rate adjustments; any operational deficits and surpluses which arise from time to time are offset without much delay through normal trading adjustments in subsequent periods.</P>
      <P>A price increase was sought by the company for the second quarter as an offset against price and exchange rate adjustments in the previous period.  I am aware of the current trading position of the company which is based for the present on a continuation of first quarter prices.  This situation is, however, transitory and will be eliminated in the coming months, so as to return INPC to a breakeven position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has imposed a price freeze which is not the subject of consideration by the Fair Trade Commission.  I would expect that an interim report would be available to the Minister in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the INPC have sought a 27p increase on their share of supply to the petrol market?  Is it not also the case that those in the industry are saying that this would impose £10 million per quarter loss on the INPC?  Is it not further the case that the Fair Trade Commission will not be examining this particular application for an increase, that it will be the Minister present who will be considering that application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the price per gallon, the Deputy clearly has received some figures which are quite wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When I indicated that the loss was transitory, I want to explain to the House that losses, or indeed surpluses, in trading are nothing new.  Over a period of time these will be addressed.  What I would be interested in ensuring is that INPC return to a break-even position as quickly as possible which would be phased in and at the same time that consideration would be given to easing any problems which might arise to the petrol users as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister will have to make a decision one way or the other as to when the losses which he says are transitory will be dealt with and how?  Is it not the case that with asset values of only £6 million with regard to the INPC, even two months of present trading would indicate that they would be trading insolvent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take into account the overall situation.  We are dealing, first, with the mandatory régime of 35 per cent and where an additional 25 per cent is being added into the market at a break-even cost for INPC.  It is impossible to talk about 55 per cent or 60 per cent of the domestic market without including that in the overall context of the ongoing examination.  Surely at this stage, in any mathematics that can be used, up to 60 per cent of the present trade could not be excluded from consideration in determining the final road the Government will go on foot of the commission's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Intervention Programme under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3301/86, known as the Valoren Regulation, includes significant provision for European Regional Development Fund support for energy conservation activity in the period 1987-1991.</P>
      <P>Conservation investment amounting to £1.75 million is included in the global figure for Valoren in the National Development Plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Valoren Plan ends abruptly in the middle of the planning period of the Government's undertaking?  Does the <Col N="1797" /> Minister have his own conservation plans outside of the Valoren programme which is propped up by the EC?</P>

      <P>It is confined to North Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am concerned and it should ideally be the concern of everybody in the Community that we have the best possible conservation programme in energy terms.  While this was accentuated very much during the two oil hikes in the seventies, it would be fair to say that the matter has retreated from the national agenda over recent years. That is perhaps understandable because quite a number of developments within the industrial sphere and, indeed the domestic sphere, have improved the situation quite dramatically so far as our dependence on and use of energy are concerned.  There is still considerable room for improvement throughout the whole economy, based not just on pure economic terms but also on global environmental terms.  I would be anxious to devote as much of our resources as possible within the present constraints to developing these programmes even more intensively in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that his concern about the matter is not sufficient if the Government's funding will be solely related to the Valoren Plan which stops abruptly in 1991, none of which funding has been allocated to genuine conservation but which has gone to the ESB and Bord na Móna?  Would he not accept that Ireland has not made progress in conservation?  We use 25 per cent more in industry on a comparative basis with the rest of the EC and have made half the gains since 1973 that the other countries have made.  Does this not indicate a need for funding, planning and policy rather than just commitment in principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are clearly two aspects to this.  One should not convey the impression that energy conservation can be managed only by requiring the <Col N="1798" /> taxpayer to shoulder the introduction of perhaps new grants or facilities.  We should be a little bit more grown up about it.  We cannot solve all our problems by asking the taxpayer to shoulder the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister's Government have a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We require a very essential information programme which would indicate to all users that there is a role which the citizen, the commercial entrepreneur and all of us can play and not always want to find a solution through additional taxation and other resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it will be by Government policy that we will have improved traffic management, for example, which is an element of conservation?  It can be only by Government strategy that the ESB will change their policy which is preventing the emergence of combined heat and power systems in Ireland.  It is only through Government action that public buildings can gain access to the sort of services that should be available for buildings generally.  These are matters on which Government policy must act. Would the Minister not agree that it requires more from him than this cant about public funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to combined heat and power systems, the Deputy knows well that there has been a certain amount of research carried on here in this regard.  Two projects were developed in the early eighties, each of which had to be abandoned on economic grounds.  There is not much point in the Deputy trotting out high faluting ideas which, having been rigorously tested, have been found to be incapable of meeting economic criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 31, 44 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive (NIREX) in the UK, have for some time been considering options for disposal of radioactive waste.  NIREX originally defined a number of options for further study and one of these was storage in caverns under the Irish Sea.  The Irish Government were opposed to this option and made their views known to the UK authorities. According to the most recent information available to me in the matter, sub-seabed disposal is no longer being considered.</P>
      <P>In an announcement on 21 March 1989, NIREX nominated sites on land at Sellafield and Dounreay in northern Scotland for a programme of geological and other investigations to establish which, if either, would be suitable for a deep repository for solid low and intermediate level radioactive wastes. Assuming permission is granted quickly, these investigations will take up to 18 months and will lead to more detailed investigation of a single preferred site. Based on experience to date, my Department will be kept fully informed of developments by NIREX and will be in a position to give me appropriate advice as the situation develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the British Government have dropped entirely the possibility of these deep-water caverns?  In the context of the proposed site at Sellafield, has any assessment been carried out of the dangers <Col N="1801" /> that that new proposal may pose to this country?  If no such study has been carried out, what detailed study does the Minister intend will be carried out with a view to making representations on this new proposal to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In February of this year the Nuclear Energy Board were informed by NIREX that the seabed caverns were no longer under consideration.  We subsequently checked the position with the authorities in the Isle of Man as they had similar fears and they received the same information about a month ago.  I think we can assume and accept from the best evidence available to us that that proposal has now been abandoned. Obviously, we are happy about that because we have made a strong case against it in the beginning.</P>
      <P>With regard to other studies, I do not think I can enlighten the Deputy because they will have to be considered in the light of further examination and I will inform the House as soon as information that is of interest to us comes to light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government intend to make representations with regard to this new proposal bearing in mind the deep concern that people feel about the Sellafield plant and the inefficiencies we have seen in the working of that plant and which have led to ongoing pollution of the Irish Sea?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

I am happy that the arrangement is on a free and frank basis and I am anxious to maintain that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has indicated that NIREX are at least consistent would he agree that that does not necessarily mean they are truthful? Having regard to the full and extensive nature of Question No. 31, would the Minister outline to the House the precise steps his Department proposes to take to ensure that the British Nuclear Authority, NIREX, and British Nuclear Fuels are closely monitored over the next number of years so that we can avoid the mishaps and cover-ups that have characterised their activities in the Irish Sea over the past 20 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

I assure the Deputy that is my aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister outline whether he has been in direct contact with his counterpart in the British Government on the issue of storage of nuclear waste?  Would he accept the view expressed by Greenpeace that there is no technical solution to the problem of disposing of nuclear waste and that it is no more satsfactory to have it stored on the ground than it is to have it in caverns under the Irish Sea?  We must insist that our interests in this area are considered by the British authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question about my contact with my counterpart in the United Kingdom is timely because arrangements are now being put in train <Col N="1803" /> for a meeting to take place very soon at which I will make sure that these matters are on the agenda.  I accept also that there is no safe hiding place for nuclear waste. Storage, whether under the sea or on land, cannot be accepted as guaranteeing that the public at large are safe.</P>
      <P>This is a most regrettable aspect of this type of development and is one of the reasons we have maintained our status as a non-nuclear power.  I am not able to say what the ultimate solution to these problems is because, of their nature, they have an international dimension.  We have to work very hard to ensure that whatever scientific and technical matters have to be addressed they will give the maximum degree of safety and security to the public.  However, as long as there are these problems, there is always a risk, and it is our job to minimise it to the greatest possible degree.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the Minister's comment that there is no established definite safe means of storage of radioactive waste, could he tell the House whether he has a preference that such waste is stored above ground or under the sea?  Would he consider ground storage to be safer in relative terms than storage in deep subterranean caverns? Given the duration which the waste remains active, would it not be preferable to have access to it on the surface as distinct from it not being accessible if it were stored in deep caverns?</P>

Will he indicate to the House whether he will meet his counterpart in Britain and insist on the <Col N="1804" /> fullest information being made available to him and his Department in the context of any feasibility study or assessment that the British Government carry out to ensure that the fullest scientific information is made available from the British to us?  We should also ensure that we can independently assess the validity of any assessment they may carry out so that we are in a position to guarantee the maximum protection for our population regarding the proposed cavern on a land site which they now apparently have in mind?</P>

None of us can claim all the wisdom in this matter and, as regards any support or information from the House as a whole towards establishing our position on this and being able to maintain it, I certainly will facilitate the House in every way. Naturally I am not in the same position to give a guarantee whether the British Government will, from time to time, be as forthcoming with me.  I can only assure the House that I will be doing anything I can to ensure that that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 40 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware from my announcement yesterday of the priority the Government attach to the rapid development and upgrading of the Whitegate refinery.  The decision to allocate significant funds helps greatly in my efforts to ensure that our national oil facilities of Whitegate and Whiddy are put to the best possible use.  While my Department have had discussions with a number of possible interested partners in the development of the oil market here, none of the proposals is sufficiently developed at this stage to enable me to come to a final decision.  I am establishing a special task force to examine a full range of technical and financial options for the refinery as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposals which the Minister has already received, will he indicated to the House when he might be able to make a decision on them?  Do any of the proposals contain a proposal for distribution of petrol as <Col N="1806" /> distinct from securing supplies?  In relation to the Minister's announcement yesterday about the £26 million which will be made available for expenditure on Whitegate, will he tell the House exactly what that expenditure will relate to, given, as I understand it, that if you upgrade the Whitegate facility and put in a cracker the cost involved will be in the region of £60 million to £100 million?  I am curious as to what £26 million can do given that the overall cost of upgrading Whitegate in a meaningful way would be substantially more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's first question, I expect to be able to make a decision later this year.  The developments to which I referred yesterday make it essential that I mix all the ingredients so that we have a comprehensive package which we can develop for the future. In relation to the question concerning distribution, one of the proposals includes that element but, obviously, it will be subject to many considerations before a final decision is taken.  I do not know why the Deputy is disappointed that I have secured Government approval for the expenditure of £25 million on the upgrading of the refinery, and to say it is not sufficient is not perhaps the way to approach it.  In the negotiations which I will be conducting and arising from the task force which I will establish later this week, we must decide the type of facility we will develop in Whitegate. We also have to decide the type of technology and the cracking to which the Deputy referred but, basically, we must ensure that we develop the highest added value produce possible.  It may well be that, in the course of my deliberations, I will have a joint venture or other partnership in trying to arrive at the final solution.  The fact that I now have resources available to me strengthen immeasurably my negotiating hand in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am saying that if you build a house you must complete it before it is any use.  If the Minister has only £26 million to spend on a facility that requires upgrading to the extent of £100 million I am just wondering how much good that small amount will do. Will the Minister confirm &mdash; he has half answered this &mdash; that the probability is that he will more than likely be entering into some kind of joint venture with an oil producing country to provide the balance of the funds to upgrade the facility to the required standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly one clear option and there may well be a situation where we would avail ourselves of EC resources as well because that would comply with the criteria for Structural Funds.  However, my thinking at present is that we would negotiate with a partner, an oil producing country, for a consideration which would enable us to develop the refinery to the maximum possible extent, consistent with modern demands, environmental and otherwise, and at the same time have a much better degree of security of supply tagged to it.</P>

There would be no logic whatsoever in confining development at Whitegate to a consideration close to the mandatory offtake.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>INPC operations currently encompass the purchase and refining of crude, the supply of 35 per cent of Irish market requirements of petrol and gasoil to the distribution companies and associated trading of intermediate and final petroleum products.  There are no proposals or plans in hand at this point in time to involve INPC in retail distribution in the Irish market.  The position will, however, be kept under review in the coming months and the findings of the report of the Fair Trade Commission into key aspects of the existing distribution system will be of interest in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  Would he not accept that one of the major problems we faced in recent weeks was the fact that the oil companies who supply at least 50 per cent of the oil products of this country also control something like 90 odd per cent of the distribution network and that so long as we have that situation it will be impossible to break free of the stranglehold these companies have on this economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy misinterprets what I said.  I said there were no current proposals to involve INPC in the distribution market.  I went on to say that this matter would be reviewed in the light of whatever developments take place.  We cannot for all time decide whether INPC would stand away from the distribution sector.  It may well be decided as to whatever the strategic requirement of the time is, and we are open to ensuring that INPC play the sort of pivotal role they will be required to play in ensuring we have a proper market here.  We are not eliminating any aspect of the trade but there are no proposals at present to go in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply indicated that to some extent it would depend on the outcome of the inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission. Surely the difficulty there is that the Fair Trade Commission will be looking at it purely from the point of view of whether pricing is fair given the monopoly that exists.  The strategic question of whether the multinationals should control the bulk of our distribution system will not be an issue for them.  The Minister surely must give us a commitment here that his Government are actively looking at providing an alternative distribution system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that the commission will be looking at the pricing mechanisms, but it would be impossible, having examined the pricing mechanisms, not to deduce some consideration as to why we arrived at that situation if distribution is a factor, and obviously it is.  If other factors are to be enjoined in that these will be all duly considered by the Government in whatever action will eventually be taken arising from that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware I announced details yesterday of an agreement for the sale of the State shareholding and royalty in Tara Mines Ltd. The Government decided to proceed with this transaction following careful consideration of the various factors involved including the question of the value to the State of a minority shareholding in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that this question was down for some time before the Minister made a decision.  Is he aware that for six years now, since 1983, every six months I have questioned every Minister for Energy in regard to the payment of royalties and tax by this company who have not paid, as the Minister said yesterday, a brass farthing?  Does the Minister agree that the agreement he has announced is equivalent to total capitulation to this company?  They have taken up £608 million and the Minister has capitulated to them by selling them 25 per cent of the company.  In view of the rising price of non-ferrous metals, including zinc, for quite some time &mdash; in recent months very sharply rising prices &mdash; does the Minister agree that the State's shareholding he has sold for less than its market value, will be increasing in the next few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy there was absolutely no capitulation to anybody in relation to these negotiations.  I informed this House and Deputy Mac Giolla that, should I get a satisfactory offer for the Tara shareholding, I would be prepared to sell, and we negotiated on the basis of ensuring that the consideration in the final analysis would put into the hands of the State at this time funds which would exceed the dividend <Col N="1818" /> and royalty which would be possible over the lifetime of the mine and any historic royalties which were due up to this time. It was on that basis I set out to negotiate to ensure that we had in hand at the end of the negotiations a sum of money not equivalent to but greater than the anticipated forecast dividend and royalty over the lifetime of the mine.  The significant difference between the two is, as the Deputy rightly says, in the historical context.Up to now there was clearly no certainty on the basis of experience as to what the future would give by way of dividend and royalty.  I clearly took that matter into consideration and, using the best available international forecasting agencies on the likely price of ore over future years, on the likely exchange rate between the dollar and the pound and on all the other considerations in relation to the restricted shareholding I had, I am satisfied that I have achieved at this juncture, with money in hands for the State, a very significant breakthrough.  Also I have, as I said, ended the barren period which the Deputy referred to, during which no royalties whatsoever were paid on this mine to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me conclude.  These job losses took place during a time when we had a 25 per cent shareholding in the company.  In the context of these negotiations and on the best information available to me, there are no proposals for a reduction in the workforce.  The company are a highly competent, professional developing organisation and have introduced a lot of new technology. As far as I can see, the future for the workforce in Navan is quite secure.  When we had a 25 per cent shareholding there were job losses and the Deputy will have to realise that I cannot control these patterns in privately controlled companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify something which was not explicit in yesterday's announcement.  Is the figure of US$50 million converted to IR£35 million the total and absolute settlement for historic royalties not paid in the past and the waiving of any royalties to which we might be entitled in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So this is it.  Tara with all its richness is worth just £35 million to the Irish people and the Minister does not think he has capitulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I will explain the position to the House.  In 1986 Outokumpu purchased 75 per cent of this shareholding in Tara.  At that time they paid $80 million using the US GNP inflation rate, that would be equivalent to $113 million today.  If we were to do a straightforward mathematical calculation on the value of the 25 per cent shareholding which I had, though slightly diluted in 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Col N="1820" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  In 1986, Cominco, Noranda and Chartered Consolidated were multi-national companies reading the future in regard to zinc prices.  That was the best price that those multi-national companies with international experience, one of which will be controlling one of the biggest refining and smelting processes in the world, were prepared to accept, using the criteria we were talking about.  I have beaten that price by 50 per cent.  I acknowledge that zinc prices have gone up and were at an all-time high last February, though they have dropped by 20 per cent in the past two months.  If I wanted to achieve the maximum input of finance for the State I was right to go at the time when zinc prices were high.  I will counterbalance this is one other way.  I achieved that price with a minority shareholding, which could not be compared to a 75 per cent shareholding with the restrictions that were there from 1975 and the dilution which took place in March 1982.  If we use the developments which took place in 1986, update the price paid then and take into account that the negotiators were internationally experienced competent people in the world of mining, we must take cognisance of what they accepted and compare that to what has been achieved in this instance.  We must take into account the use for which the money is being provided.  We have had an exceptionally good deal.  I am disposing of a minor shareholding in a dormant asset in a privately controlled company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not confuse the purposes for which the Minister wishes to spend the money with the value of the <Col N="1821" /> money which he has obtained.  Let us not follow that red herring.  Can the Minister not accept that his forfeiture of any future royalties is inexplicable?  Can he indicate why he has written off on behalf of future generations and future Ministers for Energy that possible opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained already and I will try to do so in a different way. The consideration which the Deputy has in mind seems to ignore a fundamental feature of our experience in this relationship to date.  In 1986 an application was made for a royalty which, to the best of my recollection, was something like $4.8 million.  This was considered to be the royalty entitlement up to that time. Negotiations have gone on since then and it has not been possible to complete this matter, so that up to the current time we have not been able, with the lifetime of the mine nearly half-way through and with an exported ore in value terms of something like £600 million, to obtain a single penny through royalties.  Looking at the system in the shareholding and the agreement, one could not be sure as to what the future would hold in relation to this matter.  Ore prices are high at present, though dropping.  The cyclical nature of ore prices results in high peaks and some very protracted periods of low prices.  There is a new dimension in the context of refining facilities which will be operational in Alaska next year and are expected to depress prices further. Taking all these considerations into account I do not understand why the Deputy can assume a dividend and a royalty of such a substantial nature that it would be better than the deal I have achieved.  It must be borne in mind that starting from now I have a time value alone of $3.5 million a year by virtue of the fact that I have this money on hand now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The deferred payments <Col N="1822" /> have a market rate of interest compounded from day one until they are finally paid.  I do not think the Deputy can stretch his imagination, based on experience up to now in relation to royalties and looking to the future, to decide that this country would be certain to obtain through that mechanism the kind of funds which I have put at the taxpayers' disposal and into the refinery today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that when Outokumpu bought their share in this mine it was sustaining losses while it is now making significant profits?  Is it not also the case that this bears no comparison with the figures now since the Minister is giving away royalties on top of the shares?  The two figures cannot be compared.  Is it not the case that only up to 1984 royalties of £5 million were sought?  Royalties of at least another £5 million are due up to 1989 and with two-thirds of the mine left we could expect another £20 million in royalties from the remaining life of the mine.  In view of that, would the Minister not accept that, as the Irish Stock Market now values a similar company two-thirds the size of his share in this mine at £40 million, they would value his share at £60 million and not the £35 million he obtained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no way you can compare the price of a 75 per cent shareholding with what I had &mdash; a minority shareholding in the company &mdash; and relate that to what is happening on the stock market, where people spend money on shares in a particular company in the expectation of a bonanza, or that they are going to make a lot of money.  People <Col N="1823" /> do that in these instances, but I am dealing with a cold situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know what I am doing.  I have been able to calculate what dividends and royalties would be due to the State over the next 20 years of the lifetime of the mine.  I was not prepared to accept at this stage an equivalent sum for these royalties.  I sought more than that, and that is what I have achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister has just said, the lease agreement at present requires that royalties would be paid only after a certain level of after tax profits has been obtained. Given that the State has received nothing during the lifetime of this mine up until the announcement was made yesterday, would the Minister not consider that the best way to ensure the Irish people benefit from mineral resources which are being extracted would be to have a production royalty system in place whereby every time something is extracted from the mine a royalty of some kind is paid on foot of that?  Would the Minister assure the House that he would put that kind of system in place for any future mining leases he grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to a previous question I indicated that the Government are quite happy with the system in place at present but if it was necessary to review that in the light of developments in the future, I would be quite anxious to ensure that changes are made.  Let us acknowledge that we want to see exploration and mining taking place.  In some instances it is quite a high risk business where very considerable finance has to be expended before there can be any return for the <Col N="1824" /> investment.  We need to develop these resources and to create employment.  We have to get a balance between the incentives which are there for that development to take place in the first instance and the final take to the State.</P>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the question, by disposing of the royalty element in the context of these negotiations for the future, the tax take from the company, including Outokumpu or any future company arising from a similar arrangement, will be all the greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points.  I want to ask the Minister if the sale of this share, for whatever price, is an indication of a dramatic change in policy by Fianna Fáil.  With the Galmoy discovery coming onstream, possibly as big as Tara, does this indicate that the Minister has forgotton completely and forever about the question of building a smelter to process our own ore?  Finally, is this sale an indication to Fianna Fáil's friends in Galmoy that there will be no State interference in that area and that they can take the whole lot for themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision and this sale have no ideological undertones.  It is a stand-alone arrangement.  It is the sale of a minority restricted shareholding, which was perhaps badly constructed in the beginning and diluted on 5 March 1982, in a privately controlled company, being used in a publicly owned strategic facility. that is the direct opposite to what the Deputy claims the Government are doing.  The Government are being accused of privatisation by transferring funds from a privately controlled company into a publicly owned national strategic facility.  That could not possibly, by any stretch of imagination, be a direction in which you could go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have considered the question of a smelter for this country for a very long time.  The IDA and various <Col N="1825" /> Government Ministers have considered the capital intensive cost of building a smelter.

I would also remind the Deputy that the knowledge about the ore body in Navan is known to all the people in that business in Europe and no international proposal has been made.  Finally, the facilities for smelting in the world as a whole, as the Deputy probably realises, far exceed the demands on that capacity at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the four Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of this House will be aware, the Taoiseach, as soon as news of the appalling disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield became known, issued a message of condolence to the British Premier conveying his personal <Col N="1827" /> sympathy and that of the Government at what had occurred.</P>
    <P>While this message can be taken as being on behalf of us all, I believe it is appropriate on this occasion to again express deepest sympathy with all those who are bereaved as a result of the tragedy and all those who have suffered physical injury or trauma arising out of it.  I know that all Members of this House will wish to be associated with this expression of sympathy.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday's occurrence has naturally given rise to concern about arrangements for crowd control and safety at similar events held here.  I want to begin by outlining the respective responsibilities in the matter.  Responsibility for the orderly control of crowds and for public safety within the grounds at football matches and other events of that nature rests on the organisers of such events.  The attendance of gardaí for duty inside the grounds or premises at these events can be arranged by organisers through the Garda authorities who will provide the level of Garda attendance requested.  Where Garda service of this nature is provided, the organisers of the event bear the cost.</P>
    <P>Security and public order arrangements outside the grounds at such events are an operational Garda matter and one on which the Garda obviously have to adopt a flexible approach involving a willingness to change plans or tactics at any time to suit developments.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have, for some years now used prepared guidelines on operational planning for control of spectators at sporting and other events which gather huge crowds.  The guidelines include arrangements for policing both outside and inside the stadia and the main routes used by spectators.  As part of their planning for major events of this kind the Garda authorities meet the organisers and the necessary arrangements are planned in advance.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have, in general, worked well up to now.  In the aftermath of last Saturday's tragedy, however, it is only prudent that all aspects of safety at <Col N="1828" /> such events should now be thoroughly reviewed.  Accordingly, the Government have decided to set up a high level review group to carry out a comprehensive examination of all existing arrangements, including the need for additional legislation, for public safety and crowd control at major public events.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government have directed that, as a matter or urgency, all Departments should carry out a detailed review of existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>In relation to the major sporting events that are due to take place over the next few weeks the Garda authorities have made arrangements to consult with the sporting organisations concerned with a view to seeing to it that all the necessary steps are taken to ensure the safety and security of those attending these events.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of a contribution to the disaster fund which has been set up, this matter has not as yet been considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is concerned at the level of insensitivity, if not irresponsibility, of the Croke Park authorities who on the day after the Hillsborough disaster were found to be in breach of the 1985 Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations when two exits, installed at the insistance of Dublin Corporation, behind the Cusack Stand remained locked despite an attendance of 35,000 spectators.  Is it the Minister's view that prosecutions should follow that serious breach of safety regulations?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about the establishment of a review group.  I have suggested that a committee of inquiry should be established which is much the same thing.  Will the Minister indicate how quickly the review of existing sports stadia will conclude in view of the fact that a number of major events are scheduled to take place in the next couple of weeks? Will the Minister indicate the Government's willingness to make a generous donation to the disaster fund?  I accept that the Minister has said that that matter has not been considered but I should like to ask him to indicate that there is a willingness to make a donation.  I should like to ask the Minister to indicate how quickly legislation governing crowd control, the safety of sports stadia and other outdoor locations, will be brought before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, discussions have been put in train between the Garda authorities and the organisers of big sporting events in relation to crowd control arrangements.  Those discussions will review plans which have been in place for some time for crowd control at such events and which have worked well up to now.  If any adjustments or modifications of these plans are needed in the light of the experience of last Saturday's events at Sheffield, than I have every confidence that the Garda and the organisers of these events will identify them and implement them vigorously and successfully.  Looking beyond the forthcoming events, there will also be the through review directed by the Government.  With regard to the Deputy's question about the time frame the review is expected to work within, I should like to remind him that Departments have been instructed by the Government to review their involvement in these arrangements.  The review body will be established immediately.  I should like to repeat that the Garda are approaching the organisers of sporting events which are due to take place.  If legislation is felt necessary I am sure the House will give it the priority it may need to get it through as quickly as possible.</P>

Will the Minister ensure that all sporting bodies take that suggestion into account?  In regard to Lansdowne Road, I suggest that the Minister communicate with those responsible for the DART service in regard to the use of the station adjoining those grounds.  The Minister should ensure that trains do not stop at that station when <Col N="1831" /> major fixtures are taking place in the adjoining ground.  The gates are a potential hazard on such occasions.  I am sure the Minister will get the co-operation of the people of Dublin, if he makes an alternative arrangement in regard to that system.  Will the Minister ask the Lansdowne Road authorities to provide more entrances to the ground?  Spectators will be safe inside but there is a need to examine the number of entrances.  Will the Minister give details of the type of review that will take place? Does he agree that the review should not be confined to Dublin venues and should include major centres throughout the country?

Certainly, these will be matters that will be considered by the review group about which we are speaking.  With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, the Deputy and the House can rest assured that this review group will not confine their activities solely to the Dublin area.

      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach if the Government would make time available for a debate on the current position within the Defence Forces.  At the time the Taoiseach seemed to have an open mind in the House and suggested that the matter could be discussed between the Whips.  That has been done and to say the least the Government Chief Whip has taken a negative attitude. I should like to ask now whether the Taoiseach would reconsider the matter and agree to make time available for a debate on circumstances causing a great many of us a good deal of worry and <Col N="1904" /> members of the Defence Forces and their families a great deal of hardship.</P>

      <P>What I am about to say is being said in a spirit of the utmost constructiveness.  It seems to me that Deputy Doyle's question a moment ago and mine last week and others just before the Easter recess would indicate that the Chair appears to be under the impression that in the replies he gives to Deputies in the House as to the reasons why their questions may or may not be allowed, his syntax is pellucid and the replies comprehensive and comprehensible but from the other side of the argument, the replies tend to be opaque, incomplete and are seen by Deputies as not really explaining the reason.  With great respect, I suggest that the Chair should have his office look again at the terms in which he couches these replies so that perhaps some of the discussions we have here might be avoided and the Chair would not be under an obligation from time to time, as was suggested by Deputy Davern, of counting to ten.  It would help the order in the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides a statutory basis for the taxation provisions which I announced in this year's budget and for other tax changes which the Government now consider necessary.</P>
      <P>The measures in the Bill are an essential part of the Government's overall strategy for economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Everything we are doing is aimed at increasing growth and jobs in our economy.This applies as much to the tax measures we have before us in the present Bill as it does to the expenditure side of the budget, the ongoing implementation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the recently published National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>All these elements are meshed together in a coherent overall strategy. The problems and development needs of the economy are such that there can be no question of double think or lack of consistency between the different parts of that stragegy.  Everything must hang together in a consistent and carefully-targeted approach aimed at securing more growth and more jobs.</P>
      <P>In view of last week's comprehensive debate in the House on the National Development Plan, I do not propose today to deal at any great length with the economic situation.  Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, however, I would like to comment briefly on recent trends, to underline again some of the points touched on in last week's debate, and to review the Government's approach to tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> This year's budget won widespread support throughout the community. Developments since the budget suggest that the strategy on which it was based is firmly on course.  The Exchequer returns for the first quarter were very encouraging.They support the view that the strengthening in economic activity which was projected in January is in fact taking place.  There is a strong recovery in consumer spending.  Retail sales in January were up by 7 per cent in volume on the year before.  Unemployment in the first quarter of this year was substantially lower than in the first quarter of last year. Manufacturing employment in the final quarter of 1988 &mdash; the latest period for which figures are available &mdash; shows a year to year increase for the first time since 1980.  In the building industry, employment in the larger firms in January and February was some 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding two months of 1988.  This, together with the increase of 30 per cent in housing starts in the first two months of the year, is an indication of the substantial recovery which is now under way in the building industry after several lean years.</P>
    <P>The trends so far support our expectation of a further substantial balance of payments surplus this year, of broadly the same order as last year.  Exports have risen by 24 per cent in value year to year in the first two months of this year.  This reflects the continued buoyancy of our export markets and the all important improvements in competitiveness which have been made here.  There has also been strong growth in the value of imports.  Imports of capital goods are up by 20 per cent &mdash; a good omen for investment and future output.  As expected, imports of consumer goods are also strong in response to the recovery in private consumption.  The challenge to domestic producers is to capture a growing share of this recovery in consumption and not to lose out, through price increases, to overseas producers selling into the home market.</P>
    <P>The overall prospect for 1989 remains, therefore, one of strong economic <Col N="1915" /> growth.  I am confident that the budget time prediction of a 3½ per cent increase in real GDP will be realised and might be bettered.</P>
    <P>Everybody is taking heart from these developments.  There is a new air of confidence around.  It is good to see new investments and projects springing up all around the country.  While the problems are still formidable, people now see that the earlier pattern of despondency and economic decline can be broken.</P>
    <P>It is no part of my task to dampen down this new enthusiasm &mdash; the opposite is the case.  I must underline again, however, that in taking satisfaction from the progress made to date we must keep our feet firmly on the ground.  Easy options must be avoided.  An increase in costs and inflation &mdash; even from the low base we have achieved &mdash; is no substitute for higher productivity and efficiency. Jobs will be lost, not made, if we do not continue tight control of costs right across the economy.</P>
    <P>For this reason it bears repeating that much of the rise in prices in the three months to February &mdash; over 1 per cent, leaving aside non-recurring budget effects &mdash; originated within our own economy rather than from abroad.  If we are not to put at risk our hard-won success in getting inflation down, all sectors must continue the restraint in evidence up to recently and avoid rekindling domestic inflation pressures.  Renewed inflation can only do harm to our international trading prospects, diminish our growth potential, and ultimately inhibit the recovery in employment now under way.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the public finances over the past few years has been dramatic.  The trends so far this year suggest that, yet again, the budget targets may well be bettered.  In this area too, however, we cannot allow our guard to slip.  The annual addition of new borrowing is still too high.  The exceptional overhang of debt still constrains our economic progress and eats up large resources that could be put to much better use.  I wonder if this House realises that to secure our national debt involves £40 of <Col N="1916" /> every working person's salary or wages. The Government are determined, therefore, to press ahead with the reduction of borrowing and debt.</P>
    <P>We are already considering how best to achieve necessary further savings in expenditure in 1990, so as to make room for new investment within an overall improving budgetary trend.  This work will be advanced in the coming months. It must take account, among other things, of the fact that the carry-over costs from the 1989 budgetary concessions on social welfare and personal taxation alone will add some £160 million to the opening position for next year.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements identified by the Government in their strategy for bringing order to the public finances was the absolute necessity to control the growth in the public service pay bill, which accounts for such a large proportion of total Government expenditure.  For this reason, the position that is developing on special increases in the public service is of particular concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that already this year I had to provide an extra £70 million for the cost of the general pay increase under the public service pay agreement, £28 million for increments, £12.5 million for the Defence Forces' special increases plus £15 million for the carry-over cost of increases from the 1986 pay agreement.  In addition to these very substantial amounts, I provided £30 million for special increases this year as the Government accept that there are legitimate expectations that some payment will be made in respect of certain special increases processed under the current pay agreement.</P>
    <P>However, the number and cost of the increases which have been processed, or are being processed under the agreement, to say nothing of further claims which may be made, is a cause of serious concern.  The Government are determined to take a resolute stand on this issue.  This means, first, that the £30 million provision cannot be exceeded this year and, secondly, that commitments cannot be made which would increase the pay bill in 1990 and subsequent years to <Col N="1917" /> such an extent as to place in jeopardy the considerable progress which has been made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I announced in my budget speech my intention to invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discussions on the whole issue of special increases.  I met with Congress on 8 March and informed them of the financial and budgetary problems which the Government face in relation to the build-up of special increases in the public service.  I asked them to consider the issues involved and to meet with officials to see if a mutually acceptable solution could be reached.  Since then, a number of such meetings have been held and talks are continuing.  It is my earnest hope that the good sense and concern for the national interest which was so evident in the discussions which led to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will also inform these talks and that a satisfactory solution will emerge.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in the past two years in the reform of the tax system.  Talk of reform could only be talk so long as the public finances were in such disarray.  The actions taken in the past two years have created scope to make a significant start on the process of reform and we have availed of this to the full. As is indicated clearly in the <i>National Development Plan</i>, the process will be pushed forward until we have a fairer and effective system with a considerably lower burden of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>The phased programme for tax reform has been pursued by the Government without compromising the overall reduction in Exchequer borrowing which has been so crucial to economic recovery. The programme last year included sizeable reliefs in personal tax; major improvements in tax assessment and collection arrangements, such as the introduction of self-assessment and the hugely successful amnesty to clear arrears of tax; a sustained attack on the tax evasion which for so long has exploited the general body of taxpayers, and a major revamping of the corporation tax system in line with international trends and to <Col N="1918" /> remove the bias towards investment in machinery rather than jobs.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform continues this year, as is reflected in the present Bill, with further sizeable reductions in personal tax including a highly significant cut in the actual rates of tax; new development incentives and, at the same time, measures to ensure that earlier incentives are not abused; and further improvements in tax administration and reasonable measures to counteract transactions which are aimed primarily at tax avoidance and which, if not curbed, could prove so costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is only by effective tax administration and a broadening of the tax base, combined with savings on Government expenditure, that we can achieve the lower level of personal tax that we all want.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention the implications for tax reform of the 1992 indirect tax harmonisation proposals.  There are now clear indications, confirmed by the proceedings at the EC Finance Ministers meeting that I attended yesterday in Luxembourg, that the earlier set of proposals put forward by the Commission will be revised.  I expect those revised proposals will be put on the table next month by Commissioner Schrivener.  This confirms the wisdom of the Government's approach in not rushing to implement the earlier proposals.  We have, of course, taken the prospect of harmonisation into account by reducing our reliance on increases in indirect taxes so as not to worsen the problems we face.  I stressed again at yesterday's meeting that the process of harmonisation will involve a huge tax revenue loss for this country and that the Commission must address this problem as part of its revised approach.</P>
    <P>The ongoing discussions in the Community on the question of introducing a common withholding tax on interest payments is also something that we have to take into account in our work on tax reform.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the approach underlying individual sections of the Bill and to draw the attention of the House to the more significant items. <Col N="1919" /> Full details of the individual sections are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The early sections of the Bill deal with income tax and provide for implementation of the package of tax reliefs announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 1 increases the general and age exemption limits.  The general exemption limit is being increased from £2,750 to £3,000 in the case of a single person and from £5,500 to £6,000 in the case of a married couple.  For single persons aged 65 years or over, the new limit is £3,400, and for single persons aged 75 years or over, £4,000; these limits are of course doubled as appropriate for elderly married couples.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for the introduction of the addition of £200 per child in conjunction with the exemption limits. This addition is aimed specifically at improving the position of low-income families and its impact on the tax burden faced by such families can be dramatic. To take one example, a married couple with three children, one spouse working with an income of £6,600 and taxed under PAYE, will save up to £495 compared with their 1988-89 tax bill.  Of course, this exemption and child allowance also applies to people in small businesses and indeed to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the changes in income tax rates and bands.  The top rate of tax is being reduced to 56 per cent and the standard rate to 32 per cent.  This reduction in the standard rate, which is the first for over 20 years, also applies to the deposit interest retention tax and to the withholding tax on professional fees. The income tax bands are also being widened: the 48 per cent band is being extended to £3,100 for a single person and £6,200 for a married couple, while the standard rate band is being extended to £6,100 for a single person and £12,200 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>These income tax changes have three objectives.  The increase in the exemption limits and the introduction of the child addition of £200 per child is aimed, as I <Col N="1920" /> have said, at improvement of the position of low-income families.  The extension of the standard and 48 per cent rate bands is aimed at reducing the progressivity of the system and maintaining, at nearly 63 per cent, the proportion of taxpayers paying tax at no more than the standard rate.  Finally, the reduction in the standard and top rates underpins pay moderation in the economy and begins the process of driving down income tax rates and fully restoring the incentive for enterprise and effort.</P>
    <P>The Government have thus given a clear signal of the direction in which we wish to go in future reform of personal tax.  The overall cost of this year's income tax package is over £200 million in a full year.  Taken together with the concessions introduced by my predecessor in 1988, reliefs costing well over £700 million on a cumulative basis over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have been provided by the Government, compared with the commitment of £225 million contained in the programme.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill continues the £286 PRSI tax allowance for the current year, while section 4 deals with the benefit-in-kind taxation of preferential loans.  Following the fall in interest rates in the past two years it reduces to 10 per cent the specified rate which is used to assess the benefit-in-kind charge on preferential mortgage loans; it also provides that, where an employer makes a loan to an employee at less than the specified rate, the loan will not be regarded as a preferential one provided it is made on an arm's length basis at normal commercial rates.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 deal with the restrictions on life assurance and mortgage interest relief which I announced in the budget.  Life assurance relief is being confined to 80 per cent of its previous levels, while the percentage of mortgage interest within the relevant ceilings which will qualify for relief is being reduced to 80 per cent from 90 per cent, at which it has stood since 1987.  The yield from these measures is £16.8 million in 1989 and £27.9 million in a full year.  This has met <Col N="1921" /> part of the gross cost of the major package of personal reliefs.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes significant changes in the business expansion scheme.  As Deputies are aware, there has been widespread concern in this House and elsewhere at recent developments in relation to this scheme.  The original intention was to encourage the provision of equity capital for high-risk companies which offered the prospect of substantial gains to the economy in terms of output and jobs.  In return for the provision of risk capital to these companies the general body of taxpayers made available an attractive relief for investors.  The recent developments to which I refer have been diverting the scheme away from this very desirable objective.</P>
    <P>The Government had to weigh the position carefully so as to ensure that action taken to restrict relief under the scheme would not interfere with BES funding for deserving projects.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is intended to redirect the scheme back to its original purposes.  The section introduces five measures, as follows: it provides that, where BES money is being used for the purchase of a ship, that ship must represent a beneficial addition to the Irish shipping register; it imposes a limit of £2.5 million on the amount of money a company or group of companies can raise under the scheme; it excludes from the scheme international leasing and related financial services; it also excludes self-catering accommodation in the city or county of Dublin and the urban areas of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway; and finally, it provides that BES relief will not be available on shares in relation to which options or guarantees are held which provide for sale at other than market value at the end of the five-year period for which shares must be retained under the scheme.  I am satisfied that these provisions will help to restore the scheme to its original purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the section the new measures will apply in respect of shares issued on or after the date of publication of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall my budget <Col N="1922" /> announcement that annual accounting for PAYE-PRSI and VAT would be introduced for small scale employers and traders.  The change in relation to PAYE-PRSI has been given effect through regulations already made by the Revenue Commissioners on 23 March under existing legislation.  The change in relation to VAT is provided for in section 52 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the purpose of the annual accounting facility is to ease the administrative burden on small traders and to release resources in the Office of the Collector General for other purposes. Moving to the new arrangements is an option for the traders and employers concerned &mdash; it will not be obligatory and they can stay with existing periodic payments if they wish.  Even for those wishing to change, the final decision will rest with the Collector General who will have regard to the track record of the traders concerned and can if necessary impose a procedure for payments on accounts within the 12-month period.  The amounts of revenue involved in these cases are not significant.  I believe that the new facility will be useful one but the Revenue Commissioners will of course closely monitor how it operates in practice.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a consequential provision arising from the introduction of annual accounting for PAYE.  It relates to Revenue preference for PAYE in a company liquidation.  The intention is simply to retain the existing Revenue entitlement in the event of a company on an annual accounting basis going into liquidation. The opportunity is also taken in section 8 to put beyond doubt the Revenue Commissioners' entitlement to take into account PAYE deducted by the company for the income tax month in which liquidation occurred.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives effect to the measures on stock relief for farmers, which were announced in the budget, by extending the scheme for a further two years and reducing the clawback period for destocking in respect of stock increases occurring from 6 April 1989 onward.  This will help to promote the build-up of the national herd.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> Section 10 increases from £6,000 to £7,000 the threshold applied to capital allowances and deductible running expenses for cars.</P>
    <P>Section 16 and 17 introduce new taxation arrangements for unit trusts and similar investment funds.  Fund management activity represents an area of great opportunity for this country.  This opportunity and job potential will be focused in the International Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks Area and the Government are confident that a significant number of quality fund management projects can be attracted into the centre.  The Government have already announced the special tax régime which will apply to funds which establish in the centre, and section 16 gives effect to this.</P>
    <P>In line with the position in certain other countries competing for the business these funds will not be subject to taxation on their income or capital gains provided that they are under management by a company in the centre, are established for the benefit exclusively of persons resident outside the State and are subject to the new regulatory régime for such funds which is being put in place by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on foot of the EC UCITS Directive.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the House that the same tax arrangements are being made in section 16 for funds which locate in the Shannon Airport Zone.</P>
    <P>Section 16 also introduces new tax arrangements for domestic Irish funds of this kind so as to ensure that the tax treatment of these funds will be broadly consistent with the tax treatment of funds in the IFSC and with continental European practice in the taxation of these funds.  The changes will help the funds in question to maintain a competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> foreign funds selling into the Irish market.  Such funds will no longer be liable to tax in their own right, but Irish-resident unit holders in a fund will be taxed on income and gains of the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the acquisition by <Col N="1924" /> Irish residents of units in a fund established in another EC country under the UCITS Directive.  While welcoming this development as positive progress towards a single European market in financial services, it is necessary to safeguard against possible infringements of our taxation system.  Income received from the foreign fund by an Irish resident is, of course, subject to tax in Ireland and to facilitate the collection of this tax, section 17 provides for disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners of information in relation to the acquisition by Irish residents of units in a foreign investment fund.  The information is to be provided by persons acting in the State as intermediaries between the Irish investor and the foreign fund.</P>
    <P>Section 19 restricts the cost to the Exchequer of domestic-sourced section 84 loans.  Despite the measures taken in the 1984 and 1986 Finance Acts, the cost of these loans to the Exchequer has increased considerably in the last three years.  This increase is due both to a 60 per cent rise in the overall volume of these loans over this period and to the increasing use of high interest rate section 84 loans.  These loans are taken out in currencies such as the Greek drachma and the Australian dollar and are much more costly to the Exchequer than normal section 84 loans.</P>
    <P>The section limits the cost to the Exchequer of domestic sourced section 84 loans in three ways.  First, no new section 84 lenders will be allowed on and from 12 April, the date of publication of this Bill.  Secondly, existing section 84 lenders will be allowed to increase their total loans volume only by a maximum of 10 per cent in the case of each lender and provided that such an increase is solely for loans to manufacturing companies.Thirdly, non-manufacturing companies located in the Shannon Airport Zone will not be allowed to borrow any new domestic sourced section 84 loans as from 12 April 1989.  These companies, which borrow the vast bulk of the very costly high interest rate loans, will be allowed until 31 December 1991 to phase out all their existing section 84 loans.  The <Col N="1925" /> changes will put these Shannon companies on the same footing as companies in the International Financial Services Centre in regard to section 84 loans.  Finally, it should be mentioned that the provisions do not affect foreign sourced section 84 loans, which will continue to be available to Shannon and other companies.</P>
    <P>Given the escalation in the cost of section 84 lending, these restrictions are necessary and reasonable.  The Government will be monitoring carefully future developments in this area.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 amend the new rules introduced last year for the distribution by companies of dividends from different types of profits.  There is no change in regard to the key rule that dividends are treated as coming proportionately from the mix of profits of the year or years in question.  This rule reflects the underlying commercial reality of companies with a mix of profits.  The main change is that a company will now be able to pay the dividends out of the mix of profits of any one or more preceding year in the past nine years.  Where such profits are exhausted, the company can go back earlier than nine years.  A company will, consequently, have much more flexibility in regard to dividend distribution as compared to the previous proposal which obliged companies to pay dividends in the first instance out of the mix of profits of the immediately preceding year.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of new or improved incentive measures to help build up various sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Section 15 introduces a major incentive for private sector investment in toll road projects.  The existing 50 per cent capital allowance relief for expenditure on such projects, which expired recently, is now being replaced by a provision to allow the write-off in full of this expenditure against toll income.  In addition, pre-trading interest which arises on capital borrowed to fund this expenditure will also qualify for relief.  The new concession will run for a period of three years and will encourage the active participation of the private sector in a significant way in the future development of toll roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> At present, data-processing and software development services qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  In order to reflect recent developments in the computer industry, certain related consultancy and technical services will also qualify in future.  This extention is provided for in section 20.</P>
    <P>Section 25 contains measures specifically designed to increase the overall investment in film projects, to maximise the initial investment in an individual film project and to encourage reinvestment in such projects.  The existing ceiling on investment of £100,000 in one year is now being increased to £600,000 for a single production and this total amount may, alternatively, be spread over three years, at £200,000 per year, as an investment in one or more productions.  In addition, as a further encouragement to corporate reinvestment in the industry, the concession on capital gains tax, which allows deduction of the full purchase price before tax relief, for shares held for three years in a film production company, is being extended.</P>
    <P>These enhanced incentives will apply up to 9 July 1992, and, together with other incentives already in place, will provide significant and substantial assistance to the film industry in attracting investment.</P>
    <P>Section 27 extends for a further three years the special rate of capital gains tax which applies in respect of certain shares, including those dealt with on the smaller companies market of the Stock Exchange.  This concession was introduced in 1986 when the smaller companies market was first set up.  The smaller companies market is still a relatively new market which has yet to realise its potential in terms of a capital raising facility for small growth-oriented Irish companies.  The Government believe that the extension of the special capital gains tax rate for a further three years will prove to be a very useful boost to the smaller companies market.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill provides that future contracts based on Government securities will not be chargeable assets for the purposes of capital gains tax. <Col N="1927" /> Gains on Government securities are already exempt from capital gains tax. As the law stands, this exemption would in all probability be held to extend to future contracts based on those securities provided that delivery of the underlying security is an unconditional requirement of the contract.  In order to remove any ambiguity on this point, section 29 makes it explicit that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the excise duty increases announced on Budget Day, Part II of the Bill also makes provision for the rationalisation and updating of some 50 excise licences.  In general, the level of licences/fees payable is being increased in line with inflation.  A small number of redundant licences are being terminated.  I am also taking the opportunity to create an excise licence specifically for dealers in petrol, whether wholesale or retail, at an annual rate of £20.  There already exists a hydrocarbon oil vendor's licence, to cover dealers in auto-diesel, which is being increased in the Bill to £20 also.  I am providing that a single payment of £20 will cover both the petrol and the auto-diesel licences. The purpose of the new licence is to equip the customs and excise service more effectively in the fight against petrol smuggling.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in section 47 for the introduction of a ten year driving licence at a fee of £20.  The three-year licence will continue, at least for the present, and there will also be provision for a one-year licence in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there is no reference in the Bill to the scheme of refund of VAT and excise duty on vehicles purchased by disabled drivers.  I am anxious to make a further attempt to ensure that obvious anomalies in the operation of the scheme be minimised and, if possible, eliminated, and I propose to discuss with Opposition spokesmen the possible terms of an amendment which I might introduce on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I would welcome any suggestions the main Opposition spokespersons may wish to make. We will probably then sit around the table <Col N="1928" /> in an effort to work out an acceptable amendment.  I do not think anyone is interested in seeing the abuses which are taking place continue.  Last year my predecessor made an attempt which proved to be unsuccessful.  Therefore let us hope we are more successful this year.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to the VAT changes announced in the budget as well as a number of further measures. The budget measures comprise the increase from 1.4 to 2 per cent in the farmers' flat-rate refund and the related livestock rate, the introduction of the annual accounting option to which I referred earlier and the reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in VAT for works of art.  In regard to this latter provision I have gone further than my budget day announcement by extending the lower rate to works of art regardless of their age.  Literary manuscripts are also covered by the concession.  It was pointed out to me, that because of the 50 year period laid down, the works of some very well known Irish artists were excluded. Consequently, I have made this change.</P>
    <P>Section 49 is a technical amendment affecting legal services supplied in insurance-related cases involving businesses.Until a recent High Court judgment the position was that such services were regarded as being supplied to policyholders who, in most instances, were able to recover any VAT charge. The court adjudged that the services should be regarded as being supplied to the insurer who, being VAT-exempt, would not be able to recover the tax.  As the effect of this would have been to increase the cost of insurance premia, and also to introduce an element of distortion of competition between Irish and certain foreign insurers, I am restoring the previous position.</P>
    <P>Section 53 is a technical amendment which empowers the Minister for Finance to set appropriate conditions when concessionary VAT refunds are being made under section 20 of the VAT Act.</P>
    <P>A change in the VAT treatment of optical services is provided for in sections 54, 55 and 56 (b).  The supply of spectacles and contact lenses by opticians has been <Col N="1929" /> treated as exempt from VAT on the basis that it was an integral part of the optician's professional service which is free of VAT.  The European Court held in 1987 that this practice was erroneous: their view, which is of course binding, was that while the professional service of eyesight testing is properly exempt under EC law, the supply of the spectacles or lenses must be taxable.  In accordance with this judgment I am imposing the 10 per cent rate of tax on these goods but, in order to allow opticians time to make the necessary arrangements for this transition, the provision will not take effect until 1 November next.  I do not expect corresponding increases in the cost of spectacles since, as a corollary of taxation, opticians will become entitled to reclaim input VAT on their purchases of equipment and other goods and services.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the bank levy is being renewed at last year's level of £36 million and section 57 gives effect to this.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of 1987 the Revenue Commissioners have operated a pilot scheme for the voluntary assessment of capital acquisitions tax.  This scheme involved close co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the legal profession.  In view of the success of the pilot scheme and the potential gains in terms of additional yield and greater administrative efficiency, I announced in the budget that the Government had decided to introduce self assessment of the tax on a mandatory basis.  Legislation to give effect to this and to a number of other matters in relation to capital acquisitions tax is contained in Part V of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 65 is the principal section.  It provides that mandatory self assessment will take effect from 1 September 1989. Because of the &ldquo;grace&rdquo; periods allowed for the submission of returns this means that self assessment will be fully operational on 1 January 1990.  Under the present legislation the Revenue Commissioners assess tax directly on the basis of information provided in returns completed by taxpayers or their agents. Under the new procedure the taxpayer <Col N="1930" /> or his agent, usually a solicitor, would complete the return, assess the tax due and forward this to the Revenue together with the payment.</P>
    <P>If a self-assessment system is to work it is critical that taxpayers disclose fully the assets which are subject to tax and compute their liabilities correctly.  The Bill, accordingly, provides for increased penalties and powers of enforcement. Section 68 increases the statutory penalties for non-filing or late filing of returns from £500 to £2,000 and the penalty for fraud from £1,000 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the new system will not be abused it is also considered necessary to introduce a surcharge for significant under valuation of property. This is provided for in section 70 and will operate so as to increase the tax payable in such circumstances by a surcharge ranging from 10 per cent to 30 per cent depending on the extent of the under valuation.  This type of surcharge represents a new development.  It is modelled on US Federal estate duty.  Normal appeal procedures will of course apply both in relation to the original tax and to the surcharges.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other changes which the Government have decided to introduce this year.  The main one of these concerns what is known as the &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; nephew relief.  A nephew or niece who takes a gift or an inheritance of business assets from his uncle or aunt is treated as a child of that uncle or aunt and so has a tax-free threshold of £150,000 instead of £20,000 in relation to those assets.  In order to benefit from the relief the nephew or niece must have worked &ldquo;substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo; in carrying on the business of the uncle or aunt in the five years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance.  This concession is being retained and the opportunity is being taken to set out more clearly what constitutes &ldquo;working substantially on a full-time basis&rdquo;.  The concession is being extended also by section 74 to gifts or inheritances involving trusts.</P>
    <P>Parallel with the introduction of increased penalties and powers of <Col N="1931" /> enforcement section 75 contains a particular measure designed to facilitate those who wish to make provision for a future charge to tax.  Since 1985, it has been possible to take out special insurance policies to provide for payment of inheritance tax.  The proceeds of these policies are exempt from inheritance tax in so far as they are used to pay that tax.  The relief applies at present only to policies in a sole name.  Representations have been made by the Irish Insurance Federation that the relief be extended to policies in the joint names of husband and wife and payable on the death of the survivor.  Because of the spouses exemption, tax does not normally arise until the death of the surviving spouse.  Section 75 extends the relief for qualifying insurance policies in the manner suggested by the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement on 25 January this year I announced that the Government had decided to introduce measures to counter the avoidance of tax.  Part VI of the Bill contains the Government's proposals in this regard.  Section 76 contains a general anti-avoidance provision. This represents a new development in Irish tax law but is by no means a new development in the international context.The need for a general provision here was highlighted by a decision of the Supreme Court last July in what has become known as the &ldquo;McGrath case&rdquo;.  It was clear following that decision that the means to counter tax-avoidance schemes had to be fundamentally reviewed if the Exchequer were not to incur a major loss of tax revenue.</P>
    <P>Numerous provisions aimed at curtailing tax avoidance have been introduced in earlier years.  These provisions have been of a specific nature &mdash; that is, aimed at particular abuses &mdash; rather than a general nature.  While specific provisions have a continuing role to play, and the Bill indeed contains a number of new specific provisions, experience shows that they can be circumvented by elaborate tax-avoidance schemes.  In addition, with a specific provision the loophole is closed only after it has already <Col N="1932" /> been exploited.  It is clear, therefore, that as well as specific provisions there is a role for a general provision to help safeguard the revenues of the State.</P>
    <P>The general provision in section 76 is a carefully balanced one which has been drawn up by the Government in close consultation with the Attorney General and taking account of the Supreme Court judgment in the case to which I have referred.  The purpose of the general section is to counteract certain transactions which have little or no commercial reality but are entered into primarily for tax avoidance purposes. The intention is to enable the Revenue Commissioners, subject to specified procedures and safeguards, to disallow the benefits of such transactions.</P>
    <P>The provision applies basically to transactions carried out on or after Budget Day, when I indicated the Government's intention to legislate in this area.  Transactions carried out before that day are affected only if they would result in the avoidance of tax arising on or after Budget Day.  In the absence of this latter provision tax deductions and reliefs engineered artificially before Budget Day could adversely affect the Exchequer, and thus the general body of taxpayers, for many years to come.  In simple terms I am saying if somebody following the McGrath type case avoidance scheme had set up his or her losses in advance of Budget Day and the profits had not come through but might come through in future years that would stop from Budget Day.  I must stress that this provision is aimed at transactions which set out purely and simply to avoid tax. There is no question of trying to create uncertainties for genuine business transactions or normal use of recognised tax reliefs.  The section contains explicit safeguards in this respect.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements the Revenue Commissioners are prepared in certain circumstances involving incentive reliefs to give an opinion in advance on the possible tax consequences of a proposed activity.  In addition the Revenue Commissioners will give, within the limits <Col N="1933" /> of their resources, opinions on the tax position of actions which have already taken place.  These procedures will not be affected by the new provision.  I know that the Revenue Commissioners will continue to be anxious to help to the maximum extent possible in dealing with approaches from business or other interests about genuine transactions. What they understandably must be wary about is a request for an advance opinion on a hypothetical or artificial proposition which is aimed at constructing a tax avoidance scheme.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the procedures which must be followed before a benefit can be disallowed under section 76.  The Revenue Commissioners must first from an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction. Having formed such an opinion, they must then notify the tax payer concerned who has 30 days in which to contest it by appealing to the Appeal Commissioners. There is provision too for the rehearing of an appeal by the Circuit Court and the stating of a case for the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no question of giving an unfettered general power to the Revenue Commissioners.  At the end of the day, an appeal to the courts is available and, in the case of dispute, it will be the judgment of the courts and not the opinion of tax officials which will finally determine the outcome.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general provision, specific anti-avoidance provisions are being introduced to counter a number of known avoidance schemes.  Section 77 counters tax avoidance devices designed to create allowable losses for set-off against chargeable gains.  Section 78 counters arrangements designed to enable shareholders to extract profits from a company without becoming liable to income tax on the receipt of those profits.  Section 79 combats the avoidance of capital acquisitions tax by the use of arrangements involving private company shares.</P>
    <P>In this opening address I have dwelt on some general economic issues and the <Col N="1934" /> approach to tax reform as well as outlining the more significant elements of the Bill.  I look forward to the opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sometimes the Second Stage of a Finance Bill has a sense of occasion.  That is certainly not the case today.  This Finance Bill is more remarkable for its size than its content.It is more an accountancy document than a political one.  It seems to legislate to implement the provisions of the budget, as indeed do all Finance Bills.  It also introduces new measures to deal at a very late date with problems of tax avoidance which were brought to the attention of the Minister before, during and after the budget.  As an instrument of economic policy, this Finance Bill is as inadequate as the budget from which it derives.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that after spending almost two years as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance took up his portfolio without a shot in his locker and, despite his responsibility for industrial development and the creation of jobs as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he introduced a budget which contained not a single serious idea which would contribute to economic growth and job creation.  The paucity of policy has been reconfirmed in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the favourable economic background at home and abroad and the fact that he inherited a good set of books from his predecessor, the Minister has chosen not to act to correct the serious problems in our economy which inhibit growth and job creation.  He seems to rely on public relations rather than action and has coined anodyne phrases such as &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo; to suggest that inactivity is a policy.  Try arguing with those on the dole queue &mdash; at present over 240,000 persons are unemployed &mdash; or with the 100,000 persons who have emigrated since the Government came to power that &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo; is a policy tailored to their needs.  Try arguing with the one million citizens who struggle below <Col N="1935" /> the poverty line that &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo; will take them out of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Government by turning their back on their platitudinous solutions and adopting the policies presented to the people by Fine Gael in the last election have succeeded in improving the fundamentals of the economy, but for the Minister to pretend that no further corrective action is necessary and that we will all glide together through untroubled seas towards prosperity could, at worst, be a recipe for economic disaster and at best bring about a situation where the future of two-thirds of our people is secured and the rest of our people are written off as surplus.</P>
    <P>The Government must govern in the interest of the people.  They must shape policy which enables all our citizens to aspire to happiness and prosperity.  They cannot stop now and shout &ldquo;Success&rdquo; when only a little ground is gained and there are so many victims not only of the economic blunders of the late seventies but of the corrective action of the eighties.</P>
    <P>We have a small population.  Much of what we produce must be sold abroad, and all our people can be gainfully employed only if we organise our economy to produce and sell far more than can be consumed by us.  We must export to live.  All economic policy in this country should be addressing the problem of how we can produce more goods and services and sell them more competitively at home and abroad.  We must produce to the point where all our citizens available for work are working.  Then we could afford to relax and say, &ldquo;Steady as she goes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is evident there are many factors which inhibit our economic growth.  They have been recited by me and others, in particular Deputy McDowell, on numerous occasions in this House.  A Minister for Finance who does not acknowledge the existence of these obstacles to growth and does not seek to remove them is not doing his job.  A Minister for Finance who in his first year fails to use the primary <Col N="1936" /> statutory instrument available to him to shape the nation is a disappointment.</P>
    <P>The factors which inhibit growth in the economy are well known.  They are not mysteries found at the far end of a telescope, at the bottom of a well or at the back of a cave.  Nowhere have the structural problems of the economy been recited more succinctly in recent times than in the introduction to the national plan.  Having identified the problems, however, the Government have failed to act &mdash; rather the Civil Service have identified the problems and the Minister has failed to act.</P>
    <P>I would like to look briefly at the economic and social analysis contained in chapter 1 of the plan which illustrates the problem in the context of this Finance Bill.  Let us look at the policy decisions arising from this analysis which the Minister for Finance could have incorporated in this Finance Bill but did not do so.  No progress will be made unless policy is coordinated to achieve recognised, agreed, attainable objectives.  The Minister for Finance, who had available to him the economic and social analysis in chapter 1 of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>, could have asked himself and his officials a simple question: &ldquo;What decisions could I incorporate in the Finance Bill which would remove some of the weaknesses identified?&rdquo; This did not happen.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government are serious about the economic analysis in chapter 1 of the plan or do they intend it as a series of <i>mea culpas</i> to soften the hearts of the Brussels bureaucrats, an exaggeration of our difficulties to loosen the European pursestrings in a pathetic belief that the biggest mí-ádh will get the most potatoes and that we must portray ourselves as Europe's misfortunates to get an adequate share of the Structural Funds. If there is a belief in Government circles that the economic and social analysis in the plan is a ploy rather than a depiction in the starkest terms of a weakness of our economy, they should disabuse themselves of the thought.  The economic and social weaknesses identified in the first chapter of the plan are real; the solutions <Col N="1937" /> proposed later in the plan are unreal and inadequate.  The Minister for Finance in this Finance Bill had the first opportunity to act but he has not done so.  It is not a case of not doing enough.  He takes no action at all.  One wonders if chapter 1 of the plan, like the 1977 manifesto, is a document he never read.</P>
    <P>Our peripheral location has resulted in major cost disadvantages.  The plan states that transport costs for Irish exports to Europe account for between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of export sales values. Much of this additional cost arises at home.  There are three reasons for this &mdash; our inadequate road structure, the high level of VAT and excise duty on articulated vehicles and motor cars, and the high cost of fuel due in part to high levels of excise on auto diesel and petrol.  The Minister could have acted in this Finance Bill to remove the competitive disadvantages arising from domestic transport costs.  He had announced the Government's intent in relation to the harmonisation of VAT and excise duty and he could have begun the harmonisation by lowering VAT and excise duty on articulated vehicles and by reducing the excise on auto diesel and petrol. Instead of doing so the Minister in his budget increased the excise duty on petrol by 6p per gallon and promised that a reduction in the cost of petrol at the pumps would cancel out this increase.  It did so for two weeks.  Then the price went up and the pressure has been upward since.</P>
    <P>The action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in recent days has added further to the shambles.  A mock battle will not bring down transport costs. Major increases are on the way and the Minister for Finance stands idly by giving little lectures on the evils of inflation and doing nothing, although he has the solution in his own hands.  He is reaffirming the Financial Resolution on excise duties on petroleum in the text of this Bill.  I call on the Minister today to reduce the excise imposition on petrol and auto diesel and to state his policy on the harmonisation of excise duties on petrol and diesel and on lorries, cars and vans as we approach <Col N="1938" /> 1992.  Let us have a real policy to reduce transport costs and compensate for our peripheral position in Europe and not proceed as if the inadequacies of our main roads was the only factor contributing to costs.  When will the roads Authority be put on a statutory basis and will it be given the right to toll roads?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.1.18 of chapter 1 of the <i>National Development Plan</i> states that trade distortions and anomalies have been caused by differentials in tax and excise duties on either side of the Border Could the Minister inform the House if he is doing anything about removing these problems?</P>
    <P>Ireland's dependence on agriculture is illustrated in paragraphs 1.1.21 and 1.1.22 of chapter 1 of the plan.  Has the Minister any proposal whatsoever in this Bill designed to improve the efficiency or productivity of agriculture?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.1.23 states:</P>
    <P>The traditional indigenous industries are small, and are generally characterised by significant deficiencies in essential business functions &mdash; finance, marketing, production, technology, management and business planning.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is not a single incentive to encourage small businesses to improve their performance under any of those headings.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 1.1.25 low investment levels are identified as seriously inhibiting economic growth in Ireland.  It is stated that the relative level of investment <i>per capita</i> is not sufficient to allow real progress towards convergence.  The whole basis of the plan is to enable us to converge towards European living standards, European growth rates and levels of GNP.  There is no measure in this Bill to rectify these matters.  We have a multiplicity of tax incentives to encourage investment in the building industry but very few incentives to encourage direct investment by the taxpayer in manufacturing industry.  The best incentive, introduced by Deputy John Bruton, was the business expansion scheme which has <Col N="1939" /> been virtually wrecked by the maladministration of the scheme by this Minister.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes.  The Minister has foregone about £50 million of taxpayers' money.  Most of it has gone into areas which will have no effect on job creation.  It is not going into manufacturing industry at all.  The Minister has succeeded in bringing about a situation, despite the fact that we reminded him about it on budget night and before, where money which could have gone into manufacturing industry for job creation is being drained off into areas for which it was never intended.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The best incentive, the business expansion scheme introduced by Deputy John Bruton, has been virtually wrecked by the Minister, who has not administered it correctly since he took over the portfolio.</P>
      <P>In part 2 of chapter 1 of the plan there is a sectoral analysis.  It refers to the traditional sector of Irish industry.  The Minister lays claim to understanding industry. Paragraph 1.2.4 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of the traditional sector of Irish industry has, in general, been extremely poor over many years. Employment in the sector is over 25 per cent lower than in 1980.  Investment levels have fallen as has the share of the domestic market accounted for by domestic industry.  Less than one <Col N="1940" /> firm in four is engaged in overseas sales and, in those that are, there is an undue reliance on one overseas market &mdash; the UK.  Profitability has been poor and in recent years has been running at less than 2½ per cent of sales.  While there are significant exceptions, which indicate a real potential for improvement, the sector generally is characterised by major scale diseconomies, poor capability in general management, in marketing expertise, technology and quality control.  The sector suffers from a general lack of competitiveness illustrated by the substantial loss of domestic market share suffered since Ireland joined the EC.  Some 90 per cent of Irish industrial firms employ less than 50 people and the weaknesses of Irish industry are generally more intense in these small-scale enterprises.</P>
    <P>That is the economic and social analysis of the traditional sector of Irish industry, but the Minister proceeds in this Bill as if it has never been stated.  There is not a single measure in this Bill to cater either for the strengths of the modern sector of industry, which is identified in the analysis, or the weakness of the traditional sector.  This Minister has spent two years at the Department of Industry and Commerce and should know the weaknesses of the traditional sector in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 1.2.11 and subsequent paragraphs the weaknesses of the tourism industry are identified.  Many of them relate to the imposition of VAT and excise duty on motor cars, self-drive cars and petrol.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister has ignored it completely in this Bill and there is no attempt to remove the structural weaknesses in the Irish economy which are illustrated in this plan.  The Minister is failing to use the power at his disposal to cure the problems of the economy.  He has been carried on the wave of opposition support and the fact that he inherited a good set of books from his predecessor.  The Minister is not sailing the ship but is being carried on the wave.</P>
      <P>Many of the inadequacies of the tourism industry relate to VAT and excise duties and the Minister should state what he is going to do about harmonising them. If there is any sector in our economy that has proved to be inadequate it is the tourism industry, and much of this is due to the high prices of the kind of consumer goods that tourists indulge in when they are on holidays.  I think we should call a minute's silence in the House to allow the Minister to reflect on the effects of lower excise and VAT on the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I could go on.  There is scarcely an economic or social weakness identified in chapter 1 of the plan which could not be remedied to some degree by an appropriate taxation response.  There is no response.  The Finance Bill is not merely a vehicle to enshrine in statute the rise and fall of tax rates; it is an essential weapon in the armoury of a government to make the economy grow.  This Minister has failed to use it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now turn to the area of personal taxation and state again, as I have repeatedly done, that radical reform of personal taxation is a prerequisite for the kind of <Col N="1942" /> growth rates we need.  This Government seems to see a reduction of taxes as the fruits of success in the economy.  Fine Gael regard radical reform of personal taxation as the foundation stone on which to build that success.  The tax system is not the result of our lack of economic performance; it is, to a large degree, the cause of it.  Successive Governments here have organised a most benign tax regime for capital investment and manufacturing industry, but have coupled it with a most malign PAYE and PRSI structure.  When it costs and employer £3.30 to put £1 in the pocket of a person on the average industrial wage, is it any wonder that the dole queues stretch to the horizon?  When a single person on little more than the average industrial wage has to bear the top marginal rate of income tax, is it any wonder that highly skilled single people are voluntarily joining the thousands of involuntary emigrants leaving our shores?  Is it any wonder that skill shortages are now emerging even though 18½ per cent of the population is unemployed, when 100,000 have emigrated in the last three years?  Over the last two years we have pressed the case on this side of the House.  I want to acknowledge that the Minister has moved a little.  He has reduced the top rate and the standard rate.  He continues however to substitute minor reductions in rates for fundamental reform of the system and is failing to do the job that is necessary.  Fine Gael appreciate the difficulty of tax reform. We have offered to approach the problem as we have approached the problem of debt control.  I would like to repeat that offer today but I know it will be rejected.</P>
    <P>Let me now comment briefly on a number of sections of the Bill.  What I shall say is by way of preliminary comment.I will address each section at lengthy on Committee Stage and table a lengthy list of amendments.</P>
    <P>First I would like to look briefly at the Minister's decision to increase by £200 in respect of each qualifying child the exemption limits for taxpayers with children I still cannot understand why the Minister approached that poverty trap in this fashion rather than using the family <Col N="1943" /> income supplement or a form of it.  That, in my opinion, is a far better method of targeting the people he seeks to target by this measure.  The Minister, by eliminating one poverty trap for married couples earning between £6,000 and £7,500, is opening another poverty trap when the clawback takes place slightly above that level.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister's action in section 24 in reducing from 12 per cent to 10 per cent the benefit-in-kind for preferential mortgage loans.  I had an agreement with his predecessor that that should happen and I am glad to see that it is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for a reduction in mortgage interest relief.  I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that the reduction in relief should be tied to the level of interest and that if mortgage interest rates go back up the relief should go back up.  I do not think it is beyond the capability of the Minister and his officials to have a situation where if mortgage interest rates go back up again the relief would go back up towards 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the Minister's corrective action in respect of the business expansion scheme.  On Committee Stage I would like the Minister to deal with this at more length.  I would like to know in particular why he pitches the upper limit of £2.5 million on the amount of shares issued by a qualifying company in respect of which relief can be claimed.  Is this £2.5 million a year or is it a total of £2.5 million?  The way it is drafted it looks as if it is something that could be repeated from year to year.  I would like the Minister also to justify the total elimination of leasing activities from this scheme. In relation to an aspect of the business expansion scheme which I drew attention to on budget day, the operation of self-catering tourist facilities, I would like the Minister to tell us if he is completely happy with the operation of another incentive for self-catering schemes where at least 75 per cent of the capital cost can be written off against personal taxation. I presume subsection (d) is intended to <Col N="1944" /> remove those BES schemes which have a guarantee in place which would be other than the market value of the shares, and again I would like to explore that at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with sections 9 and 10.  I welcome them and have some questions to raise.  In regard to section 13, I am not sure if it is for the purposes of clarification or intended as a new measure.I understood that when changes were made in corporation tax the write-off on farm buildings was to be treated differently from the position in industry. I see now that the Minister is proposing that up to 50 per cent can be written off in the first year as terms of accelerated allowances.  The balance of the expenditure would be written off at 10 per cent a year over the following five years.  I will be looking for clarification on this also.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the issue of the tolling of roads.  I would like the Minister to throw more light on his decision to increase from 50 per cent to 100 per cent the allowance on capital expenditure on toll roads.  Maybe this is justified; I am prepared to listen to the arguments.  A greater difficulty at the moment is that the tolling of roads is a function for local authorities.  We have had the experience already in regard to the Naas by-pass where the intent of the Government of the day and of the Department of Finance was that the road would be tolled, and the local authority refused to do so.  It seems to me that even though some local authorities have already stated that certain stretches of road would be tolled, the decision will be taken by a majority vote of the local authority meeting.  I do not think that provides the kind of certainty a private company needs when getting involved in the type of scheme the Minister seems to believe they will get involved in as a result of the improvements in section 15.  We need a firm statement on the establishing of a national roads authority on a statutory basis and on whether or not they will have the power to impose tolls on roads rather than the local authority.  Certainly it would provide greater certainty, if that were the case, to those who want to invest <Col N="1945" /> private capital in the building of motor-ways, bridges, roads, etc. here.</P>
    <P>Section 16, First Schedule, deals with the taxation of UCITS, a new word that we have to become familiar with, the undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities.  On the face of it, it is something that I would agree with, but I find it quite complex and I will be looking for quite a lot of explanations from the Minister.  Let me start with one question.  Does the Minister envisage a situation whereby companies outside the Custom House Docks site and the Shannon area would be involved in UCITS activity and if then there will be a power by the Revenue Commissioners to disentangle contributors to the UCITS so that foreign nationals will be exempt from tax and Irish citizens will be taxed? Will that apply outside the centre as well as within the centre?</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to raise refers to section 17 which is the anti-evasion section.  It would be extremely difficult to actually work that section in practice.  If we have free movement of capital in the Community it will be difficult for anybody to know the identity of the investor who puts his money into the Custom House Docks site; and, whether it is sourced from London, Amsterdam, Luxembourg or wherever, if he is an Irish citizen that will be fairly easy to disguise. The anti-evasion section seems to envisage a responsibility on the agent of the management of the fund operating in this country if someone invests abroad but I am thinking of a position where an Irish citizen channels his investment through an agent abroad back into a fund operating, say, in the Financial Services Centre.  Is there any provision in the sections to deal with that situation?  There is always a problem with tax breaks and it is very hard to ring-fence them completely.It might be possible to do that in a closed economy but once there is free movement of capital, labour, services and so on without let or hindrance across a community which will be moving towards various forms of unity after 1992, then the traditional coach and four will be driven through many of these provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> I would like the Minister to cast more light on section 19 and the restrictions on the section 84 loans.  While he dealt with it at considerable length in his Second Stage speech he did not attempt to quantify the tax foregone by what he said is the extending use of these provisions, particularly for high interest loans drawn in Greek drachmas and Australian dollars.I would just like some information on the amount of money that is foregone and what the implications of the section are in terms of the package of incentives available to the agencies, the IDA and SFADCo, in attracting industry to the country.  I would like also if the Minister would comment on the effect as he sees it on Shannon-based companies.  After 1991 they will not be able to source section 84 loans domestically but will continue to be able to source them abroad. We do not have that information at our disposal on this side of the House.  It would be of interest to all of us, and especially to those of us who live in the Shannon region, to be put in a position where we could measure the possible fall-out from this restriction.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the first constitutional question in this debate.  Is it constitutional to treat lending agents differently and will it be a subject of challenge that only those lending institutions which are at present involved in section 84 lending will be allowed to continue it, especially against the background of a Central Bank Bill which will empower the Central Bank to issue licences to many other people who want to engage in banking activities?  I would like the Minister to comment on that when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is a further extension to the 10 per cent regime.  There is very little left now that is not included in the 10 per cent regime if it has anything at all to do with the manufacturing industry.  I have no particular objection to it but it will put a further strain along the margins of corporate taxation.  I wonder if we are far from the day when the accountancy firms of the city and the country will be looking for the 10 per cent tax regime.  Since so many of them are involved in consultancy <Col N="1947" /> work it will be difficult enough to draw the line where a 10 per cent regime applies to consultancy in technical services relating to software development and data processing and where consultancies in other areas are subject to a rate of, I understand, 43 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 25 which provides some relief for the film industry seems to be a welcome move and I accept that.  I have already commented on Part II, customs and excise, and on the price of petrol and the harmonisation of excise duty.  There is a multiplicity of increases in licence fees over a multiplicity of licence provisions and that is something that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  It seems that most of the increases are more or less in line with inflation but I would like the Minister to go through them briefly on Committee Stage and point out if any change of significance has been made in any particular area.  I would like to ask the Minister in that context if the petrol retailers' licence is a new imposition or if it is an addition to some provision that existed previously.  In regard to the value-added tax provisions in Part III I would like to ask the Minister why he did not state his position on the harmonisation of VAT.  That will be crucial to the collection of taxes and also to economic development in the country over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 50 and in particular section 51 which fulfils the commitment made previously by the Minister.  I think the figure concerned could have been brought to 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent. The advice from independent sources was that the appropriate rate would be 2.6 per cent in regard to the VAT refund to farmers.  I may be putting down an amendment along those lines so I would ask the Minister to comment on this point in his reply to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I find section 52 disturbing.  It allows small traders the option of paying VAT at 12 month intervals rather than periodically.I know it will be welcomed by many small traders but I think it will get many of them into frightful trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> Many of their accountants will be advising them to continue to pay periodically. This seems to run counter to the kind of trend which we have seen in Finance Bills in the last few years.  It seems to be an invitation to people to get into difficulty when they have just come out of it as a result of the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to VAT on spectacles are technical in nature.  I think they derive from the European Court of Justice decision and certainly I cannot see any significant basis for controversy about them.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone further than his commitment on budget day in regard to section 56 and the reduction of VAT on works of art.  He has extended the commitment to apply to works of art not only over 100 years old but regardless of age and has extended it to manuscripts as well.</P>
    <P>In section 58 there is a further concession to the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  This has become a feature of Finance Bills.  We are at the stage now where we would be disappointed if a further concession or two, three, or four were not given in a Finance Bill to the financial services industry on the site or to the site itself. In Chapter II the arrangements with regard to returns and assessments on capital acquisition tax and especially the arrangements for self-assessment, are matters which I will be raising again.</P>
    <P>I would like to move now to the anti-avoidance provisions in Part VI of the Bill.  This is a section on which I intend to spend some time on Committee Stage. Obviously when gaps open up and when there are so many experts in the country and in the city who spend their time in identifying gaps, one needs to close the gaps, to protect the Revenue.  I accept what the Minister says, that after the McGrath case the wisdom of the Revenue Commissioners and the officials of his Department is that particular anti-avoidance measures of closing the door when the horse has bolted, are no longer adequate and a general tax avoidance measure is required.  This measure is very wide in its scope and will operate on the <Col N="1949" /> basis that any transaction which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is a tax avoidance transaction rather than a business transaction will be dealt with under the section.</P>
    <P>My concerns are threefold.  First, will genuine business transactions be caught? The explanatory memorandum states that genuine business transactions, even if carried out in a manner which is intended to minimise the tax chargeable on the transactions, cannot be regarded as tax avoidance transactions.  It gives the Revenue Commissioners the power to look behind every business transaction and form an opinion as to the motive which caused the transaction in the first instance.  I do not think it is enough to say that because there is an appeal to the Circuit Court and because that can be taken on a point of law to the High Court it will be the judgment of the court in the final analysis and not the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners that will be the deciding factor.  Of course, on appeal it will be the opinion of the court that will be given and that will be based on the terms of the section.  The court will not be looking at it independent of the section. If a Circuit Court judge finds that the Revenue Commissioners have con-formed with the terms of the section the Revenue Commissioners will win the argument.  That is a very wide power for the Revenue Commissioners.  Instinctively, I would prefer taxation measures being a matter of statute law rather than a matter of opinion on anybody's behalf, whether it is the Revenue Commissioners or the appeal from the Revenue Commissioners.Somebody must interpret what the law is but this section goes beyond simple interpretation.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the section the Revenue Commissioners, or officers thereof, are entitled to form an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction and if they form that opinion within the terms of the section I believe that a Circuit Court judge can only evaluate the formation of that opinion within the terms of the section.  The protection of the court, which the Minister has stressed, is more apparent than real.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> Secondly, this is retrospective to a large degree.  The Minister should have moved quickly when the Dáil resumed last October &mdash; the decision of the Supreme Court was announced during the summer &mdash; to introduce emergency legislation.  I do not think there would have been any difficulty in the House if he wanted to close the gap on that occasion.  There is a retrospective element in this, the degree of which I am not in a position to judge.  I would like to be advised by the Minister on it.  Certainly, transactions carried out before the day of the budget, in so far as they would avoid tax due on or after Budget Day, are caught within the terms of the section. It seems to me that for schemes put in place after the judgment in the McGrath case in July the liability for the tax would more likely accrue at the end of the tax year, towards 5 April.  Consequently, there may be a major element of retrospection in this.</P>
    <P>If that is so, well and good because I do not think anybody should be in a position to exploit a loophole in the law to enable them forego the payment of taxes which they are legally obliged to pay.  However, there are problems about retrospective legislation and I am sure Deputy McDowell will deal with them. There are problems about measures which operate in this way and I would like the Minister in his reply to deal with the constitutional difficulty of retrospection.I have dealt with the major portions of the Bill and, naturally, I will be tabling a series of amendments on behalf of my party.  I should like the Minister to take the opportunity when closing the debate on Second Stage to reply in detail to the questions I have raised on the different sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third Finance Bill introduced by the Government in this Dáil and, in terms of the life of the Government and the Dáil, it marks more than the half way stage.  Seen in that light the Finance Bill, in my view, is not a milestone for those who had hoped that the Government would avail of the uniquely favourable consensus that exists <Col N="1951" /> in the House for radical tax reform.  On the contrary, the introduction of the Bill is more akin to a tombstone than a mile-stone because it marks the end of any hope that the Government have any view, any wish or any appetite for radical tax reform based on the consensus which exists in the House.</P>
      <P>Why is it that the Government have failed to spell out a programme on tax reform?  Why is it that the Government have failed to set themselves any targets for tax reform?  Why is it that the Government, while able to make projections and plans for expenditure, for borrowing, for job creation and for a myriad of other things, cannot spell out even the vaguest plan, programme or strategy for reform of our tax system?  In that context I was slightly bemused by what was contained in the Minister's speech.  We are told that he intends to pursue a phased programme of tax reform.  A phased programme of tax reform, we are told, has been pursued by the Government without compromising the overall reduction in the Exchequer borrowing which has been so crucial to economic recovery.  Last year we were told what the programme included.</P>
      <P>With the greatest respect, the Minister has a neck as hard as certain portions of the anatomy of an equestrian gentleman. All I can say is that a programme, as now enunciated by the Minister, is something one finds out after it has happened.  We do not know what the programme is going to bring about next year, the year after or the year after that.  We do not know where tax rates are destined to be under this programme in two, three, four or five years time but what we do know is that the Minister is following a phased programme.That means that things happen by bits and pieces.  We will find out afterwards what the programme meant the previous year.  That is a new form of programme.  The whole idea of prospective programming is gone, one only finds out afterwards what has happened, that it fit, retrospectively, into some scheme of things that the Minister calls a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> I have to compliment the Minister on his dexterity in the use of the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; and, in his budget speech, for formally abandoning the Government's previously stated position that their tax programme was aimed at putting two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate of income tax.  That was enunciated by his predecessor, Deputy MacSharry, when Minister for Finance at great length both in the context of the last general election and after.  We were told that this was the aim of the Government.  It could have been achieved by changing the marginal tax rates of one in ten taxpayers.  It did not carry with it any notion of tax reform. It was very nearly achieved last year.  In fact, it was abandoned this year when it could have been put in place, but that is because it was a nebulous target.  Changing the marginal tax rate paid by one in ten taxpayers never amounted to a programme of tax reform.</P>
    <P>Why are all these things happening on a basis that will not be spelled out?  Why are clear policy objectives not made known so that people can decide if the Government are adhering to a programme?The answer is complex.  Perhaps, the chief reason is that the Government, like no other, have been the mental hostage of what I term the mandarins of Merrion Street and Dublin Castle.  The tight grip exercised over Government spending in the last two years has succeeded except in one vital area, public sector pay, where we have a Pandora's box of special pay claims now bursting open.  The Minister admitted on Budget Day that it amounts to £150 million.That is frightening enough but we do not have any clear view how public sector pay is to be controlled.  On other occasions I pointed out that public sector pay in absolute terms has increased each year for the last five years at a rate in excess of the rate of inflation.  That public sector pay bill is being paid by a bankrupt Exchequer.  It is extraordinary that we should be facing into £150 million worth of special claims and that there was no effort made to publicly mobilise opinion <Col N="1953" /> to say that we cannot afford in the foreseeable future to concede claims of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, despite whatever they can achieve in controlling public expenditure, are not, never have been and never will be a power house of radical fiscal reform.  For that one needs a Government, as opposed to the permanent government of the Civil Service, which is driven by a sense of determination, regulated by a sense of direction and fired by an ambition and an appetite for reform, not a mere set of fiscal caretakers, watchmen and checkers who, I think, in many respects the Government resemble.</P>
    <P>Anyone who cares to look at the five Reports of the Commission on Taxation will see a consistent vein of cynical opposition on the part of the State's fiscal establishments in Merrion Street and in Dublin Castle to any radical departure from their tried and tested methods.  The problem is that, though the present tax system has been tried and tested, it has also been found wanting.  The Minister's advisers in Merrion Street and the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; who, in substantial form, draft many of the clauses of these Finance Bills &mdash; prefer to leave the present tax system largely in tact. They always warn against the unpredictable effects of any disruptive change. They are the harbingers of gradualism and creeping reform.  Now they have the Minister coming into this House, I regret to say, announcing that he is pursuing a programme but it is one which must be kept a State secret because it is one he cannot publicise in advance.  In any given year the advisers in Merrion Street and Dublin Castle are happy to close a few loopholes here, simplify a few procedures there, complicate a tax concession here and gratify the Government of the day by experimenting with some tax incentives there, but all the time resisting any changes of substance.  The crucial test for the permanent Government &mdash; as I call them &mdash; is to prevent change unless that change comes from them, is consistent with their underlying aims and does not appear to contradict too blatantly their recent <Col N="1954" /> departmental policy.  Nowhere is that more obvious than in the area of tax reform.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme, with which this Bill is concerned to some considerable extent, is a prime example of the interaction of permanent government with the Government of the day.  Instead of radical tax reform, on which political agreement was impossible for the last Government, when Deputy John Bruton introduced the business expansion scheme, it was decided to give an incentive to certain forms of investment in business.  The scheme, as introduced, was cautious, mean and ineffective I do not say that with any malice towards Deputy John Bruton &mdash; because I think it was well meant &mdash; but it was always destined to fail.  Since then it was widened to the point where it became not only ridiculous but scandalous.  When townhouses in the heart of Donnybrook became, for tax purposes, thatched cottages in high amenity tourism areas the monstrous nature of leaving high tax rates as they were but giving tailormade tax breaks for limited purposes became apparent to everyone; it was nonsense.</P>
    <P>Now we have nonsense on stilts because the Minister proposes that the tourism concession is to be determined by geographical criteria.  For example, Lucan will be out for such absurd tax relief for townhouses but socialist Leixlip will be eligible.  The reason is that the county boundary runs between those two suburbs of Dublin.  The suburbs of Dublin will be divided on an Alice in Wonderland style basis between tax allowable tourist areas which lie within the city and county boroughs, and places which lie outside.  The same applies to Cork and Limerick.  The Corporation bailiwicks in those two cities will be ineligible but Shannon Banks, over the river in Clare &mdash; which is a suburb of Limerick for all purposes &mdash; will be eligible for this kind of scandalous relief to continue in relation to townhouses which are built there.</P>
    <P>I just do not accept that that is a proper way to deal with this issue.  If the Minister <Col N="1955" /> really wanted to narrow down this concession to genuine holiday/tourism facilities in high amenity areas the idea of doing so by reference to Victorian county and city boundaries is so ludicrous as to call into question whether anyone is making a serious effort to control this abuse.  I ask: is there any distinction between Leixlip and Lucan for the purpose of that concession?  Is it not absurd, whatever about its other merits, that Leixlip should be eligible to have townhouses described as holiday villages for the purposes of taxation whereas Lucan cannot?  That just makes nonsense of what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the grotesque use of the business expansion scheme to capitalise leasing operations ought to be curtailed.I welcome the fact that the Minister is curtailing it.  But what is the justification for business expansion schemes in which banks guarantee the performance of an investment?  With such blue chip guarantees does not the business expansion scheme cease to be an incentive to risk-taking and, instead, become an out and out tax hedge?  As the Minister has pointed out, where there was not risk involved, was the business expansion scheme not a tacit admission that, because marginal rates of tax were too high, ways would be found and devised for the wealthy and well-advised to avoid those tax rates?  That is what the business expansion scheme had become. In the last month everyone who even looked half well off, or half comfortable including, somewhat wrongly, myself, was inundated with scheme after scheme, devised on some kind of mailing lists of, I suppose, potential plutocrats and professionals in Dublin who are imagined to have huge sums of money which they could plough into these things, suggesting that by 12 April they should invest in these schemes because the guillotine was going to come down on them.  The idea that I, or anybody else in this House, was to make an investment in a scheme which was designed to promote risktaking and, at the same time, have an associated bank <Col N="1956" /> guarantee my investment just makes nonsense of the whole philosophy of the concession to start with.  I want to say this, that in so far as a number of large financial institutions have offered guarantees of that sort, they are in danger of being found to have strayed into the insurance area.  Some of those investors may well find themselves, in the fullness of time, having their guarantees set aside or invalidated by the courts, with a lot of these schemes also giving the financial institutions recourse to the assets of a company in respect of guaranteed performance in relation to the shares.  On my understanding of the law, that is an unlawful, invalid and worthless guarantee.When the whole matter shakes out there may be a great many disappointed investors.  Some people who think they are getting away with murder may find that they have not, that they have been a victim of a bit of financial mugging.</P>
    <P>But what about the ordinary person weighed down by tax, struggling to survive to make ends meet to pay for food, housing, clothing, education and health? For them there was no orgy of tax breaks, no retinue of clever accountants, or greedy entrepreneurial parvenues with dubious ethics and financial projections offering instant wealth.  No, for Joe Soap, there were no tax reforms, no tax breaks and there still is no mercy.  The contrast between the new clique of tax break tiros, of get-rich-quick, fiscal child magicians, engaged in frenzied exploitation of tax concessions and the average industrial worker, who pays out 65 per cent of every hour's extra pay he can get to the State, for whom every pound of take-home pay costs his employer £3.30, is nauseating to behold.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that Ireland has the highest employment tax wedge of the OECD countries and, as a result, the worst employment situation.  I reiterate that radical tax reform of personal income tax is needed to change that, not business expansion schemes which I call fiscal cocaine for the economic glitterati. We need a fusion of income tax and employee PRSI.  We need a 25 per cent rate over the range of incomes up to <Col N="1957" /> the average industrial wage for a single person and up to £16,000 for a married taxpayer.  We need to introduce tax credits in substitution for tax allowances. Real steps need to be taken to tackle tax evasion involving I think, cards with employment and tax numbers which everyone must use for every transaction. We need to finance local government separately and not out of income tax.  We need a top rate of tax that gives the worker, investor and industrialist a reason to try harder.</P>
    <P>All of these things are possible if there is the political will.  In the most comprehensive tax reform programme ever published by any party in this State, the Progressive Democrats have shown that there is a way.  The way is there but where is the political will?  I suggest that one should not look to Merrion Street, to Dublin Castle or to any other mullahs of the present orthodoxy because they will never deliver radical tax reform.  It is our conviction that we cannot afford to wait for recovery before we tackle tax reform. Radical tax reform is part of the process of recovery, not just its possible reward.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to tax avoidance in this Bill are like the rest of it, drafted by the Revenue Commissioners.  I welcome in principle a statutory scheme whose purpose it is to disregard wholly artificial transactions aimed at reducing tax bills and which have no independent justification or motivation.  I accept that the proposed clauses attempt to achieve this end and to introduce genuine tax efficient means of achieving genuine commercial ends, but the text of the Bill is drafted in a way which does not even attempt to strike a proper balance between the legitimate purpose of anti-avoidance and the equally legitimate purpose of having certainty in laws relating to tax in which taxpayers and those who advise them can act with some degree of certainty as to the law.  I am surprised at that and that it has been done with the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill which deals with tax avoidance needs very close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" /> It would be wrong to get stuck into a line by line analysis at this stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some particular principles which are inextricably bound up with the provisions of this Bill as drafted to which I would draw the Minister's attention now, lest he think that I left the matter too late on Committee Stage.  Tax for the purpose of tax avoidance is extended by Section 76 (1) (a) to cover any interest, penalty or other amount so that a transaction which had no legitimate purpose other than to avoid interest or a penalty can be a tax avoidance measure under this provision.  If the Revenue Commissioners form an opinion that a certain transaction was done not simply to avoid ordinary tax but to avoid a liability to a penalty, they can disregard the transaction involved and bring about a situation whereby somebody who through an artificial procedure had avoided a penalty would become liable to a penalty.  Undoubtedly this provision will be scrutinised by the High Court, because it will end up before the courts. It is a remarkable state of affairs that somebody faced with a penalty cannot within the law adopt a scheme or a transaction to save himself from being penalised.That is a most remarkable provision and it is wrong.  If tested it will be found to be invalid constitutionally.</P>
      <P>More alarming is the whole purpose of intentionality as to the purpose of various tax arrangements and the meaning and purpose of various provisions of statutes. This principle of intentionality, as I call it, is set out in section 76 (3) (a) and (b). This is the saver clause which effectively says that the Revenue Commissioners will not regard a transaction as being a tax avoidance transaction in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary to study section 76 (3) (a) carefully to see exactly what it means.  The Minister's speech reflects its exact meaning in terms which &mdash; although I hesitate to say are dishonest &mdash; would <Col N="1959" /> give one a false sense of security about the extent of this safeguard.  The Revenue Commissioners under that subsection are required not to regard a transaction as a tax avoidance transaction if they are satisfied that it was undertaken or arranged by a person with a view directly or indirectly to the realisation of profits in the course of the business activities of a business carried on by the person.  This relates to business but not to an ordinary person in relation to his own affairs.  That is of very great significance because it means that an ordinary person who goes through some kind of an arrangement, say a family rearrangement of assets which is not related to business, cannot avail of that section.  That clause is combined to transactions which are not undertaken or arranged primarily to give rise to a tax advantages, but section 76 (3) (a) relates only to business.</P>
    <P>The ordinary citizen uninvolved in business has no safeguard at all under paragraph (a) but is included under paragraph (b) which is even worse, because paragraph (b) would oblige the Revenue Commissioners not to regard the transaction as a tax avoidance transaction if it was undertaken or arranged for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of any relief or allowance or other abatement provided by any provisions of the Tax Acts, and that the transaction would not result directly or indirectly in a misuse of or an abuse of the provision, having regard to the purposes for which it was provided.  That is the first case I have ever seen of the Revenue Commissioners being allowed to take a look at the whole corpus of tax law and form opinions as to what this House intended when it introduced a particular concession.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are entitled to categorise certain activities as an abuse or a misuse of a tax break created by this House.  We are now proposing to give to the Revenue Commissioners the role of interpreter of statute.  They are to look at the Tax Acts, and perhaps there is something to be said for that because they draft all the Acts, <Col N="1960" /> but the constitutional fiction at the very least, is that we are supposed to form the opinions and have the intention.  This Bill, for the first time, gives the Revenue Commissioners the right in relation to any tax provision to look to what they consider to be its purpose and to regard any use of it for a thing that they do not consider to be its purpose, to be an abuse or a misuse.  That is an unconstitutional delegation by this Oireachtas of the power of interpreting its statutes not to the courts but to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are now obliged to serve notices in relation to transactions they see to be tax avoidance transactions unless they in their judgment having formed a subjective view about the purpose of a given tax break given ten, 20 or 50 years ago, decide that it is not an abuse or misuse of that tax break. They have an awful cheek to seek that power.  For the Revenue Commissioners to draft a clause and put it before this House via the Minister, which in fact gives them the right to look through the statutes and make subjective decisions about the purpose and intent of the law of the land and to disallow people tax breaks on that account, is a piece of the greatest legislative arrogance.  They are taking to themselves the role of legislature and judiciary together.  They are now claiming the right to look at laws and say what their purpose is, to say what amounts to an abuse or misuse of the law and to determine what they will do accordingly.  That whole notion is wrong in principle.  It does not necessarily follow that it is unconstitutional although it may well be, but it is wrong in principle to make a series of laws which determine people's tax liabilities by reference to the views of other interested parties as to what the intention of this House was in any given case.  That is bad drafting and very ropey from the point of view of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I note the involvement of the Attorney General in this, but it has been clear from the phraseology of the entire section 76 that the one thing that has been avoided <Col N="1961" /> throughout is the use of the word &ldquo;determination&rdquo;.The Revenue Commissioners do not determine that something is a tax avoidance scheme; they form an opinion. The grotesque fiction that that really represents shows through at the top of page 74 of the Bill in subsection 5 (e), where we are told that for the purposes of this subsection an opinion of the Revenue Commissioners that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction shall be final and conclusive in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Opinions never become final and conclusive.That is nonsense, a perversion of ordinary English.  The only sense in which something becomes final and conclusive is that it is a determination which affects the rights of others.  If this use of the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;, presumably on the advice of the Attorney General's Office &mdash; that one should never mention a determination by the Revenue Commissioners because that would involve an administration of justice and an invasion of the monopoly of the Judiciary &mdash; is designed here to mask a process which, in fact, is a determination process, then you are again into big difficulties with the legality of this provision.  Anybody who uses the phrase that &ldquo;the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners shall be final and conclusive&rdquo; actually is using code and somewhat disingenuous and obvious code for the proposition that a determination has been made which will become final and conclusive.There is a huge vulnerability to any proposal which will try to mask a determination as a mere opinion which has been notified to the other side.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some considerable mileage of the rights of the courts in this matter to supervise the whole process.  On the face of the Bill there is not a process of determination by the Revenue Commissioners with the right of appeal.  There is right of appeal from an opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, which is remarkable in itself. Normally one does not have to appeal from an opinion, one can only appeal from a determination.  The safeguards suggested by the Minister to be available for an appellant are very considerably <Col N="1962" /> less generous than have been suggested to this House by him.</P>
    <P>The fundamental ground for upsetting the notice served containing this opinion &mdash; which I say is a determination &mdash; is that there were insufficient or no grounds on which the Revenue Commissioners could or would reasonably have formed the opinion that the transaction specified or described in the notice of opinion was a tax avoidance transaction.  You are left with the situation that the taxpayer takes on the onus before the appeal commissioner or the Circuit Court, not of saying to that tribunal, whichever it is, &ldquo;Here is what I did and here is what they say I did.  I ask you to accept my view of the situation as more reasonable than theirs and that on the balance of probabilities I am more correct in my submission that it is not a tax avoidance transaction than they are when they submit to the contrary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The taxpayer here must go one stage further as this section is drafted at the moment and say that if there were two conclusions, both reasonable, both even equally reasonable, one to the effect that it was a tax avoidance transaction and one that it was not, in those circumstances the appellate body, be it the appeal commissioner or the Circuit Court, is still not entitled to reverse the Revenue Commissioners' opinion, such as that is.  They must form the view not simply that they would prefer the appellant's account of the transaction on balance but that there were no reasonable grounds, effectively, for the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at their estimate of the transaction.</P>
    <P>That switches the onus of proof on to the taxpayer and leaves him in the potential position that he can go to an appellate tribunal and even have its sympathy in that if it were the Revenue Commissioners it would not have arrived at that opinion but, nonetheless, it would be taken as a reasonable view of the situation and the tribunal would not interfere with it.  That is not simply reversing the onus of proof, which might be reasonable in this circumstance, but making the position of the taxpayer virtually impossible.  It is equivalent, in a criminal <Col N="1963" /> case, to saying that the defendant is not there to prove his innocence to a jury but to prove that the guard did not have the right to arrest him on day one, that in forming his opinion as to whether an offence had been committed he acted unreasonably.  That is pushing the boat much too far.  If, coming into this drafting of the legislation, there were some balanced view from the other side not to push the thing over the edge or make it into a unacceptably draconian piece of legislation, then the right of appeal against the determination of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; which I think it should be admitted to be &mdash; would not be confined to this very narrow ground.</P>
    <P>I contrast the language used in this right of appeal with that used in another tax avoidance clause of this Bill, section 78, where, at the foot of page 79 at lines 50 to 53 a different onus of proof, is put on the appeallant because it provides:</P>
    <P>This section shall not apply as respects a disposal of shares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is a particular form of tax avoidance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>where it is shown to the satisfaction of the inspector or, on the hearing, or rehearing, of an appeal, to the satisfaction of the Appeal Commissioners, or the judge of the Circuit Court, as the case may be, that the disposal was made for bona fide commercial reasons and not as part of a scheme or arrangement the purpose, or one of the purposes, of which was the avoidance of tax.</P>
    <P>There is a different system in that section, obviously drafted by a different hand or by the same person in a very different humour, a slightly more liberal humour. You can tell the appellate court that you want to satisfy it that on balance you are right and that you are not taking on the onus of proving that the Revenue Commissioners acted unreasonably but are saying that, bearing in mind all the facts, you are right.  That is a simpler onus for the taxpayer to discharge.  I suggest that <Col N="1964" /> section 76, which is an omnibus anti-avoidance provision, could be substantially rewritten.  It could be rewritten with a view to making it fairer, clearer and less subjective.  On all those grounds at the moment, in its efforts to be comprehensive and all-embracing, it is effectively giving the Revenue Commissioners a power which we as a Legislature should never delegate to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked the Minister about the retrospectivity of this legislation.He kindly said that he thought that I would have some views on the matter.  I have never personally taken the view that it is outside the scope of the Legislature to enact retrospective tax legislation.  Perhaps it is outside the scope of the Legislature to impose penalties or to declare things retrospectively to be offences under the Constitution but I do not think it is outside our power to say in respect of a transaction that has long past that now, in 1989, it shall attract a particular rate of taxation.</P>
    <P>Subject to reasonableness, I never thought that was a major problem, but the retrospection conferred on this section by section 13 (b) is, in my view, very dubious.  It effectively means that this anti-avoidance section shall apply to any transaction undertaken before 25 January 1989 where certain tax consequences would flow from that transaction after that date.  That is all very well if you put a limit on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to transactions in the twenties, thirties, forties or fifties are we saying that if the Revenue Commissioners, think back on what the Earl of Iveagh did with his Guinness shares in the thirties &mdash; which was the subject of litigation in the courts in those days &mdash; or if that transaction had not been entered into by him, we would now have a very different tax situation?  There must be some limit.  This does not apply only to people who availed of the McGrath decision in the Supreme Court in the summer of 1988; it applies to people who engaged in transactions which had nothing to do with the McGrath case in 1976, 1978, 1983, 1985 or any time.  It is not confined to the McGrath case and, in <Col N="1965" /> my view, it is wrong to see it as closing a particular loophole.  It is of general application.</P>
    <P>There are many cases where the Revenue Commissioners in the fullness of time will see a transaction which took place five years ago characterisable as a tax avoidance transaction in that certain consequences still flow from it.  Transactions which are water under the bridge as far as the taxpayers are concerned will be investigated retrospectively on a selective basis by the taxman.  I do not think it is right to confer such a wide power on him.</P>
    <P>In section 76 the Revenue Commissioners are given a procedural leg up over the taxpayer, which I think is totally unconscionable.  The taxpayer cannot widen the scope of the appeal, apart from the four statutory grounds of appeal given to him.  The Revenue Commissioners, on the other hand, may at any time amend, withdraw or change any matters in one of these notices that has these effects.  In effect, the Revenue Commissioners can keep moving the goalposts and changing even their own opinions and the consequences which flow from them.  I believe section 76 (10) is grossly unfair.  The ordinary taxpayer is confined to certain grounds of appeal and he cannot widen the scope of the appeal but the Revenue Commissioners, having looked at the notices they have served, can at any time in any way vary it as suits them.  Of course, there is a proviso at the end of subsection (10) where something has become final and conclusive by way of a determination by a tribunal that they cannot reverse that.  However, subject to that, the Revenue Commissioners can keep shifting the goalpost and keep changing their opinion at any time whereas the taxpayer is nailed by his feet to the floor when he goes before the appellate tribunal to appeal under one of the four statutory grounds of appeal.</P>
    <P>I believe a far better job could be done. The idea of intentionality, which gives the Revenue Commissioners the function of deciding what was the purpose of any tax break and then determining whether a transaction is an abuse or misuse of <Col N="1966" /> it, is unnecessary, unconstitutional and grossly unfair.  The same purpose could be achieved by more simple legislation.  I want to reiterate, in case I am misunderstood, that I welcome in principle the purpose of section 76, but in taking on board Canadian and other precedents, I think the Revenue Commissioners have been over-ambitious and have effectively tried to give themselves the power of provisional legislators and judicial powers to interpret legislation.  The limited right of appeal conferred on the taxpayer, with limited statutory grounds of appeal and the onus of proof cast on him, is unnecessary and endangers the viability of this section as far as the Constitution and judicial acceptance is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think the Revenue Commissioners have gone too far.  They have been too greedy and they have disregarded what should have been a balanced approach by a Legislature dealing with tax avoidance.If this section were enacted in its present form, they will have left a great deal of uncertainity in terms of what the tax law at any given time means, what can be upset and what transactions can be set aside that the subjectivity is not a matter for a judge, which would be bad enough but is a matter for one of the players in the contest, the Revenue Commissioners.That is the unnecessary draconian aspect of this provision.</P>
    <P>I will confine my remarks on the other reforms in the Bill to Committee Stage. However, I do not accept the proposition generously stated by Deputy Noonan that all the excise increases were in line with the rate of inflation.  They do not look like increases of 3 per cent to me; most of them are multiples of 50 per cent and 100 per cent, and some of them need explanation.  In relation to intoxicating liquor and its sale the increases seem to be aimed at letting the publican off but they hit every other form of alcohol consumption, no matter where it occurs. Special extensions at clubs were hit but the publicans seem to be getting the easiest run from the increases in excise duty.</P>
    <P>I would like to call the Minister's attention to the remarks he made on radio and television to the effect that he cannot <Col N="1967" /> undo the 6p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol because of a High Court decision which curtails his power in these matters.  This is the first time a Minister has accepted so quickly a High Court decision which apparently went against the Government, and which I thought might be appealed.  It seems that the Minister is not bound by this 6p increase because this Bill is the occasion on which this has to be copperfastened and made into law.  If the Minister does not move a particular provision in the Bill, it will lapse and will not have effect as the law stands under the 1927 Act.  Although I heard the Minister say these things on the radio, I did not quite believe him.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister now pretends to have a phased programme for tax reform, I ask him to get up on his hind legs in some assembly, be it here, somewhere else or at a press conference and tell us what lies in store for us under the phased programme of tax reform, to fix himself targets, to tell us where he sees the basic rate of income tax in three years time, how he sees it comparing with rates in Europe, and where he sees tax allowances, the process of widening the tax base mortgage relief and a number of other things ending up.  If he were to state this, curiously, I do not think it would be to my political advantage but it would copperfasten the sense of confidence the Minister has referred to.  If people could see that the Government had a target for tax reform &mdash; even stated as loosely as the British Tory Party did when they said they intend to bring down the basic rate of income tax &mdash; then I believe we would have a much greater sense of confidence in the future.  People who are now preparing to emigrate &mdash; and they speak of it constantly on the radio &mdash; because of the crippling rate of taxation might reconsider if this Government aimed to have our tax rate roughly the same as that in England and think it worthwhile to stay in this country.  The Minister would create a sense of hope if he would spell out his phased programme of tax reform.  The present system of simply making nibbling <Col N="1968" /> changes here and there is not an adequate substitute.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of the Bill require closer scrutiny.  I will put down amendments, not for the purpose of just making noises or simply to give me an excuse to exercise my right to speak.  I would particularly appreciate if the Minister, in relation to local authority tenants on fixed mortgage rates &mdash; of whom there are many and for whom the reduction in mortgage rates has given no relief whatsoever because they are tied to fixed interest mortgages &mdash; would provide some relief for them as it would be a just change in the mortgage interest relief position.  This could be easily done by providing for a certain class of mortgages, to be determined by regulation of the Minister, and that the 80 per cent rate would not come into effect.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to cite reduced mortgage interest rates as the reason for reducing the mortgage relief from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of qualifying interest, but people on a fixed interest rate must regard such a justification for cutting back on their tax break &mdash; which is quite small at the moment &mdash; in a somewhat jaundiced light.  I ask the Minister to at least examine the possibility of giving them some relief instead of doing what Deputy Noonan suggested, providing some kind of inbuilt accelerator clause when interest rates go up.  Justice could be achieved by doing the former.</P>
    <P>I look forward to participating on Committee Stage.  The Progressive Democrats will not oppose Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest last Sunday to the Minister for Finance giving the general economic background to the Finance Bill.  He stated in the RTE interview that the cornerstone &mdash; to use his own phrase &mdash; of the Government's economic policy was the control of inflation and a dependency on low interest rates.  I see considerable merit in a strategy of that nature, but it is indeed a strategy with a high risk content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister said that imports of consumer goods are also strong in <Col N="1969" /> relation to a recovery in private consumption, I thought of the degree of imported inflation which this country suffered in 1984, 1985 and in part of 1986. When one recalls, as the Minister rightly stated last Sunday, that UK interest rates have risen no less than 11 times in the past 12 months there are ominous portents for us in that regard.  This matter should be urgently addressed by Opposition spokespersons as well as the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a need to control inflationary trends at domestic level and I am not at all certain that there is a grip and a sense of sectoral urgency in relation to this matter in the handling of the economy. For example, I would have thought that the spiralling of private house prices in certain areas of the greater Dublin market would by now have been given a vicious kick in the groin by the Minister for Finance because they have an impact on the creation of inflationary expectations and an inflationary climate.  The subject has not been addressed in the Bill and there is a great need for the Minister to get to grips with that situation.</P>
    <P>It might well be intensely unpopular among certain sectors as we are now subsidising the private sector by about £155 million per year in mortgage interest relief.  However, it might temper some of those who are contemplating taking out mortgages of £70,000 and £80,000, merrily trading up and driving up inflationary pressures in the market.  These pressures could spread through the market and become a very serious impediment to our endeavours to retain a low level of inflation in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said last Sunday that the price of drink had had an effect on inflationary trends.  In the first quarter of 1989 it had an effect of 0.3 per cent on the consumer price index.  Again there is a strong case to be made for a rigorous and tough attitude in relation to the price of drink because tourists are generally shocked by the price they pay for alcoholic drink &mdash; and even more shocked by the price of non-alcoholic drink &mdash; in this country.  The Government should exert greater control in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> If we continue the rate of growth of imports of consumer goods we will, in the next 12 months, have a substantial input of imported inflation in our economy.The recent sham war between the Minister, Deputy Burke, and the oil companies is a classic example of the extent to which inflation can be imported as we face a very substantial increase in the price of petroleum products.  There is a need for the Government to address themselves urgently to the inflationary drive in the economy.  I very much doubt if there has been Government or internal Cabinet discussion on the matter except in regard to the question of public service pay to which I will refer in a moment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance are worried and when they get worried their classic, Pavlovian response is to embark on another cutting exercise.  I wish the Minister well on his first budget to this Dáil but I am afraid he may fall into the trap of spending from April to October driving himself quietly round the bend as memorandum after memorandum is flashed before him from the public expenditure division of the Department of Finance while they go on another campaign of cuts.  When that campaign is over they will start the next campaign of cuts.  In his speech the Minister said that the Government are already considering how best to achieve necessary further savings in expenditure in 1990 so as to make room for new investment within an overall improving budgetary trend.  He went on to say that the increases in social welfare and personal taxation will add £160 million to the opening position for next year. That has an all too familiar smell about it.</P>
    <P>We have to point out that the extent to which such major reductions in the current account can take place is extremely limited and was extremely limited in the budgets of 1988 and 1989.  The rather raudous condemnation the Minister received from the chairman of the Southern Health Board, which I presume we all listened to with great interest, is an indication that the Fianna Fáil Party at local level are not immune from the effects of the cuts in the health service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> There is virtually no room for manoeuvre left in any of the major segments of public expenditure, be it in health or education. For example, we are going to witness the termination of the school transport scheme because of the deliberate underfunding of that scheme to the tune of £7 million this year.  Certainly by the end of June the word will be out in no uncertain terms.  I do not see any leeway for the Minister to go down the road of a further cutting exercise to the tune of £100 million or £150 million in 1989.  It is a move we shall certainly oppose.  In relation to public service numbers and the staffing of essential social services, there is no leeway left unless the Minister suddenly announces that he is going to provide another £100 million to pay for another round of public service voluntary redundancies, repeating the exercise of 1987 and 1988.  It is highly unlikely he will do so.  Indeed, it would be highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the fresh statement the Minister has made in relation to the public service pay bill.  In this year's budget the Minister provided £30 million to cover special pay increases.  I pointed out at that time that this was an under provision, on my estimation, of around £29.5 million.  I made this estimation taking into account the amount to fall due for payment under the current pay agreement under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It now transpires that my foreboding at that time was quite correct.  The Minister provided £70 million to cover the general increase under the public service pay agreement, £12.5 million for the Defence Forces, £28 million to cover the payment of increments &mdash; I accept that that is the normal value of increment these days &mdash; and £15 million to cover the payment of increases carried over from the 1986 pay agreement.In addition to these substantial amounts the Minister said he was providing £30 million to cover special pay increases.</P>
    <P>Inflation is now running at a rate of between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent.  It is likely to hit 3.5 per cent by mid year.  The <Col N="1972" /> Minister estimated in the budget that the rate would be 2.75 per cent.  In that context I am very taken aback that the Minister is now in effect saying to public servants that the already deferred payments under the public service pay agreement of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are going to be rolled over into 1991.  I understand that that proposal is that certain grades will receive their payments and that those on the higher levels will have their increases deferred and rolled over into 1991.  Bearing in mind that the special increases were clearly outlined in a very specific section in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I would be taken aback if there were to be another approach to the public service unions for a further deferment.  I think this issue should have been faced up to in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government made some strange decisions at that time, largely because the new Minister, Deputy Reynolds, in fairness, had very little time to work himself into this new portfolio.  For this reason the figure of £30 million was just knocked off and there was a very deliberate under provision to cover special pay increases to fall due for payment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Given that the Government have been bragging, to say the least, about the extraordinary buoyancy in budget revenue over the first quarter of 1989, I am opposed to their turning round to the public servants and saying that the special pay increases to some grades which they were assured they would receive as and from July 1989 would be deferred until 1991 and they can like it or lump it.  I do not think that this is acceptable.  Between embargoes and deferments in promotions the public service has just about taken enough and if this strategy is enforced by the Government it will only result in demoralisation within the service.  Unless remuneration, particularly from middle management upwards, within the public service is maintained at reasonable levels &mdash; there are no fancy salaries as we well know within the public service &mdash; we will see a decline in morale and a reluctance to take difficult decisions as well as a <Col N="1973" /> decline in the quality and content of the public service.  Therefore I wish to express my serious concern at the Minister's statement made here today in relation to public service pay.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the main income tax provisions of the Bill.  Like Deputy McDowell, I also criticised the lack of reform.  My colleague of the other Opposition party, Deputy Noonan, has been equally critical.  I do not know how in God's name we are going to bring about a fundamental, radical reform of the taxation system, because we are now, after three budgets of this minority Government &mdash; in a sense that has not been a bad thing because they have been periodically hit over the head and obliged to behave themselves in terms of their approach to budget matters &mdash; finishing with another troika of income tax rates. We still have our 32 per cent standard rate; we still have a 48 per cent rate and we have a 56 per cent rate.  I would have thought that by now the imperative need for simplification of our taxation system would be evident.  Why not have two rates at maximum?  What is wrong with two rates of income tax?  This would provide enormous public understanding of what taxation is about.  It would avoid public representatives being driven quietly out of their minds as they endeavour to explain to their constituents that the standard rate is 32 per cent up to X income, which is variable, per annum, that the next rate is 48 per cent variable on an annual 5 April basis, and that we have a new rate of 56 per cent, again variable.  There is a great need for that system to be changed.</P>
    <P>We look back at the Commission on Taxation reports as almost historical, archival documents at this stage, back into the seventies.  There is a great need to introduce the simplified tax credit system into our system of income taxation.Then there is the imperative need to bring in a system of property taxation. After three budgets in this Dáil the Government are caught up in frozen immobility in terms of taxation reform. Despite the voluminous documentation <Col N="1974" /> available within the Department of Finance and equally substantial documentation available from the Department of the Environment, there is a determined reluctance on the part of the Government to grasp that nettle, a total reluctance, so much so that I think the only time the Cabinet got excited was when a few members of the Cabinet discovered they had property in excess of £68,000 value and then thought they might have a liability themselves and they worked themselves into a quiet frenzy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Government are going to show any seriousness about taxation reform they must spend some time at it and come up with coherent proposals and not get bogged down in the farce &mdash; it was a farce &mdash; of a proposal which came up on child benefit, with some Ministers saying, &ldquo;We will get those over £35,000 a year&rdquo; and then we are not sure whether that was family income or individual income and another Minister said that never happened, we never talked about that and then the Taoiseach turned around and said, &ldquo;My God, what are they all up to now?  Sure, we are not going to do it at all&rdquo;.  In the end it brings political tax reform into disrepute.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister and the Government to bring forward real and measurable changes in the overall situation.</P>
      <P>I come to an equally serious matter which I hope will not deteriorate into the same shambles as other taxation measures, namely VAT harmonisation on the indirect taxation proposals side.  I am glad the Minister confirmed yesterday at Luxembourg that the earlier set of proposals put forward by the Commission will be revised.  As he knows well, the general report put before the European Parliament no longer favours a bludgeoning, exclusive, all embracing abolition of the zero VAT rate.  Commissioner Schrivener, to whom I listened last week, is, I gather, bringing forward some revised excise proposals with the Commission. These are of great importance.  We should take the question of VAT harmonisation at domestic level and we should take it out of the political lobster pot, boiling pot or whatever mess it tends to get into on an inter-party basis.  I am sure my colleagues Deputy Noonan and Deputy McDowell will agree with me when I suggest there is a need for a consensus.This is the only time in the lifetime of this Dáil that I have used the word, a very dangerous word as we all know, but there is need at domestic level for a serious consensus on an all-party basis on the harmonisation of our indirect taxation system within the Republic.  I do not think it is going to happen if the Minister comes in here in budget 1990, throws in a few fliers and talks about a loss of 552 billion ECUS if we adopt the old proposals of the Commission but saying that now we are going to adopt the new, revised proposals of the Commission the net Exchequer loss will be about 320 billion ECUS and that he is making proposals X, Y or Z and we all troop in one direction or another on budget night.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is a coincidence that we were talking about the economic plan last week, the Finance Bill today and now we are back to the same theme again.  There are hardly variations on the theme at this stage.  It is difficult to think of anything new to say when one has been over the ground so often.</P>
      <P>First we should state the principle which underlines this initiative by Deputy John Bruton and the Fine Gael Party in advocating an economic accord for 1990 and then seeking to legislate in the areas of that accord which would require changes in the law.  We are of the view that there are certain fundamental flaws in our economy which prevent economic development and growth.  An gad a bhí níos gaire don scórnach was the burden of the national debt.  We realised after our period in Government that to establish the kind of consensus not only in this House but among the key players in the economy whom the Government describe as the social partners and also to get a consensus among the electorate at large we required a bi-partisan approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> We do not believe that the Government could have proceeded with such a series of expenditure cutbacks to bring us in sight of stabilising the GNP-debt ratio without that consensus in this House. That consensus went out to the wider community and the supporters of the parties who were in general agreement here found that they did not line up with individual pressure groups who were trying to put the Government's policy off the rails. We have had a number of examples of this over the past two or three years. There is certainly still a problem with the national debt since it is growing all the time, but as a percentage of GNP it has been substantially reduced.  Consequently the crisis element has disappeared and the debt remains the problem which continues to exist.  That was a success in terms of people agreeing that there were general principles on which they could work together, even though they were divided about other matters in this House.</P>
    <P>We have sought to extend that thinking to other areas of the economy.  We tried it in the reform of taxation.  I argued on the last Finance Bill and the one before that reform of personal taxation was absolutely vital, but I also said quite openly that it would be very difficult to reform personal taxation.  Clearly the resources necessary to establish very low rates of income tax are not there and will not be there for some time.  What is involved in the reform of taxation is a reallocation of resources and in any such reallocation, with a different spread of the burden of taxation, there will be winners and losers.  The experience in other countries was that if the reform of taxation was approached incrementally it did not work because the winners identified their winnings much later than the losers identified their losses.  Frequently many people paying income tax won a little bit.  They gained in a small way and did not become over-excited about it, but those who lost a particular tax avoidance scheme or taxation perk they had enjoyed felt the pain rather dramatically.  They organised themselves very quickly into effective lobby groups and stopped the <Col N="1979" /> Government who tried to move incrementally on the reform of taxation.  I and my party are of the view that if we are to reform taxation we should do it by presenting a package which would clearly identify the losers and the winners and we would try to establish a consensus in this House in judging the most effective personal income tax system to encourage growth and development.  We put this forward as a proposal and the Government have decided not to go along that road.</P>
    <P>The Government could share some of the views we have on economic development. No matter what countries we compare ourselves with, it is quite clear that the Irish economy has performed very inadequately in this and the last generation. In terms of a league table of developed economies we have slipped back.  Our rates of growth have only been about half that of the average for the EC over the past generation.  Why is that so? Why can we not perform as the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians and the Germans perform?  Why should we always be the sick man of Europe?  Is it some fault in ourselves or some fault in the way we arrange matters?  Clearly it is a fault in the way we arrange matters.</P>
    <P>Various people have analysed the difficulties in the Irish economy.  The best analysis in recent times is in chapter 1 of the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  It is an economic and social analysis which effectively lists the problems in trying to make this economy grow.  It does so very well. It may be moving from a wrong motivation. Somebody may have decided that the way to get the maximum Structural Funds from Europe was to present the blackest picture possible and to point out in great detail the inadequacies of the Irish economy so that if the case was made as black as possible we would attract the maximum amount of Structural Funds.  Whether or not that was the motivation, we still have in chapter 1 of the plan a serious analysis of the problems of the economy and the factors which are preventing growth, both at the macro-economic and sectoral levels.  That should <Col N="1980" /> be taken very seriously.  The plan does not subsequently move to eliminate those weaknesses.  It sets out a series of infrastructural projects, all of which are worthy in themselves, but the sum of all of them does not constitute a plan.</P>
    <P>What we and Deputy John Bruton had in mind was a very simple idea.  If we could identify and agree that there are certain structural and sectoral weaknesses in the economy there would not be that much difference on either side of the House.  An analysis such as we have in chapter 1 of the national plan would point out those weaknesses quite clearly. We might be able to pick out a number of them as priorities and seek to get a lasting agreement, regardless of which party were in Government, so that there would be continuity of policy.  We would also seek a wider consensus among the trade union movement, employers' organisations and the farming groups so that certain key principles and strategies would remain the same and there would be a continuing policy into the nineties towards removing those factors which inhibit growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote two examples. The first is the whole problem of being on the periphery of Europe.  We are the ultimate peripheral country out in the Atlantic.  With the Channel tunnel now being constructed we will shortly be the only island on the western approaches to Europe.  The plan says that because of our peripheral location transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe are between 9 and 10 per cent of export sales values, approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.  This cost penalty applies to the great bulk of Ireland's international trade, exports, imports, materials and capital goods.  I do not think there is a Deputy in this House or a citizen in this country who, if he understood the economic arguments, would disagree with that.  The fact that we are on the edge of Europe and have to transport our goods to the marketplace is a serious problem which is preventing this economy from growing.  The home market is only 3.5 million people, and it <Col N="1981" /> is self evident that we cannot organise enough economic activity internally to gainfully employ all our citizens.  We have to export to live; it is only as a trading nation that we can survive.  It is clear what the problems of transport are.  We are suggesting that we should agree a programme and stick to it, right across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>The list of infrastructural projects, particularly the 1,500 or 1,600 miles of national primary routes which are going to attract the resources of the Structural Funds, are all desirable objectives.  Of course we need main roads running to the ports and improvements in our main roads structure.  We need more than that because there are other cost factors.  We also need an immediate movement to reduce the cost of excise on articulated vehicles because that is one of the major impositions which makes transport here so expensive.  Second, we should reduce excise on auto diesel.  I know that there are not vast sums of money lying around in the Government coffers to make dramatic reductions in the price of petrol simply by removing excise duties.  That would be unrealistic; but we can move selectively beginning with auto diesel, so that some of the disadvantages which are suffered by Irish exporters are reduced simply by reducing the cost of transport.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how we arrange transport to the continent of Europe. There is a very strong case to be made for having a central location somewhere in the hinterland of the channel ports on which Irish truckers can converge and avail of a whole range of activities which are organised so that the various economies of scale which would result from such an enterprise could accrue to the benefit of the Irish State.  If we cannot take our goods to the marketplace and sell them as competitively as those who produce them at the centre of the marketplace, we have a problem.  That aspect of economic development alone is something that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>We have sought the consensus necessary to do things like that.  Simply building the roads in Ireland, improving them and putting in dual carriageways, running <Col N="1982" /> a motorway from Belfast through Dublin to Rosslare, will help; but it will not solve the problem.  We are at risk now from competition from abroad, particularly from the United Kingdom.  Carriers with lorries travelling from Europe down the motorways of the UK, coming to the ports of England, coming into Ireland and linking up with a further good network of roads will be in a position to wipe out many of the people here who trade on the home market.  Competition works in both directions.  If our network of roads becomes very effective for distributing foreign goods around the country and we leave our truckers and our exporters with all the disadvantages of the high cost of fuel and the high cost of excise duties on articulated trucks, not only will we not achieve the desired objective of exporting more to the UK and mainland Europe but we will find that the home market is taken from under our feet as well.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about small sums of money.  It costs 40 per cent more now to shift a metric tonne here than it does in the UK and that kind of competitive disadvantage can only result in UK traders taking a larger slice of our market if we improve our roads.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am merely developing some ideas that I proposed previously.  I do not wish to unduly take up the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area that is worth looking at is tourism.  It is not possible for tourism to thrive if the cost of those consumer goods which people enjoy when on holiday is seriously out of line with prevailing costs elsewhere in Europe.  If the price of drink, for example, is significantly beyond that which pertains in the UK, is several hundred per cent beyond what the holidaymaker in Spain could purchase it at, then those who like to drink when on holiday will not have Ireland at the top of their list; those who like to tour a country will not have Ireland at the top of their list if petrol costs are significantly <Col N="1983" /> higher; nor are those who like a bottle of wine at night going to put Ireland at the top of their list if there is a mark up of 1,000 per cent or 1,200 per cent on the bottle of wine in the supermarkets.  It is a very simple idea to put, but doing anything about it depends on making some move towards the harmonisation of excise duties across the Community.  I do not know what the Government's intentions are in this respect.  We will have to harmonise.  I suggest that we begin now, independent of the demands of Europe, by making decisions that will help our economic growth and help particular sectors.Again I appreciate we do not have massive resources.  If we were to harmonise immediately it would lead to serious loss of revenue, but in these areas, for the benefit of certain industries like tourism, we should start making little moves to improve our competitiveness. Then we will be positioned for economic growth in 1992.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to do this Bill justice in a very short period but I would like to commend it to the House.  There is really only one problem that has to be addressed in terms of economic growth here, that is how we can produce more and sell more competitively.  We should start by removing those obstacles which prevent us from doing that.  When we think about that simple proposition I think we will find there is a large measure of agreement right through the House about how we should move.  We should eliminate as far as possible the divisions in this Parliament which inhibit economic growth because when growth is prevented jobs are not only created but others are lost.</P>
    <P>I am seriously worried that we are now organising a country where we will have stabilised the situation for three-quarters of our population, but will have written off the other quarter.  Anyone in a job at the moment is reasonably well off, but the number on the live register is 240,000, and 100,000 persons have emigrated in the last three years.  The micro economics of how to run a company which is a loss <Col N="1984" /> maker, making people redundant, cutting down on overheads and making it a good company for a smaller number of workers, can be applied to a country. We are on the way to doing that at the moment and we should stop to think about it.  Certainly the situation has improved for about three-quarters of the people, but we are treating our unemployed and our emigrants as surplus to need.  An expansion of the consensus which has served us well in dealing with the debt problem into some of the area suggested by Deputy John Bruton would be desirable and would be a major benefit in solving some of our economic problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to what Deputy Noonan has had to say in building upon, as he said, the arguments or dispositions which had already gone on in the various other submissions which have been made in the Finance Bill here this afternoon and building upon, as he saw it, the need for a political consensus which, of course, is the permeation of much of what is in this Bill and of what is happening in the country at large.  I would find very little to quarrel with in what Deputy John Bruton has put forward in his Bill or indeed in some of the thoughts which were expressed here tonight by Deputy Michael Noonan.  Per force I speak from a script because that is what is required but it would be interesting to carry on the to and fro in the atmosphere which has been conveyed by Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern and interest that Deputy Bruton has expressed in the development of the Single European market.  It is important that we as a nation are aware of the challenges and opportunities that will be ours on the total integration of the European market.  It is of vital importance that our young people are adequately prepared to grasp the opportunities open to them in the context of the single market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be addressing in particular the sections of the Bill which have a bearing <Col N="1985" /> on my own Department and the education implications of that.  I presume other speakers will also devote themselves to their own particular areas of activity.  In the areas of education I would be in agreement with much that was done by the previous administration.  It appears that much of what we are doing would be also in agreement with the broad spectrum so there is not much cause for argument between us on the matter.</P>
    <P>To ensure that educational and training programmes are relevant to current needs and requirements I have instituted dynamic processes of curriculum reform and development, following on what was undertaken by a previous Minister, at primary and post-primary levels and ongoing reviews of educational and training provisions in post compulsory and higher education sectors.  These initiatives are necessary as, due to the accelerating rate of change in our society resulting from advances in science and technology, the requirements of the labour market are changing rapidly.</P>
    <P>The Irish education system has a long tradition serving this country well. Indeed many foreign companies invest in this country because of the high educational standards and high calibre of our young people.  That is not just a pious aspiration.  Frequently one reads that.</P>
    <P>To ensure that our school leavers have the requisite competencies and basic skills it is necessary that school-industry and higher education-industry links are developed and strengthened.  Both industry and education must plan mechanisms to reduce the isolation of their respective worlds in order to improve the quality of education programmes and to eliminate any deficiences.  Links between education and industry can provide the necessary motivation and encouragement for young people to improve their school performance, to develop a greater sense of civic responsibility and to become members of a flexible and adaptable workforce.  From such a process the economy as well as the young people themselves will benefit.</P>
    <P>I have always been greatly struck since <Col N="1986" /> I came into education by the need for it not to be seen as a sort of enclave on its own with great high walls around it and indeed previous Ministers, Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, and also Deputy Noonan, have seen to that.  The mechanisms set up to enable industry and education to interlink now must be strengthened and used much more frequently and much more productively so that young people, those who teach them and people working in and guiding industry will see that there is much to be gained from scrutiny of each other's departments' activities and how they can interlink and interface with one another to give of their best to each.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to some of the details of the Bill relating to educational matters and proposed amendments to the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971. I will deal with both of those, as they come under my jurisdiction, at the moment anyway.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad of the opportunity to speak on Deputy Bruton's proposal and amend the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The proposal at section 1 (1) (a) to extend the definition of &ldquo;technical education&rdquo; to include &ldquo;contract work relating to assisting local industries in conducting such research and development work as may be beneficial both to the economic prosperty of the locality and to educational development in the locality&rdquo; and the reference at section 1 (2) to &ldquo;arrangements to allow Regional Technical Colleges and Colleges of Technology to make available research and personnel facilities for, and to encourage joint ventures with, industry&rdquo;, attempt to provide for an area of activity which has been of great concern for some time.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions of the pool of highly qualified personnel with technical and professional skill and expertise in science, technology, business and other vital areas which is available in our colleges.  This must be fully exploited if this country is to maximise its potential. As Deputy Noonan said, productivity <Col N="1987" /> must increase and we must gear ourselves to that.  Otherwise we will lose the race. Our regional technical and other VEC colleges are particularly well placed to contribute towards the establishment and forestering of significant economic enterprises.The main teaching function of these colleges will of course remain &mdash; that is always the core of all educational enterprises &mdash; but over and above this main function I see it as essential that they expand their role in support of local and regional enterprise.</P>
    <P>References have been made to perceived legal and structural difficulties in connection with developing further the research and consultancy involvement of VEC colleges.  In line with the Government's strong commitment and support for the concept of college industry links I am anxious to facilitate the removal of any institutional or legislative barriers which might be a constraint.  To this end I intend shortly to bring forward legislation which, while retaining the valuable VEC links, will allow the colleges to operate with considerably greater autonomy than at present.  This legislation will also specifically permit them, in accordance with agreed policies and guidelines, to become statutorily involved in research and consultancy activities in support of local industry.</P>
    <P>Colleges are already involved in valuable industry-linked activity.  There are industrial liaison officers for all the regional technical colleges.  Assistance towards the funding of these appointments is provided by EOLAS showing again the clear interaction between one Department and another.  Among the functions of these ILOs are the promotion, fostering and establishment of links between the college, its departments and staff and industry and the promotion and facilitating of co-operative research and other joint projects.  A further very significant development is the establishment of business incubator units at various RTCs.  These units will enable the testing and development of new business ideas to take place in close proximity to the available expertise in the colleges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> Section 1 (1) (c) of the Bill requires me to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas before 30 September 1989 on proposals to improve the teaching of continental languages in all schools.  Acquiring competence in foreign languages is not something that can happen by learning grammatical rules and memorising lists of words.  In my generation that was how you learned foreign languages but it is much better now.  Language learning involves the acquisition of a complex range of skills that can only be built up and refined by massive exposure to the target language in real life situations and prolonged practice in using that language as a medium of social interaction.</P>
    <P>Foreign language learning poses different problems for different countries.  It is perfectly plausible, for example, to expect children in European countries which are linguistic crossroads to acquire one or two or even more foreign languages.For those children exposure to and practice in using foreign languages are natural occurences generated by the social environment.  It is quite a different matter for a country like Ireland, which is geographically isolated from the European mainland and which has no immediate contact with foreign languages.  The word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; occurs again and, again it holds true in this sense.  There is no social or environmental stimulus to use a foreign language.  Indeed, there is a negative motivation that comes from the perception that English is a universal medium of communication and that all other languages have limited utility.  I suppose that is a hangover.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I should like to dwell for a moment on some of the measures that have been introduced in recent years in the post primary curriculum and in the teaching and testing of modern continental languages.I do this to dispel any idea that little or nothing has been done to equip young people to face the linguistic challenges of 1992.  First of all the syllabi for modern languages have undergone radical reform.  I am not claiming the halo for this because that has taken place under many Governments.  The major <Col N="1989" /> change in this regard has been to shift the emphasis from the study of language as an academic exercise to the acquisition by the student of the essential language skills, namely aural and reading comprehension and oral and written expression.  This has naturally involved the production of authentic language meterials so that the student comes into contact with the real living language in its natural context.</P>
    <P>An immediate benefit from the new approach is the improved motivation of pupils who are now using the language, albeit in a simulated context, to convey what they want to say instead of analysing and parsing endlessly the structure of the language and making up contrived utterances to illustrate grammatical points.  I should also point out in this regard that the new junior certificate will provide a second more modest level for those students who may only aspire to a basic competence.</P>
    <P>In tandem with those changes the examinations have been reformed to reflect the thrust of these changes.  We now have, for example, aural and oral examinations and the written examinations focus on the functional language rather than literature.  There will always be a need in the study of any language to look at the literature component but our immediate concern is competency and the functional skills which must be acquired.  It is my belief that out of the acquisition of the spoken and functional skills of languages will come an awareness in the young person of the need to develop an interest in a language.  From that will develop an interest in the literature of the language.</P>
    <P>This reform of the modern language syllabi and examinations has made formidable demands on teachers.  They have had to work at improving their oral command of the target language, particularly in the registers used in everyday social interaction and they have had to familiarise themselves with life and events in the country of the language.</P>
    <P>Despite the unfavourable economic climate an expanded programme of in-service courses in Ireland and abroad has <Col N="1990" /> been provided by my Department for teachers of modern languages to equip them for the challenges of the new approach.  This in-service provision is being maintained and intensified.</P>
    <P>I have also taken steps to diversify the provision of modern languages in our schools giving particular emphasis to the expansion of German.  I have identified those schools which have teachers with the necessary qualifications to teach German or Spanish or Italian but who are not at present teaching any of those languages.  On foot of this information I propose with effect from September, the next school year, to utilise this potential in a significant number of schools.  I also propose to sanction additional teaching provision to bring about diversification. French, as we all know, already occupies a strong position in the schools and its standard, too, must be maintained.</P>
    <P>The European Commission have drafted a programme called LINGUA to promote the teaching and learning of foreign languages.  I was happy to be in a position at the meetings of EC Ministers for Education, meeting in Council, to strongly support their programme.  Preparations for its introduction into schools and colleges in the 12 EC member states are well advanced.  It is planned that the first phase of this programme will run for five years, 1990-94, with an estimated funding of some £192 million.</P>
    <P>It is intended that Community funding will be available under the programme to assist pupil exchanges as well as providing for foreign language students and teachers to spend a period of time in the country whose language they are studying or teaching.  Foreign language in business and industry will also be promoted.  At Question Time last week I was asked about the shortcomings of ERASMUS. We have learned from those shortcomings and we will be seeking to offset them in the LINGUA programme.</P>

      <P>I raised that question and I welcome the Minister's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a timely and important programme for this country <Col N="1991" /> and I will be making every effort at European level to have a realistic programme with an adequate level of Community funding implemented as soon and as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>The LINGUA programme, in association with our own language initiatives, should result in a dramatic increase in the participation rate of young people studying foreign languages in our schools and colleges.  But even more important will be the quantitative improvement in communication skills resulting from studying languages at school.  Graduates from our schools and colleges will have the necessary technical, marketing and language skills to help industry and business enterprises achieve economic success in European markets and further afield.</P>
      <P>In referring to the teaching of German I should like to correct a statement made on a radio programme on Saturday.  One of the participants on that programme which deals with politics stated that only 100 post-primary schools here teach German.  In fact, 266 post-primary schools teach German.  Various points of view are put forward on that programme but I was anxious to correct that point. The figure I have given has increased from 160 two years ago and, with the advent of the special initiatives, I have no doubt it will increase further.  I accept that that is not the complete picture and that every child in the country will not be learning two continental languages by 1992 but we are moving in that direction. We are making efforts to bring about a greater diversification of modern European languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposal for the introduction of a certificate of competence in modern continental languages open to both school students and adults, there is merit, certainly, in an approach to the teaching of languages based on graded levels of competence.  However, major structural, pedagogical and logistical problems would be created in adapting our present system to adult needs and in allowing learners to advance from one <Col N="1992" /> level to another at their own pace.  Moreover there would be a need for an authority to devise, administer, monitor and validate the system.</P>
    <P>In so far as international exchanges are concerned the cultural agreements that exist between Ireland and a number of European countries already promote teacher and student exchanges.  The latter are known as language assistant exchanges and are intended for trainee teachers of modern languages.  In the immediate future, because of demographic trends it would appear desirable to concentrate on an expansion of the schemes for teacher exchanges.  I am at present examining the possibilities in this regard, particularly in the context of the operation of the proposed LINGUA programme which has the matter of teacher exchange as one of its pivotal proposals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal to introduce modern continental languages in primary schools, I should say that the primary school curriculum is the subject of an overall review at present.  I would expect to receive the report of the review body later this year.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of this review, I do not have plans to introduce the teaching of modern continental languages in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to section 6 of the Bill which proposes certain amendments to the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  Subsection 2 of this section proposes the amendment of section 3 of the 1971 Act so that the general functions of the Higher Education Authority would be extended to include the promotion of links between institutions of higher education and industry, trade and agriculture, by means of joint ventures and joint research.</P>
    <P>I fully agree, to reply to Deputy Noonan, on the need to establish closer links between the world of higher education and the world of economic activity.  Each has a lot to learn and gain from the other.  The world of economic activity can become aware of, and benefit from, the skills and expertise available in higher education and can be assisted in developing new products and processes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> The world of higher education, on the other hand, can become more attuned to the skill needs of the world of economic activity and can ensure that its courses are designed to provide these skills.  Closer links and greater co-operation between higher education and business and industry can help these sectors to become more productive, more cost-effective and more competitive.  I would have no real difficulty with the proposal made in this subsection.  However, I do feel that it should be left open as to how the links proposed could best be promoted and established and so I would be in favour of omitting the words &ldquo;by means of joint ventures and joint research&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (a) of this section proposes the amendment of section 6 (1) of the 1971 Act which provides that the higher Education Authority maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.  The amendment in the Bill seeks to emphasise that special regard should be taken of the need to provide second chance part time education for those who have already spent seven years or more in the labour force and would require the Authority to advise the relevant Minister for Education on whether a proportion of places should be reserved for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In some European countries and in the USA the demand for second-chance or adult education has increased dramatically.This is not yet the situation here and the third level institutions are coping with the present demand.  As subsection (1) of section 6 of the 1971 Act has been left suitably broad I feel that the amendment proposed in Deputy Bruton's Bill is unnecessary since the existing powers of the Authority are not confined to full time and post-school education.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3 (b) seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 6 of the 1971 Act, so that, in addition to recommending to the Minister the overall provision of places within the higher education system, having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in student numbers between the institutions of higher education, the Authority would also have regard to the need to ensure <Col N="1994" /> that priority is given to those forms of higher education which offer the greatest prospects to students of gainful employment in Ireland and the need to promote effective practical links between industry, trade and agriculture.  This latter part of the amendment is unnecessary since it would be covered by extending the general functions of the Authority to include the promotion of such links as proposed already in subsection 2 of this section.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the institutions of higher education and the Higher Education Authority are doing everything possible to provide graduates who have the skills needed by the various sectors of economic activity.  This is, well established by the HEA Report on First Destination of Award Recipients in Higher Education (1987).  The report indicates that there was a large fall in the proportion of all respondents classified as seeking employment or as engaged in State-sponsored work experience schemes.  I would share the Deputy's concern about the numbers of young graduates who must seek at least their initial employment abroad.  But the Government are doing something about this.  As I have said earlier, we have made great strides on the road to economic recovery. Our exports are up, our interest rates and inflation are down.  The Government are committed to policies which will develop an environment conducive to economic progress.  It is only by pursuing such policies that we can create productive jobs and it is by creating such jobs only that we can secure employment for our young graduates.</P>
    <P>I feel that the balance across the disciplines in higher education is reasonably right.  Accordingly, I do not see the need for the amendment being proposed.</P>
    <P>At present a broadly-based interdepartmental group are investigating the whole area of third level education.  That review group was mooted by the previous Government and established by us.  I hope to receive their report next month. They have reviewed all aspects of the provision of third level education under the various subheads of their remit which <Col N="1995" /> I have enunciated here many times in answer to parliamentary questions.  The result of their in-depth investigation into all of those matters could well complement much of the provisions of this Bill and certainly will point up some of the submissions I have made in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>Subsection 4 of the section seeks to amend section 16 of the 1971 Act so that a committee will be appointed to prepare a report before 1 January 1990 on any duplication of facilities that may exist with a view to concentrating resources in centres of excellence in particular disciplines.</P>
    <P>I have no great problem with what Deputy Bruton is proposing here.  It is in all our interests to avoid unnecessary duplication but unlike Deputy Bruton, I would have to use and stress the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.  Our higher education system, like any other arm of Government, must be as cost-effective, as efficient and productive as possible.  It is for this reason that the Government established an interdepartmental committee to review the whole third-level education sector.  For this reason it would be premature to consider legislative changes until this whole area can be reviewed in the light of the committee's report.</P>
    <P>In subsection (5) Deputy Bruton is, in effect, proposing that the majority of members of the Higher Education Authority should be non-academic members. Indeed I have a certain sympathy with what he has in mind here.</P>
    <P>However, consideration of these matters should await the report of the interdepartmental committee.  Certainly I will bear in mind the matters raised by Deputy Bruton in this Bill at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate that I was very pleased to respond, in like manner, to the submissions put forward by various Deputies.I was present for Deputy Noonan's contribution which I found to be of a consensus-type nature.  The Bill contains many provisions on which we are already <Col N="1996" /> engaged within the Department as a follow-on to various other initiatives undertaken by various Governments and which will be progressed further in the light of the provisions of this Bill put forward by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity to speak on this Bill is especially welcome to those of us who, through pressure of time, were precluded from speaking on the debate on the national plan in this House last week.</P>
      <P>I might begin by commending Deputy Bruton on having brought this comprehensive and far-reaching Bill before the House.  It forces all of us to confront the issues facing our country in the run-up to 1992 in an open and coherent fashion.  Let us hope that it will help to propel us towards coherent action.</P>
      <P>Rather than range over the variety of issues addressed in this Bill I will confine my remarks to the areas dealing with education and deal also with regional planning as it relates specifically to the area I represent, that is Cork city.  Deputy Bruton rightly emphasised the importance of bringing about educational change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acquisition of oral competence in at least two modern European languages is for the majority of our school leavers an absolute precondition to any real, active and fruitful participation by our people in the new integrated Europe.  There is no disagreement about that from any side of the House.  However, how it is to be achieved within the desired timescale is another story.  The single greatest obstacle to progress is the absence of a sufficiency of language teachers competent to introduce additional languages in the classroom.  Since recruitment of newly qualified teachers into the workforce has almost come to a standstill there is one way to tackle the problem only, that is to provide massive in-service training for practising teachers and to do so now.  But that involves the expenditure of a lot of money.  If we are really serious about tackling the problem resources must be made available.  It is to be hoped that the LINGUA fund will be put to <Col N="1997" /> good use in providing the requisite number of teachers, of well motivated, keen people who, within a short time, will be in a position to introduce German, Spanish and Italian into our classrooms. In that respect I have been heartened by what the Minister had to say in the House this evening.  We do have access to an infill of funds from that source.  It is to be hoped that they will be used well and purposefully to enable us implement the start-up in our schools, providing German, Spanish and Italian on the scale prevailing conditions demand.</P>
    <P>It is good to hear from the Minister that German is now being taught in 266 schools.  However, that is a drop in the ocean when one considered the export potential on the German market for goods manufactured here.  We must intensify and escalate our efforts and spare no energy in so doing.  We must be single-minded in providing the resources that will enable us to achieve that goal. All sides of the House must combine in that effort.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of languages on a graded scale, I believe it is possible to introduce French into primary schools.  I accept that the experience in Great Britain is not very encouraging to us in as much as that what happened in England in the sixties and seventies was, after ten years of effort, deemed to be a failure.  Despite the fact that £1 million was provided from funds under the Nuffield Foundation to introduce French into primary schools in England the project failed, and it was so deemed in 1974, if my memory serves me right.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think the British experience ought to inhibit us.  Unlike children in Britain, children here are linguistically geared from a very early age to take on board a second language other than vernacular.  That is one of the great benefits of having a second language &mdash; the Irish language, which essentially is meant to be our language &mdash; taught in primary schools.  Irish children, unlike their British counterparts, are geared to thinking and expressing themselves in a second language and are geared to the <Col N="1998" /> skills of effectively using a second language from a very early age.  Undoubtedly this helps them to take on board a third language at an earlier age than students who are schooled in a monolingual country.  When people argue that the Irish language has had its day I remind them of that very real plus point which the Irish language has given to our students at this stage in their development.</P>
    <P>Irish primary school children are much better geared to grappling with a language other than their vernacular from an early age and as such I would contend they are infinitely better prepared to take on board a modern European language at the age of nine, ten of 11 years of age. Of course, the only obstacle to doing that is the absence of sufficiently qualified teachers to introduce the language at that stage.  This is a great pity because if our aim is for students to achieve oral competence in two modern European languages by the time they reach leaving certificate level we must be prepared to introduce one of those languages at a stage earlier than post primary education.Learning a language adequately is a long process and I believe with regard to modern European languages, that process ought to commence in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is beyond our capability to introduce French at the senior standards of primary school with a view to introducing German, Spanish or Italian, as the case may be, at the post junior certificate examination stage, and following that through so that by the time students reach leaving certificate stage all of them will have an oral competence in two modern European languages as well as having a good conversational competence in both Irish and English.  Languages nourish and help one another and I know from experience that in schools where there is a range of languages the students are equally good at Irish, English, German or French.</P>
    <P>We must not go for the lowest common denominator when we talk about the introduction of additional languages: we must take note of what we have, value what we have and build on that.  If we <Col N="1999" /> could provide the in-service training for our teachers to enable them to introduce French at primary level we could, as I said, introduce it at 15 years of age and upwards so that we could achieve the target mentioned by Deputy Bruton in this Bill.  I do not think this would be beyond our capability and this is what we ought to be aiming for.</P>
    <P>It was very heartening to read in one of today's newspapers the results of a survey carried out on behalf of the European Parliament Information Office. That survey showed that second level teachers of all groups in Irish society are highest among those who favour closer integration with Europe.  This is very heartening.  Ninety seven per cent of all second level teachers polled considered that a European dimension ought to be included in all second level education. The will is there &mdash; and the Minister for Education must take note of this &mdash; and what teachers are clearly saying is &ldquo;Give us the tools and we will do the job&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The teaching of European languages must not be left to the schools alone; other supporting initiatives will have to be taken.  Summer colleges here and student exchange between member countries must be organised on a vastly increased scale.  Much of the time currently spent on grinds, duplicating work which is already well covered in mainstream education, must now be directed towards language learning.  Parents would be much better advised &mdash; and the career prospects of their children would be much better enhanced as a result &mdash; if they spent more time and money on giving their children an opportunity out of school to learn modern European languages than what is happening at present when much time is spent duplicating work that has already been well and adequately taught in mainstream education.Parents would be well advised to think in that direction.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to discover today that the director of the Euro College, which is a private venture, who had planned for 800 places in her Euro College next summer, has already had applications for <Col N="2000" /> places for more than 1,000 children who want to take part in the summer courses in her colleges located throughout the country, such is the demand from parents who want their children to gain some kind of competence in modern European languages.  That demand must be met.</P>
    <P>Adult education must also be harnessed to the campaign to provide an environment where all of us, young and old, become more proficient in speaking European languages.  Television must also be used to provide French and German programmes nationwide.  This is already being effectively done in Cork where TV5 on multi-channel has an audience of more than 14 per cent of all the station's audience.  When there was a breakdown in the multi-channel for some technical reason or other there was an outcry from parents and teachers alike as to why the French programmes were not going out on multi-channel.  There is no doubt there is a demand for European languages and this demand can be met in a variety of ways outside school.  One of the mistakes we made in regard to the Irish language is that we put too much of a burden on schools and did not match that with parallel efforts outside school. Let us not make the same mistake in relation to the introduction and teaching of modern European languages.</P>
    <P>The media must reflect more accurately the new drive towards multi-lingualism.God knows there is little enough written in Irish in any of our newspapers, even those regarded as being serious newspapers.  Would it not be great if some day we woke up to find something reported in French or in German?  Suppose they started reporting a football match or an all-Ireland final.  We would all know the story but despite that we would still have to read about it the following morning in our newspapers. Would it not be great if somebody had the initiative to write about it even partly in French, Italian or German?  That would be a great attempt to bolster what I hope will happen in our schools and it is not beyond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there are reports that are excellent, for example, those by Con Houlihan.  Much has been said about modern European languages.  If we could put even a fraction of that into action we would not have any problems.</P>
      <P>The imminence of 1992 calls for a number of other urgent initiatives on the part of our educational institutions if the people of this country are to reap full benefit from the opportunities that the integrated European market will present. Given resources in key faculty areas the third level colleges are well placed to act as catalysts for growth and development. I speak especially here of University College Cork and the role that college is capable of playing in the development of a dynamic food industry with its capacity to generate thousands of jobs in developing, processing, packaging and marketing food products as we stand on the threshold of a consumer market of 320 million people.</P>
      <P>Cork has a fine faculty of food and technology.  Since its inception in 1926 it has played a major role in developing a food industry in this country.  For the modest outlay of £5 million, UCC now has the capacity to transform our agricultural and food industry from commodity and intervention-type product, with all its inherent waste, and turn it into a consumer orientated industry with all its potential for job creation and wealth creation.  It is nothing short of a scandal that, as I speak here this evening, the shelves of the shops, supermarkets and food halls of this country are filled with food that is produced, processed and packaged in countries outside Ireland thereby creating thousands of jobs for people other than our own.  This is the ultimate betrayal of our young people who are hungry for jobs.  It must be corrected in the context of the opening of the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis in the future must be on research aimed at increasing the production of consumer products with high <Col N="2002" /> added value allied to strong marketing in the language of the purchaser.  This will inevitably increase prices for the primary producer and will also create thousands of badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>Cork sits in the heart of some of the finest agricultural land in Europe.  It also has one of the finest deep water ports in Europe with a potential for an export trade.  University College Cork has the tradition and the skill in the field of food, science and technology.  Given the necessary resources it has the ability to revolutionarise and galvanise the food industry.  Cork must become not just the food capital of Ireland but the food capital of Europe; it can and must be done.</P>
    <P>University College Cork also has an enormous potential for generating economic growth through the expansion of its national micro-electronic research centre. The growth of the Irish electronics industry is one of the major success stories of the past 20 years.  In 1987 32,300 people were employed in this fledgling industry which now accounts for 27 per cent of our total manufacturing output.  With proper increased investment this industry has enormous potential for growth and for employment opportunities to keep our highly qualified young graduates at home where they can earn their living and generate spending power and wealth for their own people.  The very legitimate request of this centre for enhanced investment to expand its activities must be met in the context of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I fully support the measure advocated in this Bill by Deputy Bruton aimed at forging new links and strengthening old links between education and industry.  In this respect the proposal contained in the Government's national plan to initiate a resource centre in which FÁS, University College Cork, the Regional Technical College in Cork and the IDA will cooperate is most welcome and should be ardently supported.  I hope that will be brought forward sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for speaking up for my own sub-region in the context of this debate.  I represent a city that is part of a sub-region uniquely fitted for priority <Col N="2003" /> consideration under the terms set out in regard to the Structural Funds, an area deeply disadvantaged because of its location and the farthest removed from the centre of the European market and which is further disadvantaged because of its failure to lobby successfully for its fair share of the national cake in the last ten years.  Yet this is an area rich in national assets.  It has a large reservoir of energetic, enterprising, well educated young people; recipients of the largest single educational investment ever made in the history of this country, an investment put there by the dedication of our taxpayers and well nurtured by a group of dedicated teachers in a major act of faith in the future of this country.  It also has a fine pool of industrial workers recently made redundant because of the simultaneous collapse of so many big industries but with a range of valuable industrial skills that now stand to go to seed.  Are these fine workers to be left to rot on the scrap heap or could they, with proper policy decisions, be put to work in new manufacturing industries?  I contend that they could.</P>
    <P>We have a fine port, a thriving developing airport, a good city road structure and housing at prices which young couples can still afford.  We are located at the gateway of some of the most sought after tourist terrain in Ireland and tourism is predicted to be the greatest single growth industry in the years ahead.  In this respect I must remind the Government that we have no direct ferry service to the UK.  There is no sign of any real Government commitment to putting such a service in place.</P>

If that is not done all this talk about developing the tourist industry and multiplying jobs is only hogwash.  Action counts but not words.

      <P>What is now needed is a set of new initiatives and key investments in areas that I have mentioned to set Cork on a new course of job and wealth creation and to begin the upward spiral that is needed.  That is all I am asking.  This can be done in the context of the proper strategic application of Structural Funds.  Putting a road from Dublin to Rosslare is of no benefit to the people in the south-west.  I am arguing for our fair share of Structural Funds and then proper policy making to ensure that those Structural Funds are spent strategically to generate the maximum number of jobs and real wealth in the <Col N="2005" /> area.  That is a reasonable request.  The process of preparing for 1992 is the last opportunity we have to lift ourselves out of the economic and social mediocrity that has beset this country for the last ten years.  I want to see Cork and its regions playing a key role, and so I support the broad thrust of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would know more about that than I, given the grouping to which she has aligned herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill amends the Vocational Act.  In many ways this section is welcome in that it gives us an opportunity to consider the whole concept of education and industry links and because it also gives us time to concern ourselves with the teaching of continental languages.  The Minister for Education spoke tonight on this section and I cannot add to what she said but I will make a few observations.  I commend Deputy Quill for the point she made that because we teach Irish children two languages from a very early age, they are attuned to the fact that there are alternative ways of expressing themselves.  The Deputy's point is very valid.  Those people who denigrate the teaching of Irish as a waste <Col N="2006" /> of time should attend to this point.  If nothing else, every pound that has been spent on Irish has given our children and ourselves the benefit from the earliest age of knowing that we can express things using different languages.</P>
    <P>Another point on which Deputy Quill touched and which I want to raise is that when we are discussing the importance of language and the importance of developing a capacity to express ourselves in day-to-day situations in languages, we should look at the way in which our national radio and television channels address this issue.  Those of us who live outside the Cork region do not have the opportunity, except when visiting Cork, of seeing the excellent Channel 5 presentation of continental language programmes.  This is a great shame.  If RTE 2 were to use the spare time they obviously have to any effect, they should use it by picking up news digests from both the German and French channels and rebroadcasting them.  It could not be costly and it would be extremely beneficial, particularly as people have an innate grasp of what is being discussed in any current affairs programme irrespective of the language.  Those who are fortunate to have language skills would have their skills improved if they could look at current affairs programmes in an alternative language, and those of us who are still stumbling in an alternative language would have the opportunity of picking up some additional vocabulary.</P>
    <P>In relation to the role of education in the context of 1992 and further European integration, it pains me a little that some of the contributions here have unnecessarily focused purely on the economic end of education, particularly when they were discussing language.  We have discussed language in the context of commerce and of economic development.  Obviously it is appropriate that we should do so but there is also an intrinsic value in language opening our minds to alternative culture.  That aspect is also worthy of emphasis.</P>
    <P>The proposals, in so far as they relate to the affairs of the VECs and RTCs generally, are a little premature.  After <Col N="2007" /> all, the Minister for Education is at present finalising new legislation.  Given that we are undertaking an overall review of third level education, Deputy Bruton's proposals, in so far as they relate to the Higher Education Act, are also premature.However, the debate that has focused on this aspect has been very welcome in that we are for once focusing on the value of third level education and on the industry/third level linkages.  This is something I welcome as a relatively new departure in third level education here. Members will be aware that today the institution with which I am associated, UCD, has announced a further initiative in the context of university/industry linkages.The job is being well done by the third level institutions.  The proposals here are premature only in that there is a review in hand and that is the most appropriate vehicle for producing suggestions here.</P>
    <P>I condemn the proposals in section 2 which attempt to amend the Central Bank Act.  <i>Inter alia,</i> it provides that the bank should take into account the need to create employment.  One would assume that all the State institutions were conscious of all the dimensions of their activities.The fact remains that the Central Bank Act, 1942, provides a general function for the bank to protect the integrity of the currency and control credit and in that context to secure the welfare of the people.  It is superfluous to put this provision into law.  It seems unwise in that it will focus the bank excessively on one of its multiple objectives.  I cannot understand the general value of this.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with the planning and development laws more or less. There is no doubt that we need to look at the developing and planning laws and to re-emphasise the way planning and legislation should operate.  Unfortunately there is far too much emphasis on physical planning in the way that Act is operated and far too little emphasis on development.  The Planning and Development Act, after all, has two sides.  It attempts to deal with physical planning and development.  It attempts, <Col N="2008" /> in the words of Seán Lemass, to create in the local authorities a set of locally oriented development corporations. There is no doubt that we need to speed up the planning process and that spurious objections which are introduced in planning and which can sometimes prohibit development need to be addressed. The Minister for the Environment has already dealt with this aspect in some detail.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the by-laws and approval of by-laws being required within a certain period.  One of the aspects of planning with which any of us involved in this area is familiar is the problems that exist with by-laws.  Many of our by-laws are extraordinarily out of date. Recently I was looking at the by-laws for the township of Bray.  These were drawn up in the early years of the nineteenth century.  If you strictly applied the by-laws, there is no doubt that many of the existing developments would be illegal.  I wonder at the wisdom of some of these by-laws.  They serve a purpose, but clearly what is needed in the planning and development context is a strict and urgent review of the by-laws, a very severe degree of editing.  Many of the by-laws on our Statute Book, far from aiding and assisting the planning and development role of the local authorities, hamper planning and development.  An urgent review is needed because many of the by-laws have long since outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has already dealt with the education sections and I do not intend to focus on them.  Section 7 amends the European Communities Act.  It requires the Government to report at regular periods, quarterly, to each House of the Oireachtas and to a joint committee of the Oireachtas.  I wonder at the wisdom and, indeed, the usefulness of this.  We have at the moment an Oireachtas joint committee, established consequent upon the Act, charged with the task of overseeing how we relate domestic legislation to legislation coming forward from the EC.  It strikes me that an extension of their terms of reference would not be required to <Col N="2009" /> expand their activities to focusing specifically on a movement towards the creation of a Single European Market.  I am not a member of that committee, but my recollection of their terms of reference would be that this objective in section 7 could well be achieved, in any event, within the context of the existing committee work.</P>
    <P>The Government are vitally aware of the importance of communications in the general context of 1992.  While the proposal contained in Deputy Bruton's Bill focuses on our discussing the issue of 1992 with each other, its strikes me that a far more fruitful focus for discussion on 1992 would be, not to be talking amongst ourselves but with our partners in Europe. In this regard, Deputies who have focussed on the recent development plan have been disingenuous in the extreme in that they have not recognised adequately the institutional framework which the Government are at the moment putting into operation.  The Government are deeply conscious of the importance of the development plan as a vehicle for increasing Structural Funds aid but also for integrating our economy into the new Europe.  They have acknowledged the importance of communications in this regard by establishing a unique relationship in the context of the plan with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission has, on its side, established a task force of relevant Commissioners and Directors General, headed by President Delors.  This is paralleled on the Irish side by a committee of Government Ministers and secretaries headed by the Taoiseach.  This seems a far more logical communications forum for discussing how we integrate ourselves into the Europe of post-1992.  I cannot see the purpose of section 7 or what precisely it will serve.  It strikes me that the institutional arrangements which I have outlined here, together with the institutional arrangements set up for the preparation of the development plan, were a far more logical way of utilising energy and time.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 are interesting. Section 8 deals with the road fund and <Col N="2010" /> sections 9, 10 and 11 with taxation matters.In the context of the road fund and the National Roads Authority, I cannot understand the purpose of the Bill.  All that Deputy Bruton is grasping here is something which Government have already in train.  The Government have already indicated their intentions for the National Roads Authority.  A road budget for the next five years is already provided in the context of the plan, so precisely what is aimed at here is difficult to establish.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 focus on tax incentives.  Basically, the intention of these sections is to extend existing schemes.  There is a proposal for additional tax relief on interest paid by an individual for a loan raised with regard to a business expansion scheme.  Perhaps Deputy Bruton would bite his tongue a little now, given all that has been said in recent times about the BES.  There is a further proposal for additional tax relief to be granted to farmers letting their land under a long lease and there are proposals to modify restrictions on tax relief for investment in research and development. The Minister for Finance when speaking on this set of proposals made a very valid point about this <i>ad hoc</i> set of suggestions.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that we in Ireland face is that, as we all know, our tax base is far too narrow.  Over the years it has been progressively narrowed by ad hoc tax incentives, most of which are good in themselves but taken as a whole, sometimes achieve nothing or, at worst, actually contradict each other.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in ad hocery when we discuss tax incentives.  There is a danger in having a multiplicity of tax incentive schemes.  That is precisely where this Bill is heading.  What is being advocated here is the antithesis of taxation reform.  After all, taxation reform is an issue with which Deputy Bruton is said to be familiar.  It is an issue about which he is said to be concerned.  Yet he is proposing here the worst kind of taxation ad hocery.  This is to be condemned.I do not see the value of what he is proposing and do not for a moment accept that anybody who has seriously <Col N="2011" /> studied this Bill could give any degree of support to this set of proposals.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are equally ill-considered.  Section 12, which deals with the Industrial Development Act, is a very questionable piece of legislation.It is proposed, for example, that a new section be inserted in the primary Industrial Development Act providing the inclusion of targets for performance to be achieved up to the year 2000.  I do not think Deputy Bruton seriously believes that it is possible to establish realistic targets beyond next year or the year after.  Nobody in this House believes that that is the case.  I cannot for the life of me understand what he aims at doing here.  I am not opposed to the concept of establishing targets.  In fact, I have argued frequently that targets which have been set for job development are unrealistic and that the type of figures that come from the IDA from time to time are phoney.  I say that coming from County Wicklow where, over the years, we have had a lower delivery of jobs by the IDA than we could reasonably expect.  I cannot understand how anybody with Deputy Bruton's fine mind could suggest that this ludicrous proposal has anything to commend it.</P>
    <P>I shall be very brief as time is marching on.  Section 13 amends the National Development Corporation Act.  When you read the body of the proposal it is an equally ludicrous proposal.  It suggests that there should be a regionalisation of the activities of the NDC.  No Deputy in the House can believe seriously that the NDC's operations are on such a scale that they need to be subdivided by sector, by region or whatever.  The NDC's activities are of such a narrow scale that it would dissipate them if we were to try to create a regional element.</P>
    <P>Section 14 has already been discussed at great length.  I made a contribution on the concept of moving Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome directly into domestic law, but given that the Fair Trade Commission is undertaking a study in this regard &mdash; and I made this point on the last occassion we debated this, this, <Col N="2012" /> like so many other proposals in the Bill, is premature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Reports: Developments in the European Communities &mdash; 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st Reports.</P>
      <P>The European Communities Act of 1972 imposes an obligation on the Government to make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.The motion before the House this evening asks the Dáil to take note of the last eight such reports which have been laid before the Dáil, covering each six-month period from January 1984 to December 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I would like to say that it is a matter of some regret that a debate has not taken place on these reports since 1984.  The reports provide a factual record of the principal decisions taken by <Col N="2013" /> the Communities, as well as summarising developments on the main issues at stake, with special emphasis on those which affect this country.  It would be highly desirable for the Dáil to take the opportunity, every six months, of reflecting on the European Communities achievements as outlined in the reports, as well as on the main current issues facing Ireland and the Community.  I would hope that we can now establish a rhythm of debate every six months from now on.  That it has not happened in recent years is due partly to the fact that there have been other regular opportunities to debate developments in the Communities and these are availed of the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the fact that these reports have not been debated recently may be that of late a considerable gap has developed between the publication of a report and the ending of the period which it covers.  This has meant that it loses some of is immediacy.  For instance, the 31st report, covering the second half of 1987, did not appear until February of this year.  This was due chiefly to pressure of other work not only in the Department of Foreign Affairs but also in other Departments which contribute to the reports.  However, the 32nd annual report, covering the first half of 1988, is complete and with the printers and work on the 33rd report, covering the second part of 1988, has been put in hand.</P>
    <P>Every effort will be made in future to maintain the rhythm of production of these reports so that they will appear within a reasonable period, which I would regard as six months following the conclusion of the period with which they are concerned, so that the material contained in them is still relevant for discussion in the House.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the fact that the reports have not been debated for some time gives us a unique opportunity to review a period which has been momentous for the development of the Community.  It was instructive, when preparing for this debate, to look at the first of the reports listed in the motion &mdash; the 24th, covering the first half of 1984.</P>
    <P>At that time the Community was in a <Col N="2014" /> state of stagnation, if not of crisis.  It was paralysed by the problem of inadequate budgetary resources and its decisionmaking process seemed frozen. However, since then the Community has pulled itself out of the crisis and is better equipped to face the challenges of the nineties than one would have dared to expect five years ago.  In this context it is instructive to consider some of the developments of the last five years.</P>
    <P>In June 1985 the Commission presented its White Paper listing the 300 or so measures needed to complete the internal market &mdash; an issue which preoccupies all sectors of the economy as we prepare for the 1992 deadline.  The year 1985 also saw the completion of negotiations on Spanish and Portuguese accession and these two countries formally became members in January 1986, bringing new and fresh perspectives to the Community.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act was agreed in January 1986.  Deputies will now be thoroughly familiar with the Act which has been debated extensively in this House.  It provides chiefly for improvements in the Community's decision-making process, particularly the application of qualified majority voting in the Council in certain areas, most notably in the internal market area.</P>
    <P>It also provided for the promotion of economic and social cohesion in the Community, an enhanced role for the European Parliament in the Community's operation, for closer co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy and for the development of Community policies in areas such as science and technology.</P>
    <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court on 9 April 1987 in the Crotty case, the Government moved quickly to hold a referendum in May 1987 which gave the Irish people an opportunity to consider the Single European Act and to renew commitment to the Community. Following their approval of the Single European Act, by a majority of 70 per cent to 30 per cent and the depositing of Ireland's Instrument of Ratification, the Single European Act came into effect <Col N="2015" /> throughout the Community on 1 July 1987.</P>
    <P>The next stage was the achievement of agreement on a comprehensive package of measures designed to facilitate the future development of the Community. This package of measures, aptly entitled &ldquo;Making a Success of the Single Act&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;Delors Plan&rdquo;, was presented by Commission President Delors to the European Council in February 1987.</P>
    <P>The Delors Plan included agreement on a new regime of own resources and budgetary discipline, new agricultural guidelines, a reform of the Structural Funds and a new arrangement for the British budgetary contribution.  Negotiation on this package was at times arduous.However, agreement was finally reached on the package in February 1988, and thus full effect was given to the main lines of the Community's development implied in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn in more detail to some of the main areas of Community policy.  As has been the practice with debates of this nature in the past, I will not limit my comments to developments in the reports before us but will deal with current issues.  Indeed my emphasis will be on current issues.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned how the Commission's White Paper of June 1985 formed the basic programme for the completion of the internal market.  Over half of the 300 or so measures listed in that programme have now been adopted so good progress has taken place.  Some of the remaining measures are important for this country, and potentially difficult, most notably the question of tax harmonisation.However, the Government are confident that satisfactory solutions will be found to the problems which arise in this area.</P>
    <P>The movement towards the completion of the international market will give fresh impetus to economic growth and development in the European Community.It will also have significant social implications in addition to the economic opportunities which it will present.  This has been recognised by the European <Col N="2016" /> Council which has stressed that the ultimate objective of the completion of the internal market is the promotion of the maximum wellbeing of all of the people of the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland attaches considerable importance to the realization of the social dimension.  Unemployment, which has rightly been recognised as the major social policy issue confronting the Community, is a particular priority for us. We will continue to press for effective Community action to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the progress which has been made to date in relation to the reform of the Structural Funds in the context of completion of the internal market in 1992.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already be aware of developments in relation to the <i>National Development Plan</i>, which was considered in the course of a three day debate in this House last week.  Because the details of the debate are, no doubt, still fresh in your minds, I do not propose to address specific aspects of the plan here this evening.  I feel it would be more useful, instead, to take stock of the process of reform of the Structural Funds to date and the manner in which that reform has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the objective of cohesion.</P>
    <P>Cohesion, as you are aware, is the process designed to lessen the economic and social disparities between the less prosperous peripheral member states and the more prosperous central regions.  Community commitment to narrowing the gap between the regions was given a new impetus in the Single European Act, in which the policy of cohesion was, for the first time, given Treaty status.  This impetus was further developed in the Delors Plan which outlined the Commission's proposals for the implementation of the Single Act.  The Delors Plan established clear objectives for the Structural Funds and identified the broad lines of the reform of these funds.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Commission's proposals, particularly those relating to reform of the Structural Funds, was <Col N="2017" /> endorsed at the Brussels Council in February 1988, where it was decided that the resources available for the three Structural Funds would be doubled by 1993.  In an effort to concentrate the funds where they are most needed, the European Council also decided that the contribution to the less developed regions would be doubled by 1992; that a special effort would be made for the least prosperous regions which, at the Taoiseach's insistence included Ireland, and the provision that, for these regions, the rate of assistance from the funds can be up to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the course of negotiation of the regulations which give effect to the Delors Plan, Ireland was successful in obtaining agreement that certain infrastructure projects with private sector funding will be eligible for Community assistance. Given domestic budgetary restraints this provision is of crucial importance to us. It means Ireland will be able to maximise the benefits derived from the increased funds.</P>
    <P>Of course the reform of the funds is not just about increased budgetary resources for the Community's regions.  It is also about making better use of those resources.  As the Taoiseach stated in this House last Wednesday, this availability of increased resources represents a unique opportunity for Ireland &mdash; to raise the whole country as a region of the Community onto a new plane of development and to overcome the economic and social deficiencies that are holding us back.</P>
    <P>In that spirit we have drawn up a national development plan which sets out our national priorities for Community assistance.  The plan is of crucial importance because it will provide the basis for our negotiation with Brussels for Community assistance for Ireland over the five year period 1989-1993.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware, of course, that this plan is not just a set of expenditure tables projected over five years.  It is a comprehensive, integrated national plan covering every region and to which each economic sector is linked.  The plan is the outcome of close consultations at <Col N="2018" /> every stage with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government also undertook a wide spectrum of consultation, not only at national, but also at regional level. This ensured the participation of regional interests from each of the seven subregions in the formulation of the plan.  I am confident that our logical and coherent approach at every stage, from the earliest negotiations right through to finalisation of the <i>National Development Plan</i>, will ensure that Ireland is well positioned to avail, to the maximum extent possible, of the doubled resources of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Right through the period covered by the reports and to date agriculture has continued to have a central place on the agenda and remains one of the Community's most important concerns. Decisions taken at the Community level over the past 18 months have essentially completed the process of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Measures for the stabilisation of expenditure are now being implemented in all of the main product sectors.  The common thread of these measures is that the CAP should become a more market-oriented policy. The mechanism of intervention is being reduced and there is an increasing emphasis on quality production.</P>
    <P>The reform process has, of course, entailed painful decisions for some member states.  Ireland has been particularly affected by the changes in the milk and beef regimes.  However, the unsustainable budgetary situation created by surplus production made change unavoidable if the policy itself was to survive and its long term viability ensured.  The earlier reforms are already bearing fruit in the form of improved market balance and higher producer prices for major commodities, in the dairy sector in particular.  The CAP now has a stable and adequately financed basis for its effective future operation.  The Government are determined that the policy should continue to serve its fundamental objectives, in particular the safeguarding of family farm income.  We will actively seek to ensure that it also <Col N="2019" /> provides a suitable framework for the development of agriculture and of the food industry in this country.</P>
    <P>A further important development last year was the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers to a revision of the programme for western development incorporating some major improvements to the original programme.  The most significant of these are the extension of the geographical scope of the programme to cover all disadvantaged areas in this country and the provision for higher rates of Community contribution, ranging up to 70 per cent for certain types of investment undertaken within the framework of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Community is, as Deputies are aware, the largest trading bloc in the world and its external relations are a particular concern not just to the member states but also to its trading partners.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in the Community on external relations in the period under review has been the launching of a new round of trade negotiations, under the auspices of GATT, in September 1986.  The negotiations are due to end in 1990 and embrace a number of sectors not hitherto covered by GATT &mdash; notably, agriculture and services.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware the mid-term review meeting in Montreal in December 1988 had to be suspended because of differences between the Community on the one hand and the US and members of the Cairns Group on the other, principally over agriculture.  This meeting was resumed in Geneva at the beginning of this month and the results achieved were generally satisfactory to the Community, including Ireland.  We are now embarking on the most difficult phase of the round &mdash; the negotiations. On the basis of progress to date in the round we are satisfied that the eventual outcome will result in agreement on the broad range of areas covered by the GATT.  In turn this will encourage the expansion of world trade and strengthen the open international trading system.</P>
    <P>The Community's external relations <Col N="2020" /> have continued to expand and diversify in the period under review.  This reflects the growing interest in and importance attached to the Community by third countries, since the adoption of the Single European Act.  The creation of the internal market in 1992, which will open up a market of over 300 million customers to the world market, has resulted in a new impetus being given to the Community's external relations.</P>
    <P>The joint declaration on the establishment of official relations between the EC and the COMECON, signed in Luxembourg on 25 June 1988, is a significant development in this context and opens the way through bilateral agreements for the development of relations between the Community and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Relations with long standing partners have continued to develop.  A new impetus was given to EC-EFTA relations in the period under review.  The first meeting between Foreign Ministers of EFTA and the Community was held in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984.</P>
    <P>A further impetus was given to our relations with EFTA by the second ministerial meeting at Foreign Minister level held last month in Brussels, when it was agreed to explore how relations could be restructured and intensified.</P>
    <P>Relations with Japan have improved since 1984.  Although the Community's trade deficit with Japan has risen to $22.79 billion and continues to be a source of concern, the Japanese Government have attempted to resolve some of the problems we have raised with them. EC exports to Japan have increased in the last two years &mdash; by 20 per cent in ECU terms in 1988.  We look forward to the continuation of positive trends and to the expansion of mutually advantageous and balanced trade between Japan and the Community after 1992.</P>
    <P>Since 1984, relations between the Community and the US have at times been strained by problems affecting trade.  In particular, agriculture has presented difficulties, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora.  However, the successful outcome of the resumed GATT mid-term review meeting in <Col N="2021" /> Geneva, to which I alluded earlier and our own contacts and those of the Commission with members of the new administration in Washington, give us grounds for optimism that both sides will be able to approach these problems anew and to find lasting solutions.</P>
    <P>Turning now to European political co-operation, during the period under review its procedures and practices were codified and given legal form for the first time in Title III of the Single European Act.  This puts into treaty form the EPC process in which Ireland has been engaged since we joined the Community in 1973.  It enables the Twelve to take a view on foreign policy issues of general interest.  As it is based on the principle of consensus all statements and actions have to be mutually agreed.  So far as security matters are concerned the scope of EPC is limited to its political and economic aspects, to take account of Ireland's position.</P>
    <P>There have been many developments in the period under review in which the EC member states, through EPC, have played a role.  I should like to mention just a few.</P>
    <P>East-West relations have been a major preoccupation of EPC during the period covered by the reports.  Hopes were greatly heightened by the treaty between the superpowers eliminating nuclear weapons from Europe and by the Soviet Union's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.They were raised further by the agreement in principle by the superpowers to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals by half.  We hope that negotiation on strategic nuclear weapons can resume in the very near future.  Another encouraging development has been the growth of movement towards democratic pluralism in several countries of Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary and Poland.  The recent elections in the Soviet Union give us grounds for hope that something similar may happen there. This has been an exciting period during which we have all become more aware of the other &ldquo;lung&rdquo; of Europe, to use the striking metaphor from the Pope's address to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> The Vienna Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began in late 1986 and concluded early this year with new undertakings in the field of human rights and contacts, in inter-state relations, in the area of military security and in economic co-operation.These results mark a qualitative jump forward in the CSCE process in which Ireland has been engaged since its inception in 1975.  The benefits of these agreements should be felt by individuals, especially in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The growth of openness and the popular demand for democratic pluralism and respect for human rights that we now see in many East European countries owe much to the CSCE which has been a standard bearer and an encouragement to those who have been repressed and denied freedom of expression.  Ireland co-ordinates most positions in the CSCE with its partners in the European Community.The Twelve have been active in promoting the CSCE as the most reliable framework within which the relations between the countries and peoples of Europe, in association with the US and Canada, can be discussed.</P>
    <P>We co-ordinate our position with that of our partners in the United Nations also.  The Twelve have given their full support to the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to build on the ceasefire reached in June last year and to find a lasting settlement to the conflict between Iran and Iraq.</P>
    <P>They have supported the UN's efforts in Afghanistan in which Irish observers play a part.  They have called for an international conference under the auspices of the UN to discuss a lasting solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The violence in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip &mdash; which seems daily to become more worrying &mdash; should demonstrate to all that the situation is untenable and can only be resolved by the establishment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace based on the principles set out by the Twelve in the Venice and Brussels declarations.The situation in Lebanon has long been a source of preoccupation for the Twelve and has again deteriorated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> We, along with our partners in the Twelve, have appealed to all parties in the conflict to put an end to confrontation and to permit the emergence of a peaceful solution to the current crisis.  In this connection, the Twelve have reiterated their support for UNIFIL, in its operation in the south of that country.</P>
    <P>The transition to independence is finally under way in Namibia on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 435 and within the context of an agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.  Although the beginning of the transition process has been marred by terrible events, the process will now hopefully continue peacefully.  With our partners we have reiterated our unqualified support for the Secretary General and for UNTAG in which Ireland and most other EC member states are direct participants.  The evolution of events in Namibia will have an important influence on developments in South Africa.  We continue to advocate in EPC the maintenance of effective pressure on South Africa to take the necessary steps to bring about the dismantling of the apparatus of apartheid and the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the legitimate representatives of all the communities of that country.</P>
    <P>My remarks have only covered some of the developments during the period. Looking back over these years we can see that it has been a time of historic developments, both in terms of the relationship between the Twelve member states of the Community and also in the world as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is, however, in the realm of EastWest relations and disarmament that the most promising developments have occurred with the most immediate relevance for all mankind.  Some regional problems have been resolved or are on the way to resolution.  Ireland through its partnership in the Twelve will continue to play a constructive role in important international issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Ireland assumes the Presidency of the Council of <Col N="2024" /> Ministers on 1 January next.  Preparations are well under way to enable us to carry out a successful Presidency.  We have decided on many of the practical arrangements and are reviewing the development of the Community's agenda on an ongoing basis in order to draw up the priorities for the first six months of 1990.</P>
    <P>The Presidency is of vital importance. It will place Ireland in a key position next year, when we will be charged with presenting the Community's views on many key issues to its partners on the world stage.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to refer to the European Parliament.  The present Parliament holds its last session next month.  It has many achievements to record, for example, the Spinelli Draft Treaty from which the Single European Act emerged and its growing involvement in Community decision making.  We look forward to similar achievements by the new Parliament which will assemble in July and to co-operating closely with it, especially during our presidency.</P>
    <P>The new Parliament will be working with an almost new Commission.  President Delors had many historic achievements to record during the period of office of his first Commission.  I am sure that he will continue his achievements in his new term.  The Government have given major priority to their relationship with the Commission.  I am glad to say that we have established close and continuous links at the level of Taoiseach and President of the Commission and at all other levels.  This will enable us to ensure maximum co-operation not least during the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I would conclude, therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, by saying that we have seen during the period under review a set of inter-related developments in the European Community which have put it on a xsound footing to face the challenges of the coming decade.  It has been a period in which member states, including Ireland, renewed, through the Single European Act, their commitment to the ideals enshrined in the Treaties and, in this context, could I say that I welcome the <Col N="2025" /> broadening of the consensus regarding our participation in the European Community which has recently taken place in Irish political life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on cramming into a very short space of time what I would regard as a 35 minute or 40 minute speech and doing so in a very palatable fashion.  In relation to debates on the various reports which come before the House, like the Minister of State I believe they should be held much more regularly, thereby giving the impression to our own people that we are up to date with and really interested in what is going on in Europe.  We should not debate reports two or three years after their publication.  I note that the latest report has come on stream much quicker than previous reports and I hope that future reports on developments in the European Community come on stream even quicker so that we can debate the reports as near as possible to their publication date.</P>
      <P>The coming five years will probably prove to be the most exciting and most important period in the development of the European Community for many reasons.  The Community, relative to the United States, Japan, EFTA and other trading blocs, has a long way to go.  In believing that the Community has achieved a great deal to date and all we have to do is sit back and absorb the benefits, we are being quite insular in our thinking.  In fact, we have a long way to go, including the major trading powers within the Community, before we achieve, for instance, the income <i>per capita</i> that has been achieved already by the other trading blocs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have come to the conclusion that we have already achieved our goals and objectives but this is not the case and we need to keep that fact in mind.  To date we have not accured any of the benefits of the putting in place of the Single European Act.  Every Act of that nature has both its positive and negative sides.  As the benefits accure I hope we do not find that tariffs of one kind or another have not been removed or that <Col N="2026" /> tax or excise duties have not been harmonised.Failure to do so would leave us in the worst possible position.  On the one hand, there could be the doubtful benefits of competition and on the other we could be faced with the obstacle of not being able to compete on a level playing field. It is important to ensure that we get both sides of the coin, the downside as well as the upside.</P>
    <P>During the coming five years the Community will achieve new levels.  Development is going to accelerate at a speed hitherto unknown.  This will happen for a number of reasons and if it does not, something will have gone radically wrong.  An indicator is the interest being shown in developments within the Community by the other trading blocs, such as EFTA, the Eastern bloc countries, the United States and Japan.  There is a certain amount of curiosity and, greater than ever, benign interest being shown. Concern has also been expressed by a number of those trading blocs.  We can get an indication of the way the wind has been blowing from the GATT negotiations.The concern in some quarters was very well expressed there.</P>
    <P>The one good thing about all this is that we are part of the European group and sit at the negotiating table.  Far from having to negotiate alone in the world market, we are part of a large umbrella group who have the necessary clout, both economic and political, to achieve the kind of agreement and deal we deserve.  We should remember that in development terms, relative to other Community countries, Ireland lags behind.  We were behind to start with and in comparison with the other members of the Community we have not gained a great deal.  A great deal of ground had to be made up.</P>
    <P>Let us compare income <i>per capita</i> in the European Community with income <i>per capita</i> in the United States, Japan and the EFTA countries.  Oddly enough, the EFTA countries come out on top with, according to 1988 figures, an income <i>per capita</i> of US$19,000, followed by Japan and the United States.  One would have expected either Japan or the United <Col N="2027" /> States to be on top of the league but, because of their peculiar structure EFTA seem to have achieved a great deal more. If one looks at the way trade has developed between the EFTA countries and the European Community during the past five or six years, and the rate at which it is accelerating, one would readily recognise that the EFTA countries are showing a greater interest in the Community than in trading with another bloc. One or two of those countries are now thinking of much closer co-operation with the Community.  This is an indication that they see what we should be seeing more readily, that Europe is going to take off economically and politically and is going to be one huge success; likewise, the Eastern bloc countries, Hungary has already concluded its trade agreement with the Community and other progressive east European countries are showing an interest.  I use the word &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; advisedly as I honestly believe there is a sense of urgency in some of those countries to avail of the umbrella of <i>glasnost</i>&mdash; in the hope it will continue &mdash; and to establish economic links with the Community lest there be a change of opinion in other places.  That is a desirable development.  It is important that it take place and that there be that kind of economic co-operation and trading within Europe itself.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration.  With the removal of tariffs and various other barriers, trading with the Community becomes much easier because, instead of having to draw up 12 sets of papers in order to deal with each member state in the Community, an outside trading industry merely will have to draw up a single set of papers whereupon they can deal at a much more economic and convenient rate with the Community.</P>
    <P>The reverse of course, is true as has been found in dealing with Japan and the US.  The deficit which has grown from US $18 billion in 1987 and is now at US $22.79 billion, according to the Minister's speech, is a dangerous development in one sense and is a salutary warning to <Col N="2028" /> those countries within the Community because it has proved, and is proving as each day goes by, that the Japanese economy is very vibrant, efficient, progressive and moving forward fast, which is something the Community has not been doing.  In that area trade with Japan in future will have to be watched, otherwise the industries with whom the Japanese are likely to be competing in Europe will find some very stiff competition on their doorsteps.  The need for efficiency cannot be over-emphasised among those industries.I do not propose in the short time available to go through these industries in detail, but we can refer to the electronic and high technology industries in which the Japanese have been extremely successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that in the period we are now reviewing the finances of the Community came into order.  That is true.  The Delors Plan has set out in more ways than one the ground rules whereby the Community can move forward.  That is good because there was a certain indecision and lack of objectivity for a long number of years which led to the Community meandering, as it were, from one economic crisis to the next and not being able to come up with any conclusive or objective decisions.</P>
    <P>The only thing I am a little worried about in this agricultural country is that if one looks at graphs anywhere one sees the steady decline in employment in agriculture.  The flight from the land was never more obvious than at present.  It is not just in Europe or Ireland, it is a worldwide phenomenon. It seems to be part and parcel of development.Increasing standards of living and the affluent society seem to go hand in hand with the gradual diminution in employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that from the point of view of Irish agriculture &mdash; this is still essentially an agricultural country &mdash; supports that were there in the past will not always be there; quite the reverse.  Certain indicators, signposts, stabilisers, depending on which way you look at them, have now been introduced, the objective of which is to <Col N="2029" /> curb production in a couple of areas. For instance, milk and beef have been particularly hit and this will have a serious effect on our economy whether we like it or not.  It is part and parcel of EC policy and part of the policy within the GATT round, but there is also the question that this country, relatively speaking, does not contribute nearly as much to the creation of the surpluses as do some of our European partners.  To this day, quite an amount of those surpluses is being generated by the use of cheap substitute feedstuffs imported from the US which are used to produce efficiently products in the area of beef or milk but, at the same time, they are not producing a natural product in the sense we know it.  They are producing the product under artificial conditions, under battery unit type operations, and of course, the farmers get higher output and great efficiency. We will have to concentrate on producing a product by natural methods in a good, pollution free environment and being able to sell our products on the world market on that basis.  If we can do that, and we can, provided we emphasise it sufficiently, we can be very successful.</P>
    <P>Another area which is important for this country and for the rest of Europe is the future role of the Structural Funds, which has been referred to by the Minister and in the 31st Report &mdash; the size of the funds, where to apply them and the effect they are likely to have.  One question that must arise especially over the next five years, is whether jobs should be brought to the people or the people brought to the jobs.  People will say very quickly that you cannot bring every industry to the people.  You cannot bring industry from the Rhur in Germany to this country, for instance, but quite a number of large industries in Europe &mdash; in Germany in particular &mdash; want to relocate for one reason or another.  Some of them have relocated within Germany, and some have tried and got benefits to relocate.  Without doubt relocation is taking place.  If relocation is to take place we should be prepared to capitalise, particularly on high technology, light industries in electronics.  Some European <Col N="2030" /> companies wishing to expand could find it opportune, advisable and economically beneficial to locate in this country for a number of reasons. Greater use of the Regional Fund and the Social Fund to encourage that kind of relocation should be considered.</P>
    <P>Two points follow: in order to enable Irish workers to capitalise in that type of arena they must have another language. We have listened to the debate tonight and we recognise, albeit at a late stage, that the need to learn major continental languages was never greater than at present.  In a sense I should not say that because I have no language except the one I am now using and a little Irish.  It is a failing in a number of us that we do not have a continental language.  One is at a loss on the Continent for a number of reasons but particularly in terms of everyday trade when dealing with Germany, France, Italy and Spain, countries with large populations.</P>
    <P>There is a large market there, a large consumer force that needs to be tapped, and is waiting to be tapped.  To sell on that market we need to have the key that is most important, a common language. There is a great need for the Community to think seriously about relocating industry in a way that will be convenient for people, otherwise we will see the denuding in terms of population of large areas of the Community, and perhaps our country to an ever greater extent, unless there is greater emphasis on that type of relocation.  It is not possible to do that with every industry, but it is possible in the case of high technology, light industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with what is in the 31st Report in particular, EC-US relations and the GATT round.  We can take consolation from the fact that we are part of a population of 320 million people.  Whatever chance we would have in that kind of arena, we would have absolutely no chance outside it, trying to fight a case alone and trying to establish our rights among, for instance, the EFTA countries, Japan, the US and perhaps the East European countries.  It <Col N="2031" /> would be as well to forget about that area and to depend on our strength in numbers and in the European economy.  We must be good Europeans.  It is probably a state of mind.  The European elections will be held on 15 June and I sincerely hope that people of all political persuasions will become involved, come out to vote and express their opinion.  If they do not, it may well be that Europe will continue to look benignly upon us but they will not take us as seriously as we should be taken.  We cannot become as important as we should be within the Community unless our people actively pursue their democratic rights by participating in the election.</P>
    <P>There is much that one cannot cover in the course of a 20-minute contribution. The term of office of the Parliament to be elected in June will probably be the most important since the Treaty of accession.  The success of the Parliament and of the current Commission and the dealings of the Council of Ministers will be of such importance as to leave an indelible mark on the Community.  It will be referred to by historians in the future as the time of the most important development in the Community.  I hope the nation will appreciate the importance of being fully committed Europeans.  I believe the Government will continue to participate to the fullest extent within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity, the first in almost two years, to debate developments in the European Communities.  It is a strange comment on the priorities of the Government, however, that we could devote three sitting days to a debate on the Government's <i>National Development Plan</i> last week but only two hours tonight to considering eight reports on developments in the EC covering the period from July 1984 to January 1988.  This is a noteworthy comment on this House because it is happening at a time when, as the Minister of State has mentioned, 300 or so directives and regulations are being implemented almost daily in the run up <Col N="2032" /> to 1992.  When we consider in contrast all the domestic hype and window dressing about the so-called National Development Plan, it is not surprising that there are increasing reports emerging from Brussels about its credibility and its value as an integral part of the strategy for 1992.</P>
      <P>The first report on the Order Paper which we are discussing, the 24th is almost five years old.  The last report, the 31st, is 16 months out of date already. Only two of these reports &mdash; the 30th and 31st &mdash; cover the period of office of this Government.  They cover the period January to December 1987.  A point worth noting from these reports is that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, attended only one meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers in this period.  That was on 21 May 1987.  His Minister of State, Deputy Ger Connolly, attended the first Environment Council under this Government, on 19 and 20 March 1987.  But for the remainder of the year Ireland was represented at European Council and informal meetings of Ministers by the Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Environment or the Deputy Permanent Representative, Mr. Denis O'Leary.  I have no doubt that these officials represented Ireland well but the lack of attendance by the Minister for the Environment at such meetings makes this Government's claim that it is interested in environmental matters ring rather hollow.</P>
      <P>I note from the last report we are debating &mdash; the 31st &mdash; that, in this period, the European Council of Environment Ministers debated and accepted a Directive on the approximation of the laws of member states concerning the lead content of petrol and measures to be taken against air pollution from engine emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At another meeting when the responsible Minister was not present, the Environment Council reached agreement on a regulation concerning export from and import into the Community of certain dangerous chemicals.  This regulation introduced notification procedures in relation to the export of certain chemicals <Col N="2033" /> whose use within the Community was banned or strictly limited because of their effects on human health and the environment.More importantly, from Ireland's point of view, the Council held an exchange of views on the environmental problems created by dumping and incineration of waste at sea.</P>
    <P>There was no Irish Minister at this meeting, however, to make a case against the dumping of waste in the Irish Sea.  I hope that this point is taken into account when Fianna Fáil candidates are clamouring to express their concern about the environment, about the Irish Sea being the most polluted sea in the world, during the forthcoming European elections.  I also hope that the Minister's attendance record improved during the last year, for which we do not have reports.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the contents of these reports, which are out of date and superseded by the events leading up to 1992, I would like to draw the House's attention to a problem that the Progressive Democrats foresaw and warned against at the time of the Single European Act referendum.  It was our view, based on the legal advice that first identified the constitutional difficulties that arose in the Crotty case, that the wording eventually put to the people regarding the ratification of the Single European Act was too limited.  In view of the narrow nature of that wording, the Progressive Democrats believe that the Government must hold another referendum to permit Ireland to ratify two important Patent Conventions on the same day as the European elections on 15 June.  The Taoiseach expressed the view earlier today in the House that any constitutional difficulties could be circumvented, but I would remind the House that that was the precise Government thinking which eventually necessitated a constitutional amendment to ratify the Single European Act almost two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Patent Convention <Col N="2034" /> 1973, which Ireland has not ratified, and the Community Patent Convention, which Ireland has signed but not ratified, are matters not within the scope of &ldquo;necessitated obligations&rdquo; of our membership of the European Community and, accordingly, are not protected by the 1972 EEC amendment to the Constitution.We believe that failure to ratify these Conventions, which has often been raised on the Order of Business in the Dáil over the last year, by 1 August could have serious implications for at least one large employer in the chemical industry and will threaten employment in that industry.</P>
    <P>This issue, which Deputy McDowell highlighted on the Order of Business today, is not an obscure point of property law, as the Taoiseach seemed to suggest. It is of huge significance for Ireland in terms of employment and investment. Under the existing Irish law, patents have a normal maximum life of 16 years. Under the European Patent Convention, that life-span would be extended to 20 years.  As long as Ireland retains a 16 year patent, investment and development, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, would be jeopardised.  The IDA, the CII and the leaders of industry have demanded ratification of these conventions.</P>
    <P>For example, Smith Kline and French (Ireland) Ltd., is producing a drug called Tagamet used as treatment for ulcer patients.  Its market position depends on the patent for a particular chemical ingredient.  Without full ratification of the conventions, that patent will expire on 1 August this year thereby placing at risk a considerable number of jobs.  That company alone has an investment of £100 million in Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is needed immediately to preserve the legal situation in the short-term is legislation to extend patent lives to 20 years and a Bill to hold a referendum to ratify the conventions.  If a referendum, which we are advised is necessary, were held on 15 June, it would avoid the cost of a separate referendum.  On the other hand, if the European Patent Convention <Col N="2035" /> is not ratified or, if ratified, is found subsequently to be invalid constitutionally, the damage done to jobs in investment in Ireland could be enormous.</P>
    <P>We canvassed, at the time of the referendum on the Single European Act, for a broader type amendment to the Constitution which would have covered future conventions necessitated by our membership of the EC.  The Government ignored our advice at the time but the Taoiseach did undertake an examination of Article 29(4)(3) of the Constitution to see if a further referendum were required.  It is now time that the Government reported back to the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>A second matter not explored by these reports, because they are out of date, is the question of other European States applying for admission to the EC in the future.  The reports mention the accession of Spain and Portugal but the future enlargement of the Community is a vital matter affecting Ireland's interests in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>First, the Community may have reached a size at which its geographical and internal dimensions are such that when taken together they place an unreasonable strain on the treaties. There is a vast number of competing claims such as between various economic sectors and member states, as well as budgetary and social matters, that must be balanced and harmonised if the Community is to remain a viable and prospering entity for Ireland.  This has meant that we have had to become used to obtaining a smaller share of the resources available to us as a member of a group of Twelve as opposed to nine.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, therefore, we should give careful consideration to all future applications for membership of the EC.</P>
    <P>The second factor which must be borne in mind is that the issue of Austrian membership of the EC is likely to arise next year at a time when Ireland occupies the Presidency of the Council.  I was surprised that the Taoiseach did not refer to the prospect of Austrian membership &mdash; a country of neutral status &mdash; in his recent <Col N="2036" /> meeting with the Soviet President, Mr. Gorbachev, in his report to the House last week.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a question to the Taoiseach for tomorrow asking him if he raised the question of Austrian membership with President Gorbachev during his recent visit and if he can report whether the Soviet Union will continue to oppose any such application.  This is, after all, a matter over which the Taoiseach could have a major influence in 1990.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which we should be urging on the Government in the run-up to 1992.  We are already, for example, in default of the Draft Products Liability Directive since last July.  This would impose a strict liability regime in favour of consumers against the manufacturers of defective and harmful products.</P>
    <P>We should also amend the Trade Marks Act, 1963 to allow for service trademarks for the financial services sector.  At the moment, many companies in the financial services sector are disadvantaged because they do not have adequate protection for their logo or trademark.  This is a serious consideration for companies coming into the financial services sector in Dublin.  It would require only a slight change in the definitions section of the Trade Marks Act to legislate in this area.  There is another matter I would like to refer to.  It appears that many Departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, have developed a practice of implementing EC directives by way of circular and not statutory instrument.  This is not only unlawful, because of a decision of the European Court in 1980 which required that directives should be implemented by legislation or secondary legislation, but is also an illustration of shabby administrative practice and poor management in the run-up to 1992.</P>
    <P>This point was highlighted in the courts here last Friday.  In the case of Green v. the Minister for Agriculture, it was found that the method of implementing the headage payment scheme was found to be unconstitutional.  What plans, if any, <Col N="2037" /> do the Government have to rectify the implementation of the EC directive in this regard?</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to raise an important issue of institutional reform which will be a major plank in the Progressive Democrats' policy for the European elections in June.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of change in Irish politics initiated by the Progressive Democrats, we are advocating that Members of the European Parliament should be permitted to attend and contribute to Dáil debates and ask parliamentary questions on European affairs.  There is a strong case for this change in its own right to allow MEPs to address and appear in the Dáil.  This &ldquo;right of audience&rdquo; would allow them to do that.  They would not have the power to vote.</P>
    <P>This institutional reform would not require an amendment to the Constitution; merely all-party agreement to a change in the Standing Orders of the Dáil.  It would remove MEPs from the vacuum in which they all say they find themselves once they are elected to Europe.  They have no means of reporting back to their home parliaments.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats put a motion before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in late 1987 proposing that Standing Orders be amended to provide a right of audience to members of the European Parliament to permit them to raise parliamentary questions and contribute to debate on European matters in the Dáil; and proposing that such right be extended to members of the European Parliament from Northern Ireland on matters of mutual interest, North and South.  It was rejected by the bigger political parties at that time.</P>
    <P>As Chief Whip of the Progressive Democrats, I have tabled the same motion for discussion at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the run-up to the European elections.I am asking the other parties for their support for this initiative in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State to have debates on development within the EC every six <Col N="2038" /> months in this House.  It would be better in future if our elected MEPs also had an opportunity to give a European perspective to our deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about the series of six monthly reports that have been brought before the House this evening for a very short debate.  Like other Members of the House I am disappointed that we have such an accumulation of reports and that they are to be taken in a debate of a mere two hours.  The reports are sufficiently important to be debated on a six monthly basis as was originally intended.  It is indicative of our approach to such matters that not alone have we allowed a number of reports to accumulate but we have paid scant attention to other very worth-while reports about our involvement in Europe.  I refer to reports from the Joint Secondary Commission on European Legislation under the chairmanship this year of Deputy Gemma Hussey.  This committee meet frequently but receive very little exposure in the national media.  They have produced numerous reports and have done invaluable work on the directives as they affect us.  Yet the Seanad is the only House that has managed to debate them, at least during my term in this Dáil.  We should have all-party agreement to put in place the standard procedure whereby the six monthly reports from the EC would get a substantial amount of Dáil time and not be just an addendum to a long day's business so that Members of the House will have adequate opportunity to debate their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports are invaluable in keeping us abreast of developments in the Community.The Minister of State rightly marked as being significant the 1985 accession of Spain and Portugal.  I would like to pay a special tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, for the manner in which he, as President of the EC, was involved and totally immersed in the negotiations leading to the accession of those two countries.  He can take the lion's share of the credit for the enlargement of the Community and <Col N="2039" /> for bringing into the Community two very valuable components and creating a greater sense of unity and cohesion within the mainland of Europe.</P>
    <P>I note too that the Minister mentioned the Single European Act.  In this regard I pay a very special tribute to former Senator Jim Dooge for the manner in which he pioneered and chaired a committee that was mainly responsible for getting the Single European Act on the agenda.  We recall with a certain amount of dismay now the manner in which it has been embraced by all sides of the House. On reflection we remember that the present Government, then in Opposition, threw up every single kind of obstacle in relation to the taking on board of the Single European Act.  It was supposed to be a threat to our sovereignty; it posed all kinds of sinister threats to this country and yet when the matter came before the House it was accepted and today it is a coherent, integrated, valuable part of the Government's economic strategy.</P>
    <P>The national plan was alluded to by the Minister.  In terms of significance for this country, the recommendation that we take on board the revision of the Structural Fund, integrated programmes and the new developments within the European Community have been by far the most significant beacon on the horizon for this country.  I am particularly disappointed, as are many of the people on the public thoroughfares, that the national plan which was going to be the rocket that would launch us into a greater European Community is not, in terms of input, content, or thrust, anything like the rocket we anticipated.  It was to be the rocket that was going to give us a new momentum, and that was going to bring us a greater sense of economic equality with the other member states but what was going to be the massive rocket launch turned out to be a damp squib.</P>

      <P>If you ask anybody in the street what it means, very few of them <Col N="2040" /> see it as offering us the great possibility of economic dynamism that is needed to bring us into the mainstream of Europe, to raise our standard of living or to put in place a solid economic base that will ensure that the type of economic traumas that we are now going through will never be repeated in the future.  Like other Members of the House I am very disappointed that it did not address the software that is needed to give the economy the necessary mechanisms to adjust, to adapt and to meet the challenges of the future.  I am sorry it did not address the problem of a revision of our PAYE system, of our VAT system or indeed other areas of taxation in order to make it far easier for exporters to perform within the economy.  I am also extremely disappointed, as other Members of the House and as people outside are, that in relation to giving us the necessary linguistic competence, this area has been virtually totally ignored within the ambit of the plan.</P>
      <P>When we look at the general education system, with particular reference to languages, we notice that the vast majority of post-primary schools teach only one language &mdash; French &mdash; that the number of schools that teach a dual continental language is minimal indeed and that in terms of linguistic competence many teachers feel incapable of meeting the challenges of oral language teaching. When we look at the number of language laboratories, at the scarcity of audiovisual or audio-lingual facilities and at the general level of oral proficiency in continental languages when one comes off the leaving cert conveyor belt, in terms of integrating into the greater European Community, in terms of looking for jobs on the Continent and in terms of doing ourselves justice abroad, we are very much second rate as regards our linguistic ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when literally thousands of graduates with BAs and BComms are walking the streets of London, Brisbane and Boston, we should seriously think of involving them to a greater extent in the European Community.  They should be sent abroad into teaching environments. <Col N="2041" /> There should be teacher exchanges and other programmes on the Continent in order to give them the linguistic confidence to be able to master the language. We should bring them back here and ensure that we devote ourselves to the better management and more proficient use of continental languages.</P>
    <P>I look at the Continent of Europe as providing us with an ideal opportunity of absorbing the greater workforce that we are not able to accommodate within this country who unfortunately in many cases have to go west rather than east.  If we could achieve the necessary linguistic competence and if we could give our people the necessary skills in terms of German, French, Spanish and Italian, these people would be able to look with a greater degree of confidence to job opportunities in Germany.  We know that the Germans in particular welcome Irish apprentices, graduates and labourers and that these people integrate very well and adapt to the German way of life.  After all, Germany is the motor of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The national plan also has been most remiss in terms of addressing the job situation.  When one considers that there are 243,000 people out of work at present, that it is predicted that 40,000 people will emigrate this year and that over 20,000 people will do the leaving certificate in June with little real chance of a long term employment opportunity in this country, the modest target of between 29,000 and 35,000 jobs per annum is extremely inadequate in relation to addressing the unemployment problem in this country.  In this regard I do not care what anybody says in relation to the main components of the economy, whether in terms of a growth rate of 3 per cent, of keeping inflation down at 3 per cent, of having a surplus this year again on our balance of trade or in relation to the overall economic situation in the country, while we might put in place the nuts and bolts of the economy there is no buzz out there.  Nothing is happening and the national plan, which is very much contained within the reports by way of recommendation, does little to <Col N="2042" /> give us the necessary thrust and momentum to put ourselves into a combative and competitive position for the nineties and the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on the various reports. I believe, as I have said before, that we should unanimously agree across the board that we will never allow a situation to arise again in which four years' reports will be taken in one fell swoop at the end of a long and tiring day's business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to thank the three Deputies who took part in the debate and to express my concern also at the very limited participation in the debate this evening.  That we had two hours to debate this matter and we are going to finish almost an hour earlier shows that lack of interest by some people in the debate, particularly by two political parties one of whose deputy leader and the other of whose leader are standing as candidates for the European elections.  This shows scant regard for what all of us here tonight feel is a very important debate.  I would agree with all three Deputies in relation to the delays in the publication and the debating of these reports.  It is an improvement that the report for the first half of 1988 has now gone to the printers and work has already started on the report for the second half of 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan is quite correct when he says that the next five years will be the most exciting development period within the European Community.  Of course we would all agree that the Community has a long way to go.  There is tremendous interest now in the Community from outside the member states, whether you are talking about EFTA, the US, Japan or indeed the COMECON countries.  That is because of the single European market and the fact that, to many of them, it represents a type of fortress Europe. Those of us who have been involved in promotions in any of these countries have been at pains to point out that we are not talking about building a fortress Europe. We welcome the great interest there is in <Col N="2043" /> what is seen as a huge economic bloc of more than 320 million people which has the kind of clout that is necessary when dealing with economies such as the US and Japan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan suggested that the finances of the EC have been put into order and described that as a good thing. As the person who represented Ireland on the budget Council since 1987 it is a great relief to me that the finances have been put into order because we have left behind us Council meetings that went on until 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. without a break.  The achievement in regard to the finances is a tribute to the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors.  He ensured that he got agreement from all member states to get the finances of the Community on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan is correct in saying that agricultural production has been curbed, that we have a new milk and beef regime which we do not like.  Ireland has made the point of all meetings of the Agricultural Council that as a small country we have not contributed as much to the surpluses as have other member states. We have the natural attribute, referred to by Deputy Durkan, of a clean environment.I agree that we have to protect it and ensure that it stays clean.  We should market produce from here on that basis.  Some companies have done that successfully.  If they can do that abroad and beat the best of competition in Europe into second place than all our companies can do the same if they put their minds to it.  In the run up to 1992 it is important, as all political parties have been suggesting, that companies are put on that footing because otherwise, they will not have a chance of survival.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the relocation of industry from central Europe here.  He was correct in saying that we should use the Structural Funds but, in particular, the Regional and Social Funds to encourage some of those industries to establish factories here on the periphery of the Community.  One of our biggest problems, particularly in the west where Deputy Higgins and I come from, has <Col N="2044" /> been our infrastructure.  It was very difficult for the IDA to attract industries to that region.  It is important that the Regional Fund be used to bolster the infrastructure, and create new infrastructure where that is possible.  When a group as large as the CIGNA Corporation decide to locate in a small town in the west of Ireland we realise the tremendous advantages we have from the point of view of modern tele-communications.We should build on that advantage and encourage such industries to locate here.</P>
    <P>The Social Fund should be used for training purposes, to help university graduates, those who have graduated from the RTCs, VECs or apprentices from FÁS embark on further training courses so that they can take up the positions that will be available to them when industries relocate from central Europe.</P>
    <P>All Members, and I am as guilty as anybody else, refer to the importance of continental languages for our young people but as politicians we should be taking some positive steps to improve our language ability.  The House has been very successful in recent years in promoting the use of the Irish language. Many changes have taken place in the House among Members and the staff, in regard to the use of Irish and a great effort is being made by people on all sides to use whatever bit of Irish they have and improve on it.  I suggest to the Ceann Comhairle, as the person responsible for the House and as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that he should consider holding classes in continental languages, particularly French and German, for Members.  I am sure many Members are genuinely interested in improving their knowledge of a continental language.  The business community in some parts of the country have given a lead in regard to that.  For example, the Chamber of Commerce in Galway started a language class at the beginning of the year, for one hour in the morning before business people went to work, to foster a knowledge of German. It has proved so successful that an advanced course in German is being <Col N="2045" /> offered.  Courses in French are also being offered.  We should encourage such development throughout the country. We can succeed if we put our minds to it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need for us to be good Europeans.  Some of us are accused of being too good as Europeans. However, it is important that we should emphasise at every opportunity that Ireland is fully committed to the European Community.  That occurred in the referendum on whether we should join the Community and at the time of the referendum on the Single European Act. I share, with Deputies Kennedy and Durkan, concern about the European elections in June.  All politicians agree that there is a certain amount of apathy among the general public in regard to the European elections.  We must attack that in the coming weeks.  The European Parliament up to now was seen as an institution that was far removed from the country and with very little influence on what was happening at home.  We are all aware that the parliament has increased powers and is more involved in decision making within the Community.  The role of the next parliament in steering through the policies brought forward by the Commission and the Council of Ministers, will be exceptionally important.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Kennedy in relation to members of the European Parliament being permitted to contribute to debates in the House.  All our political parties are committed to ensuring that as far as possible we should not have a dual mandate and because of that we should consider how we can involve our MEPs in debates in the House.  Fianna Fáil MEPs have been pushing that view with me in the last two years.  They see themselves as being isolated from what is happening on the political front at home and they would like to have a forum where they could contribute to a debate.  They have put forward a suggestion that the Seanad might be an appropriate forum.  We should give consideration to this and representatives of all political parties <Col N="2046" /> should try to find a way, with the co-operation of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, of solving this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the Minister for the Environment but as he is well able to defend himself I have no intention of defending him this evening.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Kennedy that I will bring her remarks in relation to his attendance at meetings of the Council of Ministers to his attention.  I have no doubt that he will be delighted to respond to those comments.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the difficulties that the European Patents Convention creates for us.  The appropriate legislation is with the draftsman and the Whips office is putting pressure on to get it into the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the position of states outside the European Community applying for membership.  I attended an EFTA meeting in Austria some months ago and I discovered that there was a great interest in the European Community, particularly in regard to 1992 and what that will mean.  I have no doubt that very shortly there will be a formal application from Austria to join the Community.</P>
      <P>The business community in Sweden are most anxious about and are engaged in a fairly vigorous debate in relation to their country's position after 1992.  I think there is a realisation within the EFTA States in particular that very little fruitful consideration can be given any application from another State until after 1992.  It is felt that all of the attention and deliberations of the Community up to 1992 will concentrate on the creation of a single market and all that goes with that.  The Austrians in particular are very appreciative of that fact.</P>
      <P>I understand that the product liability legislation is with the draftsman and is at an advanced stage of preparation.  It is hoped to introduce that legislation perhaps before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> Deputy Jim Higgins talked at length about the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> on which we had a three day debate last week, so I referred to it very briefly only in the course of my remarks.</P>
    <P>The European Community is going into high gear for the future.  We shall see many developments take place very quickly with the process <i>vis-á-vis</i> the internal market being speeded up considerably. The next five years, particularly the next European Parliament, will be one of the most, if not the most, important Parliament since the European Parliament was established.  Therefore, I would go along with what Deputies were saying, in encouraging our people to come out as they did when the referenda on occassion and on the Single European Act were held, and re-establish that great commitment of Irish people to the European Community.</P>

      <P>Following the Chernobyl accident, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) agreed a Convention on early notification of a nuclear accident.  The Convention provides for notification of the IAEA in the event of an accident which has resulted, or may result in a transboundary <Col N="1835" /> release which could be of radiological significance, and has been signed by 70 States including Ireland.  The IAEA has procedures in place to notify first affected States and then all States.  The EC acceded to the IAEA Convention, and also set up a separate Community system of rapid exchange of information in cases of abnormal levels of radioactivity or of a nuclear accident.  An effective bilateral arrangement in respect of incidents in the UK also operates independently of the foregoing.  These are the main international arrangements which ensure that we will have early warning of an accidental release.</P>
      <P>In addition to these arrangements, the national emergency plan for radiological emergencies provides for a national gamma dose rate monitoring system which will give immediate warning of any abnormal rise in radiation levels.

This system will be fully operational in a few months.</P>

      <P>The operation of the compulsory offtake regime for refined product by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation does not give rise to significant additional costs to the final consumer in the Irish market. In addition, as pointed out in a previous reply to the Deputy, in the light of Whitegate's performance since 1982 and given the characteristics and performance of the Irish oil distribution sector in the same period, it cannot be argued that the offtake regime, of itself, creates a high cost environment for petrol and oil products in the economy.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has, on several occasions over the last two years, requested the participation of the INPC in an examination by the committee of their affairs.  While successive Ministers for Energy and the corporation have been most anxious to facilitate the wishes of the committee, certain issues which would be examined by the committee are <i>sub judice</i> and it was, and is, considered unlikely that they could be dealt with without prejudice to the interests of the State.</P>

In November 1985 President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl created the EVP as a Franco-German initiative in the first place.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Presidency of the European Communities involves major responsibilities for members of the Government and for the Irish administration as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will assume the Presidency of the European Council, which will meet in Dublin Castle in June 1990. As Minister for Foreign Affairs I will take the Chair in General Affairs Councils and 11 other Ministers will chair meetings of the Council concerned with their areas of responsibility.  Altogether we expect approximately 37 meetings of the Council to take place in Brussels and Luxembourg during the period of the office of our Presidency.  In addition, a small number of informal meetings of Ministers will take place in Ireland.  At official level approximately 200 committees and working groups come under the aegis of the Council and Ireland will be called upon to provide chairpersons as well as national spokesmen for all of these.</P>
      <P>In the area of European Political Co-operation, I will preside at three ministerial meetings and officials of my Department will chair meetings of the Political Committee and of 21 working groups.</P>
      <P>It will be our task during the Presidency to determine the agenda for all these meetings, to lead the discussions and to do everything in our power to achieve agreement on the various issues at hand, so that the business of the Community is effectively discharged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers will also have significant <Col N="1847" /> responsibilities associated with the European Parliament, which, under the Single European Act, has been accorded an enhanced role in the Community's operations.It is our intention to maintain close co-operation with the Parliament during the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency will, of course, continue to maintain the close relations which we have already established with the Commission &mdash; a relationship which we could regard as essential to the success of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the Presidency extend to other areas also.  The duty of co-ordinating and expressing the position of the Community and of the Twelve in various international fora including the UN, the OECD, the GATT, the ILO and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will also fall to Ireland, as will the role of acting as spokesperson for the Twelve in contacts with third countries.</P>
    <P>The duties of the Presidency require a thorough knowledge of the subject matter involved in the various issues and the requisite skills, including language skills, to prepare and conduct the meetings in an efficient manner.  My Department, and the other Departments involved, are taking the necessary steps to ensure that officials entrusted with the tasks of Chairmanship are well able to perform the duties required of them.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of preparation are well in hand.  These include the compilation of the calendar of meetings, arrangements for the deployment of the necessary staff, and the provision of conference accommodation, transport and other facilities in respect of those meetings which will be held in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not feel it necessary to set out the internal co-ordination arrangements which are in place for the running of the Presidency.  The Deputy will understand from what I have already indicated that co-ordinated preparation for the successful conduct of our Presidency is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Finally as regards policy priorities, these are under ongoing review but I am <Col N="1848" /> sure the Deputy will appreciate that with two Presidencies to be completed before Ireland takes the Chair, it would be both premature and inappropriate to announce our intentions at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>There are four products containing Daminozide which can be legally marketed under the terms of the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations. Only two of these products are currently on sale in this country under the product names Alar and Dazide.  Under the EC Regulations, my Department cannot ban any of the products until evaluation of dossiers submitted as applications for clearance to place on the market is completed.The results of studies currently under way are an integral part of this evaluation.  While these products can be used on apples and pears, my information is that they are little if at all used on food crops in this country but are mainly used on ornamental horticultural products.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the US Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ban Daminozide in May 1989 but the ban would not take effect before the spring of 1990, pending the results of ongoing studies.  This matter is also under examination by the EC Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime contact is being made with the distributors of the products about the desirability of discontinuing sales or selling only for specific purposes <Col N="1850" /> pending the final outcome of tests.  My Department is asking Teagasc to formulate a suitable advice programme for growers as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The person concerned appealed the disallowance of disability benefit following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case has now been referred to an appeals officer for determination.The appeals officer will indicate shortly if he proposes to hold an oral hearing of the appeal.  If he does the person concerned will be notified of the arrangements as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of disability benefit appeals where the claimant had been found to be capable of work by a medical referee of the Department it is the practice to <Col N="1856" /> arrange for a second examination by a different medical referee before the case is submitted to the appeals officer.  Where a claimant is found to be incapable of work following the second examination benefit is immediately restored. However, if the opinion of the second medical referee agrees with the first then the claimant is afforded an opportunity to state the grounds on which he or she wishes to base the appeal.</P>
    <P>This foregoing process takes some time to complete.  Notwithstanding constraint on resources every effort is made to ensure that appeals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Decisions on appeals are statutorily the function of appeals officers who have the discretion to either decide a case summarily or hold an oral hearing.  The Minister has no function in this.  The appeals officers have 151 disability benefit cases on hands which are awaiting oral hearings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following investigation of his means, his claim was disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish full particulars of his means, he had failed to show that his yearly means did not exceed <Col N="1858" /> the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate from 3 February 1989. The statutory limit in his case is £4,368.00 per annum.</P>
    <P>He appealed against the decision on 15 February 1989 and his case has been referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries in connection with his appeal.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 11 April 1987 following an examination by a medical referee who considered him to be capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 11 April 1987 to 27 November 1987 &mdash; the date of the latest medical certificate before him at that time.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the equality legislation increases in social welfare payments in respect of adult dependants are provided in respect of a spouse whether male or female who is living with and dependent on the recipient.  A spouse in employment or self-employment or in receipt of a social welfare payment in his or her own right is not a dependant.  However regulations provide that a working spouse whose earnings are under £50 a week continues to be regarded as a dependant.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that a spouse doing a small amount of work is not debarred from being an adult dependant on their spouse's claim.  In view of the purpose of the limit it is not considered necessary that it be increased automatically on an annual basis or otherwise.  It will, however, be reviewed from time to time in the light of increases in the general level of earnings and other relevant factors.</P>

On Monday 6 March 1989, the group of students referred to by the Deputy was selected for customs examination in the Green Channel at Shannon Airport. Thirteen students were found to be ineligible on age grounds and were advised that the tobacco products and alcoholic beverages in their possession could only be cleared on payment of the appropriate import charges.  One student paid the charges.  In the remaining 12 cases, the goods were detained and will be released on payment of the appropriate import charges.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the great <Col N="1865" /> work being done by the Young Ireland Movement in the promotion of Irish goods through the second level education system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the European Court ruling of 24 November 1982 in the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; case.  The court ruled that the Guaranteed Irish campaign and other measures to promote Irish goods, all operated by the Irish Goods Council, were in breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome and that the State, by virtue of its funding of the IGC, was in breach of the treaty.  The IGC was obliged to cease its involvement in the Guaranteed Irish campaign and Guaranteed Irish Ltd. was established as a private sector company with no State involvement or funding.  As a result of the court ruling, unfortunately, the Government are not in a position to provide funding to any activities directed towards the promotion of Irish goods.</P>
      <P>An application from the Young Ireland Movement for entry into the youth service grant scheme funded through the Department of Education is currently under consideration.  Subject to their recognition as a <i>bona fide</i> youth organisation within the definition of the entry conditions of the scheme it may be possible, budgets permitting, to provide funding through this channel.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the organisation is also constantly involved in raising funds from the private sector and I wish them continuing success in their endeavours in this regard.  The professional advice and guidance of the State agencies is, of course, always available to Young Ireland.</P>

      <P>Only a token sum of £5,000 is <Col N="1874" /> provided at subhead G.1(v) of my Department's Vote under the heading &ldquo;Environmental and Community Works&rdquo; towards the provision of community centres on non-Gaeltacht islands. This is because no applications for such grants have been made in recent years. Assistance for centres on Gaeltacht islands is a matter for Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 221 of 12 April, 1989 for details of the 1989 capital allocation to each county council for their housing construction programme.  The estimated number of housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; in 1989 by each county council is set out in the schedule which is being circulated with the Official Report and which also gives for each council the percentage variation in the 1989 capital allocations and &ldquo;starts&rdquo; compared with 1988.</P>
      <P>The 1989 capital allocations to individual housing authorities were determined, within the overall Public Capital Programme provision for local authority housing, on the basis of estimated expenditure in 1989 on (1) commitments on their existing programme at 31 December, 1988 and (2) new work approved for commencement this year having regard to relative housing needs returned by the housing authorities as at 31 December, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of local authority housing needs is a matter for each housing authority in accordance with section 9 of <Col N="1875" /> the Housing Act, 1988.  Housing authorities have been directed to make their <Col N="1876" /> initial assessment to establish their housing needs as at 30 September, 1989.</P>

      <P>The plans for the development of psychiatric services in County Roscommon involve the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at the County Hospital, Roscommon.  This unit is expected to open in mid 1989 at which stage routine admissions to St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea will cease.  I have provided the necessary capital resources to enable this unit to be completed.  The provision of alternative facilities for other categories of patients, including psycho-geriatric patients, currently in St. Patrick's Hospital, is the subject of discussions between the Western Health Board and officers of my Department.  In the interim, services essential to the requirements of patients will continue to be provided in St. Patrick's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The future use of the land at St. Patrick's Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board as part of its estate management policy. I am in agreement with the board's proposals regarding the use of funds derived from the sale of lands at St. Patrick's Hospital towards the capital costs arising from the development of the alternative facilities referred to above.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the work undertaken by the centre referred to by the Deputy.  I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board and I have been informed that as the board is concentrating on developing its own statutory based services, it is unlikely to be in a position to provide the centre with financial assistance.The centre has made an application to my Department for a grant from the national lottery.  It is being considered in the light of the many competing demands for assistance from the national lottery.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.  In line with the best international practices, it is my policy that people with mental handicap should enjoy as normal a life as possible in a setting appropriate to their individual needs and that services would be developed to allow them to remain in their own community for as long as is possible.  To achieve this, the following services have been developed to cater for the needs of individuals at different stages of their lives:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Assessment and Early Intervention Services.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Special Schools-Special Classes.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Day Care Units.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Vocational Training Units.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Long-term Training Centres.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Hostels and Houses in the Community.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Residential Centres which would cater in the main for persons with severe handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with this policy the development of community-based services and the transfer of people inappropriately placed <Col N="1883" /> in large residential centres is an ongoing process in each region.</P>

      <P>No proposals have been received from the North-Western Health Board in relation to the future of Cloonamahon. My Department, however, are aware that the board are considering the coordinating and development of the mental handicap services in the North-Western Health Board area and fully support the board in this objective.  I am satisfied that the thrust of what is being considered is in the best interests of the persons catered for by these services and is in line with the best international practices.The developments will lead to a big extension of community services.</P>
      <P>At 31 December 1988 the Cloonamahon Centre catered for 100 residents and 16 day attenders.  Their ages and degree of handicap is outlined in the following tables.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that only one person is employed by the South-Eastern Health Board to deal with payments under the drugs refund scheme in Wexford; that claimants are experiencing up to three months' delay in payments of drugs refunds due to them; and if his Department can take steps to ensure that this situation is improved in view of the hardship caused by such long delays.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 <Col N="1886" /> together.  The local administrations of the drugs refund scheme is a matter for the appropriate health board.  The average waiting period for refunds under the drug refund scheme in the South-Eastern Health Board area is 5-6 weeks, broadly in line with the national situation, though I am aware of particular delays occurring in Wexford.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the South-Eastern Health Board have a total of five staff administering the scheme within the board's functional area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there can be particular problems for patients with ongoing chronic long-term conditions who are dependent on the present scheme.  It was with these patients in mind that the Government adopted my proposals for the introduction of a new drug cost subsidisation scheme which will relieve continuous users of the refund scheme of the burden associated with substantial initial cash outlays in the purchase of prescription drugs and medicines.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> All figures cited refer to whole-time equivalent numbers employed at June 1988.</P>
    <P>All non-specialist social workers provide a range of services to different client groups, where appropriate, including the elderly.  Thus it is not possible to precisely identify the numbers working with the elderly at any given time.  In addition, certain health boards retain community workers to deal specifically with the problems of the elderly.</P>

      <P>The number of acute health board and public voluntary hospitals in 1987 was 73; in 1988 the figure was 66.  A number of the hospitals in question amalgamated in the period of changed designation from acute to long-stay.</P>
      <P>The number of in-patients treated in such acute hospitals in 1987 was 497,717 compared with approximately 482,854 in 1988.  A valid comparison of these figures must take account of the changes in clinical medicine and the increasing tendency to provide acute services on a day care basis, where appropriate.  In 1987 there were 88,405 day cases treated which increased to 101,804 in 1988.  The number of out-patients treated increased from 1,528,365 in 1987 to 1,579,240 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The allocations made to each hospital are as set out in the following schedules.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the plans he has for the co-ordination and rationalisation of acute hospital services in the Cork urban area, as stated by him in Dáil Éireann on 19 May 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In my statement of 19 May 1987 I mentioned the urgent need in Cork for better co-ordination between the voluntary hospitals and between the voluntary hospitals and the health board.  A group was established in 1988 to increase co-ordination between the Southern Health Board, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital.  The purpose of the discussions is to ensure the closest possible co-operation between the three general hospitals and the most effective organisation of services.</P>
      <P>The group which is chaired by an official of this Department and includes representatives of the voluntary hospitals and the Southern Health Board has examined the organisation of accident and emergency services, cost containment measures and improving hospital services for the elderly.  As a result of the group's work changes have been made to the organisation of accident and emergency services, the hospitals are co-operating on cost saving methods and plans are being prepared for a specialist geriatric service in the voluntary hospitals.</P>

Circular 10/67, which <Col N="1896" /> originally issued in March 1967, was recently re-issued to national schools.  In relation to the promotion of pupils, it states &ldquo;The normal procedure should be that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year.  There may be cases, however, where the principal teacher feels that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year in a class.  In regard to such cases it is felt that by reference to educational principles they should be minimal; that no pupil should be held back for longer than one year throughout his/her national school career, and that usually the retention of a pupil in a class for a second year should take place only in the third or fourth standard.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  It is the ongoing policy of my Department to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in the education sector. A working group monitors and co-ordinates activities within the Department relating to equality of educational opportunity for girls and boys.</P>
      <P>2.  The need to avoid sexism and sex-stereotyping in schools continues to be stressed at in-service courses for teachers and school principals organised by the Department &mdash; a module on &ldquo;Sexism and Sex-Stereotyping in Primary Education&rdquo; was included in all in-service courses for primary teachers organised by inspectors in Summer 1988.  The matter is also generally raised at discussions with the principal and staff prior to submission by the inspector of a school report.  A total of 736 school reports were furnished in the school year 1986-87 and 607 in 1987-88.</P>
      <P>3.  Issues relating to gender equity continue to be covered generally in in-service courses for post-primary teachers as well as specific seminars and courses being organised in this area.</P>
      <P>4.  In 1986 the previous Government spent only £24,000 on equality programmes in the education sector.</P>
      <P>5.  In 1987 a total of £60,000 approx. was spent on the following programmes:</P>
      <P>(a)  EC Action Programme to promote equal opportunities for girls and boys in education and which had, as its theme, &ldquo;Equal Opportunities for Girls and Boys in Education&rdquo;.  Travel prizes, consisting of a week's stay in Brussels, were awarded by the Commission to the four winning entrants from Ireland. They travelled to Brussels in September where they had an opportunity to meet prize-winners from Spain, Portugal and Greece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  An Action-Research Project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in <Col N="1898" /> school activities related to the new technologies.</P>
    <P>This project was grant-aided by the EC.  The cost to the Department in 1987 of the EC assisted projects at (a) and (b) above was approximately £21,000.</P>
    <P>(c)  Pilot intervention projects in physics and in chemistry were extended in September 1987, to include six regions.  In the year 1986-87 four schools had been involved in the projects, the aim of which is to encourage more girls in senior-cycle second-level education to study the physical sciences.  Expenditure on these projects in 1987 was £29,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>(d)  A programme to provide grants for mature women students is operated by my Department.  Grants of £1,000 each are awarded to ten mature women students who have already completed at least one year of a higher level course and who are either unemployed or in poor financial circumstances.  The total cost of the scheme was £10,000 in 1987.</P>
    <P>6.  In 1988 in addition to the £10,000 allocated for grants to mature women students a total of £54,000 approximately was allocated to fund the following equality projects.</P>
    <P>(a)  The Action Research Project initiated in 1987 to stimulate interest and encourage girls to participate in school activities related to the new technologies was continued in 1988. Four schools representative of the main kinds of second level schools are involved in the project.  The cost in 1988 to the Department was approximately £12,000.</P>
    <P>(b) The Pilot Intervention Projects in physics and in chemistry was extended to ten regions for the 1988-89 school year.  The cost of these projects to the Department in 1988 was £42,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>7.  In 1988 both of the above projects were monitored by experienced evaluators.In evaluating the Action <Col N="1899" /> Research Project a combination of techniques was adopted in conducting the evaluation including:</P>
    <P>(i)  Pre and post-questionnaire surveys of pupils in the project and of matching groups of control pupils (usually in non-project schools).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Interviews were carried out with the parents of some of the participating pupils.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A questionnaire survey of all teachers in the four project schools.</P>
    <P>The evaluation strategy used by the evaluators of the Pilot Intervention Projects in physics and in chemistry included:</P>
    <P>(i)  study of documentation (Department reports, etc.) available;</P>
    <P>(ii)  classroom observation and inspection of facilities;</P>
    <P>(iii)  unstructured interviews with school principals, teachers and pupils;</P>
    <P>(iv)  questionnaire survey of pupils and teachers.</P>
    <P>8.  In 1989 a total of £115,000 approximately will be allocated to the following equality programmes:</P>
    <P>(i)  Programme of Grants for Mature Women Students;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Action Research Project Programme as for 1988;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Pilot Intervention Projects in physics and in chemistry as for 1988;</P>
    <P>(iv)  Pre and inservice teacher training projects in the primary and post-primary sectors.  The agencies co-operating with the Department of Education in the implementation of these projects are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra, Dublin.</P>
    <P>(b)  Thomond College of Education.</P>
    <P>(c)  Department of Education, University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> (d)  Teachers' Union of Ireland.</P>
    <P>(v)  Research project to examine aspects of gender equality in primary and post-primary education.</P>
    <P>Projects at (ii), (iii) and (iv) will qualify for EC funding in 1989.</P>
    <P>9.  A working group on the elimination of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials has been established in 1988 at primary level representative of the Department of Education, school management, the INTO and the National Parents' Council.  Its terms of reference are to examine the level of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials, to make recommendations for its elimination on a phased basis taking due account of the need for restraint in public expenditure and to monitor progress in the area.  The working group has carried out an examination of the guidelines for publishers in this area, has made a study of the course in conversational Irish and is also examining the research available on the topic of sexism in teaching materials.  A proposal will be submitted to the equality committee in my Department shortly.</P>
    <P>10.  The continued evaluation and monitoring of the above projects and in particular the findings of the research project at (v) above will be used to formulate future plans and strategies to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in the Irish Education system.  In addition, the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment have been required to ensure that sexism and sex-stereotyping be eliminated from school curricula and that such curricula prepare pupils for their future roles in society.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department attend meetings in Brussels which are convened by the EC to discuss equality issues in education and to formulate plans and strategies for the Council of Ministers.  In this way my Department can significantly influence developments in this area and ensure that the output from the Irish education sector can fully avail of the <Col N="1901" /> opportunities which will be theirs in a post-1992 Europe.</P>
