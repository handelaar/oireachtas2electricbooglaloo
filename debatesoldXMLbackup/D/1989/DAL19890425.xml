      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has satisfied himself that the quality of air traffic control in Irish statutory air space is satisfactory and that there is no danger to the public as a result of the increased volume of air traffic; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to accommodate the projected increase in air traffic volume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 19, 23 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1986 there has been a tremendous increase, both here and in Europe, in aviation activity.  That increase, when seen as advances in tourism, business and in the whole Irish economic climate, is most welcome.  Inevitably the increased air traffic has strained staff resources, particularly in the Air Traffic Control Service.  I am fully aware of the position and I am glad to say that arrangements are being made for the induction of a substantial number of staff into the service. My objective is to ensure that there are adequate staff numbers available for training, to deal with this traffic level and to cope with future expansion.  I have seen and regret the alarmist references to the lack of radar cover at Dublin Airport. The radar at Dublin, at times, is subject <Col N="6" /> to meteorological clutter.  The phenomenon is well known to controllers, who have procedures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In addition to replenishing staff resources, I must also mention that there is also a major equipment replacement programme under way.  That programme, at a cost of £30 million, is to replace the radar, communications, instrument landing and navigational aids in the country.  The new radar for Dublin, a high quality modern system that is used throughout Europe, will be in place by the end of this year or early next year and will not be subject to meteorological clutter.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the growth in air traffic is not confined to this country.  In Europe, there are now major difficulties arising from shortages of staff, equipment, organisation, procedures and airspace to handle the present volume of traffic.  As a result air traffic throughout Europe is being restricted to maintain the safety of the overall system.  These restrictions, I regret to say, will encompass this country causing delay and disruption of air traffic. Naturally, every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>I recognise the concern of Deputies and the public generally with safety issues.  Safety is the cornerstone of the air traffic control system.  To ensure that safety standards are maintained, the volume of air traffic in the system is regulated to match control resources.  The House may be assured that safety is my first priority and, while there is no room for complacency, I am satisfied that the Irish ATC system operates to the required standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that he agrees with the statement which suggests that there was no radar cover at Dublin Airport on a number of occasions recently?  Will the Minister agree that that, irrespective of how long it takes to install new equipment, is not acceptable, particularly during the tourist season?  If the Minister's views are to be believed that there will be a great increase in traffic to all airports, will he agree that something will <Col N="7" /> have to be done to ensure the safety of air travellers, those who work in airports and on board aircraft, until the new equipment is installed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this is a matter of the new equipment.  As I indicated, the radar at Dublin Airport is subject to this phenomenon called meteorological clutter.  When the new equipment is put in place it will obviate that meteorological clutter because it is a new system which is independent of what happens in the atmosphere. Arrangements are now being made for the induction of a substantial number of extra staff.</P>
      <P>With regard to the safety aspect &mdash; and I appreciate the Deputy's concern in that regard &mdash; I am absolutely confident that safety is being maintained as a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Minister, in his reply, has coupled a question in my name, No. 23 with No. 4, a priority question.  Am I entitled to ask a supplementary on my question No. 23?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reply to the effect that things will be better in the future, am I to accept that on occasions there was no radar control at Dublin Airport?  I am pressing the Minister to say what immediate action is being taken on the basis of the representation made by the air traffic controllers branch <i>vis-à-vis</i> the problem obtaining at the airport in order to ensure <Col N="8" /> maximum safety.  I assume the Minister is as concerned as any other Member of this House that this should not be happening, and should not occur throughout the summer months, if and when meteorological difficulties arise. Would he agree that something must be done rather than on occasions have a pre-1940 position obtaining at Dublin Airport when there is no radar control at all in existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make two points. As I said, what is being done at present &mdash; and I am glad to be able to say so &mdash; is that the induction of a substantial number of staff into the service is under way.  Second, the system, as it exists now, entails radar beams being sent out and returned when they strike aircraft but also, as of now, certain things in the atmosphere return them which causes what I have mentioned already, that is, meteorological clutter.  With the new system in place that will not happen &mdash; it is called secondary surveillance radar &mdash; when there will not be any problem whatsoever with regard to outside interference with the radar system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one brief supplementary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Kavanagh to please bear with me for a moment.  The Chair has an obligation to dispose of all of the priority questions within the prescribed time laid down by Standing Orders, which is 15 minutes.  I am seeking Deputies' indulgence in permitting the Chair to deal with the three remaining priority questions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inform the House on how many occasions <Col N="9" /> the radar system failed, and the duration, at Dublin Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying there has been a breakdown of the radar system. What I am saying is that as of now atmospherics interfere with the present system. I should say that £30 million are being invested in the new system, which will be in place very shortly.  In the meantime, safety is now, and will continue to be, a strong priority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the plans, if any, he has to enable car hire firms to offer more competitive prices to tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Levels of car rental rates are, in the first instance, a matter for the individual car rental companies. However, the Government and I are fully aware that car rental rates in Ireland are less than competitive when compared with some European countries and with North America which accounts for 55 per cent of tourist rentals.</P>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance and excise duty is regularly cited as the main factors contributing to the relatively high level of car hire costs in this country.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out to the House in response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Hussey on 16 November 1988, while the current state of the public finances precludes a lowering of excise duty, or a deferral of excise duty on car rental fleets, Government policies in other areas are helping to improve the competitiveness of the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's economic policies which have led to substantial reduction in inflation and interest rates allied with the moderate pay increases negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have all helped to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry and tourism in particular.  Of direct relevance to tourism, and the car hire sector particularly, these policies have brought about more competitive tourist accommodation <Col N="10" /> rates which, allied to lower access transport fares, have helped considerably to improve the competitiveness of fly and self-drive holiday packages to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Specific measures to tackle the high cost of motor insurance are an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and these measures are in train.  The provisions in the Courts Act, 1988 will foster an environment for lower motor insurance premia.  My information is that, arising from increased competition in the insurance secor and in anticipation of the benefits arising from the Courts Act, insurance premia have already begun to come down.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that, short of reducing the level of excise duties on car rental fleets, the Government are making every effort to improve the competitiveness of the car rental sector.  I can assure the House that these efforts will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply &mdash; which was really a party political broadcast rather than a reply to a specific question &mdash; the Minister will be aware that Aer Lingus have now reduced their return fares across the Atlantic to 299 dollars for coming months with the result that it is much easier to cross the Atlantic twice &mdash; it is cheaper &mdash; than to hire a car for one week in this country. In view of that, would he accept that those costs constitute a major disincentive to the North American market? Furthermore, would he say whether the Government have engaged in any costing exercise of what it would cost them to reduce excise duty or &mdash; as the car hire people talk about &mdash; charge excise duty only when these fleets are sold on for the second time?  Have the Government engaged in any cost-benefit exercise between that cost and its advantage to the tourist industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to excise duties, I should say that studies have been undertaken.  Indeed we have examined very carefully the position in Denmark where the scheme alluded to by the Deputy is in operation with regard to <Col N="11" /> excise duties and the selling-on period.  I am glad to say that, coupled with the reduction of fares the Deputy mentioned and recently announced by Aer Lingus, there has also been an announcement that they are making provision for car hire at a very low cost indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>These two combined will impact on the price of car hire.  I have said already that I regard the figures as too high.  I have a list of them from two different sources.  We emerged not too badly on the list from one source and second highest on another.  The fact of the matter is that the rentals are too high, particularly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the large United States market.  We are endeavouring to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Of course the broader question of excise duties will come up very much for consideration with regard to the single market in 1992, as the Deputy well knows, when they will have to be dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 27 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, I must remind the Deputies that the rod angling licence is a matter for the Minister for the Marine.  I am pleased to point out that according to preliminary Bord Fáilte estimates there was an increase of over 16 per cent in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in 1988, i.e. from 2.096 million in 1987 to 2.435 million in 1988.  Bord Fáilte have targeted a further growth of 16 per cent in 1989.  I have no data on what effect the rod licence had on our tourism performance in 1988 or estimates of its impact on the target for 1989.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte estimate total revenue derived from tourists who came to Ireland specially to fish at £10.8 million in 1987.  However, a further £31.6 million was spent by general holidaymakers from home and abroad who availed of the opportunity to fish during the course of their holiday.  Comparable statistics for 1988 are not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry at the position in which the other people who put down questions for priority find themselves in. Is the Minister aware that estimates by the tourism industry for the west of Ireland alone put the loss in revenue for last year at £4 million to £5 million because of the rod licence dispute and in the town of Oughterard, which has a population of 800, they put the loss at £400,000?  In view of this situation does the Minister not think that he, as Minister with overall responsibility for tourism, should have a survey carried out on this problem to help his Government see light <Col N="13" /> on this silly dispute, as the Taoiseach called it, and to introduce a sensible solution to it?  Will the Minister carry out a survey in the area to see what the actual losses are on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the basic lessons in logic I learned was to examine the major premise.  I have examined the major premise in what the Deputy has said and I do not accept it.  I have had no such advice from the relevant Bord Fáilte people in the west of Ireland and I have had no such estimate from them.  I do not know where the Deputy got his estimate but I do not see how I can base any kind of judgment on an estimate he plucks from the air.</P>

May I ask the Minister whether he intends to reverse the decision to reduce the capital grant to Bus Éireann over the next three years by 3.5 per cent per annum?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will outline the advantages which accrue to the economy due to Shannon being the sole trans-atlantic airport for Ireland, which obliges scheduled flights to land in both directions and also requires charter flights to call one-way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shannon stop obligation has been part of Government policy since the commencement of trans-atlantic services and has been a key factor in the continuation of Shannon as a significant transatlantic airport and an important centre of economic life in the mid-west region.  As Ireland's trans-atlantic gateway, Shannon Airport has generated positive returns for the Irish economy in general, and the west of Ireland in particular.  Its impact has been mainly in the areas of tourism and industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as tourism is concerned, the requirements in relation to transatlantic flights mean that a large proportion of <Col N="19" /> tourism traffic from the US enters Ireland at Shannon.  This has given rise to the development of major tourist facilities and infrastructure in the area and the surrounding regions which create a highly favourable first impression of Ireland. Shannon Airport is ideally located as an entry point to some of the principal areas of tourist interest in the south, west and mid-west regions of the country and opens up a wide range of options for tourists in terms of places to visit.  It is clear that Shannon Airport generates considerable benefits for the less developed parts of the country.  For example, over 5,000 full-time jobs in tourism in the south, west and mid-west regions depend on US tourists.</P>
    <P>In so far as industrial development is concerned, Shannon's status has been a major factor in attracting US investment in Ireland. There are some 108 US manufacturing companies located in the west and mid-west regions, employing about 12,450 people.  This represents 32 per cent of all US manufacturing employment in Ireland and the presence of all year-round flights between the US and Shannon Airport has been a major factor in these companies deciding to locate in the west and mid-west regions.</P>
    <P>For over 40 years Shannon Airport has been the hub around which major economic and social developments have taken place in the mid-west and surrounding regions.  The economic and social benefits which have resulted are incalculable. There can be no doubt that development on the scale which has occurred in the region could not have taken place without the airport and the associated customs free zone.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have maintained the Shannon stop requirement in order to ensure that the benefits created by the existence of a major international airport in the west of Ireland should continue. The results, which are there to be seen in terms of employment and wealth creation, have clearly justified this policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>I have two questions to ask <Col N="20" /> the Minister.  In his reply he illustrated some of the benefits which are received by the tourist interests in the mid-west and in the western areas.  Would the Minister not agree that statistics are available to make comparisons between tourists who disembark at Shannon and tourists who disembark at Dublin and that the tourists who disembark at Shannon spend four additional bed-nights in the country over the average tourist who disembarks at Dublin?  Would the Minister agree that it would never be possible to accede to the very partisan request of the wealthy Dublin lobby who want the overfly proposal initiated at an extreme cost to the west coast region?  Would the Minister not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to indicate to the Deputy that the Government have no intention of changing their policy in that regard.  I want to point out, however, that statistics show us, for example, that many tourists visit Dublin who first fly direct to London and come back to Dublin.  We have been making an analysis of those figures.  That is also a factor to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The reports on the Buttevant and Cherryville accidents have a common recommendation regarding restrictions on the use of timber-bodied coaches.  These recommendations have been implemented progressively as new rolling stock became available.  Since Buttevant the number of timber-bodied coaches has fallen from 235 to 69.  This number will be reduced to 45 when push-pull coaches, at present in the course of construction, are brought into service later this year.  The other seven recommendations in the Buttevant report have been implemented.</P>
      <P>In the case of the report on the Cherryville accident, seven of the other eight recommendations have been implemented, one with minor modifications. This modification allows trains, when permission is given by the signalman, to pass a signal of Danger at up to 15 mph instead of 10 mph.  The eighth recommendation, which relates to the provision of tail lamps on the rear of trains, is in the course of being implemented also on the basis of an improved modification.  This allows for high visibility markings, which are being procured by Iarnrod Eireann, at the rear of passenger trains as an acceptable alternative to lighted tail lamps during daylight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the Government decided that proposals for the extension of DART should not be proceeded with because of the considerable costs involved and the state of the public finances.  It was also decided at the time that any proposals for further upgrading the rail services in the greater Dublin area should be based on diesel on existing lines.  In that connection the provision of improved public transport services for the new suburbs to the west of the city was seen as a priority. This priority is reflected in the investment plans prepared by CIE at my request. These plans propose, on the rail side, the upgrading of the existing Dublin-Maynooth line and the provision of a new commuter service on the existing line from Clondalkin to the city.</P>
      <P>Many transport proposals were submitted for consideration in the context of assistance from EC Structural Funds. Indeed, there were so many that it was obvious that all of them could not be accommodated within the resources likely to become available.  In the circumstances it was necessary to place particular emphasis on using available resources to serve the areas of greatest need.  Against that background and the priority already determined for improving public transport services in the suburbs to the west of the city, it was not found possible to provide in the national plan for any extension of DART.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="23" />
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the present costing agreed by CIE is of the order of £3.5 million as distinct from the earlier figure of £7.5 million because no new train sets will be necessary?  Is he also aware that it will be necessary to get a new diesel train set for the diesel shuttle to Greystones which would cost around £1 million &mdash; further reducing the cost of the extension of the DART to Greystones. In view of that perhaps he might reconsider his situation especially if EC Structural Funds are available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have taken a decision on it and, as I have said already, the priority is the development of the system to the west of Dublin city, which is badly in need of that development. The actual line that has been mentioned by the Deputy is already provided with a rail service and the Deputy is aware of that.  What we are trying to do is to develop the area west of the city where facilities are not available.  I would like to say that my predecessor even said he would not have taken the decision to put the DART in place if he had been in power at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister give a reply which excludes the extension of the four miles from Bray to Greystones which was in the original DART plan in the seventies?  Because of the fact that so much of the money would be paid for by Brussels why could the Minister not have included it in the many proposals which were accepted at the local level of discussions and which were included in the plan at that level?  This will be regarded as a great disappointment because it has never been indicated to the public representatives from the Wicklow area that this has been excluded from a plan which was supposed to contain all the necessary proposals which were always considered for the DART?</P>

      <P>I have no plans to reestablish the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-ordination of efforts to minimise traffic congestion and to improve traffic circulation in Dublin is now the <Col N="26" /> responsibility of the Dublin Transportation Task Force.  Since their reconstitution by Government decision in January 1988, the task force have been required to co-ordinate and integrate on a non-statutory basis the activities of the various official bodies involved in traffic management and the provision of public transport in Dublin, to devise and fund new traffic management and bus priority schemes, where necessary, and by these and other appropriate means to fight traffic congestion and promote and facilitate the use of public transport.</P>
    <P>The task force are quite rightly interpreting their mandate in the broadest sense.  For example, they continue to pursue the key objective of improved traffic law enforcement, and have taken steps to ensure that transportation aspects are fully taken into account by the Dublin planning authorities, both as regards general policy and its application in particular instances.</P>
    <P>The task force's chairman reports to me regularly on progress and I am satisfied that they are functioning as an efficient and extremely cost-effective means of achieving significant progress in areas which were central to the role envisaged for the former transport authority. Consequently, and in view of the need to use our limited resources as wisely and productively as possible, I see no compelling case for re-establishing a statutory Dublin Transport Authority.  In any event, the perceived need for intervention by such a body in the transport planning area has been largely obviated by subsequent developments, culminating in the Government's approval, in the context of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> and subject to the availability of assistance from the EC Structural Funds, of a package of measures relating to the improvement of road and rail infrastructure and services in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Enthusiasm is a good word and enthusiasm generally can be gauged if somebody is willing to put his money where his mouth is.  We offered £500,000 because of the tourism implications for the establishment of a ferry service.  We then backed that up with the offer of an interest free loan to the company but they were unable to get a ferry for the season.  The matter rests there.  I understand that they have not given up hope of getting the service going in 1990.  I will be the first to welcome their input into the tourist numbers in 1990.</P>

Twenty four hours is the usual period mentioned now in the international definition of a tourist.  It is very important to get the idea across, an idea that has been put forward for many years by some leading friends of Ireland in Britain and the US, that we are in competition with sun holiday destinations for our own people wherever they are. Anybody who refuses to praise them for choosing their own native land rather than sun destinations, or refuses to enumerate them among tourists, is not doing a service to tourism in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if the Government will increase their funding for the development of Farranfore Airport, County Kerry, to the maximum EC level, in view of its importance to the region for tourism and industrial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the development plan for regional airports which I announced in 1988, provision was included for further Exchequer grant assistance of £1,125,000 for the development of Farranfore Airport.  This investment is designed to ensure that Farranfore satisfies the operational and <Col N="32" /> safety standards required by my Department to handle 40/50 seater aircraft and it will leave the airport in a strong position to exploit the tourism and economic prospects of the region.  Work on the development of the airport project is proceeding satisfactorily and I understand that the airport will open for international services on 22 May 1989.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer grant for the airport will bring State funding for the project to almost £1.4 million and this represents a generous level of support, especially at a time of scarce resources.  In relation to further State funding for the airport, the position is that proposals have been made to the EC authorities in the context of the Structural Funds for the further development of regional airports.  In this context it is hoped that additional funds will be available for the development of regional airports, including Farranfore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the local contribution now stands at £1.7 million, surely it would be only right that this amount should be matched by the normal funding as accepted by the EC, which is 70:30, and which is envisaged in the Structural Funds?  In view of this great effort made by the local community in raising that amount of £1.7 million, could the Minister make a case for the proper amount of £3.4 million, including his original grant, to be made available to Farranfore Airport?  If that airport has to compete with other regional and international airports, certainly the runway will have to be made longer.  There will have to be more facilities in order to bring larger planes to this airport.  Would this funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services to and from Irish ports is a matter for the shipping companies involved.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the backlog of freight units which developed at Rosslare following the withdrawal of the <i>St. Patrick</i> on completion of a charter contract to the B &amp; I in early April and also as a result of disruption caused by industrial action.</P>
      <P>While part of the problem arose through difficulty experienced by the B &amp; I in securing a vessel to replace the <i>St. Patrick</i>, it was most disturbing that this should for a while have been compounded by industrial action at a time when the company are engaged in a radical recovery programme designed to restore them to commercial viability. Such action can only do damage to the company's prospects and it is imperative that all concerned work together to restore customer confidence quickly and to ensure that it is retained by providing uninterrupted and reliable service in the future.</P>
      <P>While most freight units unable to use the B &amp; I service were transferred to alternative routes, a backlog did arise through unaccompanied traffic which could not be diverted elsewhere.  I am informed by B &amp; I that they will have an additional freight vessel operating on the Rosslare-Pembroke route within the next few days.  This, combined with the existing vessel, will exceed the capacity formerly available with the <i>St. Patrick</i> and will enable any remaining backlog to be dealt with speedily.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has taken any fresh initiative to put a boat on the Cork-Swansea route to open up the link between the south-west region and the United Kingdom and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are concerned that as many commercial access transport links as possible be developed by air and sea in the interests of the national tourism effort.  It has, however, been made clear in response to previous Dáil questions in this matter that it is not a function of my Department to provide ferry services between Ireland and other countries.  That is a matter which is entirely for the commercial discretion of ferry operators.  Bearing in mind, however, the value of the Cork-Swansea ferry service and local fund-raising efforts to assist the ferry service, the Government were prepared, on an exceptional basis, to make available to that service an Exchequer grant of £500,000, together with a loan of up to £500,000 to be repaid in September 1989.  Regrettably, Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited announced last February that the service would not operate in 1989 as the company were unable to charter a suitable vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that local efforts are continuing with a view to the restoration of the Cork-Swansea service in 1990.  I wish the promoters every success in their efforts, and I must stress that any ferry <Col N="36" /> service on the route must be commercially self-sustaining in order to ensure its continued survival and lasting benefit to the local community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>How will one of the main objectives of the national plan be realised in the absence of a direct ferry service to the south-west region, beginning as of this year?  The statement to which I refer says that the major objective is the alleviation of a disadvantage associated with the isolated location of the south-west region.  Could I remind the Minister that in a previous Question Time in this House he accepted that the provision of a ferry service into this very isolated region was the kind of project that ought to qualify, uniquely qualify, for aid under the Structural Funds?  Having admitted that, has he taken any steps at all to make provision for a funds incentive to get the ferry service restored under the national plan or the application which has been made to Brussels for funds?</P>

      <P>The second part of the question is covered by what I have said already to Deputy Barry, namely, that as I understand it, the ferry company still have hopes of developing a service in 1990.  Up to a couple of weeks ago we thought we might have a limited summer <Col N="37" /> service, but that does not seem to be the case, and the situation as of now is that the company have not abandoned the idea of having a service in 1990.</P>

Is there not a contradiction in developing one and not the other?

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the plans he has for establishing a special air tunnel for freight to the European mainland in the context of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i>; the work which has been done on these plans; the location which has been chosen as the main airport in Ireland; and the criteria used to make the decision on location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The vital importance of continental European markets in Ireland's export drive, the problems of our peripheral location and the need to integrate as far as possible our air transport system with the European transport network has created an urgent requirement for additional capacity for the transport of goods by air in a fast and reliable fashion at competitive rates to our main markets within the Community.  The Government's response to these needs is the proposal for the development, <i>inter alia</i>, of specially dedicated air freight channels to key destinations in Europe, along the lines outlined in the Government's <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i></P>
      <P>The airports in Ireland and the destinations in Europe to be served by these channels will be determined following the completion of a special feasibility study but the principal factors to be taken into consideration will include the location of the demand for such services and existing airport infrastructures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to have one main centre for the air freight channels or to have them distributed at several airports throughout the country?  Furthermore, is it intended that the air freight will be channelled to one destination for the entire EC, requiring vast <Col N="40" /> warehousing and so on?  Who would be in charge of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, as I indicated in my reply, we are getting the feasibility study under way as quickly as possible.  Much will depend on the results of that research.  It seems to me &mdash; I am speaking as one perhaps less wise on this matter &mdash; that the existing developed airports would be heavily called on in this regard.  With relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, namely, the construction, lease or purchase of large depots, that has been under consideration, but in the commercial life of the Continent of Europe the JIT syndrome is working very strongly, in other words goods are delivered just in time and are then collected.  That system would obviate the necessity for having large and expensive warehousing.  I am advised that the trend is very strong in that direction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if the <Col N="41" /> Government have considered the possibility of reopening all or part of the old Harcourt Street-Bray railway line either as a rail line or busway and including such a project in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993,</i> especially in view of the population growth in its catchment area; if he has considered the implications of the Shankill by-pass on the possible reopening of the line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in 1987 that proposals for the extension of DART should not be proceeded with because of the considerable costs involved and the state of the public finances, and that any proposals for further upgrading rail services in the greater Dublin area should be based on diesel rail on existing lines.  As a consequence I requested the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann to prepare public transport investment plans for the area involving only bus-based options or diesel rail on existing lines.</P>
      <P>The transport investment plans for the greater Dublin area were submitted to me by Córas Iompair Éireann in August 1988.  The plans favour the provision of a busway on the former Harcourt Street line and I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is considering the possibility of such a development on the line between Harcourt Street and Dundrum.  No doubt he will take into account any implications other developments in the area may have for a busway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has approved the terms of the sale by Aer Rianta of a portion of the company to a private tours competitor (details supplied); the price received for same; the commercial criteria involved in arriving at this decision; and whether any tenders were sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The tour handling business referred to in the Deputy's question was part of a joint venture arrangement between Aer Rianta and SFADCo which has also been involved in a number of other tourism related activities since its formation in the early 1960s.</P>
      <P>Following the collapse of the only private tour handling company in the mid-west region in 1970 the tour handling business was established by Aer Rianta and SFADCo to fill the gap in the vital area of servicing incoming tourist groups.</P>
      <P>Because of the subsequent emergence of a number of successful privately owned tour handlers in the mid-west it was decided last year that it was no longer necessary or appropriate for Aer Rianta and SFADCo to be directly involved in this activity.  Accordingly, the tour handling business was offered for sale and a number of tenders were received.  The business was sold recently to a private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paramount consideration governing the decision in relation to the eventual <Col N="43" /> sale of the business was the need to ensure a continuation of the high level of service which had been provided by the Aer Rianta/SFADCo joint venture in attracting and handling groups of tourists in the region and also normal commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>In accordance with long established practice it would not be appropriate for me to disclose confidential commercial details in relation to the sale price of the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to find out when exactly these tenders were publicly invited.  What papers were asked for? This company was recognised in the area as being very successful.  In the case of the privatisation of a public company the offer should have been widely available to the trade.  When were these tenders invited?  Was there a selective tender system as operated by SFADCo, a kind of under the counter system, used in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any dates here but I can assure the Deputy that there was nothing under the counter about it.  There were five tenders and it went to the highest bidder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consideration at board level in both Aer Rianta and SFADCo the business was sold to this private company.  The sale price is on record, as are the other tenders, but I do not want to break with the precedent of not revealing private commercial details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>How and where were these tenders invited?  Was it through the press or privately?  There is a lot of concern about this matter in the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Another company was set up by former employees of the company, so there were two companies doing that job.  There were five staff employed in the tour handling division prior to its sale. <Col N="44" /> They were all Aer Rianta employees. One resigned shortly before the business was sold, two are now working for a new company and the remaining two are back in Aer Rianta.  I will let the Deputy know about the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of privatisation gives rise to a lot of emotion.  I understand the balance of this company is now to be offered at Shannon.  The precedent set in the asking of tenders in this case leaves a lot to be desired.  Will the Minister ensure that in future sales of public companies will require publication of invitations to tender in the national newspapers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a report from our embassy in Paris about the arrest last weekend of an official attached to the South African Embassy in Paris, an American citizen and three persons from Northern Ireland, who were allegedly in possession of military material.  The American citizen and the three persons from Northern Ireland have been charged with illegal dealing in weapons.  I understand that the South African official was a technical and administrative officer and that he was released after his arrest because of his official status.  I also understand that the South African Ambassador in Paris has declared that the official concerned has left the country.  The matter is now under judicial investigation in France and Deputies will understand that my comments on the matter must, therefore, be restricted.</P>
      <P>I would like to say first that the Ambassador in Paris has conveyed our congratulations to the French authorities on the success of their security measures against an operation which, apart from its possible implications for security in Northern Ireland, could have resulted in the breaking of the arms embargo on South Africa imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 of 1977.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I instructed that a protest be made in the strongest possible terms to the South African Government.  The protest was delivered by our Ambassador in London to the South African Ambassador in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the protest, our Ambassador reminded the South African Ambassador of sectarian attacks by loyalists in Northern Ireland which, in the past 20 years, have killed almost 700 people.  The South African Ambassador was also reminded that already this year <Col N="98" /> 11 people have been killed by loyalist paramilitaries.  The Ambassador was told that the Government condemn in the strongest terms the provision of weapons, or funds for the purchase of weapons, to any group engaged in violent activity in Northern Ireland and that they wish to have the assurance of the South African Government that South Africa will not supply any such weapons or funds.</P>
    <P>The South African Ambassador has transmitted the Government's message to the South African Government.  He informed our Ambassador that the South African Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that the South African Government were investigating the matter, that he had given the assurance that the South African Government are not supplying weapons to any terrorist organisation and that he had stated that should any organisation or individual in South Africa have transgressed in this sphere, action will be taken against those concerned and an assurance will be given that this will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I have informed the British Government, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, of our deep concern about the security implications of this affair.  The ability of Loyalist paramilitaries to steal weapons from establishments in Northern Ireland is a grave matter.  The question of recent breaches of security at Shortts and at a territorial army base at Newtownards were discussed.  We have been informed by the British Government that, following the theft from the Shortts factory at Crossgar, Ballinahinch, at the end of October 1988, a thorough review of security has been carried out under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence.  This had resulted in a number of improvements to security arrangements both in relation to the security of the premises and to the security screening of staff employed at the factory.  Similarly, since the theft earlier this month from the territorial army base in New-townards, a full security review is being carried out into security at the base and other such bases in Northern Ireland.  It was confirmed that the items stolen from <Col N="99" /> Shortts were parts of the Blowpipe missile system, a Blowpipe training simulator and parts of the Javelin missile system. None of the items was of itself capable of operational use.  The Blowpipe equipment stolen from the territorial army base was a training model in sections which was not capable of being used operationally.</P>
    <P>The British Government are not in a position at the present time to offer a conclusive judgment on whether Loyalist paramilitaries in the North have already received supplies of weapons from South Africa.</P>
    <P>I wish to add that the security threat in Northern Ireland, including the threat posed by Loyalist organisations, is kept under constant review in the Anglo-Irish Conference and in the daily contacts between the police forces.  These discussions include the organisation known as Ulster Resistance.</P>
    <P>I believe it is essential that the greatest care should be taken by constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland to say and do nothing which might encourage paramilitary organisations.  In this regard I note the remarks yesterday by Reverend Ian Paisley that his party have no connections with Ulster Resistance.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that all aspects of this affair will continue to be closely monitored by the Government and that discussions will take place with other Governments as necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the circumstances under which statements are being made here when Private Notice Questions put down were refused.  It appears to me that what the Minister is saying now is precisely what he should be saying in answer to the Private Notice Questions.  That is another matter we will have to investigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement. There are three points I want to make about this whole incident which came to light last Saturday.  One is the concern that we must all express about the ability of Loyalists to obtain weapons and secret blueprints in Northern Ireland; second, <Col N="100" /> the effects of those blueprints being swapped for weapons or the weapons themselves being used to kill Nationalists and Catholics in the North; third, and this applies not only to the South African Government but to the Libyan Government, the cynicism of both those Governments meddling in the affairs of Northern Ireland, resulting in Irish people being killed because they supplied arms to either side in the North.</P>
    <P>There must be a big question mark over the security arrangements of the British security forces, given the fact that one of the people arrested yesterday was a member of the territorial army and the parts of this missile that were stolen were stolen from a territorial army base in Newtownards.  Likewise, it is known that the South African Government, since the embargo was placed by the United Nations and some other countries to sell arms to them, have become 90 per cent self-sufficient in arms, and the only part they are missing are these types of missiles. Yet it appears that the blueprints, if not the missiles themselves, can be stolen from a factory that makes them.</P>
    <P>This shows grave naivety on the part of the British security forces that they will allow that to happen knowing, as they do, that the Arms Procurement Organisation in South Africa have at least one member, and in some cases many more, in every embassy in the world in countries that produce arms and that, as the South African Foreign Minister said yesterday, armaments co-operation in South Africa is required to maintain South African defence capabilities and consider any offer of weapons capability.  That obviously means that they are indifferent as to where they obtain these arms, whether they are obtained by blackmail, by stealing or on the blackmarket, as long as they have the arms to maintain what is a totalitarian régime.  The remark about defence capability is, to my mind, an extraordinary thing for a South African Minister to say, given the type of régime they run, the use to which they put the arms there, and also their record in Mozambique, <Col N="101" /> Namibia and Angola over the last few years.</P>
    <P>The UK Government would be very naive if they thought the South African Arms Procurement Organisation would not attempt to fill the gap in their armaments capability by going to people in Shortts, given the situation in the North and given the possibility of being able to strongarm or blackmail, or by other means, entice people in Shortts to steal either the blueprint or the missile and supply to the South African Procurement Organisation co-operation in return for money to buy arms or directly in return for arms.</P>
    <P>I certainly join with the Minister when he condemns this and advises constitutional politicians in the North on either side to stay away from organisations connected with violence or that use violence as one of the means of advancing their cause.  We are never tired of lecturing the Nationalists in the North to stay away from the IRA, and I certainly can accept that.  It is time also that the British Government took note of the close association between the Democratic Unionist Party and the setting up of Ulster Resistance a few years ago.  In spite of the fact that there is no record a statement from the DUP in the last three or four months saying that they no longer have any connection with Ulster Resistance, the leaders of the DUP must accept some of the responsibility for the setting up of Ulster Resistance and what has happened now.  Since this was set up the number of deaths of Nationalist and Catholics in the North has been twice that in the preceding seven or eight years. These are matters the Minister has been rightly bringing to the attention of the Northern Ireland authorities through the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The final irony in all this is that one of those arrested on Saturday in France is in the same French prison as the owner of the <i>Eksund</i> who was arrested on charges of importation of arms into Ireland from Libya in 1987.  The Minister's Government have strong connections with the Libyan Government and the UK have strong connections with the South <Col N="102" /> African Government.  I want the Minister, through the Anglo-Irish Conference to impress on the United Kingdom, the Libyan and South African Governments that the solution to Northern Ireland problems is not to be found by sending arms to paramilitaries in the North. Whatever solutions are to be found will be found by Irishmen in Ireland, not through the meddling of totalitarian regimes in South Africa or North Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everyone in this House has an absolute feeling of horror at what was discovered in Paris last Friday.  It is a frightening prospect that the northern part of this country is now apparently subject to importations of large quantities of arms from two totally different sources.  Two of the most disreputable regimes in the world, South Africa and Libya, are supplying arms to two different sides in the unfortunate conflict in Northern Ireland.  It is a chilling thought that this is so and it is indicative of the type of régimes they are that they are prepared to do this.</P>
      <P>It is significant that on each of these occasions, at the time of the Eksund and again last Friday, it was the French authorities who uncovered what was going on and who prevented what could have been substantially greater carnage on this island, and our thanks are due to them. It underlines the international character of terrorism at present and the unsatisfactory nature of countries trying to deal with international terrorism by way of extradition.  It underlines the call I made several months ago for the European Community to look at the possibility of having an international court within the Community to try crimes of this nature &mdash; terrorist-related crimes of a transnational character.  This is certainly one that comes into this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing for everybody, and particularly I would have thought for the British Government, that one of their major suppliers of one of the most advanced western missile systems is subject to infiltration by people who can remove objects and sell them or swop the technology <Col N="103" /> involved for weapons to kill people in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, one of the features of the Shortts factory in Belfast is that their workforce is sectarian, to say the least of it, with 95 per cent or more being of one religion and it seems to be very difficult for people of another religion to get employment there.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect is that their technology was stolen by Loyalists for the purpose of getting arms to kill Catholics. Second is the treasonable activity of people who call themselves Loyalists, who are prepared to barter their own country's most advanced defensive systems for the purpose of acquiring arms to carry on sectarian warfare.  We have often doubted the meaning of the word &ldquo;Loyalist&rdquo;.  When we see what apparently happened in Paris last Friday it makes us ask again what do these people purport to be loyal to.</P>
    <P>There is, in addition to the two missile systems which have been stolen from that factory or from Army bases in Northern Ireland, a third, more up-to-date system, the Starstreak system, which, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, would have very serious consequences indeed for western defence as a whole.  For that reason it is difficult to exaggerate the significance of what has happened in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the apparent reply of the South African Ambassador yesterday to the Irish Ambassador does not include a denial of what the Irish Ambassador complained about.  It does not deny that the South Africans have done what has been alleged and the fact that they have withdrawn the diplomatic officer involved and sent him back to South Africa certainly gives every credence to what has been suggested.  It is also noteworthy that when the assertion was made in the British House of Commons yesterday that the South African Government had already supplied arms to these Loyalists in Northern Ireland, the British Government were not in a position to deny that.  It is again a frightening thought that that appears to have <Col N="104" /> been the case and that the supply of these arms in the past two years may well have been part of a major contribution to the escalation in sectarian violence and death which have occurred during that time.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste notes in his statement the remarks made yesterday by the Reverend Ian Paisley that his party have no connection with the Ulster Resistance.  If that is the case it is only in the present tense, and perhaps in the very recent past.  It was not the case some time ago and that too is a factor that should be borne in mind.  This puts the whole question of violence in Northern Ireland and the potential violence which might break out there, on a new and even more serious footing.  It behoves the British Government in particular to get to the bottom of this problem and to ensure that it is stamped out.</P>
    <P>There was much speculation in the last number of years as to how various cargoes of arms from Libya had come onto this island and whether they had come to Northern Ireland through the Republic. I presume there can be no suggestion that the arms that were supplied by South Africa to the Loyalists were brought into Northern Ireland via the Republic.  The British Government would do well to discover as rapidly as they can precisely what route was used to convey these arms from South Africa to Northern Ireland. Of course, this is not the first time that the South African Government have tried something of this kind, and this clearly underlines the type of Government and the type of regime there.</P>
    <P>The attitude that has been taken by successive Governments here has been shown through this alone, apart from the apartheid question, to have been the correct one.  Nonetheless, several of our partners in the European Community still have full diplomatic relations with South Africa and the Government here should request them, as a matter of urgency, to try to get an explanation from the South African authorities as to what precisely they were up to.  This whole matter is a cause of the gravest concern and has internationalised the tragic consequence <Col N="105" /> on this island in a way none of us could have foreseen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government. Obviously we are all shocked, to say the least, by what happened, and what potentially could have happened arising from the meeting that took place in Paris last Friday.  Needless to say, the French security forces should be complimented &mdash; I believe a message has been already conveyed to them.  We are indeed indebted to them for the second time in recent years for their efforts to prevent arms being brought onto this island.</P>
      <P>All of us on this island, North and South, are conscious at all times of the potentially explosive position that exists in Northern Ireland and the consequences of what would happen to either side in Northern Ireland as a result of the importation of arms.  I am glad the Government have protested in a strong manner to the South African Embassy in London and I would like to feel that they will pursue this protest until we get at least some satisfactory response from the South African Government.</P>
      <P>Likewise, there are questions to be answered by the British Government in relation to this matter, to their own security and to the armaments being manufactured in Northern Ireland.  I would like to think that the Tánaiste and his ministerial colleagues will pursue this matter at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. From the Tánaiste's statement it is apparent that contact has been made through the secretariat, but I would like to think that this will be followed up at the next Intergovernmental Conference so that we will get some replies from the British Government as to what steps they are taking to ensure that this sort of liaison does not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this Government's actions against South Africa, we have been somewhat restrained in recent years by virtue of seeking unanimity in the European Community countries.  Despite the <Col N="106" /> reservations of all parties in this House towards the appalling regime of apartheid in South Africa, the Government should now press for unilateral sanctions against South Africa and should make that known to the South African Government. We should certainly seek a European ban on coal from South Africa.  The displeasure and anger which should be felt in this country about the happening last Friday in Paris would certainly justify the Government taking unilateral action outside the Community at this time.</P>
    <P>I would call on the Tánaiste, and the Taoiseach on his return, to take strong action in relation to South Africa.  I believe they will have the support of the people of this country.  We should leave no stone unturned in conveying the anger and the displeasure of the Irish Government and the Irish people in relation to the activities of diplomats operating for the South African Government in Paris last week.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the opportunity the Minister has given us to comment on the events that took place in Paris over the weekend.  We, too, tabled Private Notice Questions to him but they were disallowed on the basis that these statements would be allowed.  Unfortunately, this deprives us of the right to question the Minister on any particular aspects of his statement and to get replies from him. There is no doubt that the attempted arms transactions involving South Africa and loyalist paramilitaries is an alarming and, indeed, a sinister development.  Had this deal come off and South African arms reached Northern Ireland it could have contributed significantly to a worsening of the already serious situation there.  Given the sectarian murder campaign conducted by loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, as well as their bomb attacks on targets in the Republic, the prospect of them receiving a large consignment of arms from South Africa is frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident demonstrates once again the total hypocrisy of the Pretoria regime who, on the one hand, preach opposition <Col N="107" /> to terrorism but, on the other, are prepared to do business with those engaged in vicious acts of violence in Ireland.  It is also outrageous that anyone should attempt to provide South Africa with weapons technology which could be used against the black population and all those working for a democratic multi-racial South Africa.  We should perhaps not be too surprised that these contacts have emerged, given the fact that the vicious sectarianism practised by the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, both loyalist and nationalist, has much in common with the racial hatred enshrined in the apartheid system in South Africa.</P>
    <P>These events strengthen the case for the introduction of comprehensive trade and economic sanctions by this country against South Africa.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he has lodged a strong protest with the South African Government but I feel strongly that it should be followed up by unilateral sanctions against that country.  This incident, as well as the continuing campaign of sectarian murder by the Provisional IRA and loyalist murder gangs, shows that not only are the paramilitaries not turning away from terrorism but are actively preparing for further acts of violence and it emphasises the need for political progress in Northern Ireland to isolate and defeat all paramilitary violence.  This political progress can only take place when all the democratic parties in Northern Ireland sit down to talk about the future of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland itself and agree that despite their differences deriving from their history or ideology that peace, democracy and civil rights is the basis for pursuing individual objectives. In the Republic it is time the Government put on record a clear and unambiguous statement that the kind of progress I refer to can only be made in this way and they should drop their coy, meaningless statements about being generous to Unionists in the context of the so-called totality of relationships.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a short technical Bill to allow for the holding of the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta on the same day as the European Parliament elections.  The Bill will bring the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta within the scope of section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides for the taking of two or more polls on the same day.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, two or more polls in relation to Presidential, Dáil, European Parliament or local elections or referenda may be taken together but the provision does not extend to Údarás elections which are governed by a separate code.  This Bill, when enacted, will bring Údaras elections into line with the other types of elections in this regard and will be a permanent provision which may be used in the case of any future Údaras elections.</P>
      <P>There has been a trend in recent years towards the holding of two or more polls together whenever this is possible.  It effects certain cost savings, mainly arising from employing one set of staff on polling day.  A further advantage in holding the polls together is that it will obviate the necessity for closing schools on two different occasions, thereby avoiding unnecessary disruption of the school year.  Of course, it also makes for greater convenience for the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European election date has already been set for 15 June and, in <Col N="116" /> accordance with the law, Údarás elections must be held not later than 17 October of this year.  I think the House will agree that the sensible course is to have the two elections run concurrently.</P>
    <P>Section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963, provides for detailed matters in relation to the holding of two or more polls together such as the use of the same official mark on ballot papers for each poll, the use of different coloured ballot papers, and the use of the same, or different ballot boxes for each poll.</P>
    <P>The section also gives the Minister power to provide, by direction, order or regulation, for such matters as he considers necessary to facilitate the holding of two or more polls together.  A direction, order or regulation made under section 91 may define the powers and duties of returning officers and of any person employed in connection with the polls, and may make such modifications in Acts, orders or regulations relating to the taking of the polls or the counting of votes as may be necessary to facilitate the taking of the polls together.</P>
    <P>Section 91 also provides for the apportionment of costs where these fall to be borne by different agencies.  As we know, the cost of Presidential, Dáil and European elections are met by the Central Fund; local election costs are defrayed by the local authorities concerned and the cost of Údarás elections by Aire na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mba chóir dom focal a rá faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar is eol do Theachtaí, bunaíodh an tÚdarás ar an gcéad lá d'Eanáir 1980, d'fhonn caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Trí chomhalta dhéag atá ar an Údarás.  Toghann pobal na Gaeltachta seachtar agus ceapann Aire na Gaeltachta seisear eile ar a n-áirítear an Cathaoirleach.  Toghcháin dhaonlathacha a bhíonn ann don seachtar ar phrionsabal na hionadaíochta cionúire agus ar mhodh an aonghutha inaistrithe &mdash; faoi mar a bhíonn ann do chomhairleoiri contae.  Is mar seo a leanas a <Col N="117" /> bhíonn na hionadaithe do na limistéir Ghaeltachta sna contaetha eagsúla:</P>
    <P>&mdash;beirt do Dhún na nGall</P>
    <P>&mdash;triúr do Ghaillimh, do Mhaigh Eo agus don Mhí le chéile, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;beirt do Chiarraí, do Chorcaigh agus do Phort Láirge le chéile.</P>
    <P>Is ar 17 Deireadh Fómhair 1984 a bhí an toghchán is deanaí ann don Údarás agus faoin Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ní foláir toghcháin a chur ar siúl i gceann tréimhsí nach giorra ná ceithre bliana ná nach faide na cúig bliana.  Mar sin ní mór an chéad toghchán eile a chur ar siúl idir seo agus lár mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.  Faoi mar dúradh is é atá beartaithe ná an toghchán don Údarás a chur ar siúl ar an lá céanna le Toghcháin na hEorpa, sé sin ar 15 Meitheamh seo chugainn.  Ach an Bille seo a bheith rite déanfaidh Aire na Gaeltachta ordú a shocróidh an lá sin mar an lá votaíochta le haghaidh toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi mar a dúirt an tAire in a óráid is é an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach faoi láthair ná chun ceadú don Aire toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheith ann an lá céanna a mbeidh toghcháin na hEorpa ann, is é sin an 15ú Meitheamh seo chugainn. An toghchán deireannach do Údarás na Gaeltachta bhí sé ar an 17ú Deireadh Fómhair 1984.  Mar sin caithfidh an chéad toghchán eile don Údarás a bheith ann roimh an 17ú Deireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta féin is féidir na toghcháin a bheith ann aon uair idir ceithre bliana agus cúig bliana tar éis an toghcháin a chuaigh roimhe sin.  Mar sin d'fhéadfadh an toghchán a bheith ann aon uair ón 17ú Deireadh Fómhair seo caite.  Ó tharla go bhfuil toghcháin na hEorpa ann ar an 15ú Meitheamh agus nach bhfuil fágtha ag na seacht mbaill atá tofa ag muintir na Gaeltachta ach trí mhí in a dhiaidh sin, níl aon rud againn anseo, i bprionsabal, i gcoinne an méid atá a dhéanamh sa <Col N="118" /> Bhille seo.  Sílim nuair a bheidh an dá thoghchán ar an lá céanna go mbeidh siad in a gcuidiú ag a chéile agus go n-éireoidh linn b'fhéidir níos mó daoine a thabhairt amach chun páirt a ghlacadh sna toghcháin.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na deacrachtaí a bhí againn sna blianta a chuaigh thart le toghcháin na hEorpa ná an líon iseal daoine a tháinig amach ag vótáil.  Go minic bhí sé timpeall 50 faoin gcéad nó beagáinín os a cionn agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus go speisialta leis an cheantar Gaeltachta a bhfuil eolas agam fein air, sílim go gcabhróidh toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta le níos mó daoine a thabhairt amach sna Gaeltachtaí ar a laghad agus go gcuideoidh sé leis an uimhir a dhéanann vótáil ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go bhfuil dearcadh eile maidir leis an cheist seo, go bhfuil daoine den bharúil gur chóir go mbeadh toghcháin na Gaeltachta ann lá dóibh féin agus go mbeadh feachtas ar leith fá choinne toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta, sa dóigh go mbeadh deis ag na hiarrthóirí, ha heagraíochtaí, na gluaiseachtaí, na cumainn agus na dreamanna ar fad a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht plé a dhéanamh ar cheist na Gaeltachta agus ar chúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an cás a chiorú go mion.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuimhnítear nach bhfuil fágtha ach roinnt seachtainí idir an dá thoghcháin agus an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire, tá ciall le é a bheith againn ar an 15ú Meitheamh.  Ní shílim gur gá aon fhaitíos a bheith ar aon duine nuair a bheidh an toghchán ar siúl nach ndéanfaidh na hiarrthóirí na ceisteanna a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht agus leis an Údarás a phlé go mion agus go minie.  Tá sé á dhéanamh cheana féin ar na meáin chumarsaíde agus sílim, i rith an fheachtais sna Gaeltachtaí ar a laghad go mbeidh tús áite ag toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta mar go bhfeiceann muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé níos giorra dóibh ná Parlaimint na hEorpa fiú amháin.</P>
    <P>Anseo sa chathair agus pairteanna eile den tír measann na daoine nach bhfuil anseo ach toghchán an-bheag ar fad agus nach bhfuil puinn tábhachta leis.  Ach má amharcann tú ar staitisticí ar na daonáir-imh <Col N="119" /> is deanaí, 1986, feicfidh tú go bhfuil beagnach 84,000 duine in a gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí: 83,430 people, according to the latest census statistics are living in Gaeltacht areas, an increase from 79,502 in 1981.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil 83,000 sa Ghaeltacht anois mar tá an imirce níos measa ansin ná sa chuid eile den tír, ach ar a laghadh tá timpeall 81,000 duine in a gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí, agus tá sé sin go mór le dáilcheantair a bhfuil ceithre suíochán nó cúig suíochán ann.</P>
    <P>Deirtear linn go mbfhéidir go mbeidh toghchán eile ann an lá sin, an fo-thoghchán i Sligeach-Liatroim.  Ní shílim go bhfuil aon socrú faoi sin go fóill.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil tuairimí ag an Aire maidir leis sin.  Ach tá toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta go díreach chomh tábhachtach nó níos tábhachtaí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná fo-thoghchán an dáilcheantair sin.  Tá an oiread céanna daoine i gceist agus ba mhaith liom an rud seo a chur i gcomhthéacs.  Mar a dúirt an tAire, tá trí dháilcheantair Gaeltachta a bhíonn páirteach in Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I mo chontae féin, Dún na nGall, tá dáilcheantar amháin in a bhfuil 26,000 duine in a gcónaí.  Ansin na dáilcheantair eile, tá Maigh Eo, Gaillimh agus Gaeltacht na Mí.  I Maigh Eo tá 13,109; i nGaillimh, 29,614, do réir na bhfigiúirí a bhí againn i 1986.  B'fhéidir nach n-aontaíonn an Teachta Higgins nó an Teachta Molloy leis na figiúirí sin ach sin iad na figiúirí a cuireadh ar fáil go hoifigiúil.  I nGaeltacht na Mí tá 1,272 agus tá sé de cheart acu trí iarrthóirí a thoghadh do Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sílim go bhfuil conspóid faoin cheist sin.  Tá an Teachta in a chónaí sa cheantar agus sílim go mbeadh níos mó eolais aige ar na deacrachtaí sin ná fiú amháin a mbeadh agamsa nach mbíonn i nGailimh chomh minic agus ba mhaith liom.  Aon uair a mbím i nGaillimh bainim an-taitneamh as mo chuairt <Col N="120" /> ansin.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh mé ann go minic agus go speisialta nuair a bheas an feachtas seo ar siúl.</P>
      <P>An tríú dáilcheantar atá againn ná Cúige Mumhan &mdash; Corcaigh, Ciarraí agus Port Láirge, agus tá sé de cheart acu sin dhá iarrthóir a thoghadh, is é sin seachtar ar fad, agus beidh na sé ball eile ainmnithe ag an Rialtas.</P>
      <P>Is iad na feidhmeanna atá ag an Údarás ná an Ghaeilge, an cultúr agus an traidisiún a chothú agus a chaomhnú, mar a dúirt an tAire in a óráid, agus chomh maith leis sin, fostaíocht, tionsclaíocht agus slí bheatha a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfuil an obair sin á déanamh chomh maith agus is féidir leis an Údarás nuair a chuimhnimid ar na deacrachtaí atá acu le cúpla bliain anuas, go mór mhór chomh fada agus a théann sé le cúrsaí airgid.  Má dhearcaimid ar dtús ar an méid atá le déanamh acu leis an teanga: tá scéimeanna acu chun an teanga agus an cultúr a chur ar aghaidh; scéimeanna soisialta; corr uair bíonn dramaíocht acu agus mar sin de.  Tá scéimeanna fiúntacha forbairt pobail acu. Tá a fhios agam, go mór mhór san iarthar go bhfuil an eagraíocht ar a dtugtar Muintearas na nOileán, agus go bhfuil siad ag déanamh an-obair maidir le forbairt soisialta agus oideachais san taobh sin den tír.  Tá súil agam nuair a thiocfaidh an chéad Údarás eile i réim go mbeidh siad ábalta leathnú amach agus Gaeltachtaí cosúil le Tír Chonaill agus an deisceart a thabhairt isteach faoin a sciatháin chomh maith.  Tá dreamanna againn féin, mar is eol don Aire Stáit, Gael Uladh, atá ag tabhairt faoi chúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht ó thuaidh anois, agus ba mhaith linn go mbeadh ceangal eatharthu agus go mbeadh comhoibriú acu len a chéile.</P>
      <P>Sul a cuireadh an tÚdarás ar bun i 1979, ba é Gaeltarra Éireann a bhí i mbun forbartha sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Ar an chéad lá d'Eanáir 1980 ghlac an tÚdarás an cúram sin orthu féin.  Sílim go bhfuil dul chun cinn fiúntach déanta sna deich mbliana atá imithe ó shin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I 1979 bhí beagán os cionn 1,000 duine fostaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta ag a raibh baint ag Gaeltarra Éireann leo. Faoi láthair, i 1989, tá breis agus 5,000 <Col N="121" /> duine fostaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta i dtionscail a chuidigh an tÚdarás leo. Ceann de na dul chun cinn móra atá déanta ná go bhfuil eagsúlachtaí tionscal sna Gaeltachtaí anois.  Sa sean am bhí na tionscail bunaithe ar chniotáil, éadaigh agus mar sin de, ach tá siad tar éis an bun a leathnú amach.  I mo cheantar féin tá tionscal an-nua-aimsearach ag baint le innealtóireacht, earraí leictreonacha, earraí plaisticeacha, agus tá próiseáil bí agus rudaí mar sin ar bun ag an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí móra eile atá déanta ag an Údarás, go speisialta le ceithre nó cúig bliana anuas, ná go bhfuil siad mar cheannródaithe ar fheirmeoireacht éisc, agus tá sé ag dul le bheith in a thionscal an-mhór san am atá le teacht. Beidh a lán daoine ag obaiar agus tá na ceantair Ghaeltachtá thar a bheith oiriúnach agus fóirsteanach do thionscail mar sin.  Tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta, ar an mór-chuid, in iarthar na tíre, an chuid is mó acu ar chósta farraige agus tá siad anoiriúnach do fheirmeoireacht éisc.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé de phribhléid agam cuairt a thabhairt ar chuid de na hionaid seo i gcaitheamh an tsamhraidh anuraidh agus chuir sé iontas orm an obaír fhiúntach atá á déanamh go speisialta in iarthar na Gaillimhe.  Is iontach an rud é go bhfuil níos mó bradán á gcur ar fáil sna feirmeacha éisc ansin ná mar atá á bhfáil ag na hiascairí agus iad ag iascaireacht ar an fharraige.</P>
    <P>Sin cuid den obair thábhachtach atá á déanamh ag an Údarás agus sin cuid den dul chun cinn atá déanta sna Gaeltachtaí le deich mbliana aruas.  Mar sin féin aontaímid uilíg go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag an Údarás le cúpla bliain.  Tá gearradh siar ar an méid airgid a cuireadh ar fáil dóibh. Cuir i gcás i mbliana an liúntas caipitil a sholáthraíodh, tá sé 13 faoin gcéad níos lú ná mar a tugadh dóibh anuraidh.  Agus an méid a tugadh dóibh anuraidh, tá sé 13 faoin gcéad níos lú ná an méid a fuair siad an bhliain roimhe sin.  Sílim go bhfuil maolú, beagán ná morán, ar ghníomhaireacht an Údaráis le bliain anuas.  Tá a fhios againn ar feadh beagnach bliana, ón am seo anuraidh go dtí deireadh na bliana nó go dtí mí Eanáir nó Feabhra, gur beag tionscal a cheadaigh an tÚdarás <Col N="122" /> mar nach riabh aon airgead fágtha acu. Ón eolas atá agam féin anois tá liúntas na bliana seo beagnach ídithe cheana féin agus gan leath na bliana imithe go fóill.</P>
    <P>Sin ceann de na deacrachtaí móra agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh chun a iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aire na hachmhainní a thabhairt don Údarás chun fostaíocht a chur ar bun sna ceantair Ghaeltachta chun maolú ar an imirce agus chun na daoine óga a choinneáil sa bhaile agus an teanga a choinneáil beo.</P>
    <P>Tá deacracht eile ag an Údarás.  Bíonn iomaíocht idir iad féin agus na heagraíochtaí eile a bhíonn ag plé le fostaíocht, an IDA agus SFADCo.  Sna blianta a chuaigh thart bhí bunntáistí ag an Údarás.  Bhí siad ábalta coinníollacha níos fearr a thairiscint do thionsclóirí a rachadh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá athrú tar éis teacht air sin.  Níl na leibhéil deontais atá an tÚdarás ag tabhairt anois puinn níos fearr ná mar atá á dhéanamh ag an IDA nó SFADCo.  Níl sé sin ceart mar tá an tÚdarás ag deileáil le ceantair atá ar imeall na tíre ar fad go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra acu ó thaobh infrastructure de agus cúrsaí cumarsáide. Má tá monarcha le fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus monarcha le fáil in aice le Baile Atha Cliath, tá an claonadh ann i gcónaí go rachaidh an tionsclóir isteach sa mhonarcha níos cóngaraí don phríomh-chathair agus do na margaí ar an mór Roinn ná mar atá siad in iarthar na tíre.  Mar an gcéanna, cuir i gcás na monarchana atá ag an Údarás, nuair a chuirtear monarcha amach ar cíos, is é an cíos ar mhonarcha faoi láthair, de réir an Roinn Airgeadais, ná £21.51 an meadar cearnach.  Tá an ráta sin náisiúnta agus céacu má tá an mhonarcha anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath nó ar Oileán Árainn, tá an cíos céanna le híoc.  Bhí sé de cheart ag an Údarás fordheontas a thabhairt mar &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; ar mhonarchain mar sin, agus bhí sé de cheart acu é a thabhairt ar feadh 15 bliana.  De bharr na ngearrthaí siar agus an ghanntanas airgid b'éigean dóibh an téarma sin a ghearradh anuas go dtí deich mbliana.  Is féidir leis na heagraíochtaí eile fordheontas a thabhairt ar <Col N="123" /> feadh chúig bliana.  Mar sin, tá buntáiste caillte ag an Údarás chomh maith, agus méid an fhordheontais féin, is é sin an méid airgid a thugann siad mar fhordheontas leis an chíos a íoc don mhonarchain, tá sé sin íslithe chomh maith, agus, arís, pé buntáiste a bhí acu tá sé sin imithe.  Agus, mar a dúirt mé, caithfimid cuimhneamh i gcónaí go bhfuil an tÚdarás ag plé le forbairt agus cruthú postanna in iarthar na tíre sna ceantair imeallacha.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid go léir, agus go speisialta an Rialtas agus Roinn na Gaeltachta, an cheist a athscrúdú, agus na buntáistí a bhí ag an Údarás &mdash; ní raibh siad an-mhór ach mar sin féin bhí siad riachtanach &mdash; a chur ar fáil dóibh arís sa dóigh is go dtig leo leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dul chun cinn mór a rinne siad sna chéad deich mbliana a bhíi siad ag gníomhú mar eagraíocht a bhí i mbun chruthú fostaíochta sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Anois, chomh maith leis sin, agus bím ag caint go minic air, ba cheart cumhachtaí breise a chur ar fáil don Údarás, Agus ceann de na háiteacha a luíonn sé liom a bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh ná ar réimse na turasóireachta.  Tá sé sin déanta cheana féin.  Tuigim go bhfuil freagracht ar SFADCo maidir le cur chun cinn na turasóireachta ina gceantar féin.  Agus na ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fad is ceantair thurasóireachta iad.  Tá na radharcanna go hálainn agus na tránna agus mar sin de, agus bíonn tarraingt an phobail go dtí na ceantair sin, agus sílim go bhféadfaí smaoineamh ar ról éigin a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta chun cuar chun cinn na turasóireachta a dhéanamh sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Níl mé ag rá go bhféadfadh siad dul amach ag margaíocht, ach ar a laghad go bhféadfadh siad áiseanna a chur ar fáil a bheadh fóirsteanach do dhaoine a théann ansin ar a gcuid laethanta saoire.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile a d'fhéadfadh an tÚdarás a dhéanamh, is é sin an cultúr agus an teanga agus an traidisiún a thabhairt chun cinn, mar cuireann a lán daoine, go speisialta na daoine a thagann ón Mhór-roinn, suim sa rud seo, sa chultúr, sa traidisiún, sna mionteangacha, agus nuair a thagann siad anseo déarfainn go bhfuil an-suim <Col N="124" /> acu i gceantair a bhfuil teanga na Gaeilge á labhairt ann, agus cultúr agus traidisiúin na hÉireann.  Sin áit gur mhaith liom go n-amharcfadh an tAire agus an Roinn uirthi.  Mar is eol do gach duine, tá an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge féin faoi ionsaí.  Tá na meáin chumarsáide uilig i mBéarla, taobh amuigh de Raidió na Gaeltachta féin, agus ó cuireadh ar bun Raidió na Gaeltachta tá cúig bliana déag nó sé bliana déag ó shin ann, tá an-obair déanta acu chun na ceantair Ghaeltachta a thabhairt le chéile agus chun an teanga a labhairt agus a chur ar bhéala na ndaoine.</P>
    <P>Tá ré an raidió tábhachtach, ach tá ré na teilifíse anseo anois, agus sílim gur chóir dúinn amharc ar conas mar is féidir bealach teilifíse a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do lucht na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Tuigim go bhfuil teagmháil idir an Roinn agus Údarás na Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire maidir le seo a chur ar fáil.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liom féin agus le páirtí Fhine Gael, táimid go mór i bhfábhar go mbeadh rud éigin cinnte déanta ansin agus go gcuirfí seirbhís teilifíse Ghaeilge ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do na Gaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre.  Taispeánann Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil éileamh ar an chineál sin ruda, agus tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh sé le fáil ar an teilifís go mbeadh sé fiú amháin níos éifeachtaí.</P>
    <P>Anois, cúpla pointe eile san am atá fágtha agam.  Chaill an Rialtas deis nár áirigh siad an Ghaeltacht mar réigiún amháin nuair a bhí siad ag déanamh amach a bplean forbartha agus á chur ar aghaidh chuig an Eoraip.  Tá an Ghaeltacht roinnte suas ina píosaí, tá sí istigh le cúpla réigiún, agus de thairbhe go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Roinn na Gaeltachta ansin is mór an trua ar fad nár cuireadh cás na Gaeltachta mar réigiún amháin agus déileáil léi mar sin. Tá na deacrachtaí céanna sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fad.  Ag teacht ar ais go dtí an Bille, mar a dúirt mé, is é an príomhphointe atá sa Bhille seo ná an toghchán a bheith ann ar an chúigiú lá déag de mhí Meithimh, agus ó tharla go bhfuil an téarma atá ag na baill tofa beagnach rite sílim go mbeadh muidne <Col N="125" /> ag aontú i bprionsabal leis an rud sin sa Bhille.</P>

      <P>Os rud é go raibh baint chomh mór sin agam leis an sórt feachtais a bhí ar siúl chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú an chéad lá riamh, tá mé cinnte ag an bpointe seo go raibh an ceart againn ag an am go mba chóir údarás den sórt seo a bhunú do na ceantair Ghaeltachta chun iad a chaomhnú agus a neartú chun postanna a chur ar fáil do na daoine a bhí ina gcónaí iontu.  Cé go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é caithfear a rá go bhféadfaí i bhfad níos mo dul chun cinn a dhéanamh dá dtabharfaí cead a chinn don Údarás an obair a dhéanamh.  Creidim go bhfuil an iomarca srian á chur ar obair an Údaráis ag Rialtais le roinnt bheag blianta anuas, agus cé go bhfuil suas le cúig mhíle post sna ceantair Ghaeltachta anois i dtograí a fuair cabhair trí Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá na mílte eile imithe as na ceantair sin agus ag obair thar lear i Meiriceá, san Astráil agus i Sasana, a lán acu, agus is mór an chailliúint é sin don tír seo.</P>
      <P>Cheapas féin, nuair a bunaíodh an tÚdarás, go mbeadh cumhacht agus airgeadú ag an Údarás chun i bhfad níos mó dul chun cinn a dhéanamh sa tréimhse atá caite anois.  Tá deich mbliana caite ó bunaíodh é.  Creidim go raibh sé tábhachtach go mbeadh toghchán ann don Údarás, go mbeadh ionadaithe tofa ag an Údarás, agus go mbeadh siad sa tromlach, agus is de bharr go bhfuil siad ann, ceapaim, atá dul chun cinn déanta ag an Údarás, agus is de bharr go bhfuil siad ann a fheictear do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil baint éigin acu le hobair an Údaráis agus nach bhfuil an sórt seanscéal i gceist i gcónaí nó fós, is é sin, go mbeadh daoine a bheadh fostaithe sna Ranna Stáit nó údaráis Stáit ag labhairt síos do dhaoine. Creidim go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta acu siúd atá ag obair san Údarás, go mbíonn siad ag labhairt leis na daoine in ionad, mar a bhíodh, ag labhairt síos chucu, agus ag tabhairt beagán airde ar na rudaí a bhí ag teastáil ó na daoine iad féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is uafásach an rud é ar fad, dar ndóigh, <Col N="126" /> go bhfuil an méid sin daoine imithe anois as na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Dar ndóigh, tá siad ag imeacht as na ceantair eile chomh maith ar fud na tíre, ach is iad na ceantair Ghaeltachta is mó atá bánaithe de bharr easpa oibre.  B'fhearr liom, dá mbeadh sé de rogha agam féin, go mbeadh an toghchán seo ar siúl leis féin, ionas go mbeadh díospóireacht ar siúl, ní amháin sna ceantair bheaga, mar a bheadh anois, ach ar fud na tíre, agus go mbeadh aird na tíre dírithe ar cad a bhí ar siúl sna Gaeltachtaí, cad a bhí déanta ag an Údarás agus cad a d'fhéadfadh sé a dhéanamh, agus go mbeadh díospóireacht iomlán ar fud na tíre faoi agus go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó le cloisteáil faoi ar raidió agus teilifís.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil dainséar ann anois go bhfuil sé beartaithe an toghchán a bheith ar an lá céanna do Pharlaimint na hEorpa, mar atá á mholadh sa Bhille seo anois.  Tá an dainséar ann nach dtabharfar mórán airde ar an toghchán é féin agus nach mbeadh páirteach ann ach amháin na daoine atá ina gcónaí sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus gur beag eolas nó suim, b'fhéidir, a bheidh ag na daoine ina gcónaí in áiteacha eile ar fud na tíre sa toghchán.  Má tharlaíonn sé mar sin, is dona an rud é.  Anois, nílimid ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille, mar ní fiú seasamh ina choinne, os rud é gur chuir Fine Gael in iúl go bhfuil réiteach speisialta éigin déanta acu leis an Rialtas, le baill atá ar an mbord cheana féin a choinneáil, nó rud éigin mar sin.  Ach tá sé fógartha ag Fine Gael nach bhfuil siad ag cur ina gcoinne, agus tá formhór mo pháirtí féin den tuairim, os rud é go bhfuil costas i gceist, go mba chóir dúinn dul ar aghaidh leis an rud.  Ó mo thaobh pearsanta de, feicim na hargóintí, na buntáistí a bheadh ann dá mbeadh an toghchán fágtha leis féin, ach tar éis an méid sin a rá, nílimid ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nach bhfuil?  Tá an ráfla sin ag dul thart go bhfuil socrú éigin déanta ag Fine Gael leis an Rialtas.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh tú féin in ann tuilleadh a rá faoi sin.  Tá pointí a ba mhaith liom a <Col N="127" /> chur os comhair na nAirí atá anseo anois. Is é sin, mar a dúirt mé, faoin srian atá á chur ar obair an Údaráis ag an Rialtas. Creidim, an méid airgid atá curtha ar fáil sa Mheastachán don bhliain seo don Údarás, go mbeidh sé sin ar fad caite tar éis tréimhse bheag eile.  Tar éis an chéad chruinniú eile de Bhord an Údaráis ní bheidh aon airgead fágtha acu chun tograí a airgeadú.  Tharla an rud céanna anuraidh, go bhfuil gearradh siar chomh dian sin ar an Údarás nach bhfuil siad in ann brú ar aghaidh le tograí atá ag teacht os a gcomhair, nach bhfuil siad in ann iad a cheadú.  Is é an rud a tharla anuraidh ná ag deireadh na bliana chuir an Rialtas trí mhilliún sa bhreis ar fáil trí Mheastachán Forlíontach a chur os comhair na Dála. Ach cuireann sé sin an-bhrú ar obair an Údaráis agus ní thugann sé cead a gcinn dóibh a sárdhícheall a dhéanamh mar a theastaíonn uathu.  Cuireann sé deac rachtaí ag brú isteach orthu.  Is olc an rud e.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cén fáth go bhfuil an Rialtas ag obair ar an mbealach seo leis an Údarás, nuair a smaoiníonn tú cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé postanna nua a chur ar fáil sa cheantar.  Má tá tograí atá go maith, atá ceadaithe ag an mbord agus a bhfuil an tAire sásta leo, creidim go mba chóir go mbeadh deifir air iad a cheadú in ionad iad a choinneáil siar.  Anois, tuigim &mdash; agus is féidir leis an Aire é seo a shéanadh nó a fhreagairt nuair a bhíonn sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht seo &mdash; nuair a tugadh an trí mhilliún breise don Udarás anuraidh go raibh coinníollacha ag baint leis sin agus gur ceann de na coinníollacha nach gceadódh an tÚdarás feasta deontais seasca a sé agus dhá thrian sa chéad, mar tá sé de chead acu, agus nach bhfuil an tÚdarás anois ag ceadú ach deontais suas le daichead sa chéad, go bhfuil an riail sin i bhfeidhm i gcásanna áirithe atá tábhachtach, agus de bharr na rialach sin tá sé tar éis titim amach anois go bhfuil an IDA in ann deontais i bhfad níos mó ná sin a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bhfuil tograí acu. Mar atá ráite ag an Teachta McGinley tá SFADCo in ann deontais a thabhairt do dhaoine atá i bhfad níos mó anois ná mar <Col N="128" /> atá an tÚdarás in ann a thabhairt.  Má tá sé sin fíor, agus de réir an eolais a fuair mise tá sé fíor, is uafásach an scéal é.</P>
    <P>Cad é polasaí an Rialtais ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de?  Má tá sé mar a deir siad, go bhfuil polasaí acu fós tionsclaíocht a chur chun cinn, obair a chur ar fáil iontu, agus an tÚdarás mar uirlis chun é sin a bhaint amach, cén fáth go bhfuil na coinníollacha chomh dian seo atá ag cur anuas orthu ionas go bhfuil siad anois ag titim taobh thiar den IDA agus de SFADCo?  Cén fáth, de réir pholasaí an Rialtais, go mba chóir go mbeadh na ceantair Ghaeltachta thíos leis?  Ní thuigim cén fáth go mbeadh sé mar sin. Creidim chomh maith gur ceann eile de na coinníollacha a bhí ag baint leis an mbreis airgid trí mhilliún punt sin nach rachfaí ar aghaidh a thuilleadh le réamh-mhonarchana a thógáil.  Tá an stáid ann anois nach bhfuil réamh-mhonarcha fholamh ar fáil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ina lán de na ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus go bhfuil a lán réamh-mhonarchana réidh ag an IDA.  Mar sin, má tá daoine ag teacht le tograí nua tá rogha iontach le taispeáint dóibh ag an IDA agus, is dócha, ag SFADCo chomh maith seachas mar atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí faoi leith sna ceantair Ghaeltachta gan tuilleadh deacrachtaí a bhrú anuas orthu.  Mar sin, má tá na rudaí seo atá mé ag rá fíor, cuireann sé ceistmharc mór taobh thiar de pholasaí an Rialtais.  Cad díreach atá i gceist ag an Rialtas?  An bhfuil siad dáiríre faoi pholasaí ceart a bheith acu?  Má tá, ní féidir liomsa aon chiall a bhaint as mar atá sé.  Cén fáth a mbeadh an tÚdarás thíos ó thaobh an IDA agus ó thaobh SFADCo?  Chomh maith leis sin, cloisim go bhfuil an-bhrú ag an Rialtas ar an Údarás anois fo-chomhlachtaí agus scaireanna a dhíol agus iad féin a airgeadú de bharr an teacht isteach a gheobhfadh siad ó na comhlachtaí seo.  Credim, i gcásanna áirithe, go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh sé ciallmhar polasaí éigin den sórt sin a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>De réir mar a thuigim tá an brú chomh mór sin ag teacht ón Rialtas go bhfuil sé de iachall ar an Údarás anois monarchana <Col N="129" /> nó comhlachtaí a dhíol ar phraghas an-bheag, agus go bhfuil sé chomh beag sin nach bhfuil siad in ann a n-infheistíocht féin a fháil ar ais i gceart ó na praghsanna seo.  Luaim dhá chás a raibh socrú éigin déanta fúthu agus is é toradh an ruda, flú amháin an Roinn féin nó an tAire, sa deireadh, nach raibh sé sásta ligean don díolachán dul ar aghaidh.  Agus ceistím anseo é, cad tá ag tarlú faoi Europlast? Agus cad tá ag tarlú faoi Spudz agus an réiteach a bhí déanta?  Agus cén fáth go bhfuil moill chomh fada sin ag baint leis an dá mhonarcha sin agus an todhchaí dóibh?  Creidim chomh maith go bhfuil an infheistíocht a rinneadh in Carrolls le díol.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin go maith, ach cad faoin bpraghas?  An bhfuil an praghas ceart?  Creidim go bhfuil tionscal teicstíle eile le díol.</P>
    <P>Má tá an tÚdarás ag díol monarchana den sórt sin ar phraghas an-íseal, tá ceist éigin le freagairt ag an Aire.  Deirtear liom go bhfuil sé i gceist ag Carrolls &mdash; agus tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith á dhéanamh acu de réir gach tuairisc &mdash; i leith na monarchana agus na &ldquo;fish-cages&rdquo; atá lonnaithe acu sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ina bhfuil siad ag tógáil bradán, monarcha próiseála a chur ar bun chun tairbhe agus brabach níos mó a bhaint as na bradáin sin.  Ach tá an-seans ann anois go mbunófar cuid de na monarchana próiseála seo taobh amuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta, de bharr an difear atá idir na deontais.  Creidim go bhfuil Carrolls ag caint le SFADCo le monarcha deataithe bradán a bhunú i gceantar SFADCo. Téim ar ais chuig an gceist a bhí agam níos luaithe: cén chiall atá leis sin?  Fiú amháin i ndáilcheantar an Aire é féin tá monarcha mhór tar éis dúnadh síos i mBéal Átha Mhuirthead: Babygro.  Bhí céad post ann, agus ba mhór an trua gur theip ar an gcomhlacht sin.  Bheadh gach uile dhuine ag súil go mbeadh an tÚdarás ag obair go díograiseach chun monarcha nó tionscal éigin eile nua a chur isteach san fhoirgneamh sin chun fostaíocht a chur ar siúl dóibh siud atá tar éis a bpostanna a chailliúint.</P>
    <P>De réir an Mheastacháin i mbliana, de réir an srian atá á ghearradh anuas ar an Údarás ag an Rialtas de bharr na <Col N="130" /> gcoinníollacha a bhaineann le hairgeadú na bliana seo caite, ní bheidh sé ar chumas an Údaráis anois deontas airgid a chur ar fáil, fiú amháin dá mbeadh duine éigin le togra le dul in áit Babygro i mBéal Atha Mhuirthead.  Anois, tá suim faoi leith ag an dá Aire atá i gceist agam sa cheist sin, agus tá daoine ar mhaith leo freagraí a chloisteáil uathu.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile, agus cé go bhfuil na páirtithe a bhíonn sa Fhreasúra ag argóint go mba chóir é seo a dhéanamh, nuair a théann siad isteach sa Rialtas ní dhéanann siad é.  Is é sin ná tuilleadh cumhachtaí. Chuala mé an Teachta McGinley ag labhairt faoi.  Bhí a pháirtí féin thall ansin mar Rialtas le haghaidh chuid mhaith blianta agus níor tháinig aon athrú mór ar an scéal ó thaobh tuilleadh cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás.  Rinneadh tuarascáil ar thionscal na turasóireachta. Cuireadh an taighde ar bun chun a thaispeáint an chaoi a bhféadfadh siad páirt fhiúntach a ghlacadh chun tionscal na turasóireachta a chur chun cinn go díograiseach taobh istigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Ach níor ghlac an Rialtas leis na moltaí, cé gur cuireadh moltaí áirithe, de réir a thuigim, os a gcomhair ag an Údarás.  Tá sé dothuigthe agamsa, mar sin ceann de na cumhachtaí breise ba chóir a thabhairt láithreach don Údarás agus d'fhéadfadh siad an-obair a dhéanamh dá mbeadh cumhacht acu turasóireacht a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tar éis an méid seo a rá, bhí mé ag teacht anseo as Gaillimh ag éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta ar dhíospóireacht a bhí ann ar maidin, díospóireacht anchiallmhar, an-suimiúil, ag cur síos ar cad ab fhéidir a dhéanamh sna Gaeltachtaí ó thaobh na turasóireachta de.  Tá sé ráite ag an Rialtas go bhfuil sé mar cheann de na príomhpholasaithe acu tuilleadh postanna a chur ar fáil sa tír seo trí thionscal na turasóireachta.  Níl aon chruthúnas le feiceáil, sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ar aon nós, go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoi seo, nó má tá siad dáiríre níl aon chruthúnas á dhéanamh acu nó go bhfuil sé beartaithe acu aon rud fiúntach a dhéanamh chun cabhrú le tionscal turasóireachta láidir a bhunú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  An gearán is mó a bhí le <Col N="131" /> cloisteáil ó dhaoine i gConamara a bhí ar an raidió ar maidin ná go dtagann na turasóirí isteach ina gcarranna, tiomáineann siad thart ag breathnú timpeall agus imíonn siad amach as arís sula dtiteann an oíche.  Tagann siad isteach, ach níl na háiseanna ann chun iad a choinneáil ann. Tá siad ag dul thar an doras ach níl siad ag fanacht.  Sin an gearán is mó a bhí le cloisteáil.</P>
    <P>Níl Bord Fáilte gníomhach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, de réir mar a fheicimse ó thaobh aon leigheas a fháil ar an scéal seo, agus níl aon chumhacht ag na húdaráis áitiúla, ag na comhairlí contae, aon rud a dhéanamh faoi.  Braitheann sé ar Bhord Fáilte, agus níl mórán airgid nó níl mórán suime acu aon rud den sórt a dhéanamh, nó níl aon pholasaí nó plean leagtha síos ag an Rialtas chun feabhas a chur diaidh ar ndiaidh ar na háiseanna sna ceantair sin.  Mar sin, tá an tÚdarás ann, daoine an-ábalta fostaithe ann agus scileanna iontacha acu.  Tá sé cruthaithe go minic go bhfuil an ábaltacht iontu i bhfad níos mó oibre a dhéanamh sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ná mar atá sé ceadaithe acu a dhéanamh faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Ní theastaíonn uaim aon mhoill a chur ar an Teach.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta as an méid atá déanta acu.  Cé go bhfuil na deacrachtaí atá luaite agam ag brú anuas orthu creidim féin, agus mé ag breathnú orthu agus an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh i gcoinne na ndeacrachtaí sin, go bhfuil jab maith déanta acu.  Ach creidim chomh maith go mbeadh an ábaltacht acu jab i bhfad níos fearr a dhéanamh dá mbeadh an cead acu é a dhéanamh, dá mbeadh an t-airgead acu é á dhéanamh, dá mbeadh an polasaí ag an Rialtas a gcumhachtaí a leathnú amach agus cead a gcinn a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, ní fhéadfá seasamh suas sa Teach seo nó in áit eile go poiblí in Éirinn ag labhairt faoi cheantair Ghaeltachta gan focal a rá faoi dhrochstaid na mbóithre.  Tá siad uafásach ar fad, agus feictear dom, arís, dá mbeadh sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas tuilleadh cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás, sin ceann de <Col N="132" /> na cumhachtaí breise ba chóir a thabhairt dóibh.  Ba chóir airgead a thabhairt don Údarás chun na bóithre beaga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta a chionneáil i gceart agus tearra a chur orthu, na &ldquo;potholes&rdquo; a líonadh isteach agus cúram ceart a thabhairt orthu.</P>
    <P>Is é sin mura bhfuil sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi ó thaobh na n-údarás áitiúil.  Mar sin, tá an tÚdarás ag baint an méid úsáide agus is féidir as an airgead ón gComhphobal faoi scéimeanna ansin, na &ldquo;Special Employment Schemes&rdquo;.  Ach seachas sin, agus is beag ceann is féidir leo a dhéanamh, tá na bóithre ag titim as a chéile.  Tá muintir na Gaeltachta ina gcónaí i dtithe atá ar thaobh bóithre atá ina bpuiteach, agus is cuma leis an Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Sin rud eile a chuireann ionadh orm. Ní haon ionadh, is dócha, sa deireadh thiar thall, go bhfuil an t-aos óg ag rith as an áit, go bhfuil na bóithre chomh dona agus easpa oibre sna ceantair.  Fiú amháin iad siúd atá ag obair, tá an cháin ioncaim uafásach mór sa tír seo ag brú anuas orthu.  Mar sin, tá a lán oibre le déanamh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh aird na tíre dírithe ar an díospóireacht a bheidh ar siúl le linn an toghcháin don Údarás, agus glacaim buíochas leo siúd a d'oibrigh ar Bhord an Údaráis ón toghchán deiridh.</P>
    <P>Tá mo pháirtí sásta, tar éis gach taobh den scéal a phlé, glacadh leis an mBille agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don Rialtas chun an Bille seo a chur ar aghaidh ar an ócáid seo.  An pointe is mó is cúis leis an seasamh seo ná de bharr an sábháil airgead, mar an chaoi ina bhfuil an tír faoi láthair tá sé ciallmhar aon iarracht is féidir leat airgead a shábháil, úsáid a bhaint aisti.  B'fhearr liom mura mbeadh sé mar sin, ach sin mar atá.  Mar sin, beimid sásta ar an ócáid seo tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, deirim go cuireann sé déistin orm i gcónaí a laghad Teachtaí tofa a thagann isteach go dtí an Teach seo.  Ní raibh aon chontúirt ann go mbeadh díospóireacht iomlán Gaeilge ann.  Tá sé ar chuid den chur i gcéill atá sa Teach seo le fada. <Col N="133" /> Le déanaí bhí mé ag scríobh píosa faoi scríobh Bhunreacht na hÉireann i 1937, agus labhair an tUasal MacDermot ar an ócáid seo ar a laghad daoine a bhí ann. Fiú amháin, ghlaoigh Éamon de Valera féin orthu a bheith i láthair chun an díospóireacht i nGaeilge a chur ar aghaidh agus, mar a dúirt duine éigin, mar sórt coimre a dhéanamh air, &ldquo;They folded their tents like Arabs and left when the debate switched to Irish&rdquo;.  Cuireann sé déistin orm.  Níl sé de nós agam míchompord a chur ar dhaoine, ach bhí mé ag smaoineamh, agus tá mé ag smaoin eamh fós, ar chóir dom iarracht a dhéanamh don díospóireacht seo?  Tá sé de dhualgas ar, go háirithe, an Rialtas a bheith dáiríre faoin díospóireacht seo. B'fhéidir gur cheap siad nach mbeadh an díospóireacht seo ann agus go raibh sé socraithe suas le Fine Gael an rud a chur ar aghaidh ar an nod, agus mar sin de. Ach is maith liom a rá agus a dhéanamh soiléir go mbeidh mo pháirtí ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo, de bharr cúiseanna áirithe.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá sé deich mbliana ó cuireadh an tÚdarás ar bun.</P>
      <P>Rinne mé féin a lán iarrachtaí a fháil amach an raibh sé ar intinn ag na hAirí Gaeltachta éagsúla a bhí i gcumhacht Bille 1979 a leasú.  Tá sé agam anseo, agus an díospóireacht i 1979.  Ach bhí sé an-soiléir go raibh míthusicint i gceist.  Ar bhealach amháin dúirt, agus is cara dom é, an tAire Stáit faoi láthair ag Roinn an Taoisigh, go minic, nach bhfuair sé aon iarratas ón Údarás roinnt cumhachtaí breise a fháil.  Ag an am céanna bhí ball tofa dá pháirtí féin ar Raidió na Gaeltachta ag rá go raibh sé ag fanacht ar an Roinn chun moltaí a chur ag aghaidh cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás.  Ar ócáid eile dúirt sé go poiblí go raibh moltaí curtha ar aghaidh ón Údarás faoi chumhachtaí breise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé aige a bhfuil an fhírinne?  Ceapaim go raibh an tAire Stáit ionraic nuair a bhí sé ag tabhairt freagraí domsa, agus glacaim leis sin.  Ach tá míthuiscint an-mhór ann faoin rud.  Chun sórt coimriú a dhéanamh ar an bpointe seo, is rud fíorscannalach é nach mbeadh díospóireacht neamhspleách faoi riachtanais na nGaeltachtaí éagsúla.  Tá Gaeltachtaí <Col N="134" /> agus Gaeltachtaí ann, ach má tá tú ag caint faoi na &ldquo;Gaeltachtaí Oifigiúla&rdquo;, is iontach an rud é nach mbeadh an seans againn na coinníollacha sóisialta eacnamaíochta agus cultúrtha taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí sin a phlé.  Aon duine atá dáiríre faoin scéal, ba chóir go dtógfadh sé nó sí san áireamh an méid daoine atá anseo faoi láthair ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht.  An gceapann éinne go mbeadh an seans céanna aige bunfhíricí na Gaeltachta a thabhairt chun tosaigh nuair a bheadh an díospóireacht ar siúl do fheachtas na hEorpa?  Dáiríre, séard atá i gceist ná sórt straitéise chun na vótálaithe a thabhairt amach.  Ar bhealach, lig an Teachta McGinley an cat as an mála nuair a dúirt sé go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éascaí na vótálaithe a thabhairt amach má tá an dá rud ar siúl ar an lá céanna.</P>
    <P>Is iontach an méid atá tar éis tarlú taobh istigh den réimse ama sin a bhfuil an tÚdarás ann, deich mbliana, mar a dúirt mé.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá an ráta imirce imithe i méid go mór.  Ní chuireann sé as don a lán daoine, go háirithe daoine anseo, mar níl aon áit sa tír a bhfuil an cur i gcéill nó an sórt dalladh mullóige atá á chur ar na heagrais éagsúla atá ag plé le hathbheochan na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ná seo.  Is féidir a rá, mar shampla, nach bhfuil clóscríobhaí ag an gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge faoi láthair. Nuair atá an rúnaí ag cur fógraí amach caithfidh sé iad a chur amach i lámhscríbhinn mar nach bhfuil éinne ann chun cabhair a thabhairt dó, chun fiú amháin clóscríobhán a úsáid.  Mar sin, tá na tuarascálacha go léir ann, ón gcéad chomhchoiste, an dara comhchoiste, go léir i gcló, ag brath ar acmhainní éigin ar chóir iad a chur ar fáil chun na moltaí éagsúla a chur in éifeacht.</P>
    <P>Is cuma liomsa cén Rialtas atá i gcumhacht, má tá tú ag caint faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Níor dearnadh tada sa Teach seo, agus níl aon chabhair á tabhairt faoi láthair, fiú amháin sa Teach seo, don Ghaeilge.  Tá sé de nós, mar shampla, ag an gcuid is mó de na Teachtaí sa Teach seo éirí iontach mífhoighneach ar fad nuair atá tú ag caint Gaeilge.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a chuir mé féin ceisteanna síos <Col N="135" /> don Taoiseach, Aire na Gaeltachta, nach labhraíonn go minic i nGaeilge sa Teach seo, agus a thóg cúram na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge air féin mar go raibh an grá aige don Ghaeilge chomh mór sin.  Tá sé de nós ag daoine rith as an áit, fiú amháin na hiriseoirí.  Fanann duine nó beirt.  Lá amháin d'fhan ceathrar, rud a chuir iontas orm.  Rinneadh stair ar an ócáid sin.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin ar bhealach tá sé &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; ar fad don Rialtas agus an príomh-pháirtí san Fhreasúra a bheith ar aon aigne faoi gan díospóireacht a ligean le muintir na Gaeltachta faoi láthair ar dí fhostaíocht, imirce, drochbhóithre, mar a luaigh an Teachta Molloy, easpa fhorbairt chalafort, easpa aon chóras pleanála, aon pholasaí cultúrtha, easpa cheartanna, dáiríre.  Ní bheadh aon díospóireacht ann, mar nach mbeadh sé áisiúil. B'fhéidir go leanfaidh na baill ainmnithe ar aghaidh go tréimhse bheag eile.  Dá mba rud é go raibh ciall ag baint leis an bplean na toghcháin do Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na toghcháin Eorpacha a bheith ar an lá céanna, cén fáth nár cuireadh plean ar bith faoi na Gaeltachtaí don Eoraip?  Chuir mé ceist síos faoi. Bhí duine de na hoifigigh as Údarás na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú ar an gcoiste comhairle i nGaillimh agus, an coiste comhairle bocht, níor imigh an plean a cheap siadsan ar aghaidh, fiú amháin, don Eoraip.  Ach níor dearnadh tada faoi thaighde a dhéanamh do riachtanais na Gaeltachta, leibhéal eacnamaíochta, sóisialta, cultúrtha.  Táimid sleamhnaithe siar go dtí an cúpla focal arís, ag tús óráidí, ag deireadh óráidí, nó b'fhéidir chun cúpla focal a rá do na turasóirí. B'fhéidir go labhródh an Taoiseach Gaeilge sa tSeapáin.</P>
    <P>Tá agus bhí laigí móra ag baint leis an Údarás ó thús.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, seachtar tofa atá ann, seisear ainmnithe, agus tagann an cathaoirleach as an seisear sin.  An chéad rud, nach raibh seans ann, mar shampla, neamhspleáchas a thabhairt don chathaoirleach.  Cén fáth nach mbeadh an cathaoirleach tofa i measc na mball ar fad, gan a bheith tofa as na daoine ainmnithe.  Mar shampla, agus <Col N="136" /> ceapaim go bhfuil an tAire féin, fear ón nGaeltacht féin, báúil don mhéid seo &mdash; bhí laige mhór ag baint leis an dualgas agus an chumhacht a bhí ag an Údarás i leith cúrsaí cultúrtha, mar shampla.  An chuid den Acht 1979 a bhaineann leis seo tá sé in alt 9 (1):</P>
    <P>For the purpose of promoting the economic, social, cultural, linguistic and physical development of the Gaeltacht, an tÚdarás shall have, in addition to the functions specified in this Act, apart from this section, such powers as are conferred on it by order made by the Government.</P>
    <P>Dá gcuirfí díospóireacht ar bun, bheadh seans againn na ceisteanna seo a chur: Cad iad na cumhachtaí breise a tugadh don Údarás?  Cad iad na cumhachtaí breise a lorgaíodh ón Aire?  Cad iad na cumhachtaí breise a bhí á dtairiscint ag an Roinn don Údarás?  Cén fáth nár tugadh na cumhachtaí breise, go háirithe i leith cúrsaí cultúrtha?</P>
    <P>An deacracht a bhain leis an ghné sin de, in Acht 1979 bhí sé ann ar nós na &ldquo;social aspirations&rdquo; i mBunreacht na hÉireann arís: &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;, and the other pieces of &ldquo;guff&rdquo; which were thrown in for Catholic social teaching of the 1930s padding i mBunreacht na hEireann. Díreach an rud céanna atá in Acht 1979. Níor tugadh an t-airgead don Údarás chun an aidhm seo a bhaint amach, go díreach, mar bhí ceist thíos agam sa Dáil mar gheall air.  Fuair mé freagra air agus sheol mé litir chuig an Údaráis féin, agus fuair mé freagra ar an litir sin.  Is é a d'fhiafraigh mé ná an raibh sé ar intinn ag an Aire duine a fhostú chun an aidhm a luaitear in alt 9.1. a bhaint amach. Bhí an freagra mar is gnáth &ldquo;go gcaithfear aidhmeanna ginearálta an Údaráis a bhaint amach i gcomhthéacs an chiste atá curtha ar fáil dóibh ó bhliain amháin go bliain eile&rdquo; agus mar sin de.  Caithfidh an uile rud géilleadh do na deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta atá á bhfulaingt ag an tír faoi láthair.  Is é a tharla ná gur déanadh tagairt in alt den Acht agus nár tugadh aon chumhacht chun an aidhm sin a thabhairt i gcrích.  D'fhéadfainn samplaí <Col N="137" /> eile a thabhairt daoibh.  Tá an cheist amhlaidh maidir le cumhachtaí eile atá de dhíth ar an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá míthuiscint ann sa mhéid seo.  Ní amháin nach bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag fáil a gcearta ó thaobh bun-sheirbhisí de, go háirithe i gcúrsaí tithíochta, ach is é an tuairim atá ag roinnt údarás áitiúla ná nach orthu atá an cúram seo, toisc go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ann.  Mar shampla, níor bhunaigh Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe aon scéim tithíochta i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe. Cén fáth nár cuireadh aon scéim tithíochta poiblí ar bun leis na blianta? Tá an-chuid daoine san Údarás atá dáiríre faoin obair atá ar siúl acu agus d'iarr siad ar an Roinn agus ar Airí éagsúla cumhachtaí i leith tithíochta a ghéilleadh dóibh faoi Acht 1979.  Níl deis againn an cheist seo a phlé, ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Do chríochnaigh an Teachta Molloy a chuid cainte ar cheist seo na mbóithre. Ábhar grinn é seo i nGaeltacht Chonamara faoi láthair.  Meastar nach fada eile go mbeidh daoine ag dul ag iascaireacht sna &ldquo;potholes&rdquo;, nuair a cheadófar an caitheamh aimsire seo arís.  Bhí mé féin i mo bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe le blianta agus tugadh an freagra céanna ar an gceist seo i gcónaí, go gcaithfear na bóithre go léir a dheisiú as an méid airgid a fhaightear ón Roinn, nach bhfuil aon chiste speisialta ann do bhóithre na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ag magadh faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi láthair agus á maslú nuair a deir an mhuintir sin go mbeidh cothromáiocht acu i ndíospóireacht ar bith faoi chúrsaí Eorpacha agus faoi chúrsaí Gaeltachta.  Luafaidh mé sampla eile.  In Imleabhar Oifigiúil 309, go h-áirithe idir cholúin 35 agus 38 luaigh an Teachta Horgan ag an am go mba fiú smaoineamh ar chúram cúrsaí oideachais, mar shampla, laistigh den Ghaeltacht a thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta McGinley tagairt don obair atá ar bun ag Muintearas na nOileán i Litir Mealláin agus na téacsleabhair atá á gcur ar fáil acu.  Níl siollabas na gcúrsaí nua ar fáil trí Ghaeilge fós sna scoileanna.  Ní amháin nach bhfuil na leabhair ann do na daltaí, go háirithe <Col N="138" /> ag an dara leibhéal ach deir na clódóirí go bhfuil a lán de na leabhair as cló agus nach bhfuil aon ullmhúchán déánta chun leabhair a chur i gcló ina n-áit.  Ach níl siollabas ar fáil go fóill agus mar is gnách, tá sí ina chúis achrainne idir an Roinn agus an curriculum board maidir le cé acu an bhfuil an cúram seo orthu.  An t-aon toradh atá air seo, ná nach bhfuil an siollabas ar fáil ag na Gaeilgeoirí oifigiúla &mdash; masla eile do mhúinteoirí, do scoileanna, do pháistí agus do mhuintir na hÉireann agus do aon duine eile a bhfuil suim aici nó aige i dteagasc na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liom é seo a dhearbhú mar tá an fhianaise agam féin.  Tá triúr de mo chlann féin ag freastal ar scoil lán-Ghaelach agus tuigim go maith a bhfuil le fulaingt acu toisc nach bhfuil a gcearta ó thaobh oideachais de, ar fáil dóibh sna scoileanna&mdash;polasaí scannalach, leisciúil bréan, mí-dhleathach, chun an fhírinne a rá.  Os rud é go bhfuil suim ar leith ag an Aire sa cheist seo beidh sé spéisiúil freagra a fháil ón Aire Rialtas Áitiúil atá i mbun an Bhille seo.  An bhfuair sé comhairle ón Eoraip an dá rud a reachtáil ar an lá céanna, agus an bhfuil siad ansásta leis an seift?</P>
    <P>Nár hiarradh nuair a bhí na bunullmh-úcháin ar siúl do thoghcháin na hEorpa, nach mbeadh aon toghchán eile ar siúl ar an lá céanna?  Ghlac baill eile an Chomhphobail leis sin ach is féidir linne a rá leo go bhfuil toghcháin eile ar siúl ach nach bhfuil morán tábhachta ag baint leo; baineann siad le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Is fiú freagra a fháil ar an mionphointe dlí sin. Ar ndóigh, amach anseo, beidh sé de cheart ag muintir na Gealtachta dul go cúirt na hÉorpa chun a gcearta a bhaint amach.  Tá fear óg i Loughan House faoi láthair toisc gur dhiúltaigh sé fineáil a gearradh air a íoc, de bharr staid na mbóithre.  Sin mar a chaitear i gcónaí le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Iarradh orthu, sa seanchóras polaitíochta, a bheith sásta glacadh le bun riachtanaisí ar bhonn deonach.  Bheidís i dtuilleamaí na bpolaiteoirí éagsúla.  Ach tá bunchearta acu, ó thaobh oideachais agus tithíochta de.</P>
    <P>Fillfidh mé ar laige eile in Acht 1979. Cá háit, san Acht sin, a dtugtar cúram <Col N="139" /> don Údarás córas pleanála ceart a bhunú? Deirtear ann go bhfuil sé de cheart ag an Údarás comhairle a thabhairt agus tá daoine ainmnithe ann chun labhairt ar son an Rialtais agus bíonn na hoifigigh ann chun an scéal a thabhairt ar ais, ar eagla go dtárlódh rud ar bith.  Thairis sin, cén córas pleanála atá ann?  An mó duine atá fostaithe faoi láthair ag plé le cúrsaí pleanála san Údarás?  Céard a tharla do na moltaí a sheol ceardchumainn an Údaráis chuig na hAirí éagsúla leis na blianta ag lorg athstructúrú ar an Údarás? An bhfuair siad freagra?  Mar shampla, ní rabhadar ró-shásta leis an gcaoi ina raibh eolas ag sleamhnú amach ón Údarás, go minic trí bhéal na mball tofa éagsúla.  Dúirt lucht bainistíochta liom ar ócáid amháin nach féidir aon rud a dhéanamh, mar ar láimh amháin bhí na pleananna ag sleamhnú amach agus ar an láimh eile ní raibh cead acu aon rud a dhéanamh.  Cén sórt boird a cheapfá in aon chor a bheith ann?  Is cuimhin liom, i 1979, nuair a rinneadh comparáid idir an Highlands and Islands Board agus údaráis mar iad.  An bhfuil cúrsaí chomh sona sásta go nglacaimid ag an bpointe seo dul ar aghaidh leis na toghcháin agus gan aon díospóireacht a bheith againn ar na pointí a luaigh mé?  Sin an chéad chúis go bhfuil muidne i gcoinne na toghcháin a chur ar aghaidh ar an lá céanna.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim, agus ceapann Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, go bhfuil cúrsaí na Gaeltachta á gcur faoi cheilt, go bhfuil siad á múchadh, nach mbeidh seans ag gnáthmhuintir na Gaeltachta a dtuairimí a nochtadh faoi na hábhair a luaigh mé.  Tá áiteacha taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil eolas agam féin fúithi, is í sin Gaeltacht Chonamara, agus tá siad beagnach bánaithe faoi láthair le himirce.  Aon sampla beag amháin de chúram an oideachais dá mba rud é go raibh sé ag an Údarás, Gairmscoil Cholmcille in Indreabhán, tá ar na páistí sa scoil dara leibhéal sin dul thar an mbóthar sé nó seacht nó ocht n-uaire sa lá chun freastal ar dhá mhonarcha atá ar léas ag an VEC ó Údarás na Gaeltachta do chuspóirí oideachais.  Deirtear go minic go bhfuil siad anois ag barr an liosta.  Sin an rud atá ag tarlú faoi láthair <Col N="140" />&mdash; togha scoile; tá na torthaí ann, tá na daoine an-fhial don chóras atá ann; tá na múinteoirí den chéad scoth, agus mar sin de.  Caithfidh siad dul thar an mbóthar. Níl aon seomra don fhoireann teagaisc. Níl aon áit le haghaidh chaitheamh aimsire agus mar sin de.  Tá an trealamh go léir acu chun éargna a mhúineadh ach níl aon spás acu san fhoirgneamh atá ann.</P>
    <P>An botún is mó rinne muintir Indreabhán agus muintir na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne go rabhadar ró-fhial don sean-dream. Arís, bhí cruinniú mór acu i bhFaiche Mhór na Gaillimhe cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Labhair duine den Údarás, ball tofa de chuid Fhianna Fáil.  Sheas sé suas agus ar seisean, &ldquo;Tá mise ag troid i gcónaí ar an Údarás chun córas farantóireachta ceart a chur ar fáil ó Oileán Árann do chathair na Gaillimhe&rdquo;.  Níl aon chumhacht ag an Údarás tada a dhéanamh.  Bhí an tAire Stáit amuigh in Oileán Árann mí roimhe sin agus dúirt sé, &ldquo;Is féidir liomsa an méid seo a gheallúint daoibh, tá an rud seo á chur isteach faoi láthair don Structural Fund&rdquo;.  Cúpla bliain ó shin tháinig <i>deus ex machina,</i> an Taoiseach féin as héalacaptar, agus dúirt sé leo, &ldquo;Beidh córas taistil ceart agaibh&rdquo;.  Cathain a thiocfaidh stop leis an sórt magaidh seo ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta?</P>
    <P>Luaigh an cainteoir romham, an Teachta Molloy, na rialtais áitiúla.  Tá sé an-suimiúil.  Bunfhoirmeacha atá ag teastáil chun gnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge, níl siad ar fáil ach ó rialtas áitiúil amháin, Comhairle Chontae an Chláir.  Níor lean na rialtais áitiúla eile sampla Chontae an Chláir, agus tá siad ag cur foirmeacha amach i mBéarla do dhaoine atá ina gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí agus, níos measa fós, tá siad ag aistriú ainmneacha daoine ón leagan Gaeilge go dtí an leagan Béarla.  Níl de cheart agat sa tír seo, sna Gaeltachtaí, fiú amháin do ainm a bheith agat go hoifigiúil ó roinnt rialtas áitiúil ar fhoirm Ghaeilge.  Nach iontach an dul chun cinn atá déanta againn.  B'fhéidir gur maith an rud é; beimid ag gearradh síos ar na costais más rud é go mbeidh na toghcháin ar siúl ar an lá céanna.  Bille beag atá i gceist.  Rud beag atá déanta.</P>
    <P>An chéad fáth, mar a dúirt mé, go <Col N="141" /> bhfuil muidne i gcoinne an Bhille seo náan gá atá le díospóireacht iomlán do chúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  An dara rud, is aisteach an rud é gur bhuail an taom isteach i gceann an Aire timpeallachta, is é sin, ón Roinn Comhshaoil.  Why this sudden inspiration?  Tá sé de cháil aige go dtagann smaointe uafásacha chuige go minic.  Ach cén fáth nach raibh an méid seo ciallmhar cúpla mí ó shin?  Cén fáth go bhfuil sé ag tarlú anois?  Is ceart gan a cheapadh gurb é an sórt cuspóra atá leis ná an vóta, mar a dúirt an Teachta McGinley, dealagáid de Fhine Gael, chomh maith, an vóta a tharraingt amach. &ldquo;Winkle them out for the Údarás and European elections at the same time.&rdquo; That's what is all behind it.</P>
    <P>Ceist bheag eile.  Ó thaobh an méid ama a bheadh ar fáil ar raidió agus teilifís, dá mba rud é go raibh tú mar ghnáthdhuine, mo dhála féin, sa dá fheachtas, agus dá mba rud é go raibh sé ag teastáil uaimse argóintí a chloisteáil do thoghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta, cá mhéad clár a thabhairfaí do thoghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta ar theilifís, ar raidió?  Cá mhéad colún sna páipéir nuachta?  Is fiú an cheist sin a chur.</P>
    <P>Céard faoin bhfeachtas don Eoraip?  Is féidir a rá go mbeidh an sórt fealsúnachta ag baint leis an bhfeachtas don dá rud. Más fíor sin, cén fáth nach ndearnadh tada do riachtanais na nGaeltachtaí a luadh sa bhunphlean a cuireadh ar aghaidh go dtí an Bhruiséil?  Agus cén fáth nach bhfuil iarrthóirí don Eoraip, agus tá eisceachtaí ann, ag caint i nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht?  Tá an Teachta Molloy ann.  Bhí sé ag caint ag cruinnithe i ndáilcheantar Ghaillimh Thiar don Eoraip.  Tá iarrthóirí Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre sásta Gaeilge a labhairt.  An mbeidh seans ag muintir na Gaeltachta na hiarrthóirí a chlos i nGaeilge?  Beidh sé suimiúil eolas a fháil ina dtaobh.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil saintréith ar leith ag na hiarrthóirí atá ag seasamh don Eoraip sa mhéid nach dteastaíonn uathu éisteacht le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith an rud dá mbeadh spreagadh eacnamaíochta buan i gceist agus go bhféadfaí réiteach fiúntach a fhail ar fhadhb na dífhostaíochta, ar fhadhb na <Col N="142" /> himirce, ar fhadhb an bhochtanais, ar fhadhb na mbunstructúr, ar fhadhb an easpa tithíochta agus ar an bpraiseach atá déanta d'oideachas ar gach leibhéal; dá mbeimís i ndáiríre faoi cheartanna a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ionas nach mbeidís dá gcur i bpríosún nuair nach bhfuil siad sásta faoin méid atá á fháil acu; fiú amháin dá mbeimís sásta ceist córas cumarsáide don Ghaeltacht a phlé.  Tá díospóireacht ann maidir le soláthar scéim teilifíse Ghaeilge nó scéim teilifíse Ghaeltachta agus creidim go bhfuil a lán daoine, fiú amháin sa Rialtas, i ndáiríre faoin gceist seo. Measaim féin go bhfuil na hargóintí is treise ar thaobh scéim teilifíse Ghaeltachta, ach ní bheidh an t-ábhar seo á phlé.</P>
    <P>Cad iad na leasuithe a ba chóir a dhéanamh ar Acht 1979 maidir le cúrsaí cumarsáide? Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú a fháil ar phointe dlí freisin, maidir le Acht 1979. Ní raibh mé soiléir riamh faoi phointe bunreachtúil amháin a bhaineann leis an Acht seo, maidir le sainmhíniú na Gaeltachta. Tá dualgaisí áirithe ar an Roinn Comhshaoil maidir leis an mBunreacht agus i dtaobh na nAchtanna um thoghcháin ach tá sé beagáinín doiléir.  Abair go dtabharfaí cás os comhair na cúirteanna idir bheirt; duine amháin acu a cheap go raibh sé ina chónaí i nGaeltacht oifigiúil agus duine eile a cheap go raibh sé ina chónaí i bhfíor-Ghaeltacht, áit a raibh Gaeilge á labhairt sna teaghlaigh. Arbh fhéidir an dá sórt ceartanna a chur i gcomhréir?</P>
    <P>I Namibia, fiú, tá iarracht á dhéanamh le go mbeadh an modh cláruithe soiléir agus macánta.  Dúirt an Teachta Gallagher faoin Acht 1979 go raibh sé sásta seans a thabhairt do na breac-Ghaeltachtaí. Ba mhaith liom a bheith an-bheacht sa mhéid a deirim &mdash; Gaeltachtaí bréaga atá i gceist agamsa.  Cén fáth nár tugadh deis roimh na toghcháin chun na treoracha a mheas arís agus chun léarscáil ceart a chur ar fáil?  Is féidir fíor-Ghaeltachtaí agus breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus Gaeltachtaí eile a bheith ann, ach níl baint ag aon tír eile leis an cur i gcéill a deireann gur de bharr cúiseanna tíreolaíochta, stairiúla agus polaitiúla atá Gaeltachtaí ann nach <Col N="143" /> bhfuil Gaeilge á labhairt iontu.  Níor pléadh é seo.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh deis againn arís díospóireacht a bheith againn i dtaobh Acht 1979. Ní bheidh deis againn ach oiread cúrsaí eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha a phlé.  Ní bheidh fáil againn ar na meáin chumarsáide ach chomh beag.  Ní bhfuaireamar seans éisteacht leis na codanna sin den tír ina bhfuil an ráta dífhostaióchta agus an ráta imirce i bhfad níos airde ná an meán náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán daoine ag ullmhú do thoghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé ar intinn ag Páirtí an Lucht Oibre iarrthoirí a chur ar aghaidh don chéad uair.  Ní dhearnamar an uair dheiridh é toisc gur chreideamar go mba chóir go dtiocfadh na hiarrthoirí ón nGaeltacht féin.  Ach is iontach an dearcadh atá ar fáil ar an Údarás, maidir le buntáistí agus míbhuntaistí atá ag gabháil leis, ó nuachtáin agus Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus ó ráitisí ó ionadaithe neampspleácha ar nós Peadar Ó Tuathail as Cumhacht.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann na hoibrithe go léir laistigh den Údarás an rud atá ag teastáil.  Tá tuarascáil an-fhiúntach curtha le chéile ag an ceardchumann is mó.  Bhí moltaí ann i dtaobh bhunstructúr an Údaráis fhéin, faoi fheidhmeannaigh nua, agus déanadh trácht ar laigí an Údaráis.  Níor tugadh aird ar bith air, faraor.  Tá ualach agus cúram an fheidhmeannais ar na daoine seo ach ní thugtar seans dóibh rud ar bith fiúntach a dhéanamh.  Bhí súil acusan leis, le díospóireacht.  Níl sé ar intinn ag aon tír na toghcháin a reachtáil ar an lá céanna.  Thar aon ní eile, tá sé scannalach agus maslach gan an deis a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus dóibh siúd a bhfuil suim acu in athbheochan na Gaeilge, díospoíreacht neamhspleách a bheith acu.  Is ar an gcúis seo atá baill Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre ag cur in gcoinne an Bhille seo.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an Teachta Higgins nach cóir an dá thoghchán a reachtáil ar an lá céanna.  Is trua gur shocraigh an Rialtas, le déanaí is dócha, é seo a dhéanamh.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Molloy, bheadh sé niós fearr do <Col N="144" /> mhuintir na Gaeltachta a dtoghchán féin a bheith acu leis féin ar lá áirithe.  Bheadh aird na tíre dírithe orthu dá bharr agus i bhfad níos mó bolscaireachta le fáil acu i dtaobh chúrsaí Ghaeltachta agus i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Faoi mar atá, beidh meoin na tíre dírithe ar an mBruiséal in ionad ar an nGaeltacht.  Níor mhiste, ach oiread, a thuilleadh díospóir-eachta a bheith againn i dtaobh cúrsaí an Údaráis.</P>
      <P>Is soiléir, mar a dúirt gach Teachta den Fhreasúra a labhair inniu, nár éirigh leis an Údarás cosc a chur le bánú na Gaeltachta. Tá an imirce níos measa ná mar a bhí riamh.  Ní féidir an milleán a leagan ar an Údarás sa chás seo, agus is iomaí cúis atá leis, ar ndóigh.  Go bunúsach, dar liomsa agus le mo pháirtí, ní foláir don Udarás a bheith in ann feidhmiú go héifeachtach mar bhord neamhspleách daon-lathach, agus neart cumhachta aige chun modhanna pleanála agus forbartha a thionscnú leis an nGaeltacht a neartú agus a shlánú.  Ní mar sin atá, faoi láthair. Muna bhfuil an Rialtas sásta féachaint chuige go mbeidh Údarás den chineál seo ann, a chuireas bunáiseanna na fichiú haoise, i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta, sóisialta, oideachais agus mar sin de ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí, níl ciall le bheith ag trácht ar an nGaeltacht a bheas ann laistigh de dheich mbliana eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le blianta fada, bhí Fianna Fáil agus Fine Gael ag imirt cluichí polaitiúla leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an mhuintir ann agus ar ndóigh, tá an cluiche céanna ar siúl acu anois san Udarás.  Níl morán aird a thabhairt acu ar riachtanaisí na Gaeltachta mar ionad, ná ar an dteanga ná ar an gcultúr atá níos giorra do bhás anois ná mar a bhí le fada an lá.  Bíonn greim daingean docht ag cibé Rialtas a bhíonn i gcumhacht ag an am, ar an Údarás, toisc seisear den Údarás a bheith le hainmniú ag Aire na Gaeltachta.  In a theannta sin, éirionn le duine, nó beirt, nó triúr dá bPáirtí sna toghcháin.  Mar sin bíonn an tUdarás faoi smacht an Rialtais i gcónaí agus ní bhíonn ar a gcumas feidhmiú go neamhspleách nó go raidiciúil.  Tá lán-fhostáiocht don tír iomlán mar aidhm ag Pairtí na nOibrithe.  Ar ndóigh ba chóir <Col N="145" /> an aidhm chéanna a bheith againne agus ag an Údarás don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir é seo a thabhairt i gcrích sa Ghaeltacht gan Údarás a bhfuil sé de chúram air, aire iomlán a thabhairt d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta.  Chuige sin, tá géarghá le plean forbartha don Ghaeltacht ó Údarás ar bith, agus na cumhachtaí cuí chun leas a bhaint as na hacmhainní nádúrtha maraon le airgead agus institiúdí eacnamaíochta an Stáit.  Ní foláir Roinn ar leith a bhunú in Údarás ar bith chun cúram a ghlacadh de thurasóireacht sa Ghaeltacht agus Roinn eile a cheapfadh polasaí iompair, go háirithe maidir leis na hoileáin.  Is é atá ag teastáil, dar le Páirtí na nOibrithe, ná Údarás a chuirfidh plean iomlan forbartha eacnamaíochta, airgeadais agus fostaíochta ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, idir oileáin agus eile.  Údarás cumhachtach neamhspleách atá ag teastáil le foinsí leathana airgid aige agus a ghlacfaidh cúram iomlán na Gaeltachta chuige.</P>
    <P>Léirigh Raidió na Gaeltachta, le blianta beaga anuas go bhfuil éileamh ar sheirbhís dá leithéid ó na Gaeltachtaí uile agus go bhfuil dianghá le seirbhís teilifíse a d'fhreastalódh ar an bpobal céanna, agus ar an bpobal Iasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, chomh maith leo, a bhfuil bá ar leith acu leis an nGaeilge agus le fealsún-acht agus cultúr na Gaeltachta.  Ní seirbhís chúng Ghaeltachta atá uainn ach seirbhís arbh fhéidir a sheoladh thar tír amach agus a d'aithneodh pobail bheaga eile thar sáile; seirbhís a mbeadh fáilte roimh a dearcadh neamhspleách.  Táim ag smaoineamh go háirithe ar na pobail sin a chruthaigh iad féin trína seasamh daingean in aghaidh an impiriúlachais.</P>
    <P>Is é Raidió na Gaeltachta an t-aon áis sa tír a d'eascair ón nGaeltachta agus go nglacann muintir na Gaeltachta leis gur leo féin é.  Cén fáth nach gcuirfimis ar a gcumas seirbhís theilifíse a sholáthar dóibh féin ar an dóigh chéanna?  Níor mhiste na cumhachtaí cuí a thabhairt don Údarás le go gceapfaí mar rialtas áitiúil ar an nGaeltacht é.  Bheadh cumhachtaí sa bhreis ag an ngnáth rialtas áitiúil i gceist anseo chun go rachadh an tÚdarás i ngleic le cúrsaí turasóireachta, pleanála, bóthair, sóisialta agus oideachais.  Ní <Col N="146" /> dheiseofar na bóithre, mar shampla, muna dtugann an tÚdarás faoi.  Ní mór bóithre a bheith ann le go mbunófaí tionscail sa cheantar.  Ní foláir chomh maith scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na deontaisí do thionscail sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, féachaint an bhfuil siad feiliúnach do na ceantair atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>Ní leor tionsclóir a mhealladh isteach ar bhonn eacnamaíochta gan riachtanaisí an réigiúin sin a chur san áireamh.  Ní mór go rachadh an tionscal chun leas an cheantair, mar aonad eacnamaíochta agus mar aonad sóisialta.  Caithfidh an tUdarás a bheith in ann na mionseirbhísí laethúla idir sheirbhísí sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta a chur ar fáil go héifeachtach trí mheán na Gaeilge do phobal na Gaeltachta. Ní deonú thar na bearta atá á éileamh ag muintir na Gaeltachta, tar éis an tsaoil, ach cearta sóisialta.  Is é dualgas an Údaráis ná a chinntiú nach gcaitear le muintir na Gaeilge mar shaoránaithe den dara grád mar is amhlaidh a dhéantar i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Glactar leis go forleathan go bhfuil meath ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht.  Tá cuid den locht ar an gcóras oideachais ach is acu atá cuid den leigheas freisin. Tá an-chuid airgead Stáit á chaitheamh ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht ach muna ndéantar beart go luath ní fada eile go mbeidh airgead á dhíriú ar chóras oideachais na Gaeltachta mar chóras eisceachtúil agus ní mar ghné bheag den chóras náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar sin, is iad cumhachtaí agus airgead is mó atá de dhíth ar an Údarás. Maraon le neamhspleáchas, is iad na gnéithe seo is mó atá in easnamh ar an Údarás go dtíseo.  Ní mór dúinn an uain seo a ghlacadh chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an Údarás, tar éis dó a bheith i mbun oibre ar feadh deich mbliana.  Ba cheart an t-athbhreithniú seo a dhéanamh roimh na toghcháin in ionad ina ndiaidh.  Bheadh neart ama againn é seo a dhéanamh i rith an tsamhraidh agus an toghchán a reachtáil i mí Meán Fómhair nó idtús mí Dheireadh Fómhair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1989, allows us to reflect upon <Col N="147" /> the value of the decision to set up Údarás na Gaeltachta in 1980 and to look at their performance, at the constrictions and restrictions imposed on the authority and to evaluate their progress towards the future.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that there are two Deputies on the Government benches &mdash; two Ministers from my own constituency. It is fair to say that in this instance the constituency of Mayo West is well represented in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>I do not have any real objection to the Údarás elections being held on the same day as the European elections.  Too many people who take the view that these elections should be held singly do not appreciate the geographical extent of many of our Gaeltacht areas.  For those involved on a party political basis, it is more appropriate to do the two jobs together on 15 June than to have to call those forces into action again in September or October when the elections for the Údarás would normally be due.  So, I think the suggestion is sensible.</P>
      <P>From experience I know that in the Gaeltacht areas those who support candidates for the Údarás find that the Údarás election will in many cases take precedence over the European election. I have heard candidates of various parties in past elections asking people to give them their number one vote and reminding people of the candidate in the European campaign also.  I believe that that will apply in Gaeltacht areas on this occasion also.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the question of whether Údarás na Gaeltachta have been a success since inception.  There was a great deal of soul searching and speech making with various theories being put forward prior to the adoption of the specific programme for the Údarás.  By and large, the balance was almost correct. Every Deputy here would have grouses or complaints about various aspects of the way the Údarás are operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large the concept of having an authority to deal with a specific area of the country, in so far as the Irish language, promotion of the Irish culture and <Col N="148" /> determination of a way of life for people living in the Gaeltacht areas is concerned, has been a success.  That concept was further enhanced by the fact that a certain proportion of the board was to be appointed by the Minister of the day and the remaining proportion was to be elected by the ordinary members of the Gaeltacht areas.  That is a valuable aspect of democracy.  On the other hand, from a political and a traditional point of view, many people in the Gaeltacht areas have supported the Government party.  The election within the Gaeltacht areas by the people, together with the appointments of the Minister, amounted to a very weighty board in favour of the Government.</P>
    <P>Is it fair to ask questions as to whether Údarás have been a success and whether that success can be measured?  Are they now empowered and enabled to do the job that was set out in the 1980 Act under which that body were set up?  Having said that the concept of that kind of body was proper, in the past number of years the imagination of those involved in Údarás na Gaeltachta has been strangled by the Government decision not to give them sufficient funds.  It is entirely appropriate that the Minister for the Gaeltacht should demand the highest level of performance from officials of Údarás na Gaeltachta and should constantly call them before him to determine their targets and to see how they are operating in so far as meeting those targets is concerned but, on the other hand, it is unfair of the Government not to give those officials and that body the resources to meet the targets and to implement good ideas.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious that in recent times, with the reduced number of industrialists coming from abroad to set up here, there has been an invasion of the Gaeltacht areas by SFADCo and the IDA.  That was all right some years ago when a broad selection of potential industrialists was available and the IDA could tell them they could set up certain industries in Donegal, Mayo, Galway or wherever they wished.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach who is at <Col N="149" /> present in Japan has made an announcement about doubling the number of Japanese firms investing in our country. He said a commission is to visit Ireland to look at the investment prospects in that regard.  It is obvious that Japan has become an extremely important political and economic force on the world stage. The Japanese own 52 per cent of the state of Hawaii and 48 per cent of the state of California.  I wonder how many of these Japanese investment firms will set up in Gaeltacht areas?  Will we see Japanese firms in Carratigue or Aughleam within the next five years?  I would like to think that the IDA, having set up this tour for the Taoiseach and having done a good deal of the background work, will not decide to take unto themselves all the glory in terms of the setting up of these industries.  It is important that the people in the Gaeltacht areas be given some of the credit also.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the committee of Coiste na Gaeilge which visited the Kerry Gaeltacht last year and I was certainly impressed by the operation in so far as telecommunications is concerned, the operation of information through computer systems and the modern technology in that regard.  That does away to a great extent with the difficulties, in terms of distance, the quality of roads and so on. Difficulties are encountered by long distance truck drivers in travelling from Dublin to Aughleam, Carratigue or to the far west points of the Galway Gaeltacht. It is the equivalent of driving from London to Glasgow on a highway.  These are practical difficulties and time means money for firms of that nature.  The technological changes that have been brought about have obviated to a certain extent some of the difficulties that have been experienced in that regard.</P>
    <P>I hope the IDA, being the body who have received the most Government funds and Government attention in the past number of years, will attract these potential investors to areas other than mainline city areas.  As Deputy McGinley has pointed out, if an industrialist who wishes to set up business here is offered the option of locating in a Gaeltacht area, <Col N="150" /> that option will not be taken up first if the grants are not higher than those offered by the IDA and, secondly, if the site is not within distance of third level education institutions or near the mainline markets these people demand.</P>
    <P>If Údarás na Gaeltachta cannot give greater incentives than those on offer from the IDA or some other such body, then the Gaeltacht areas will continuously lose out, unless there is an enormous increase in the number of ideas promoted in the Gaeltacht areas.  As I have said, it is not very fair that everybody should demand the highest standard from Údarás if, on the other hand, they are not given a sufficient budget to carry out their work, to meet their targets and so on.  My understanding is that the money allocated to Údarás na Gaeltachta in 1989 will run out within the next two months.  That will obviously mean that pressure will be put on Government Deputies and on the Minister to provide more money.  Because of a lack of funds, approvals that have been awarded to industrialists will not be met.  If these people do not get the money they will not set up their businesses in the Gaeltacht areas but will move some place else where the IDA will give them funding.  I would like to think that as the Taoiseach is Minister for the Gaeltacht and his Minister of State is from my own constituency he will see to it that Údarás are given the financial resources to do what they say they are capable of doing.  Their work should be monitored strictly by the Minister who should demand the highest level of performance from them.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has arisen in my constituency which has been referred to by Deputy Molloy.  I notice he is taking a keener interest in the affairs of County Mayo recently.  The people there will probably be demanding of him that he deliver the RTC in Castlebar out of the Structural Funds.  I will take the example that was mentioned of the Babygro plant in Belmullet which eventually closed on Christmas Eve last.  The officials in Údarás did what they could in that regard and met different people in relation to setting up a replacement industry but the <Col N="151" /> only outcome is that meetings have taken place and there is a possibility that a replacement industry might be set up.  If that is so, a new industrialist will demand further training grants from the Government but will that finance be readily available? That is the kind of response that is necessary from the Government if people are to stay in the Gaeltacht areas rather than be forced to sign on the dole or to emigrate.  Many of the people in these areas actually returned to Ireland in the early seventies to set up business here.</P>
    <P>The build-up of inherent resources has been mentioned on many occasions. Tourism is a word that has been bandied about to a great extent in the past number of years.  A meeting took place today in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham involving 600 people from the tourist industry to discuss the launch of their plan and the concept of doubling the number of tourists coming into the country over the next few years.  If these tourists are attracted here and they feel safe in so doing, do we have the accommodation to cater for them?  What is the level of accommodation in the Gaeltacht areas or will it be sufficient to cater for tourists if the number coming here is doubled?  My understanding is that no grant assistance will be given for accommodation under the Structural Funds.  In the next couple of years, up to 1992, the carrot of the Structural Funds probably will be dangled in front of every community and every group in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and Údarás na Gaeltachta will face a number of practical problems.  For instance, the Gaeltachtaí of Counties Mayo, Galway and Meath are all in the one group. County Donegal is on its own as are the Counties of Cork, Kerry and Waterford. In the sub-regions set up under the national plan, Counties Mayo and Galway are a different sub-region to County Meath.  County Donegal is in a different sub-region again as is the Munster Gaeltacht.  Therefore the elected Údarás representatives from those Gaeltacht areas will have to deal with representatives from different sub-regions, <Col N="152" /> with very complex plans for each of those sub-regions.  This will create major problems for Údarás representatives, both appointed and elected.  I do not know how these may be overcome.</P>
    <P>Because of their lack of resources, it seems that Údarás are staggering from one crisis to another and are hoping the evil day will not come when they have to announce another industry has gone down the drain.  They are not being given the resources by the Government to do what they say they are capable of doing. As I said, I back the concept of a Minister being able to pressure the officials of Údarás to deliver on the accepted targets they themselves set.  They must be given the resources to do this.  There have been political rows within Údarás and during the years various matters have been raised in this House.  Allegations and charges in regard to the activities of Údarás have also been made, but be that as it may, it is also fair to say that in the making of decisions there may well be closer alliances on a county rather than on a political basis.  It seems that Údarás deem it important that there be as much representation as possible from the various counties on the board.  It often comes down to a decision being decided upon on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure if the Minister when replying will state if all of the existing members of the present board who have still two years to serve will be reappointed or whether the board will be abolished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main aims of Údaras na Gaeltachta when set up in 1980 was chun caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar phríomh-mheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun chinn.  I think in many ways the language is being treated as a complete joke and, on the other <Col N="153" /> hand, I feel that a greater number of people in ordinary walks of life have more Irish than the previous generation, and are not afraid to use it, even though they may not have a very good vocabulary. It is fair to say that the scoileanna lán Ghaelach have awakened a new interest in Irish, Irish culture, dancing, music and so on, in younger children.  While they receive biased treatment from the Department of Education in terms of teachers and transport, that is a matter to be considered whether it is fair or not.</P>
    <P>If no leadership is given by the leaders of society in terms of speaking the language on each and every occasion, then those who are not very fluent in the language will feel a bit cúthaileach, shy, about using it and will tend not to use it.  It probably would have been as appropriate for the Taoiseach on the visit of the Soviet President, to speak solely in Irish at Shannon because the Soviet President does not understand either English or Irish. If the Taoiseach had done so, foreign journalists would have appreciated that we too have our own language, a unique heritage in many ways.  The leader or our country should have made his welcoming address, brief though it was, in his native tongue in the knowledge that the Soviet President could not speak either English or Irish.  If he had done so, it would have been a lesson in diplomacy in one sense for foreign journalists who expect English to be spoken at all times.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have no objection to the election taking place on 15 June and I hope that as many as possible of those left in the country will turn out to vote. In conclusion, I would like to refer to the relevance of the population figures for the Gaeltacht areas.  While there has been heavy emigration in recent years, the population in many of the Gaeltacht areas is increasing.  For example, the 1981 figure for Galway was 26,444 while the 1986 figure was 29,614.  Obviously many of those live in Galway city &mdash; well known to Deputies Molloy and Higgins.  I do not know how many of those have or speak Irish &mdash; the Deputies probably know more about that.  Perhaps there is a need to take a look at where the boundaries <Col N="154" /> for the fíor-Ghaeltacht and the breac Gaeltacht lie.  This morning on Raidió na Gaeltachta I heard an official say they were going to update the lists of those looking for employment in Gaeltacht areas and that these lists have not been revised since 1981.  Obviously a great number of those from the Connemara and Mayo west areas who had been registered in 1981 have now left the country.</P>
    <P>As I said, I hope that as many people as possible turn out on this occasion and use this opportunity to protest at some of the activities of the Government which directly affect them.  What is happening at present falls very far short of the príomh-aidhm of Údarás na Gaeltachta which was to have Gaeilge as the príomhmheán cumarsáide chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil lei an Dáil as ucht glacadh leis an mBille.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl freisin do na Teachtaí a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht as ucht an méid a bhí le rá acu.  Ní chuireann sé isteach ormsa gur as Gaeilge nó as Béarla a deinedh an díospóireacht sin.  Mar a dúirt mé i dtús báire, sé an cuspóir atá leis an mBille ná chun a chur ar ár gcumas na toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a reachtáil ar an lá céanna is a bheidh na toghcháin do Phairlimint na hEorpa ar siúl.  Agus mar a mhínigh mé, tiocfaidh laghdú beag ar chostas na dtoghchán de bharr sin agus beidh an socrú níos sásúla i mo thuairim féin do na toghchóirí agus ní bheidh sé i gceist na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht a dhúnadh ar ócáid éigin eile idir é seo agus Mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn le haghaidh na dtoghchán don Údarás.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Dáil, tá dualgas reachtúil ann na toghcháin seo a chur ar siúl roimh Dheireadh Fómhair na bliana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt bheag a dhéanamh do chuid des na rudaí a bhí á bplé ag na Teachtaí.  Aontaím leis an Teachta McGinley gur rud ciallmhar atá á mholadh againne maidir leis an dá thoghcháin seo a bheith ar siúl ar an lá céanna.  Aontaím leis freisin go bhfuil tábhacht faoi <Col N="155" /> leith ag na toghcháin seo do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá an ceart aige nuair a deireann sé nach bhfuil ach roinnt seachtainí fágtha ag an Údarás go dtí go mbeidh sé riachtanach orainn toghcháin a chur ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do chuile dhuine, ba mhaith linn níos mó daoine a mhealladh amach agus páirt a ghlacadh sna toghcháin Eorpacha, agus ma chuidíonn an mhír seo atá á plé againn faoi láthair chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm, cuirim fáilte roimhe sin.  Beidh deis, ní amháin ag na daoine a bheidh páirteach sna toghcháin Eorpacha, ach acu siúd i dtoghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta, níos mó úsáid a bhaint as na meain chumarsáide chun a bpolasaithe a nochtú agus an díospóireacht a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Bhí cuid mhaith le rá ag an Teachta McGinley maidir leis na deacrachtaí infrastruchtúir atá sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tá deacrachtaí i ngach áit sa tír maidir le cúrsaí struchtúir, ach tá dul chun cinn déanta agus tá cuid mhaith airgid bhreise curtha ar fáil againne le tamaillín anuas chun feabhas a chur ar chuid de na rudaí sin agus chun an t-infrastruchtúr a neartú, ní amháin sna Gaeltachtaí ach thart timpeall na tíre ar fad.  Aontaím leis na Teachtaí a bhí ag rá go raibh míbhuntáistí ag dul do áiteacha iargúlta agus táimid ag déanamh ár ndian-díchill, agus chun ár ndian-dícheall a dhéanamh táimid ag cur níos mó airgid le polasaí chun infrastruchtúr a neartú sna háiteacha sin.</P>
    <P>Tá buntáiste ann freisin ag dul leis an nGaeltacht, agus ní raibh mórán tagairtí do na buntáistí atá ag dul leis na háiteacha sin.  An timpeallacht an rud is mó atá ar intinn agamsa, agus de réir a chéile tá tábhacht níos mó ag gabháil le cúrsaí timpeallachta sa tír seo.  Tá an timpeallacht thar barr agus tá sí glan agus gach uile rud i gceart sna háiteacha thart ar imeall na tíre.  Tá dul chun cinn mór déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le tionscal turasóireachta a chur chun cinn, agus tionscal foraoiseachta agus tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc, na tionscall go léir atá bunaithe ar na hacmhainní nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Bhí a lán rudaí á bplé ag an Teachta Molloy nach bhfuil baint acu ar chor ar bith leis an mBille atá os ár gcomhair, <Col N="156" /> agus níl sé i gceart, ar ndóigh, agamsa cuidiú leis an gcaint sin atá as ordú.  Ach b'fhéidir focal nó dhó chun an Teachta Molloy a cheartú, ar eagla go gcreidfeadh duine ar bith an drocheolas atá á scaipeadh aige sa Dáil maidir le cúpla rud. An chéad rud ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó ná níl aon socrú ar bith déanta ag an Rialtas nó ag an Aire Comhshaoil le Teachta ar bith ar an taobh eile den Teach seo, agus níl aon ghá le droch-abairtí mar sin a bheith á scaipeadh ag an Teachta, mar níl aon fhírinne iontu.</P>

      <P>Dúirt.  Gabh mo leithscéal. Ba mhaith liomsa é a chur ar an &ldquo;record&rdquo; freisin.  Ní raibh aon socrú agam le héinne maidir leis an mBille seo atá os ár gcomhair. Caithfidh mé freisin a chur in iúl do gach uile dhuine nár cailleadh aon phost sa Ghaeltacht, i mo thuairim féin, de bharr easpa airgid le tamaillín anuas.  Ba thrua gur cailleadh na postanna a bhí ann in Babygro thíos i mBéal Átha an Mhuirthead, agus níl aon rud le rá agamsa maidir leis an scéal sin ach go bhfuilim cinnte go mbeidh togra nua ann chun fostaíocht a thabhairt sa cheantar sin go luath.  Tá iarrachtaí faoi leith á ndéanamh ag mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Gallagher, i dtaobh togra nua agus chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-ádh leis.</P>
      <P>Is iontach a bheith ag éisteacht leis an Teachta anois ag caint maidir le heaspa airgid le haghaidh bóithre agus rudaí mar sin.  Chaith sé féin tréimhse sách fada mar Aire Comhshaoil, tamaillín ó shin, agus ní dhearna sé tada le cúrsaí bóithre nó céanna nó tionscail nó aon rud eile.  Cén fáth, mar sin, a bhfuil sé ag cur an droch-íomhá orainne agus muidne ag déanamh ár ndíchill chun feabhas a chur ar an scéal i ngach áit sa tír maidir le bóithre ach go háirithe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Molloy go mbeidh airgead an Údaráis ídithe i gceann tamaillín. Caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil sé sin fíor ar chor ar bith.  Leis an airgead ón Stát agus an teacht isteach ón díol socmhainní beidh dóthain airgid ag an Údarás chun íocaíocht deontais a thioc-faidh <Col N="157" /> chun aibíochta idir seo agus deireadh na bliana airgeadais.  Sin mar is eol domsa agus sin é an fhírinne atá os mo chomhair anois.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do roinnt rudaí a bhí á rá ag an Teachta Higgins agus a chuir díomá orm.  De ghnáth, nuair a bhíonn seisean ag caint, ní amháin ar chúrsaí na teanga ach ar chúrsaí eile freisin, bíonn rudaí neartúla agus rudaí misniúla le rá aige maidir le cúrsaí.  Ach inniu bhí sé an-chiniciúil maidir le gach uile rud agus ag scrios gach uile rud os a chomhair.  An rud a bhí á dhéanamh aige inniu ná iarracht misneach agus meon phobal na Gaeltachta a bhriseadh, i mo thuairim féin.  Cén fáth a bhfuil sé ag brú síos ar a mhuintir féin mar sin?  Agus cén fáth a bhfuil an drochthuairimíocht maidir le rudaí, díreach.</P>

Is iad na rudaí atá ag teastáil, i mo thuairim féin, sa Teach seo, i leith cúrsaí Gaeilge agus tionscail le haghaidh na Gaeltachta, ná tuairimí éifeachtúla agus tuairimí tairbheacha agus fiúntacha a bheith á bplé againn.  Sin é an gnáthrud a bhíonn le cloisteáil ón Teachta nuair a bhíonn sé ag caint.  Cén fáth go bhfuil athrú cainte air inniu?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deir an Teachta Higgins nach bhfuil sé i bhfábhar an dá thoghchán a bheith ann ar an lá céanna, agus dhealródh sé go bhfuil an Teachta Molloy idir dhá chomhairle maidir leis an scéal.  Tá mise sásta go mbeidh díospóireacht cheart ann faoi chúrsaí Gaeltachta agus an toghchán seo a bheith ar siúl.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le mo pháirtí féin, tá sé ar intinn againne iarrthóirí fiúntacha a chur sa choimhlint sa toghchán don Údarás agus féadfaidh sibh a bheith cinnte go mbeidh siad lán-ábalta an bhéim agus caoi a chur ar cheist a bhaineann leis na Gaeltachtaí, agus tá súil agam go ndéanann na páirtithe eile amhlaidh.  Tá an dalladh mullóige ar an Teachta Higgins ar phointe <Col N="158" /> beag amháin.  Níl foriail ar bith sna Stáit Eorpacha a choisceann an ballstát ó thoghchán eile a reachtáil ar an lá céanna le toghchán Pharlaimint na hEorpa.  Is ceist í seo don bhallstát féin, agus chomh fada agus is eol domsa beidh olltoghchán ar siúl i dtír amháin ar a laghad ar an lá céanna leis an toghchán Eorpach.  Caithfidh mé é sin a rá.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Mac Giolla agus an Teachta Kenny ag caint maidir leis an easpa airgid atá ann, agus ba mhian leo breis cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás, agus rudaí mar sin.  Níl baint ag na rudaí sin leis an méid atá faoinár lámha faoi láthair agus mar sin, beidh lá eile chun na polasaithe sin a phlé.</P>
    <P>It is a sensible Bill and has been seen as such by the vast majority of the Members of the House.  I thank them for their contribution and their willingness to say that.  However, I am a little disappointed with some of the contributions. It is important that those who have something useful to say should get an opportunity to speak, but they should not be negative so far as the Gaeltacht and the Údarás are concerned.  What we want is a good constructive díospóireacht sa Teach seo.</P>

Níor chloiseadh focal Gaeilge riamh uaidh sin. Ná bí ag caint mar sin.  Tá an ceart ag an Taoiseach nó ag an Aire Comhshaoil caint as Gaeilge más mian leis.  Cén fáth a bhfuil an Teachta ag cur an brú síos ar dhaoine sa díospóireacht seo maidir le cúrsaí mar sin?  Ní hé sin an gnáth rud a bhíonn á rá aige gach lá.</P>

    <P>The people generally will appreciate that.  I should like to thank those who see it from that point of view.  I am satisfied that the people in Gaeltacht areas will get an adequate opportunity to discuss na míreanna go léir, agus na polasaithe go léir a bhaineann le cúrsaí Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí teanga.  They have one great advantage that we might not have in other parts of the country &mdash; they have a very efficient Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Tá sin le cloisteáil i ngach áit san tír agus tá <Col N="160" /> cuid mhaith daoine ag éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta faoi láthair, ní amháin ins na háiteacha ins na Gaeltachtaí fhéin, ach taobh amuigh de sin freisin.  Cloistear Raidió na Gaeltachta ag cuid mhaith thar timpeall na tíre faoi láthair agus aontaím leis an bhforbairt sin.  I am satisfied that those who are interested in Gaeltacht and Údarás matters, particularly those who will be voting in the elections, will get a super opportunity between now and 15 June to make their case.  All I can say is that I wish those who seek election to the Údarás well.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for this opportunity to briefly explain why I believe the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1989, should be read a Second Time.  First I want to emphasise the consequences of any vote we take here tonight.  If the House agrees to a Second Stage reading of this Bill the net effect will be that the Bill will be formally published and circulated to Members and will be debated if and when the Parliamentary Labour Party are in a position to allocate Private Members' Time to such a debate.</P>
      <P>Given the very limited amount of time available to us this is unlikely to arise in the near future.  Therefore by voting for the publication of the Bill Members are not being asked to commit themselves to the principles involved in the Bill nor to its details.  Neither are they being asked to deprive the Government nor any other party of time to settle the dispute by negotiation, nor to pre-empt any effort at negotiations.  Members would be doing one thing, of course, by voting for the publication of the Bill: they would be sending a direct and simple message to the Government who are answerable to this House, and that message would be this: &ldquo;We want this dispute settled, we do not want to see any more damage done to our tourist industry, to the west of Ireland, indeed to any part of Ireland, or to the prospects for development of our inland waterways.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested in the past by no less a person than the Taoiseach that any defeat on any matter connected with the rod licence dispute would be an occasion for a general election.  I have to say on behalf of the Labour Party, and I hope on behalf of every Opposition Deputy, that it is completely unacceptable for the Taoiseach or any other Government <Col N="163" /> Minister to attempt to coerce the Dáil with threats of any kind.  The Dáil has both a right and a bounden obligation to consider issues where the common good is being threatened, and this is one such issue.  The threat to a vital industry, tourism, including family tourism, caused by this dispute has the potential to cause very significant damage.  No Government, and especially no minority Government, can be allowed to bully the Dáil into shirking an issue like this one.</P>
    <P>We believe that the rod licence dispute must be settled by discussion and negotiation. The Government appear to take the view that for as long as the law establishing the licence is on the Statute Book their flexibility is limited.  It appears that the underlying principle involved is that the law must be observed.  Two points arise from this.  First, the principle that the law must be observed did not prevent this Government from introducing a very generous tax amnesty for people who had flouted the law over many years, and there are many other examples of Government action in this area.  Secondly, where the existence of a badly thought-out, ill-conceived Bill on the Statute Book is the problem there is a simple solution.  The Bill whose publication we are seeking tonight is a very simple one which need not take more than half an hour of Dáil time.  The effect of the passage of this Bill ultimately would be to remove the existing legislation from the Statute Book and to leave the way clear for flexible negotiations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements have been reported in the media in the past couple of days to the effect that one of the Opposition parties would find themselves unable to support this Bill because we have not spelt out in detail the alternative solution we see to the dispute.  I want to make two brief points in relation to this.  First, we are not <Col N="164" /> asking anyone to vote for the Bill as of this moment.  As I stressed earlier we are merely seeking the permission of this House to have it published so as to add an important ingredient to the debate about this important controversy.  Secondly, we have spelt out on many occasions the elements of a solution to this problem and we have made many public statements, including a public statement by our party Leader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue in this rod licence dispute is very clear &mdash; it is the extraordinary irresponsibility of the Fianna Fáil Government in not taking any positive action over the past 12 months to attempt to resolve this dispute. They have stood idly by and seen many jobs being lost in the tourism industry. Indeed the Minister for the Marine, the Minister for Tourism and Transport and many other Ministers have sat back and seen these jobs being lost without taking any type of constructive action.  While they have sat back the Taoiseach has smugly gone around the world, in particular the US on St. Patrick's Day, and jokingly commented to reporters about the dispute in Ireland.  It is very insensitive of the Taoiseach while in America to make jokes about the rod licence dispute and suggest that he would provide a gold licence for the President of the United States if he came here on an angling holiday.  These comments are very insensitive to those people in the tourism industry whose livelihoods are going by the board and whose jobs have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that we in this party have had constructive and extensive negotiations with the various interested parties since this legislation was introduced. <Col N="165" /> Fine Gael have put in place a formula which will bring this damaging dispute to an end.  However, the Government must respond and act on that formula.  Everyone is clearly aware that that formula basically proposes to replace the licence concept with the principle of a development contribution.  The anglers have agreed to this formula.  They did not disagree with making a contribution but they disagreed with the principle of the licence.  All that remains for the Government to do is to follow this formula through by way of action rather than speeches.  It would be far more fitting for the Government to put their energies and efforts into resolving this problem rather than intimidating and threatening people who are campaigning for a change in the legislation.  Unfortunately Government interests have conducted that type of campaign over the past number of months in particular.  At the same time certain members of the Government have gone with our formula to various interested parties and have attempted to resolve the problem through that formula. However, the Government in their overall wisdom have decided not to accept the initiatives taken by various members of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Labour Bill, however well intentioned, unfortunately would solve nothing.  It would simply result in scrapping the legislation.  There is no need for any further breathing space for negotiation because an acceptable formula has already been arrived at.  It is now a matter for the Government to bring this dispute to an end and they should do so quickly in order to save jobs in this economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill which brought in the rod licence he told the Dáil that the rod licence had the agreement of the angling clubs.  The Opposition speakers accepted the Minister at his word on that occasion but alas, too late, the Minister's assurances were subsequently seen to be false. Anglers have not bought the rod licence and have sacrified their favourite sport and leisure pastime rather than participate in this State rod licensing system. <Col N="166" /> This bad legislation has been rejected by anglers.  The Government can only govern with the consent of the people and it is clear that anglers' consent is withheld in this case.  The Minister's response is to force the legislation on the people through intimidating use of the security forces.  How laughable it is to see armed gardaí mounting a ring of steel around a small number of anglers who agreed with the licence and who recently organised a fishing competition on the Corrib.  The ring of steel was brought in to give the impression that there was some real threat to the lives of those few who support the idea of a rod licence. The truth is that the vast majority of anglers oppose the idea of a rod licence. They have refused to buy the licences and are, therefore, voluntarily denying themselves participation in their own favourite sport and pastime.</P>
      <P>Last year the Progressive Democrats sought permission to introduce a Bill that would have suspended the rod licence for eight months to allow for an agreed funding system involving angling clubs' contributions to be introduced in time for the 1989 trout angling season.  All Opposition Deputies except Fine Gael Members voted for that Bill.  I think it was in September 1988, Deputy Doyle then Fine Gael's spokesperson on Fisheries said she had discussed and agreed with the angling association a system of club contributions and would introduce a Bill to implement the proposals.  The Fine Gael Árd Fheis voted against the Government rod licence and supported the Fine Gael Bill proposal.  Fine Gael Oireachtas Members spoke at protest meetings which were organised by the anti-rod licence campaign all over the country.  The spokesperson we have heard tonight, Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn, became spokesperson on the Marine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an astonishing act of treachery for Fine Gael to <Col N="167" /> come in here now and announce that not alone have they not brought forward their Bill, or their watered down motion, but that they will not now even vote for another party's Bill which proposes the same thing.  The Labour Party Bill should at least be allowed to come before the House for debate.  If Fine Gael want to amend it they could propose their amendments when the Bill is being debated but to deliberately block any debate on the anti-rod licence dispute is an unbelievable act of treachery and is absolutely undemocratic.  How can Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn continue as her party's spokesperson on the Marine remembering all she had to say on the recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme?</P>

Can the Taoiseach not <Col N="168" /> see that in relation to the decision to impose the rod angling licence fees there was no consultation with any users whatsoever and that many traditional users of our rivers and lakes have been discomoded by the move.  If Mr. Haughey was to show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Taoiseach is not fully aware of the extent of the feeling created by these fees I can assure him there is unprecedented opposition in rural areas and that that opposition will not go away.</P>
      <P>On Saturday of last week I listened to the President of the Munster Trout Anglers Association speaking to a very large audience of members and supporters in the Blackwater Valley in Mallow.  He made the point that they are willing to talk but that the Minister has refused point blank to meet the six representatives who have been nominated by the trout anglers association.  It is of vital importance that a compromise solution be found before permanent damage is done to the tourist industry.  Clearly, tourists are being deterred by both the licence fees and the uncertainty surrounding the problem on many rivers and lakes.  Recently the traditional coarse angling festival which was held in Fermoy, County Cork for many years was cancelled.  This is a festival which would have brought £200,000 into Fermoy that weekend.  It has to be cancelled because of the anti-rod licence campaign.  The rod anglers are prepared to talk.  The Taoiseach should now become involved with his Minister and reach a compromise.</P>

      <P>The sole purpose of the legislation was to find a way in which some finances could be found to adequately develop the inland fisheries of ireland which have been suffering for many years through lack of financial investment and through lack of the finances which are necessary to develop the resource to its maximum potential.</P>

      <P>Each and every Deputy here knows full well that one of the major obstacles to the development of inland fisheries has been the lack of financing and the necessity to put the financing of inland fisheries on a sound footing. Everybody here knows it is not the duty of the taxpayer to provide fully for this. Up to £30 million has been invested in the development of inland fisheries over the past five or six years.  We believe it is reasonable to expect that a modest contribution would be made to help back up the State investment in this area and that the people involved in it should contribute a modest amount to enable us to develop fisheries to their fullest potential. I am amazed to hear a Deputy mention the President of the Munster Trout Anglers Federation and the speech he made at the weekend.  I know, and so do many other people, that the President of the Munster Trout Anglers Federation fished all last summer all over Munster &mdash; he is a member of numerous angling clubs &mdash; with a salmon and white trout fishing licence.</P>

      <P>When this issue was debated previously in this House many years ago it was suggested, because of the opposition which came at that time also to the introduction of a licensing system, that if a voluntary system was put in operation it would be used and would be contributed to by the angling fraternity.  They did not do that and when the £5 voluntary registration was substituted for the licence on that occasion nobody paid it.  Last year when the western fisheries board spent over £250,000 in developing inland fisheries in the lakes, in Lough Corrib and Lough Mask and other areas of the western fisheries board area, the total amount which came by way of voluntary subscription was £181.  It is useless for Deputies to come here and say that if we go back to a voluntary system of payment &mdash; unless something dramatic has changed in the last year &mdash; that the people who were not prepared to pay last year will pay now.  Everybody knows that the voluntary system did not work, that it was not complied with, that if we are to do what needs to be done we have to have a statutory system in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there is one single issue that needs to be tackled, it is the question of financing inland fisheries and this can be dealt with in a reasonable way by supporting the legislation enacted at present.

People up to the age of 18 years and people over the age of 65 years do not need a licence. All the revenue collected from the licence goes to develop the inland fisheries at local level.  It does not go to the Government or anybody else.  How can anybody reasonably object to such modest charges which are in the overall interests of developing a resource which for far too long has been allowed stagnate and has been left underdeveloped?  The Deputies here this evening could ask people who have been misguided or misdirected in the past on this issue to at this stage fall into line with the vast majority of the angling community who know that this needs to be done.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the particular position of haemophilia suffers who are HIV positive and who have contracted AIDS.  Dáil Éireann considers that the State has a particular responsibility to all AIDS sufferers and that the State must take into account that many haemophiliacs were infected with the HIV virus through blood products supplied, albeit unwittingly, by State agencies.  Dáil Éireann therefore, calls on the Government to establish a trust fund of £400,000 per annum for HIV infected haemophiliacs.  Dáil Éireann also calls on the Government, and particularly the Minister for Health, to ensure that every public health facility is made available to all AIDS sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of ill-informed comment about this motion since it was originally put down and indeed on the general subject of AIDS. Therefore, it is important to clarify a number of points at the outset.  This is not a motion which seeks to discriminate <Col N="176" /> against any category of AIDS sufferer or to treat one category as different from another.  One of its primary aims is to highlight the plight of all AIDS sufferers and to spell out the need for a caring and efficient delivery of health services to them.</P>
    <P>It is not a motion which calls on the Government to write a blank cheque. That would be irresponsible.  One of the great tragedies of full-blown AIDS is that it is a virtual death sentence.  We know that the people who contract full blown AIDS need help principally to live out their remaining days with dignity and with some prospect of making provision, no matter how meagre, for their next-of-kin. I believe that this motion has the support not only of the majority of the House, and that that includes Deputies from every party and the Independents as well as a considerable number from the Government back benches, but enjoys the support of the entire Irish community. In the motion, we call for the establishment of a trust fund of £400,000 for AIDS sufferers who have contracted the disease through their experience of haemophilia and that the full range of public health services and facilities be made available to all AIDS sufferers.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the case on behalf of haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS.  The motion we have put down describes them as being in a particular position.  I want to explain to the House why we see them as being in a particular position.  As I mentioned earlier, nothing that I say should be taken to imply that they are in any sense more deserving of our support than are other AIDS victims &mdash; although this distortion has been suggested by some.  However, we must all recognise that there are differences. First, the number of haemophiliacs likely to contract AIDS is finite and already known.  We cannot say with absolute certainty what the number is, but in so far as it is humanly and scientifically possible to estimate, the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood product in Ireland has now been eliminated.  Second, we are dealing with unfortunate people who have contracted a disease in public hospitals while <Col N="177" /> availing of medication thought to be the best available for the treatment of their haemophilia.  The treatment was prescribed and delivered to them in good faith and nobody could have been aware that the very methodology for treating one crippling and disabling disease could infect them with an even more deadly one.  We must face the fact that haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS or who have become HIV positive have done so as a result of their contact with blood products supplied in the main through State agencies.  This fact alone gives the State a particular responsibility. I doubt if it can be described as a legal responsibility, but obviously that is a matter beyond my competence and for discussion and decision in another forum. As far as I am aware the blood products in question were supplied in good faith and all precautions thought necessary at the time were taken to ensure the purity of the product.  Tragically, those precautions were not enough.  There is, therefore, if not a legal responsibility, a moral responsibility on the part of the State, on this House and on the Government to respond to the needs of haemophiliacs who have contracted HIV or full-blown AIDS.  Third, the majority of haemophiliacs suffer from other disabilities as a result of their underlying condition.  Even before the discovery of AIDS, most haemophiliacs would have found it virtually impossible to get life assurance because of the risk attached to their hereditary condition.  For all these reasons, it is not unreasonable for haemophiliacs to demand special provisions to assist them.</P>
    <P>There are slightly more than 100 haemophiliacs in Ireland with the AIDS virus; so far, 16 have got full blown AIDS and seven have died.  As I have said we cannot say with absolute certainty what the final number will be other than that it will be finite since the blood products available for the past number of years are now free of contamination.  However, the scale of the tragedy is already immense, given the small size of the haemophiliac community.  About one in every four haemophiliacs is infected in Ireland, a far <Col N="178" /> higher proportion than in many other countries.  Because of the very nature of haemophilia, which is a hereditary disease there are cases of more than one AIDS sufferer in the same family.  So for the family there is a multiplicity of tragedies where more than one member, two or even three members of the same household, have the doubly disabling diseases of haemophilia which has already blotted their lifestyle and presented tremendous difficulties for them and the HIV virus which is a horrific prospect for them and a horrific difficulty for their immediate families to cope with.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of AIDS and haemophilia has already been recognised in many other countries.  Great Britain has established a £12 million trust fund and allowances are already available to ensure adequate dietary, mobility and attendance allowances for such victims.</P>
    <P>Many of us will have heard of the fund that was established speedily and without political rancour or division in the UK where the Government, who can hardly be described as the most caring or compassionate Government on the other side of the water, saw fit to recognise the case of haemophiliacs and established a trust fund.  Many of us will have attended the meeting last week to hear the positive results of that fund and the immense improvement in the quality of life for people suffering from the doubly crippling disease of haemophilia and HIV virus.  It allows many of them to have a proper diet, a holiday &mdash; maybe their last &mdash; and appliances and facilities in the home they would not otherwise be able to afford.  It allows them to avail of transport they would not otherwise be able to afford.  It allows them to enjoy with some sense of dignity the final years of their lives.</P>
    <P>Other countries have established similar funds.  People who have suffered in West Germany have received substantial payments on an individual basis ranging as high as £127,000.  Norway and Denmark have made substantial once-off payments.  There is a trust fund in place in The Netherlands, and many other <Col N="179" /> countries are currently looking at the provision of a trust fund.  Therefore, there is nothing unique or innovative about the demands we are placing on the Minister's desk and the Government's desk tonight. It has been done in countries whose record of compassion is not as great as our own.</P>
    <P>The European Haemophilia Society on 8 April passed the following resolution:</P>
    <P>The European Haemophilia Societies call all member governments of the European Communities to recognise the uniquely tragic position of people with Haemophilia who have become HIV positive through the use of medically inducted blood products and to make immediate financial provision for them on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis as has already been done in Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Spanish experience is that a royal fund has been established to assist people in the same position in Spain.  On 11 April the European Commission stated: &ldquo;It is certain that a humanitarian approach to all such persons&rdquo;&mdash; haemophilia sufferers who have contracted the HIV virus &mdash;&ldquo;is highly desirable and the commission fully agrees with all the initiatives taken in this direction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Against this background the refusal of our Government to make a similar concession is baffling.  The Minister has the endorsement of many of his EC partners and the encouragement of the European Commission, &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; most Members of this House and, I strongly believe, the whole community of this country who are compassionate and have seen the tragedy, evident to anybody, of people who admitted themselves to hospital for treatment for a disabling, crippling disease and who ended up with a double disease.  It is all the more baffling when one considers the grounds on which this refusal is based.  It appears that initially the refusal was based on principle or, at <Col N="180" /> any rate, on a desire not to establish a precedent which might affect the Government's legal position with regard to liability.  That argument makes no sense.  For example, the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health arranged for <i>ex gratia</i> payments in respect of children who had suffered the side effects of the three-in-one inoculation.  The Government previous to this one established the Stardust Tribunal who recommended financial settlements in respect of the victims of that tragedy and their families without regard to the issue of liability. That argument does not wash.  It cannot be argued that a settlement in this case would establish an undesirable precedent. In recent times that argument appears to have been dropped by the Government in any case.  We now appear to be more interested in keeping the financial commitment involved to a minimum. It has emerged that the Government are now willing to make an offer, albeit one that falls far short of the demand of this motion.</P>
      <P>The demand spelled out in this motion is a very modest one, as close to a minimum demand as it is possible to come. Those Deputies in this House who last week attended a meeting of haemophilia sufferers who are HIV positive would know there was a clamour at that meeting for a higher demand, but an argument was made in reasonableness that we would not demand the sky, we would make a modest demand but a demand that would have some impact on the quality of life of those suffering, not tokenism but something that would improve the quality of life of those people so tragically stricken with a doubly disabling disease. The demand of £400,000 spelled out in this motion represents 4p for every £110 we spend annually on our health services. Is that too much to ask for a group so tragically and uniquely afflicted for whom there is a clamour across this country?</P>

    <P>Perhaps the Government would prefer to make a once-off contribution to a trust fund in order not to tie their hands in respect of future budgetary arrangements. <Col N="181" /> We have no objection to a once-off payment but it would have to be sufficient to provide an income large enought to make the trust fund effective. A once-off contribution somewhere between £3 million or £4 million would be adequate, because that would generate interest and the fund would be ongoing and would not require topping up annually. Even that amount would represent a small commitment by the Government set against the overall size of their budget, even set against the extra revenue which has already flowed into the Government coffers this year.  It was a case put that if the Government decided out of their revenue bonanza to invest £10 million for one year, assuming an interest rate of 10 per cent, that would give £1 million to a trust fund and you could have your £10 million back at the end of the year.  That would be a meaningful sum to cope with the trauma, the difficulties and the dreadful situation of people who are trapped in this doubly disabling disease.</P>
    <P>Obviously, whatever provision is made, there would have to be access immediately for those people who are suffering.  Unfortunately, as I have indicated, some have died and the only certainty is that the number of people in this category will diminish because death will overcome them.  We have to act on a basis of some urgency in order to grant them some measure of dignity and some improvement in their lifestyles literally before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now about other AIDS sufferers.  No one set out deliberately to get AIDS.  That is a truism. AIDS is a debilitating, withering condition which destroys hope and morale long before it destroys life.  Every AIDS victim or AIDS sufferer is a personal tragedy and there can be no discrimination between one and another. Health services must be made available to AIDS victims.  AIDS sufferers must have all the State can provide to improve their medical condition and grant them medical relief.</P>
    <P>The pain endured by AIDS sufferers and their families is such that no words <Col N="182" /> of mine can begin to do justice to it.  As a society which regards itself as civilised and as Christian we have an obligation to those who are suffering and who are in pain.  We owe it to all AIDS sufferers to ensure that they suffer no stigma as a result of AIDS.  We owe it to them that they should be as comfortable and as free from worry as it is possible for them to be, that they should have all the counselling and support necessary to enable them to face an uncertain future and that their last days should be spent with some semblance of dignity.  We owe it to their families to ensure that they get all possible help to come to terms with the grief and loss involved.  This is not happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister's claim that this motion divides AIDS sufferers into categories rings extra hollow when we see the inadequate provisions for AIDS sufferers of all types in the community.  There are many complaints about having to wait in queues, about inadequate provisions and the lack of immediate access to medication when it is needed.  The Government have a committee working on the issue of AIDS and the delivery of health services.  I understand the committee is to report to them next week.  I hope the committee will not only make recommendations to improve the situation for AIDS sufferers but that the Government will respond in kind and provide money and resources so that this tragedy need not continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows my views on his handling of the health services during the past two years.  I have brought motion after motion before this House whenever possible.  The Minister has run down the health services to an unprecedented degree and many health services are tottering to a standstill.  I will not go into all the other aspects of his stewardship of the health services.  We know the position in the Southern Health Board now and I could name a dozen hospitals suffering the trauma of his cuts.</P>
    <P>One particular difficulty faces not only this country or Europe but the whole world.  That is the plague of AIDS.  We seemed to have had an immediate <Col N="183" /> response to it.  A campaign was waged with some urgency but that urgency seems to have gone from the debate.  We seem to have decided we have done our bit and now everything can be on a low key.  We do not have high profile warnings. It is almost as if there was a demand some 12 or 18 months ago to change our lifestyles and be aware, but now we can fall back into former practice as if nothing has happened.  I call on the Minister when responding to address the whole condition of AIDS sufferers and to outline to the House the details of the ongoing campaign to attack this most horrendous plague which has to be faced and fought by all of us in every country in the world.</P>
    <P>I know there is nobody in this House who would begrudge the provision of essential support, medication, counselling and help to all AIDS victims, but I fear that not enough is being done to put the resources and structures in place to ensure the effective delivery of the services I have outlined.  I hope the rest of this debate, conducted in a reasoned and open atmosphere, will help to bring this condition to the light of day and that at the end of the debate tomorrow at 8.30 p.m. we will stand united as a community, not divided as politicians, in support of one group of people in our community who are suffering.  I implore the Minister to think long and hard about the group of people we have talked about and to respond charitably and positively to the modest demand of people whose days are literally numbered.  I call on the House, all parties and individuals, to support the motion in the names of the Labour Party Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House and particularly Deputy Howlin for allowing me the remaining minutes of his time to say a few words on this issue.  I wholeheartedly support the Labour Party motion, which is on the same lines as a motion I tabled some time ago.  I am glad to see that there appears to be widespread support among the Opposition groupings for the effort to get justice and fair play for haemophiliacs.  I, too, have attended <Col N="184" /> many of the meetings organised by the haemophiliacs, which were attended by some of the Minister's backbenchers. Every one of them agreed that this was a particularly tragic situation which needed particular attention.</P>
      <P>On 9 February this year I raised this matter with the Minister at Question Time.  His main argument is to be found at column 2065, Volume 386 of the Official Report.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>.... as I see it the Government have a responsibility to all AIDS victims to ensure that they are provided with the very highest level of services available....  We have to ensure that there is equity in the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said on other occasions that no group could be treated differently. I have listened intently to the Minister in various interviews as well as in the House and this is his main argument.</P>
      <P>The question of treating differently a particular group of people suffering from such a desperate disease as AIDS is an especially difficult question for me to answer as a Member who represents a constituency where there is a huge number of young people who suffered from the heroin plague of the early 1980s and who today suffer from an even worse plague, that of AIDS.  Many of those young people in my constituency who are suffering from AIDS still live in the most dreadful poverty.  It was that poverty which propelled them into the heroin nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 community leaders, social workers, clergy and all who saw the problem and brought it to the attention of the Department of Health were ignored for a considerable period.  They were told the problem did not exist.  The heroin nightmare as it was seen in that area of the north and south inner city then got out of control.  The communities themselves took action.  They formed the Concerned Parents Group and went to RTE to get the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme to highlight how terrible the reality was in their area.  When surveys were carried out at that time we were told that among young people in flat complexes in the inner city <Col N="185" /> there was a higher proportion of heroin addicts than in the worst ghettos of New York and other cities around the world that had known the heroin problem for years before.</P>
    <P>I will go on to look at the facilities now available, even after that length of time, to people who suffer from heroin addiction and AIDS.  The central question is how are the haemophiliacs unique and why should they be treated differently from other categories of people suffering from AIDS? AIDS is the horror, the nightmare disease of this part of the 20th century.  A small group of people, in all about 100, were infected with AIDS as a result of medical treatment administered to them through the Department of Health.  That simple fact makes them different and imposes on all of us a moral responsibility to respond to their plea for help.  How can the Minister sustain his argument that he cannot be seen to be treating one group differently from the others? That argument cannot be sustained because one cannot escape from the starting point which is that the Department of Health treated them differently when, although unwittingly, they were infected with the AIDS virus through the administration of the Factor 8 substitute.</P>
    <P>Let me return for a moment to the Minister's reply at Question Time to which I have already referred.  The Minister said it was the Government's responsibility to provide the highest level of services for the 825 persons whom we now know to be infected with HIV.  Let us look at the only hospital facility for AIDS sufferers, James's Street Hospital. Facilities provided there are virtually non-existent.  I am told by people who work with people suffering from AIDS that these people are assigned to the corridors and hallways of the hospital to queue on a daily basis.  If even five of the 52 prisoners suffering from AIDS turn up they, too, queue with the families, relatives and parents along with ten prison officers, two officers for each, in that grim scene.  That is the highest level of facilities and services available at the moment from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> James's Street Hospital is lucky to have the only consultant working in that field. No other hospital has a consultant but what is incredible is that the doctor working with the consultant is there not because the Department of Health are employing him to be there but because he is employed by the AIDS fund, a voluntary charitable organisation.  Surely the Minister will agree that the very least one could expect is that his Department would provide and pay the necessary medical staff in the only hospital facility to care for the unfortunate, tragic people who suffer from that disease today.</P>
    <P>The same AIDS fund launched a scheme today to monitor mothers and babies infected with AIDS, a particularly difficult problem here.  Should a voluntary group have to do this?  The Minister may tell us that he has given some lottery money to this group, but that is not good enough.  That voluntary group stated today in a press release that they want to take AIDS out of the overcrowded, overburdened clinics and create a one-to-one treatment and therapy facility, a far cry from the prisoners crowded into the black hole in Mountjoy in the most despicable conditions that one could think of.  I doubt if they get equity.</P>
    <P>The Minister may talk about the Government's responsibility.  It is mostly talk but little action.  The truth is that if one has AIDS in Ireland today one's best option is that available to the 40,000 jobless each year, to get out and go to Britain.  It is, therefore, no surprise to hear that the Minister still refuses to respond in a positive way to the haemophiliacs. Even when we point to what other European countries have done, the Minister simply remarks, as he did at Question Time today, that most of the European Community countries do not have a scheme.</P>
    <P>Let us look at Britain.  In Britain the Minister for Health initially took the stand the Minister here is taking and did not agree that there was a particular case to respond to, but within a month he <Col N="187" /> changed his mind and said on 16 November 1987 in the House of Commons at column 773:</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the position under successive governments has been that while compensation may be sought through the courts, if there is a question of negligence there is no State scheme of no fault compensation for those damaged by medical treatment.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>The Haemophilia Society have, however, put to us a very powerful case that the position of haemophiliacs is wholly exceptional and should be treated as such.  Their employment prospects and insurance status were already affected by haemophilia itself. The treatment that led to their infection was designed to help them to live as near a normal life as possible.  The hereditary nature of haemophilia can, and in some cases does, mean that more than one member of the family can be affected.</P>
    <P>The Government, having considered all the circumstances, have concluded that it would be right to recognise the unique position of haemophiliacs infected with the virus. We, therefore, propose to make an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant of £10 million to the Haemophilia Society to enable it to establish a special trust fund.  It will be able to make payments to the affected individuals and families throughout the United Kingdom and to do so with greater flexibility than would readily be achieved in any other way.</P>
    <P>It has been said, rightly, that all AIDS sufferers are innocent by virtue of the scale of the human tragedy that is involved.  Guilt or innocence, therefore, is not an issue.  The issue is the terrible ordeal of a small group of people, affecting more than one and even more than two in some families and even two generations of the same family.  The issue is that the medical treatment given to the haemophiliacs by the medical services of the Department of Health was the source <Col N="188" /> of their tragedy.  That fact alone makes the case of the haemophiliacs unique.</P>

      <P>It is also important to point out that AIDS &mdash; again there is a mystery about AIDS &mdash; is an illness that can be treated in any hospital.  It consists of a number of illnesses involving kaprosisarcoma, pneumonia and neurological <Col N="189" /> problems.  All these illnesses can be treated in general hospitals around the country.  Everybody who suffers from AIDS does not have to go to a specialist unit.</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the motion proposed by the Labour Party in relation to haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS.  I move Amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>after Dáil Éireann delete everything and insert &ldquo;reject any proposals which would inherently result in discrimination between individuals suffering from AIDS or the AIDS virus; Dáil Éireann further considers that all such persons should be treated with sensitivity and understanding and notes in this respect that a Working Group under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health is to report to the Minister for Health next week on any difficulties which persons suffering from AIDS or HIV may have in gaining access to health services appropriate to their condition; Dáil Éireann notes also the offer of the Minister for Health made to the Irish Haemophilia Society to provide £50,000 for counselling services and his willingness to make a contribution towards a Trust Fund which may be established by or on behalf of the AIDS sufferers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All of us in this House have the deepest sympathy and understanding for those already carrying the heavy burden of haemophilia and who have now acquired the AIDS or the HIV virus as a result of medical treatment.  I know, too, that none of us has any less sympathy for those who acquired the virus by whatever other means or indeed any less sympathy for the 53 babies who to date have been born with the virus.  I also understand the motivation, sympathy, and emotion which underlies the wishes of all the Members of this House to do what is right in all of the circumstances with which we are now faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background I am moving the Government amendment as a firm basis for seeking a reasoned solution to the issues raised.  I believe these issues <Col N="190" /> may be summarised as follows: (1) the moral and legal responsibility of the Minister for Health in relation to haemophiliacs who have acquired the virus through medical treatment; (2) the special service requirement of haemophiliacs; (3) other services and benefits which do not usually come within the ambit of the health services and (4) the establishment of a trust fund and the making of a contribution to it by Government.</P>
    <P>The moral responsibility of the Minister for Health, about which I might add much has been loosely said and written, is quite clear.  It is to provide the best possible health services for all sufferers regardless of their ailments or how those ailments were acquired and to provide these services equitably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a bad job of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be more accountable for one sufferer as against another.  It is my duty to treat each on the same basis.</P>
      <P>The State and its agencies have, of course, a statutory involvement in relation to the treatment provided but the liability, if any, of the State and others who are involved in providing the treatment is, of course, a legal issue and therefore one which could be a matter for the legal process to adjudicate upon.  I make this point because the House should know that an intention to serve legal proceedings on the State and on the others was issued on behalf of the Irish Haemophilia Society on 6 April 1989.</P>
      <P>Because of our understanding of the special problems which may arise for persons already suffering from haemophilia and who have now acquired the AIDS or HIV virus, I established a working group under the chairmanship of Deputy Terry Leyden, the Minister of State at my Department, to consider and report to me on any difficulties which such persons may have in gaining access to health services appropriate to their condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee are finalising their report and I expect to have it and to act <Col N="191" /> upon it next week.  Finally, in relation to the establishment of a trust fund I have already made my position very clear in an interview which I gave to the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to report to the House that this evening I have been formally approached by the AIDS fund who informed me that they will establish a trust fund to assist AIDS sufferers.  I wish to put on the record of the House that I am prepared to discuss with the AIDS fund a Government contribution of £250,000 in the current year towards such a fund when it is established.  On the point of the amount of money involved, I have no doubt that the trust fund organised by the AIDS fund who are well known will have other contributors besides the Government.  I believe that our response to the issues which are before us represents a comprehensive, thoughtful and careful response and should be supported by this House.</P>
      <P>If the matter is dealt with in the manner proposed in the Labour Party motion, it would have implications I am convinced, not alone for the Government's broadly-based approach to the AIDS problem but also for such fundamental issues as the role of the State, and of the relevant State agencies, in relation to the safety and efficiency of medicinal products and of the rights and responsibilities of physicians in recommending the accepted form of medical treatment at a particular time.  I should point out, of course, that the treatment given was essential for the very survival of the persons to whom it was being administered.  This is a point that gets overlooked in some of the comments that are made regarding this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> Over the years, a number of measures were taken by the Department of Health and their agencies to protect the blood supply against contamination.  In 1983, the Blood Transfusion Service Board introduced a policy of self-exclusion from donating blood under which persons in identified high risk groups would refrain from donating.  This was done following a Council of Europe recommendation, even though there was no test available for the antibody to the virus and for screening donated blood at the time. Ireland was the first country in Europe to implement this recommendation; testing blood donations for antibodies to the virus commenced in 1985 as soon as a test became available.  As a result, Ireland has not had a case of AIDS or HIV related to an Irish blood donation.  This latter point is of particular relevance; heat-treated products only were used since 1985 &mdash; again as soon as it was shown that heat treatment kills the virus &mdash; and non-heat-treated products were withdrawn and self-sufficiency in heat-treated Factor 8 was achieved in 1987. Movement towards this commenced in 1980 but, prior to that, Ireland was self-sufficient in cryoprecipitate made from Irish donations.  I would like to stress here that self-sufficiency in Factor 8 was the BTSB policy prior to the AIDS scare but despite this, Ireland is in fact only one of four countries which are now self-sufficient, the others being Norway, Finland and the Netherlands.  It can be seen that the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board acted to protect the blood as the first priority in relation to AIDS and acted at all times to introduce newly discovered protective measures, as soon as it was possible to do so, towards achieving this end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in March 1972 under the Companies Act, 1963, as provided for in section 2 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972.  They were designed to fill a gap which was perceived in the range of State services available to manufacturing industry at the time.  The purpose was to provide an orderly procedure for restructuring ailing, but potentially viable, industrial concerns which encountered financial difficulties and which were unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir were established in a period of structural change in Irish industry prior to EC membership in 1973 and the removal of many trade barriers.  The progression to the open economy which we now have was taking place rapidly, and it was not unnatural that the Government at the time took the view that transitional measures aimed at helping Irish industry to adapt to the new more competitive <Col N="194" /> conditions would be reasonable.  Furthermore, during the recessionary period of the early eighties, Fóir provided very substantial assistance to Irish industry, mainly in the traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing, footwear and leather, furniture, mining, etc.  Unfortunately, despite Fóir's best efforts, the traditional sectors of the economy had a fall in output of about 2 per cent per annum on average over the period 1973-86, along with a consequential fall in employment.  In 1988, the performance of the traditional sectors has been turned around, and a growth in output of about 3 per cent was achieved in that year. It would be difficult to assert that Fóir Teoranta had anything but a marginal effect on the overall performance of these sectors one way or the other over the period since their establishment.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, just after Fóir Teoranta were established.  Since then, there have been wide fluctuations in the economic performance of the country.  In part, fast growth periods were stimulated by increased Government expenditure and borrowing.  These borrowings eventually became unsustainable and this Government embarked upon the implementation of a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which had as one of its central aims the improvement of the environment for industry so that industry would be in a position to stand on its own feet and compete in the world marketplace.</P>
    <P>The aim is to reduce unnecessary Government expenditure thereby reducing Government borrowing and lessening the upward pressures on interest rates and inflation.  State props such as those provided by Fóir Teoranta have no place in this environment.  The best action which the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lowering the input cost of industry thus avoiding altogether the need for firms to receive financial hand-outs from the State when <Col N="195" /> it is probably too late.  Real sustainable employment will only be created on such a basis rather than on the basis of protection and State props for industry.</P>
    <P>In 1973, 31 per cent of the Irish workforce was employed in industry.  That proportion reduced to 28 per cent by 1988, while the services sector increased, and agriculture continued its long term decline.  It is a primary aim of Government policy to promote the expansion of industry so as to offset the structural decline in agriculture and to create the basis for higher employment directly in industry and also in the services sector. Since 1960, manufacturing output has increased on average by 5 per cent per annum.  In the last two years, the growth of manufacturing industry increased to more than twice this rate.</P>
    <P>The Government's forecast of 13,000 net new jobs for the economy in the current year is achievable.  Higher employment now taking place is due to sustained export growth and also to a resumption of demand on the home market.  The European Community is now growing at its fastes rate for 30 years and, as in the past, Ireland can expect to participate in this expansion.  It seems likely that we can match average European employment growth in the current year.</P>
    <P>The link between higher economic growth and employment is as true today as it ever was.  Experience suggests that growth of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent is necessary to maintain employment and that the total number of jobs increases proportionately when economic growth exceeds that figure.  It follows that the only way to create sustainable jobs is to increase economic output by producing more goods and services. The key contribution of industry is to increase output as a result of which jobs will be supported, either directly or indirectly.  Without higher output, more jobs cannot be created on a sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Jobs will always be won and lost in any sector of industry and in particular firms. However, what is of crucial importance is that employment overall in the economy is increased, and that the new jobs are sustainable over the longer term.  We do not need a Fóir Teoranta to fulfil this objective.  Indeed, the evidence is that it was already too late for many of the firms who went to Fóir Teoranta and obtained State assistance.  This assistance was then only useful in many instances to enable the firms to carry on for a while longer. Some firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta prospered and are trading successfully today, but the main point is that the thrust of Government policy is to get the overall number of jobs up in the economy by creating the right conditions for growth rather than by propping up individual firms at a high cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The level of activity in Fóir Teoranta has tapered off considerably in recent years, from a peak of about £23 million in disbursement in 1983 to about £7 million last year.  The number of applications received, cases approved, and the average size of approved cases have also substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>In line with the fall-off in demand for their services and the virtual disappearance of large cases, together with buoyant own resources, Fóir's requirement for Exchequer funding also declined in recent years.  In fact, the last occasion when the company needed to call on the Exchequer was almost two years ago.  Since then, they have financed their operations from ongoing income from their investments by way of interest and capital repayments as well as a considerable element of pre-payments.  At the end of December 1988 cash in hands or at short notice stood at £5.7 million. Following the Government decision to wind-up Fóir, the Exchequer allocation of £3 million originally provided for in the Abridged Estimates as an ongoing entity was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Since Fóir Teoranta is a lender of last <Col N="197" /> resort, it is not perhaps all that surprising that a high degree of failure has taken place among Fóir Teoranta client firms. The failure rate experienced by Fóir however, has been at very considerable cost to the Exchequer.  The failure rate may be measured by the fact that, of the currently outstanding advances given to Fóir Teoranta by the Exchequer of £96 million, about £75 million has in effect already been written-off by the company. While many firms have prospered with Fóir Teoranta assistance, there has nevertheless been a heavy loss of the Exchequer money invested in Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The level of write-off in Fóir Teoranta is a reflection of the fact that many firms assisted failed, despite the assistance given by Fóir Teoranta.  Many such firms left it far too late to go to Fóir Teoranta for assistance.  Where, nevertheless, assistance was given in such cases, the damage had already been done and the firms eventually went to the wall anyway. While there may be economic benefit from keeping jobs in existence longer rather than being lost at the outset, there is the fact that the prospect for long term sustainable employment may be better if firms are transferred to new owners quickly in the receivership-liquidation process than if the firms are kept in existence, with Fóir assistance, but with existing debt levels and perhaps poor management and other weaknesses.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the Government considered the future of Fóir Teoranta.  Their decision that Fóir should be wound up, as indicated in the announcement I made on 22 February was grounded on the following: (i) the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services over the recent past; (ii) the very much changed industrial environment now, as a result of the firm action taken by this Government, as compared with when Fóir Teoranta were established; (iii) the soon to be enacted provision in the latest Companies Bill allowing for the appointment by the courts of an examiner <Col N="198" /> in order to prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation; and (iv) the need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges of the more competitive régime which will apply when the internal market is in place after 1992.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the decline in demand for Fóir's services.  This decline is due to a number of factors &mdash; the new climate of confidence in the economy and the favourable environment for industry are obviously major influencing factors.  I will deal with these in more detail shortly. Another important consideration is the fact that finance for industry is available on a much wider scale now than ever before from private sector individual and institutional sources.  Individual investors have the powerful advantage of State-backed tax schemes such as the business expansion scheme.  The BES now has funds of over £32 million invested, and has clearly been a substantial source of equity funding for Irish business which in the past has been perhaps too heavily dependent on debt finance.  The restrictions on the BES contained in the Finance Bill which I introduced recently are not directed towards investment in manufacturing industry, the area in which Fóir Teoranta were involved.</P>
    <P>Venture capital funds also exist on a significant scale, with an important role in this regard being played by NADCORP and the investment arm of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Given these developments, it was inevitable that, leaving aside the improvements in the economy generally, demand for Fóir Teoranta services would be considerably lessened and the need for such an organisation diminished.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the industrial environment now is also very much changed from the one which existed when Fóir Teoranta were established 17 years ago and during their main periods of business. Business confidence has never been greater.  Interest rates are at their lowest levels for over a decade, inflation is at its <Col N="199" /> lowest level since the early sixties.  The Confederation of Irish Industry, in a survey of their member firms in 1987, concluded that industry would &ldquo;prefer to have a competitive cost environment than seek to compensate for deficiencies in the environment through cash grants&rdquo; etc., from the State.  Clearly, we are living in an environment much more conducive to getting industry back on its feet, and achieving increased long-term industrial employment.  The Government have got the conditions right.  Industry itself must now deliver, without the aid of State props, for individual firms which find themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Everything we in Government are doing is aimed at increasing growth and jobs in our economy.  The problems and development needs of the economy are such that there can be no question of doublethink or lack of consistency between the different parts of the Government's overall strategy as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Everything must hang together in a consistent and carefully targeted approach aimed at securing more growth and more jobs.</P>
    <P>In view of the recent comprehensive debate in the House on the <i>National Development Plan</i> I do not propose today to deal at any great length with the economic situation.  However, there are a few general points on the economy which deserve to be aired again so that the context in which the decision was taken to wind up the activities of Fóir Teoranta can be more readily appreciated.</P>
    <P>This year's budget won widespread support throughout the community. Developments since the budget suggest that the strategy on which it was based is firmly on course.  The Exchequer returns for the first quarter were very encouraging. They support the view that the strengthening in economic activity which was projected in January is, in fact, taking place.  There is a strong recovery <Col N="200" /> in consumer spending.  Retail sales in January were up by 7 per cent in volume on the year before.  Unemployment in the first quarter of this year was substantially lower than in the first quarter of last year. Manufacturing employment in the final quarter of 1988 &mdash; the latest period for which figures are available &mdash; shows a year to year increase for the first time since 1980.  In the building industry, employment in the larger firms in January and February was some 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding two months of 1988.  This, together with the increase of 30 per cent in housing starts in the first two months of the year, is an indication of the substantial recovery which is now underway in the building industry after several lean years.</P>
    <P>The trends so far support our expectation of a further substantial balance of payments surplus this year, of broadly the same order as last year.  Exports have risen by 24 per cent in value year to year in the first two months of this year.  This reflects the continued buoyancy of our export markets and the all important improvements in competitiveness which have been made here.  There has also been strong growth in the value of imports.  Imports of capital goods are up by 20 per cent &mdash; a good omen for investment and future output.  As expected, imports of consumer goods are also strong in response to the recovery in private consumption.  The challenge to domestic producers is to capture a growing share of this recovery in consumption and not to lose out, through price increases or otherwise, to overseas producers selling into our home market.  Inflationary pressures at present in the economy will have to be resisted by every means at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The overall prospect for 1989 remains one of strong economic growth.  I am confident that the budget time prediction of a 3½ per cent increase in real GDP will be realised and might be bettered.  In this new realistic and competitive industrial <Col N="201" /> environment the demand for Fóir Teoranta's services had fallen dramatically.</P>
    <P>Everybody is taking heart from the developments in the economy.  There is a new air of confidence.  It is good to see new investments and projects springing up all around the country.  While problems remain, people now see that the earlier pattern of despondency and economic decline can be broken.</P>
    <P>It is not part of my task to dampen this new enthusiasm &mdash; the opposite is the case.  I must underline again, however, that in taking satisfaction from the progress made to date we must keep our feet firmly on the ground.  Easy options must be avoided.  An increase in costs and inflation &mdash; even from the low base we have achieved &mdash; is no substitute for higher productivity and efficiency.  Jobs will be lost, not made, if we do not continue tight control of costs right across the economy.  In areas where we ourselves have control, we must be ruthless in our approach.</P>
    <P>For this reason it bears repeating that much of the rise in prices in the three months to February &mdash; over 1 per cent, leaving aside non-recurring budget effects &mdash; originated within our own economy rather than abroad.  If we are not to put at risk our hard-won success in getting inflation down, all sectors must continue the restraint in evidence up to recently, and avoid rekindling domestic inflation pressures.  Renewed inflation can only do harm to our international trading prospects, diminish our growth potential and ultimately inhibit the recovery in employment now under way.  This Government are determined to resist such conditions thereby obviating the need for State services such as that provided by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the public finances over the past few years has been dramatic.  The trends so far this year suggest that, yet again, the budget targets may well be bettered.  In this area too, however, we cannot allow our guard to <Col N="202" /> slip.  The annual addition of new borrowing is still too high.  The exceptional overhang of debt still constrains our economic progress and eats up large resources that could be put to much better use.  The Government are determined, therefore, to press ahead with the reduction of borrowing and debt.</P>
    <P>We are already considering how best to achieve further necessary savings in expenditure in 1990, so as to make room for new investment within an overall improving budgetary trend.  This work will be advanced in the coming months. The policies for the rationalisation of State bodies, of which the decision on Fóir Teoranta was part, will be continued in that context.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in the past two years in the reform of the tax system including reductions in the corporate tax system.  These reforms were impossible to implement while the public finances were in disarray.  The actions on the tax front were made possible in large measure by the curbing of public expenditure during the past two years, while the overall reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement was not compromised. These changes have been crucial to the general economic recovery.  There can be no exceptions to the rigorous and ongoing examination of public expenditure, aimed at ensuring that the general economic environment for business is continually inmproved.  Bodies which have outlived their usefulness have no part to play in the new approach of realism to the public finances and competitiveness in the economy.</P>
    <P>The provision in the latest Companies Bill allowing for the appointment by the courts of an examiner to companies in financial difficulty is modelled on the similar Chapter 11 process in the United States.  The aim is to prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation.  This approach is one advocated by Fóir Teoranta for some years past.  It allows for a stay of the rights of creditors while the examiner attempts <Col N="203" /> a reconstruction of the company's finances. One of my objectives in preparing the Bill was to provide a new procedure which would help to obviate the need for a separate State company to deal with industrial rescue.  Conditions in the economy are now such that the Government are satisfied that such a company is no longer required.  Fóir Teoranta will, therefore, no longer be one of the participants in the examiner procedure as had been envisaged when the Bill was published.  I am satisfied that the effectiveness of the new procedure will not be impaired as a result.  There will be ample scope under the new arrangements for genuinely viable firms to stave off closure if they are threatened by merely short term financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is no justification, as has been suggested, for holding Fóir Teoranta open until the new procedures are actually enacted.  The timing differences will be quite short, and the essential point is that firms have to stand on their own two feet, in the new industrial environment, without recourse to the taxpayer for handouts.  This is a view supported, as I have said, by industry itself.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we as a nation have to gear up to the challenges that the creation of the European internal market will bring in 1992.  This applies to all sectors of the economy.  Irish industry will have to meet the competitive pressures without State feather bedding.  Lame ducks will no longer be able to look to the State &mdash; the taxpayer in other words &mdash; to bail them out.  This is an economy that is itself open to competition, and expects that the doors of its trading partners will be equally open to our exporters.  This Government are convinced that they are adopting the correct approach in the interest of ensuring that Irish industry is best equipped to meet the challenge about to face it, and to ensure that the maintenance and growth of industrial employment &mdash; and employment generally &mdash; in this country on a <Col N="204" /> long term secure footing is continued. With this in view I should add that already expenditure on industry was increased by £11.5 million Structural Fund money, in the budget, which is almost four times greater than the saving of £3 million in the Exchequer allocation to Fóir Teoranta in 1989 as a result of the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government have taken their decision in this matter in the light of prevailing circumstances.  The Government's view is that with the other sources of finance available for investment in industry and with the economy in such good condition, there should be little if any adverse impact on employment as a result of the closure of Fóir Teoranta.  As regards the view that a need may arise in the future for the State to be actively involved in industrial rescue should economic conditions deteriorate, it has to be made clear that the days of feather bedding Irish industry are over. Irish industry must be able to compete in the marketplace and, in an intensive effort to ensure that this will be the case post-1992, the Government are already devoting greater resources to industry in the context of the EC Structural Funds over the next few years.  There is therefore no lessening in the level of resources being devoted to industry.  It is the purpose for which those resources are used which is important, and we will be ensuring that the funds involved are put to best effect in order to secure good solid progress in attaining the employment targets set out in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I said in my statement of 22 February that immediate discussions would take place with Fóir Teoranta on the implication of the Government decision for the staff and the company.  These discussions began on 23 February and are continuing.  They are designed to allay whatever fears the staff may have as to their position and to cover the options that will be available to them by way of <Col N="205" /> redeployment, early retirement or whatever. This is an on-going situation as the House will appreciate but one which in the interest of all concerned, most of all staff themselves, is being progressed as rapidly as possible.  I am hopeful that the arrangements being put in place will lead to an early and satisfactory outcome acceptable to all.  The clear aim of policy in this regard is that there would be no compulsory redundancies in Fóir Teoranta, and every effort is being made to ensure that this result is achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in my statement of 22 February, I said that new applications for rescue assistance would not be accepted by Fóir Teoranta from Thursday, 23 February 1989.  In case of any doubt, I should say here that all other applications, that is, those received by the company up to and including 22 February, are being processed and decided on in the normal way.  I also said that appropriate alternative arrangements for the administration of Fóir Teoranta's existing portfolio of loans and equity holdings would be made by the end of the winding up period so as to ensure that the Exchequer investment in the firms in question is protected.  My Department are considering the options in this regard. As well as protecting the interest of the Exchequer, it is important that the arrangements to be put in place will be such as to maximise the benefit of the Fóir Teoranta assistance granted to the firms concerned.  I can say at this stage that there will be no question of throwing to the wolves Fóir Teoranta's existing client base.  Without committing myself, I would envisage that the portfolio will be continued to be managed within the public sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like once again to express publicly my appreciation of the work done by Fóir Teoranta since their establishment including the management advice service provided by the company, which had become a more significant part of their work in recent years.  I wish to <Col N="206" /> pay tribute to the hard work, commitment and dedication of the staff, management and directors of the company over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have demonstrated in my career in public office that I am no lover of unnecessary bureaucracies or of excessive public spending.  It is in the light of that record, and my experience over many years as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that I say I believe that the decision of the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, in abolishing Fóir Teoranta was a superfical and impetuous one made solely for the optics, in order that the Minister could give the appearance that he was taking action without any regard to the merits of the case and without any prior consideration of the issues involved.  As evidence of this I adduce the fact that there was no consultation whatever with the board of Fóir Teoranta prior to the making and announcement of this decision.  Furthermore, two months after the decision being announced large numbers of loose ends still remain to be tied up.  If this was a decision that was taken with care and consideration all of those loose ends would have been tied up prior to the day of the announcement but the Minister decided that he would make the announcement first and worry about whether or how it could be implemented afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister two months after he made his announcement still is unable to tell the House who will be responsible for managing the portfolio of loans and investments for which the board of Fóir Teoranta were previously by law responsible for managing. I would remind the House that the board of Fóir Teoranta have loans outstanding to them of £37 million or more and have investments for which they are responsible of £24 million or more.  Up to 22 February Fóir Teoranta, and their board, were responsible for <Col N="207" /> looking after those investments but for the last two months nobody knows who is responsible for them.  Two months after his announcement the Minister is talking about envisaging that somebody in the public sector might be responsible.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that <Col N="208" /> just because a person has got a clean bill of health following a check up by a doctor he or she should decide to cancel a life assurance policy.  The fact that there is not great demand for the services of Fóir Teoranta at the moment, and the fact that there are considerable sums of money available now from business expansion scheme funded venture capital bodies is not a reason for abolishing Fóir Teoranta who are there as a lender of last resort in bad times.  We happen to be in good times in terms of availability of funds for investment and I will be the first to acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta was established not to deal with good firms in good times but to deal with the problems of good firms in bad times.  In abolishing Fóir Teoranta the Minister is abolishing an agency established by law to operate in good times as well as bad.  To adduce, as did the Minister, as an argument for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta the fact that it is not an argument at all.  Fóir Teoranta was never established simply to be active was never extablished simply to be active solely in good times which, as everybody knows who has any length of recollection, is a temporary phenomenon.</P>
      <P>The last time the operations of Fóir Teoranta were considered in any serious manner in this House &mdash; I do not regard this debate as a considered one on the subject at all because there is no opportunity for the Minister to reply to questions &mdash; was when the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored bodies considered the matter.  I want to give one short quotation from the 17th Report of that committee, dated 8 April 1981.  Paragraph 51 reads:</P>
      <P>In the course of a submission to the Committee, the Department of Finance stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In summary, Fóir Teoranta performs a most valuable function, on the basis of rational criteria, by helping <Col N="209" /> industrial firms in temporary difficulties to survive and recover profitability. Its services are of particular value in times of exceptional economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Those are the views of the Department of Finance, a body which has a well-earned reputation of being antipathic to unnecessary State bodies.  They, as a Department, with the approval of their then Minister &mdash; who was, I believe, a Fianna Fáil Minister &mdash; expressed those views about Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I am not relying solely on civil servants to bolster my case in this matter.  The all-party committee that received that advice from the Department of Finance came to the following conclusion which I shall quote:</P>
    <P>As a result of its review of the operations of Fóir, the Committee has come to the conclusion that the Department's statement...</P>
    <P>That is, the Department of Finance earlier quoted&mdash;</P>
    <P>...is fully justified.</P>
    <P>That is the considered view of an all-party committee, including a number of Deputies of the Minister's party, of mine and of the Labour Party on this subject. It is also the view of the primary Department of State in this country.</P>
    <P>For the Minister, without consultation with the board of Fóir Teoranta, without consultation with anybody, without having made arrangements to deal with the consequences of his decision in terms of deciding who would administer the portfolio, to just abolish this body purely in order to give himself a good appearance in certain hostelries where economic matters are discussed, to my mind, is not a very rational approach.  I am well aware of the Doheny and Nesbitt school of economics.  I am well aware of the talents of those who are there but I never allowed myself to be so swayed by that advice as to make decisions that I did not believe to be rational simply because people who <Col N="210" /> were fully paid-up members of that school expressed the view.  That is the reason the Minister took this decision.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that no money will be saved by the abolition of Fóir Teoranta.  In fact, Fóir Teoranta will show a surplus of £2 million on their operations this year. Therefore, far from this being a tremendous blow for the taxpayer, this decision will be quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are not, and never were, an easy touch for a loan.  Under their terms of reference, established by the late Deputy George Colley when he introduced the necessary legislation, in order to qualify for aid from Fóir Teoranta a company must: (1) be engaged in industrial activity; (2) have significant employment involved which is either nationally or locally significant; (3) there must be a sufficient contribution of money from the owner of the company going in at the time of the rescue; (4) there must be reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis; (5) its continuance is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources and, finally, failure to receive assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.  All of those criteria must be complied with if a company is to get aid from Fóir Teoranta.  There is no question of Fóir Teoranta ever being used simply to bale out the banks because, under the law, if a company can get assistance from the banks, they cannot get it from Fóir Teoranta.  It is only companies that cannot get assistance from the banks that are qualified to receive assistance from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I believe there are a number of types of companies which need help, need continually to have the knowledge that help is available, if necessary, from an agency such as Fóir Teoranta.  I would identify three categories.  There are, first, young companies with new products, particularly in the high tech sector in the first year or two of their operations.  It is well <Col N="211" /> known that companies with a good product get into temporary difficulties early on in their first years of operations.  The Minister might say: suppose they go bust, what is lost?  The fact of the matter is that many new companies constitute a brain-based operation, based on the knowledge and contracts of a particular entrepreneur. If that entrepreneur is put out of business the fact that somebody else can buy the assets of the company saves nothing and that job-creating project is lost for ever. In such circumstances a rescue agency has a role to play, not in the majority of cases but rather as an agency to deal with minority cases or circumstances as they arise.</P>
    <P>The second category in respect of which Fóir Teoranta aid is necessary &mdash; which will no longer be available &mdash; is in the case of mature or older firms which need to buy time to diversify but which, if they close and are broken up, will never come together again.  They can receive aid in those circumstances.  There are examples of companies that have received aid in that category, such as Irish Country Bacon, Manford Clothing, C &amp; D Pet Foods.  All of those are companies which have justifiably received assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  They fit into those categories and should have received such assistance.  I might add that, as Minister for Finance, I was happy to approve assistance for some such companies. There will be a continuing need on the part of such companies to receive assistance.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a third category, that is virtually all firms in the manufacturing sector in bad times, when interest rates are high, when demand is low and it is a question of simply preserving the industrial infrastructure of the country until times improve.  That is when one needs Fóir Teoranta.  The year 1983 was a particularly bad one for the Irish economy. In that year Fóir Teoranta had their largest ever demand for assistance in recent times.  Many companies were <Col N="212" /> saved in 1983 and their employees are in secure employment today but that would not be the case had not Fóir Teoranta saved their companies.  Approximately 24,500 jobs were saved between 1983 and 1986 by Fóir Teoranta.  I believe the majority of those people would be on the dole today were it not for the availability of Fóir Teoranta aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the case that, of course, such companies can turn now to the business expansion scheme and other such agencies for assistance.  That is not the point.  There is money available by way of the business expansion scheme in good times because people have money to spare to invest in various tax concessions of that kind.  But if we again, as we will inevitably &mdash; it does not matter who is in office; this is not a political observation &mdash; find ourselves in bad times, there will not be people with money to spare to invest in the business expansion scheme, there will not be people ready to take over any company that gets into difficulty, people who have money available for acquisitions.  They are available now and do not need Fóir Teoranta now but if we get into a downturn of the economic cycle, the very time that interest rates are at their highest and most companies are in difficulty will be the very same time when there will be fewer people in the private sector available to help them.  Therefore, the whole purpose of Fóir Teoranta is to act in a counter-cyclical capacity, so that they would be available to help when there is a downturn in the economic cycle.</P>
    <P>I would be perfectly happy if the Minister had made a decision to say he was suspending the operations of Fóir Teoranta for the next two years because it was his estimation that Fóir Teoranta were not going to be needed for the next two years, that the staff would be reduced and they would continue to manage their existing protfolio for that time.  But that is not the decision the Minister took. The Minister decided to abolish the body altogether so that it is not available as a <Col N="213" /> life assurance policy whenever we get into bad times again.  This was done simply because he wanted to appear to be a brave man taking a big decision, and not because economic and commercial fundamentals justified any such decision.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we know clearly what the arrangements are going to be for the management of Fóir Teoranta's portfolio because, as I have said, it is necessary for the commercial management of any such portfolio that those who are administering it know they have a mandate that stretches ahead into the reasonable future and can make decisions about the administration of that portfolio on a reasonable basis.  I do not believe that the Minister has yet even made up his mind, as indeed he admitted in this debate, about how he is going to manage the portfolio of the body he has decided to abolish.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is right that a situation should exist in which a statutory body who are essentially in a form of suspended animation with no authority of their own, because they know they are under a death sentence, are supposed to be administering loans and deciding which loan they will foreclose on, which loan they will allow continue on for a little while more, which investment they will sell and which investment they will not sell.  A body who are under sentence of death do not have the independence necessary to make those decisions.  I do not think it is right that the Minister should be in a position where ultimately the responsibility for these decisions rests with him because the body who were established by law to deal with these matters are essentially under a death sentence and have no continuing or long term mandate.  That creates an unnecessary embarrassment for the Minister, or for any Minister for Finance, and it is an embarrassment which he should not draw upon himself by making an ill thought out decision, such as the one he made in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> It would have been far more appropriate for the Minister, if he wanted to suspend Fóir Teoranta's operations, to suspend them but to have said that the board, the body and the chief executive would continue in office until whenever they were needed again in more difficult economic circumstances, that in the meantime they would retain their statutory long term responsibility for managing their portfolio.  Instead the Minister has made the foolish decision of saying that the body will be done away with, he does not know what he is going to replace them with.  In the meantime nobody in particular has responsibility for managing the portfolio but ultimately the book stops with him.  I do not think any Minister should find himself in the position of having to make decisions of that kind in regard to outstanding loans and so on to individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said all of the things I wanted to say, except one.  The Minister made the point that he believed that the new amendments in the Companies Bill, which have not yet even been debated in this House and which will provide for a form of private sector rescue of companies, would suffice in place of Fóir Teoranta.  Nobody knows whether these arrangements are ever going to work.  The legislation may not be on the Statute Book for the next two years &mdash; judging from the lack of urgency on the part of the Government in time-tabling it, I think two years would be an optimistic timescale in that regard &mdash; and nobody knows whether it is going to work.  To say that that arrangement is somehow a substitute for Fóir Teoranta is to say something which is plainly unreasonable because nobody knows yet whether this arrangement will work at all.  It has not even been debated in this <Col N="215" /> House, it is not law and has no prospect of being law for quite some time.  That is also a superficial argument to use and its use indicates that the Minister had no argument for his decision and had to cobble together a statement to justify this top of the head decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be various themes as to what has underlined this decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta but I believe that the principle of it is the correct one.  I do not believe it is necessary any longer to have a State operated company involved in supporting basically lame duck companies, who have failed by every criteria of business to remain in business with support from the legitimate banking sector and all of the other agencies, who are able to turn to Fóir Teoranta, who in many ways had an impossible task, to prop them up.  It is ironic that when moneys were given over to Fóir Teoranta they were given over to the very people who in many instances had brought about the demise of the companies they were being given finance to try to save.  Surely this was a contradiction in terms in many ways.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the establishment of Fóir Teoranta in the early seventies reflected the thinking at that time and was probably the correct step for the Government of the day to take.  If one looks at the graph of activities of Fóir Teoranta it is apparent that at that time, particularly in the mid-seventies, when not alone the Irish economy but the world economy was in serious disarray, Fóir Teoranta were very active.  However, Fóir Teoranta were principally established to modernise many traditional Irish companies who did not have resources and were unable to modernise at the pace at which technology was moving at that time.  Of course, this is no longer the case but there are two very clear failings in the Irish economy today which have never been properly recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> We have a plethora of expertise in the banking system, management companies, institutions and a whole range of organisations but yet the only way which seems open to saving companies is the financial package &mdash; throw the money at the company and that will solve the problem.  This procedure has gone very seriously wrong.  I want to highlight an example of this within the context of the Irish banking system which operates at present.  I firmly believe that the major banks are going to have to reassess how they operate and how they fund commercial activities.  The system in operation at present is basically a secured lending system and is far removed from the equity based system which operates in many countries throughout the world.  I do not understand why major institutions such as some of the major banks do not put some of their expertise into, as Deputy Bruton said, small start-up companies to help them get off the ground. Many of these companies do not fail simply because of financial reasons; they fail because of inexperienced management and management who are unsure of where they are going and what direction they should be taking.  Yet the very people who are providing vast sums of money to these companies stand back and see their investment, from a tunnel vision point of view, go down the tubes. Surely there is something contradictory in this approach.</P>
    <P>The Irish banking system must reassess its position in this area.  I believe it should take some form of equity in many of the companies &mdash; not all of them but in specific areas, and decide where they want to be operational &mdash; appoint some of their experts, not on a permanent or daily basis in management of director positions where they will be aware of what is happening in those companies. Surely this makes common sense.  It is an Irish failing that if Irish managers do not have 110 per cent of the cake they believe it is not worth having.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying in this House <Col N="217" /> tonight that many small companies in Ireland are not facing up to 1992.  They should be out there asking: &ldquo;Am I better off to have a much smaller stake in a much larger and more viable company than trying to maintain the <i>status quo</i>? All right, I own 100 per cent of this company but I may end up with 100 per cent of nothing.&rdquo;  This message is still not getting through to many companies today.  It is not through lack of finance in many instances but rather a lack of management expertise, although this expertise is available throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Why then is the lead not coming in organising small and medium sized companies into thinking in terms of getting involved with other more viable companies, sharing the burden and management expertise, and pooling their resources long before their business has got into difficulties and they are searching around trying to get money when it is apparent that the business venture has already gone down the tubes?</P>
    <P>I would like to take issue with some of the things which the Minister said in his speech this evening and particularly in his opening remarks where he said:</P>
    <P>The aim is to reduce unnecessary Government expenditure thereby reducing Government borrowing and lessening the upward pressures on interest rates and inflation... The best action which the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lowering the input cost of industry,</P>
    <P>The first action this Minister took in his budget was to do a sleight of hand on a 5p increase on petrol.  Surely, the Minister must recognise that this is one of the dearest input costs of many companies. Yet he stands here before us tonight and states the opposite to what he is doing. The Minister cannot have it both ways, and he knows that.  It is easy to put the words down in flowery speeches but his actions are what he will be judged by.  He may have the desire and the inclination to <Col N="218" /> implement what he is saying here tonight, but his actions are the opposite to his desires.</P>
    <P>Another issue which is very much hyped by this Government &mdash; the Minister took a good deal of time to refer to it this evening &mdash; is consumer spending, which seems to be booming and all sorts of wonderful things seem to be happening. In certain areas for example, the motor industry, there is at last an upward trend.  In building and housing I am also delighted to see there is an upward trend. One of the best ways of measuring whether you are actually gaining employment in the economy is through consumer spending on a range of products, particularly those in the domestic market, not money borrowed to fund imports, which are a dead asset for an individual.  If you go to the Revenue Commissioners or ask any tax inspector about VAT returns the first thing they will say is that there is no increase in VAT returns because the ordinary punter does not have the money in his pocket.  Therefore, there is not an increasing demand for the ordinary goods and services which are provided indigenously. That is one of the fundamental reasons we are not at present creating the type of jobs in this economy that are so vital to us.</P>
    <P>It is easy to talk about 7 per cent in retail sales, etc.  When you look behind that 7 per cent, it is in areas of high borrowings rather than in areas that spread out into the domestic economy, for example, clothing where we would have many people employed and in the creation of domestic goods which are repeated on a weekly basis or, even on a fortnightly basis, in the domestic economy which the consumer and the housewife buys.  The consumer spending in all these areas is not increasing.  The result of that and the underlying trend, is that we are not creating the type and the number of jobs that are needed to sustain us.  There are still too few of us working to support the numbers of people who <Col N="219" /> either have no income or who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Why are we in this position?  The Minister knows as well as I do that the consumer and the taxpayer simply do not have the money in their pockets to spend on a continual basis.  When interest rates were low the consumer took the chance to borrow &mdash; much of it at the fixed rate of 8 per cent &mdash; from the finance companies to purchase cars, etc.  The Minister in one sense is giving a false picture by talking &mdash; I am trying to put it in very simple laymans terms &mdash; of consumer spending and the great increase in this area.  This is not happening in an area that will create many jobs, it will create some but it is not broad based enough to create the run of jobs that we need.</P>
    <P>Increased output, as the Minister rightly identified, is the only way to create jobs.  Unless companies see the demand for their goods and services increasing at a much more accelerated rate than at present, we will not get the volume in terms of jobs either from the national plan or the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There is another area with which I would like to take issue with the Minister that is an extraordinary contradiction within this Government.  They continually talk about 1992, and in speeches such as this the Minister is happy to refer to open competition &mdash; which I fully support &mdash; and all the things which will happen.  Yet, when measures are suggested by this party and Fine Gael, as has happened over the past number of months, to try to lay down some ground rules for open and fair competition, this Government turn around and totally oppose any move in this area.  The Minister cannot constantly come into this House and talk about open competition, the single market, 1992, and sit on the Government benches and expect things to happen in Ireland unless he and his Government take action in certain areas. There is widespread operation of cartels <Col N="220" /> in Ireland today.  Why is that?  Because no legislative action has been taken to free that area, to break up these cartels or to force real competition.  We are supposed to help the people who are working day in and day out and yet we like to glorify the ideal without putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was serving in this Dáil long before I ever thought I would be here.  I can look back to 1972 and 1973, shortly after I had left school, and remember the great things we expected to happen in Europe.  What was the result?  The rhetoric was fantastic but the actual application was practically nil. Are we now talking about 1992 without allowing for an orderly planned admission &mdash; in a sense &mdash; into the smooth operation of the Single Market?  The Minister is one of the people in Government for whom I have a lot of time but in his heart and soul, he knows there is an enormous amount of flannel being talked about here.  The hard reality is that the mechanisms necessary to allow the very things we want to happen are not being put in place.  I reject, and I will get up here on every occasion to reject the hype and PR the Minister's party in Government are engaging in.  In all my days I have never witnessed the amount of hype&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It might seem funny for me to ask here tonight &mdash; and this might raise a smile in the Dáil &mdash; what is the reality for the emigrants and what is happening for job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental questions behind the Government's inactivity in putting the <Col N="221" /> real hard core structures into place are, what is happening for the emigrants and job creation.  These questions should challenge the Government rather than hyping up the flannel, of which the Government are so capable.  It has been an education to me to see the mileage the Government can get from some of the things they put to the people.</P>

      <P>One success has been the operation of the business expansion scheme.  This scheme, I hope, is only scratching the surface of the type and volume of investment that can be got together under that scheme.  There is no doubt it is a mechanism that can be used more and more for investment in this country.  Without increased investment under that sort of scheme we will be without the knock-on effect of job creation.  It is easy to talk about peripheral areas, but if we do not create jobs we will continue to lose people out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have a rethink on the type of scheme that the BES represents and to try to come up with more involvement not just of the public sector but of the private sector in areas of venture capital and equity funding.  There is an opportunity in the present climate to move in that direction.  If more people get involved there is an opportunity to develop some kind of national equity fund that could be subscribed to by ordinary people.  I do not like to see the State having to underwrite it but there might be some opportunity for a combination <Col N="222" /> of the private sector and the public sector to create a properly managed fund that will generate a substantial amount of money for new companies or small companies who want to expand.  That is the way forward.  We should not throw money at loss-making operations that will eventually fold.  There must be a more enlightened approach from the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The private sector as well as institutions in the public sector have had too easy a ride and it is about time they faced their responsibility in this regard.  I hope the removal of Fóir Teoranta will change the way they will approach investment in industry and in jobs so as to create wealth.  I want companies to make a profit.  I do not ask companies to be good Samaritans.  Without profit there are no jobs.  The more profit a company can make, the more jobs will be available, but companies must do this in a more responsible and imaginative way.  If that can be achieved we will have gone a long way towards putting this country on the right road.</P>

      <P>This was a very rushed decision without reference to the Dáil or to the social partners who signed the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The decision seems to have been taken rather hastily leaving a lot of loose ends. Perhaps the Minister who gave some indication that there is to be some substitute could elaborate on the position?  The decision to scrap Fóir Teoranta without providing a viable alternative mechanism to rescue companies and jobs in difficulties will have grave implications for employment in many vulnerable industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that Fóir Teoranta was established because of the difficulties facing many companies on our entry to the EC in the seventies.  Grave difficulties arose and many of our industries shut down and many were rescued with the assistance of Fóir Teoranta.  In fact, many people are at work today and paying their <Col N="223" /> taxes who, without the assistance of Fóir Teoranta, would be on the dole.  This position is particularly onerous in view of the intensification of competition which many Irish Companies will face after 1992.  At least that is what all the hype says, that 1992 will be the crunch year, that the floodgates will open and we must be ready for this mad rush when all from the Continent will rush into Ireland and swamp us.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a word of the hype. It will be a gradual process after 1993. However, we are given to understand that 1993 will open the floodgates.  The Government seem to want to give that impression.  Seeing that Fóir Teoranta was established because of the grave difficulties that would arise from our entry into the EC, surely the Minister will now see that there will be even greater difficulties for many industries after 1992. Perhaps the Minister does not believe the Government's propaganda about the effects of 1992.  There have been estimates that as many as 40 per cent of Irish firms will disappear either through mergers, takeovers or collapses.  That might be exaggeration but nevertheless there will be changes in companies and company structures and there will be a number of collapses.</P>
    <P>The Minister when speaking today gave the impression that all company closures were over.  However, closures are occurring every day of the week.  Only today Bradbury's in Athy closed down with the loss of 54 jobs.  I am not saying that these companies would qualify for assistance from Fóir Teoranta, but the closure of factories and industries has not ceased because of what the Minister says is the enormous improvement in the economy that has taken place over the past two years.  There are closures and job losses in the Minister's area as well as throughout the country.  The Government are abdicating their responsibility for restructuring companies which face difficulties, and for saving jobs.  The most <Col N="224" /> important function of Fóir Teoranta was to rescue the workers and not just the company.  The workers do not know what cause the problems.  They are never told and suddenly they find their livelihoods and the future of their families at stake because of something they know nothing about.</P>
    <P>We have always been concerned about the way Fóir Teoranta funds have been used.  In many cases they let the banks off the hook.  Many banks getting fed-up with a customer who was a bit late with repayments would send him to Fóir Teoranta who would pay off the bank and leave them laughing.</P>

      <P>In some cases at least it is true that Fóir Teoranta paid off the banks.  They saved many other companies but it is also true that companies who would have been justified in receiving Fóir Teoranta funds did not receive them.  I know of one case down in west Clare where up to 60 jobs were lost for the sake of a small sum like £25,000 short-term assistance.  Three months assistance from Fóir Teoranta would have rescued them and they would be working today if they had received it.</P>

      <P>I will tell the Minister if he wants to know.  Our main concern is the maintenance of employment and its expansion.  If Fóir Teoranta are to be abolished without alternative structures being established, what will happen?  Deputy John Bruton made the point of asking about the legal standing of Fóir Teoranta loans and equity, etc. <Col N="225" /> and about who takes the company over. What is the future in that area?  The Minister says that company law will provide assistance because apparently the new Companies Bill speaks about providing for the appointment of an examiner to companies in financial difficulties. Apparently Fóir Teoranta were under the impression that they would be the examiner to be appointed for companies that would be in difficulties under the Companies Bill.  They felt that this would be their future.  As I understand it, Fóir Teoranta were not tossing money to everybody &mdash; certainly not in recent years.  They were assisting in certain cases where there were management difficulties.</P>
      <P>In many cases financial difficulties arise from management difficulties and the problems of bad management.  Fóir Teoranta were giving some assistance to a small pool of people who assisted companies in restructuring their management, rather than giving them money. This would be a very important part of the job of some company rescue operations. We never agreed with the idea of tossing grants to people and hoping that jobs would result.  They never result unless they are under a very strict code, with projects established, deadlines met, etc., before grants are continued.  We would not agree with a company like Fóir Teoranta handing out money in the hope that the company would do something with it. Aid in the form of management assistance will help to maintain the workforce in their jobs.  Financial difficulties brought on by bad management have the effect of killing off the livelihood of workers and seriously affecting their families. They might have seen for years how bad the management was but there was nothing they could do.  There is need for some rescue operation.  I have no clear understanding on the appointment of an examiner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain this to us.  The area of the appointment of an examiner, whether it be to Fóir Teoranta, or ICC, or whoever, is very important in the rescue of companies, particularly in view of 1992 and the difficulties that many will have in facing up to competition and changing of management structures within the company.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton said at the beginning of his contribution, this is not really saving any money.  In 1987 Fóir Teoranta drew only £700,000 of Exchequer funds and since then, as far as I know, they have not drawn any.  They are dealing from their own income which has increased.  There was no need for any great rush.  We would like to have seen what alternatives were being put in place by the Minister before he suddenly chopped off Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta were themselves in a restructuring position, thinking out how they would remain viable from their own funds and still continue their rescue operations, in a totally different manner from what they had been doing before, possibly, but still in the business of rescuing companies who got into difficulties, perhaps from bad management, or maybe with good management, but who lacked expertise in developing new projects, new ideas or whatever.  Fóir Teoranta were assisting companies in that way to remain viable and retain their workforce.  I would like to hear from the Minister as to the total package to replace Fóir Teoranta in regard to assistance to companies or does the Minister now believe that everybody should be left wide open to attack and let the best man win &mdash; as Progressive Democrat, Deputy Cullen, says, let who will go to the wall, it is not worth keeping their heads up anyway because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this very important local issue on the Adjournment here tonight.  This debate is taking place in the shadow of a crisis unprecedented in the public service.  I wish to inform the House that every member of the staff of Tralee General Hospital will receive a letter in the post tomorrow evening informing him or her that they may have no wage packet at the end of the week &mdash; in other words that their wages may be deferred.  In business terms this means that the Southern Health Board are virtually in receivership. The Minister for Health is the man responsible for inflicting this humiliation on what is considered one of the finest hospitals in the country.  That position is unprecedented since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not have heard what I have been saying but I am calling for a clear-cut statement on what action he proposes to take on the issue.  Whatever the Minister does tonight, it will unfortunately be of little value to the temporary staff who have been let go today from Tralee General Hospital.  I understand that this is only phase 1 of the temporary staff lay-offs and that it is intended to lay off all the temporary staff over the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread concern in County Kerry over the crisis in Tralee General Hospital and in the public health services <Col N="229" /> throughout the county.  Indeed some of the Minister's colleagues in the county have expressed their total opposition and indignation at what is happening to our health service.  The chairman of the Southern Health Board, Mr. Jackie Healy-Rae, a great stalwart of Fianna Fáil, has laid the blame fairly and squarely on the Minister's shoulders.  He has accused the Minister of the disastrous handling of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board, agents of the Minister &mdash; have clearly failed to provide a proper health service for County Kerry and the Minister by his non-interference has clearly washed his hands of the problem.  The Minister has ignored the noises and protests of the Southern Health Board, Kerry County Council and indeed most of the Oireachtas Members from County Kerry.  However the Minister has ensured that Cork Regional Hospital will not and cannot be touched or affected by any cutbacks.  However, he may not realise that Cork has 50 per cent more acute beds than Kerry per head of population. That is most unfair.</P>
    <P>The budget for Tralee General Hospital has been reduced by £535,000 for 1989.  This is to be achieved by reductions in acute medical and surgical services and by the closure of hospital wards.  In 1987, 60 acute beds were closed in Tralee General Hospital and the present number is barely adequate to meet the neeeds of the population in Kerry which is in the region of 120,000.  I would further like to remind the Minister that there is a large influx of tourists during the summer and this must be borne in mind.  On a number of occasions extra beds had to be brought into use to cope with emergency admissions.  For example, during one weekend in March this year 50 patients were admitted as emergencies and 25 emergency operations were performed.  Previous attempts at reducing bed numbers were unsuccessful and the wards had to be reopened. As further closures are proposed <Col N="230" /> the number of patients attending the hospital is increasing every year.  Last year there were 41,000 attendances at the outpatients and 20,000 visits to the accident and emergency department. The waiting lists for outpatient services and surgery continues to increase.  The hospital functions at present by early discharge of patients.  The average length of stay is 5.27 days, one of the shortest, if not the shortest, in the country.  Indeed early discharge is necessary because of reduced bed numbers and can cause, as the Minister knows well, major problems for the patients and their relatives because in many cases, patients have to travel very great distances, in some case over 90 miles.  The follow up community services after discharge are very much understaffed and underfunded.</P>
    <P>As an initial step to reduce costs by £0.5 million, it was suggested that one medical and one surgical ward would be converted to five day wards, operating from Monday to Friday inclusive.  This would result in an estimated cost reduction of £250,000 per annum.  The alternative would have been the permanent closure of another ward which, as I pointed out earlier, would have been totally unacceptable.  The proposal to reduce 60 beds from seven day to five day beds is also totally unacceptable and is not workable as was the case over the past six weekends when the hospital authorities could only close one ward or 30 beds on three weekends because of the pressure of patient numbers.  The hospital could not close the required number of beds on any weekend.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that this hospital has provision for a bed complement of 425 acute patients but the maximum number of beds open at any time was 289.  Surely there should be some review as to who is responsible for the planning of this hospital which has been only partly opened and is likely to stay that way.  We also learned today that, because of the lay-off of two temporary <Col N="231" /> physiotherapists, the outpatient physiotherapy service will be terminated.  Over 10,000 treatments were administered by this department to outpatients in 1988. This is totally unacceptable.  I do not have to point out to the Minister that physiotherapy is important for patients who have left hospital and need treatment especially for orthopaedic or cardiac complaints.  This will be a major loss to the people of Kerry.  It is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to amalgamate the telephonist and ambulance control service so that one person could operate both. This will lead to major problems.  It would not be sufficient to have one person handling the controls in an emergency when there would be a number of incoming calls.  I think this is a very serious situation. I would like to point out that there is a cost involved in moving the telephonist service to the ambulance control and that is estimated to be in the region of £25,000.  I see no reason that this should be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out &mdash; as I and other Kerry Deputies have pointed out previously &mdash; that the waiting list for the orthopaedic department is totally unacceptable. For example, there are over 200 people waiting for hip replacements and they will have to wait two to three years for this operation.  In addition, 25 patients are waiting for knee replacements and it is estimated that that waiting list could take five years to clear.  There is no provision for ENT services in the hospital.  All ENT operations have to take place in Cork, for which there is a three year waiting period.  I would like to remind the Minister that a local doctor was quoted recently in the newspaper as saying that there was no point in sending people to Cork or referring them to Cork because they would not be treated anyway.  For a simple tonsillitis operation young people have to go to Cork.  It is ridiculous that even a simple operation <Col N="232" /> like the removal of tonsils cannot be carried out in Tralee hospital.  There is obviously no plan in the Southern Health Board for the administration of the health services there, and certainly there seems to be no national plan.  It seems to be just a random series of cuts which have to be enforced by the health board without considering their effects on the unfortunate patients.  There is great fear that the inevitable result of the cutbacks and what is going on in Tralee hospital will lead to deaths.  That is an indictment of the Minister and his Government and all those people in this House who would allow these cutbacks to continue.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask what the Minister proposes to do about the crisis in the Southern Health Board.  Is he prepared to allow them go into receivership?  Is he prepared to provide extra funding for the Southern Health Board?  I want to point out that last night over 600 people converged on the conference centre in the Brandon Hotel in Tralee for a public meeting on health.  They made their feelings known in no uncertain manner. These people are becoming increasingly concerned and my fear is they will not confine their protests to the conference centre in Tralee but that in a few weeks they will be on the streets; and they will be before this House unless something is done now.</P>
    <P>I want clear answers tonight from the Minister, if he can or is prepared to give them, to the many serious problems I have outlined.  There is no point passing the buck to the Southern Health Board. The Minister and his Government have the ultimate responsibility to provide a proper health service.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to do something about the crisis in the Southern Health Board.  If he does not, people will die, if some have not died already because of the cutbacks. People have to leave hospital before they have fully recovered.  People are leaving hospital the day following serious operations. When I was at the hospital last weekend I saw a woman stagger to the <Col N="233" /> lift and then to the front door.  She should not have been allowed out of the hospital. All this is happening because of the cutbacks. Before I hand over to Deputy Begley I would appreciate some firm, straight answers from the Minister tonight on what he proposes to do to rectify what is happening.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will accommodate Deputy Foley by giving him two minutes and I will shorten my contribution.  I thank Deputy Deenihan for giving me some of his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of what is going on in the hospital in Tralee.  As Deputy Deenihan pointed out so ably, we have long queues waiting for operations, and almost instant discharge after operations and, as a result, readmissions of the patients almost immediately.  A few weeks ago, on 7 March, I asked the Minister if he had satisfied himself that enough money was being allocated by the Southern Health Board to Tralee Hospital, County Kerry, in comparison to the moneys allocated to County Cork.  The reply was that it is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board to decide from within their allocation the level of resources to fund services at Tralee hospital.  In other words, the Minister answered the question and that was end of story.  Lo and behold, the chairman of the Southern Health Board, Councillor Jackie Healy-Rae announced to the Kerry County Council meeting that the Minister directed the Southern Health Board to give priority to the Cork Regional Hospital.  Why was the Minister so dishonest with the House?  He said it was a matter for the Southern Health Board to allocate the funds and at the same time a letter was with the Southern Health Board telling them to give priority <Col N="234" /> to the Cork Regional Hospital, in other words to downgrade the Kerry people. The Minister should be ashamed of himself. At least he should have the courtesy to tell the truth in this House &mdash; that he had directed extra money to Cork at the expense of Kerry.  A parliamentary question should be answered in a positive way.  I put it in my question for written reply but the Minister had not the guts to tell me more money was supposed to go to Cork, yet his party colleague, Councillor Jackie Healy-Rae, chairman of the Southern Health Board, declared emphatically at a council meeting that the Minister alone directed him and the officials of the board to spend more money in Cork.  Of course, that suited the vast majority of the officials of the Southern Health Board because they are all from Cork and it suited the Cork people generally.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that children in Kerry should have to wait almost three years for a tonsils operation.  A public meeting was held in Tralee last night and a local GP said, he will now have to prescribe stronger drugs to kill the pain suffered by all those people waiting for hip and other orthopaedic operations. How can the Minister stand over that? Has he any concern for the people of Kerry?  Not to put a tooth in it, this has resulted in a straight fight between Cork and Kerry and the presence of the three Fianna Fáil Deputies here tonight &mdash; Deputy Foley, Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Leary &mdash; is indicative of their concern.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat myself because Deputy Foley has asked to contribute, but I appeal to the Minister when he comes into the House again, at least to tell the truth and not to pass the buck to the Southern Health Board when he alone is responsible for the present fiasco in County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Begley for giving me some of his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven acute hospitals in the <Col N="235" /> Southern Health Board area, six in Cork and one in Kerry, the Tralee hospital. This hospital has been subjected to the most unfair treatment by the board, especially in view of the fact that when it was decided to close the Edenburn Hospital in 1988, 60 long stay patients were accommodated in the Tralee hospital and the Southern Health Board, according to the figures available, had not increased the budget of the Tralee hospital in proportion.  The net expenditure for the Southern Health Board area for 1989 is £132.6 million, of which £8,384,900 is allocated to the Tralee hospital against £8,337,900 from 1988. Here, I believe, lies the problem, because as the other six acute hospitals in Cork have in excess of £46 million based on 1988 figures.</P>
    <P>No serious effort has been made by the Southern Health Board management to draw up a national plan to resolve the serious financial position of the board which started in 1985 and continued into 1986 with massive overruns.  The easy option is always taken and in this case it is the Tralee hospital which is being treated unfairly.  Is it because we have a minority membership on the board?</P>
    <P>The latest news today is that ten staff from the Tralee hospital are to go from Monday next including two from the physiotherapy unit and that means the collapse of this excellent service.  The Tralee hospital has a very excellent staff, and they have been hard pressed to work under the strains of the past 12 months. Morale has reached an all time low and they have cried halt.  I am satisfied that our position in Kerry will not improve under the ambit of the Southern Health Board and I appeal to the Minister to consider Kerry as an independent unit to control its own health services, even if it means amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Because the Southern Health Board do not have a national plan, we have a crisis in the three hospitals and in the health services throughout Kerry.  I <Col N="236" /> would ask the Minister to have his officials examine the overall apportionment of the budget of £132.6 million allocated to the Southern Health Board with regard to Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that my responsibility as Minister for Health as far as financing is concerned is to allocate the amount voted for the health services by this House to the eight health boards as fairly and equitable as possible.  Having received its allocation each health board must decide on the distribution of its funding in accordance with its statutory obligations.  It is a matter for each health board to establish its priorities and to allocate resources in line with these priorities.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's allocation for 1989 is £132.65 million.  This represents an increase of £1.25 million on the figure for 1988.  The board's management determined that this allocation was about £3 million less than what would be required based on 1988 expenditure levels.  This is not to say that commensurate service cuts would be required.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer, in formulating his budgetary strategy, took the view that the scope for considerable savings in the special hospitals and community care programmes was limited.  As regards the latter, health policy over the last few years has been to protect community services in as far as possible. Nevertheless, the CEO proposed a modest reduction of £110,000 to minimise the effect on services in this key area.</P>
      <P>The board's psychiatric services have undergone major rationalisation over the past year and this process is continuing. As one would expect, this reduces the scope for further savings in the current year, but a target of £700,000 was set by the CEO, mainly to be found from improved efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the rationalisation of acute hospital <Col N="237" /> services in recent years, the key role the regional hospitals must play has been recognised.  The allocation takes account of the fact that the major high technology specialty should be protected in Cork Regional Hospital.  If the board were unhappy about that, they could have made the decision to come back and ask if they wanted to diminish the high technology services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless the regional hospital in Cork, like other hospitals, has to contribute its appropriate share towards the savings to be generated through efficiencies.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board decided to reject the CEO's proposals in respect of the general hospital programme and it is this rejection which has led to the current situation.  It is always preferable to adopt a planned approach to meeting budgetary targets, even though it involves making difficult and often unpopular decisions. The alternative, the unplanned approach, has a far more damaging effect on services.  A chief executive officer must, however, observe his budgetary obligations under the Health Act and must take whatever options are available to him.  In forcing management to adopt this alternative approach the board are not, in my view, acting in the best interests of the people who live in its functional area.</P>
      <P>That is part of the cause of the problem. There may be a few more causes. Deputy Spring, who is a member of the board, was Tánaiste in the last Coalition Government.  Fine Gael and Labour allowed overruns of £55 million by the health boards in the last two years and now we have to deal with that.  That is one of the reasons the Southern Health Board have difficulty.  Where were the Fine Gael members of the board then and where was Deputy Spring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan talks about ignoring the Southern Health Board.  The previous Minister for Health refused to meet the chairmen and CEOs of the health boards for four years.  Three times I have met the chairman and CEO of the Southern Health Board since this year's budget.  I accept that the former Minister for Health gave them money, but it was money which was not allocated by the Minister for Finance.  That is one of the reasons there is a problem in Tralee at present.</P>
      <P>I have met the chairman, CEO and other representatives of the Southern Health Board on a number of occasions this year to discuss the board's financial situation.  On each occasion I have emphasised the commitment of this Government to restore the national finances to a sound footing and the need for all public agencies to play their part in this essential task.  I have stressed the necessity for the board to live within its allocation and to ensure that it provides services in the most cost-effective manner possible.  I regret that the members of the Southern Health Board have not been prepared to shoulder their responsibilities in the way that members of other boards have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board allocated £8,384,900 to Tralee General Hospital to fund services in 1989.  This is £47,000 more than the allocation in 1988.  I accept that the general hospital's commitments have increased this year with the transfer of long stay patients from Edenburn.  I cannot understand, however, how a hospital with a budget of £8.4 million cannot provide a high level of acute hospital services for its catchment population. A comparison of cost per patient treated and cost per bed day with other comparable health board hospitals shows <Col N="239" /> that Tralee is more expensive.  Two comparable voluntary hospitals, the Mercy Hospital in Cork and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, can provide services much more cost effectively then Tralee.  Tralee has a generous staff complement by any standards but one must query if these staff are being used effectively.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in Castlebar where they had 12,000 admissions in 1988, the same number as Tralee.  What is the difference in the staffing ratio? There are 66.5 clerical/administrative staff in Tralee and 44 in Castlebar.  The maintenance staff at the new hospital in Tralee is 19 but only two at Castlebar. There are 50 typists in Tralee and 30 in Castlebar.  There are ten physiotherapists in Tralee and five in Castlebar.  What is the allocation to the two hospitals with the same number of admissions last year? It is £8.3 million to Tralee in 1988 and £6.6 million to Castlebar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no outpatient services in Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at the non-pay element, 77 per cent of the allocation in Tralee goes on pay, 85 per cent in Castlebar.  This means 15 per cent is going on non-pay in Castlebar and 23 per cent in Tralee.  In my view Tralee has sufficient money to provide a proper level of service for the people of the Kerry area.</P>
      <P>The non-pay costs of the hospital constitute a relatively high proportion of total costs.  I am not satisfied that the substantial allocation to the hospital is yielding value equivalent to that of comparable hospitals.  It is the responsibility of the staff of the hospital and health board management to ensure that every pound of taxpayers' money is being as well spent in Tralee as in any other hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of specific issues raised by Deputy Deenihan.  He claims it is intended to <Col N="240" /> close a further 30 long stay beds in the hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not long stay, sevenday wards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from the health board is that the Deputy's information is incorrect and that a long stay ward has not been closed nor is there any proposal to close 30 long stay beds. The claim that the out-patients' department is to close is also untrue.  I understand that the board's management propose to cease the provision of outpatient physiotherapy services at the hospital.  In-patient physiotherapy services will not be affected.</P>
      <P>The successful management of the health services requires the co-operation of health board members and health board managers.  I appreciate that boards are faced with difficult choices in living within their allocation but decisions must be faced if the national goal of economic recovery and growth is to be achieved.  I would remind Deputies that 20 per cent of Exchequer funding is going to the health services and the Southern Health Board receive the second highest allocation in the country at £132 million.  The next board have only £100 million.  There are 40 acute hospitals funded and only ten of them receive more than the hospital in Tralee.  Six of those are the major voluntary hospitals, mainly in Dublin. Most boards have faced up to their responsibilities and have supported management in the task of controlling expenditure and living within the allocation.  I regret that the members of the Southern Health Board have chosen to go another way.  I would ask the Deputies to talk to their own Fine Gael and Labour members of the board and ask them to face up to their responsibility.  The action in which they are indulging will not benefit the health services or the country.</P>

      <P>I recently conveyed approval to the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann for the proposed upgrading of the commuter service on the Dublin/Maynooth line, including the opening of new stations at Confey, Coolmine, Blanchardstown and Broomebridge at a cost of about £0.7 million.  The <Col N="45" /> board indicated that they were unable to provide for these works out of their capital allocation for 1989.  I have requested them to consider proceeding this year with the proposal in the light of its inclusion in the national plan for aid from EC Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I would like in the first instance to extend my sympathy to the family who were bereaved in this accident.</P>
      <P>I have seen a press report on the inquest in which there was a mention of the possibility of poor illumination on DART trains, though I should point out that the matter was not referred to in the coroner's report.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Iarnród Éireann that the illumination on the front of DART trains, that is marker lights, headlamps and destination indicators, adequately meets the requirements for which it is provided and is of similar standard to that used on other railway systems.</P>
      <P>Following an initiative by my Department procedures have now been introduced which can be used by gardaí to alert train drivers when the need arises for gardaí to enter on to the railway. This should further improve safety on the DART system.</P>

      <P>The formulation of proposals for the development of rail freight infrastructure is a matter for CIE and the operating subsidiary, Iarnród Éireann.  I am informed by CIE that the infrastructure has been modernised in recent years and has resulted in rail freight services becoming more efficient and more competitive.  The board considers that overall these developments have resulted in rail freight traffic being well capable of competing with road freight services.</P>
      <P>The board has identified a number of developments necessary for improving freight handling arrangements in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness in transporting international rail freight traffic.  These include a direct rail link to ship-side facilities in Dublin port and the upgrading of signalling and renovations to the rail infrastructure to facilitate the handling of bigger containers. Proposals for such developments are being considered for aid from EC Structural Funds in the context of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing measures to meet the transport priorities of Dublin within the framework of the sub-regional plans set out in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i>  The sub-regional plan for Dublin city and county contains two main transport strands.  First, to improve road, bus and rail links within the sub-region and between it and other sub-regions. This objective will be achieved by:</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvement of the national roads in the Dublin area and of the non-national roads which contribute to economic development;</P>
      <P>&mdash;provision of a peripheral ring road to link main national routes and facilitate long distance traffic;</P>
      <P>&mdash;provision of a port access route, which will keep heavy traffic from the centre city;</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvements in the existing network of public transport services, including the provision of diesel rail commuter services.</P>
      <P>The second strand of transport policy for Dublin is to improve the port, shipping and airport infrastructure so as to enhance the Dublin area as one of Ireland's main gateways to the rest of Europe.  This objective will be achieved by continued development of Dublin port and airport, including their development as bases for intensive air and sea freight shuttle services to Britain and Continental Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the priorities for the transport areas for which I have responsibility, my priority for air transport is to see the continued expansion of both passenger and freight services by air on a regular, <Col N="48" /> reliable and competitive basis at lowest possible economic cost so as to meet the Government's targets for the development of tourism and export growth.  As far as Dublin Airport is concerned, further investment is planned to cater for the huge increases in passenger traffic which are being experienced at present and which are expected to continue over the next five years and beyond.  This development will include a major extension to the passenger terminal and new car parking facilities.</P>
    <P>As regards sea transport, a major priority is the development of intensive sea freight services from Dublin Port to UK west coast ports to meet demand arising both from national objectives for export growth and completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>With regard to rail and road transport, my priority is to provide adequate, safe and cost effective services to meet the transport demands of the area.  Major developments in the medium term will be related to the transport investment plans prepared by CIE which envisage improvements in the commuter diesel rail services and proposals for local suburban bus services, and services connecting suburbs on the periphery of the city.  The improvement of rail freight infrastructure links to Dublin Port is also envisaged. Implementation of these plans is linked to the availability of assistance from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Achievement of these objectives will require substantial expenditure on transport infrastructure by the Government and by the EC over the period of the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i> The following table summarises expenditure in the Dublin city and county sub-region:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures indicate that there has been an increase in the level of recorded indictable crime in the Garda sub-district of Duleek and that in the period 1 January 1988 to 31 March 1989, 86 indictable offences were recorded there.  To date 58 of those offences have been detected and 44 persons have been or are currently before the courts in connection with 34 of them.  Papers relating to the remainder of the detected offences have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. This relatively high detection rate is expected to have the effect of curbing the incidence of crime in the Duleek area.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there has been no undue delay in bringing persons before the courts in any of the cases referred to.</P>

      <P>In so far as the question may refer to registered property, the registers in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds are open to the public on payment of the prescribed fee.  Much property in urban areas is, of course, unregistered.  In that regard section 24 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 provides that the Minister for Justice may by order determine that compulsory registration shall apply to any county or county borough.  Since the enactment of the 1964 Act compulsory registration has been introduced in three counties only, namely, Carlow, Laois and Meath.  It would be my intention to extend compulsory registration to other areas as soon as the availability of resources permits.</P>

The stallions are inspected on the criteria of movement, conformation and a clinical veterinary examination.

There is no provision for an appeal where a stallion is rejected from the point of view of movement or conformation.</P>
      <P>A fee based system to allow individual inspections of stallions prior to purchase could be introduced provided the prospective purchaser is fully aware of the substantial cost involved.

      <P>The pig slaughtering plants selected for State and FEOGA assistance under the Government's development strategy for the pigmeat industry are obliged to attain a minimum level of throughput of 6,000 pigs per week within a reasonable timescale.  The achievement of this target is a matter for the individual company concerned in each case and the provision of incentive packages at farm level is one of the ways in which they can encourage the increased supply of pigs required to meet the conditions of their grant aid approval.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not qualified for payment as only class K1 contributions, which are not reckonable for disability benefit purposes, are recorded in respect of him for the tax year 1986-87 which governs disability benefit claims made in the 1988 calendar year.  He is not entitled to disability benefit either during the 1989 calendar year as his insurance record for the 1987-88 tax year consists of Class K1 contributions and 13 credited contributions.</P>
      <P>Credited contributions have been awarded up to 22 March 1989, the date of the latest medical certificate received. These credited contributions, while not entitling him to payment currently, preserve the continuity of his insurance record for the duration of his illness.</P>
      <P>Should the person concerned remain incapable of work, and continue to submit weekly medical certificates of incapacity, he would be qualified for payment of disability benefit from 1 January 1990, as he would have 52 credited contributions for the 1988-89 tax year which would then govern his claim.</P>

    <P>Contribution Class A applies if the company director is employed under a contract of service.  A contract of service exists where there is an employer/employee relationship, the employer having the right of control, direction and dismissal over the employee.  A company director who is appointed to a post in the company under the company's Articles of Association and is paid for that work separately from his directorship may be employed under a contract of service.  Contribution Class A provides cover for the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions.</P>
    <P>Contribution Class J applies if the company director is employed under a contract of service but for less than 18 hours per week and does not mainly depend on the earnings from the work.  It also applies to a company director who is employed under a contract of service who is aged 66 years or over.  This class provides cover for occupational injuries benefit only.</P>
    <P>Contribution Class K applies if the company director is not employed under a contract of service and is either aged 66 years or over, or has total income of less than £2,500 per annum.  The percentage rate of contribution of 2.25 per cent applicable to this class represents the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy. <Col N="67" /> There is no social insurance cover under this class.</P>
    <P>Contribution Class S applies if the company director is not employed under a contract of service and has income from all sources of £2,500 or more per annum. In those circumstances the company director is regarded as a self-employed person and the Class S contribution rate of 6.25 per cent is payable.  This class of contribution provides cover for old age and widow's contributory pensions and orphan's contributory allowance.</P>
    <P>All the percentage rates applicable to the above contribution classes include health contribution (1.25 per cent) and the employment and training levy (1 per cent) and are deducted at source and paid through the PAYE/PRSI system.</P>
    <P>In addition, a company director involved in a self-employment activity, that is a trade or profession, who pays income tax direct to the collector general in respect of the self-employment activity, for example, Schedule D, is also liable for a PRSI contribution on that income.  The total income from all sources must be £2,500 or more.  The percentage rate of contribution for this category in the current year is 4 per cent, which represents social insurance only. This contribution provides cover for old age and widow's contributory pensions and orphan's contributory allowance. They would also be liable for the health contribution and the employment training levies.</P>
    <P>All self-employed contributors are liable to pay a minimum social insurance element of £208 in respect of income from all souces for the 1989-90 year.</P>
    <P>A revised information leaflet on the insurability of company directors will shortly be published by the Department and I will arrange to have a copy forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Since the extension of the treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons took effect on 19 October 1987, a total of 39,892 claims for dental benefit have been received on behalf of dependent spouses.  Up to 10 April 1989 a total of £1,830,711 was paid, in respect of such claims.</P>
      <P>Information relating to dental treatment is recorded on the basis of claims received from dentists.  The fact, however, that a course of treatment may extend over a period of time and that in some cases claims are not made to the Department until the treatment is completed or even later, means that the information available at any time is not complete.  Accordingly, the actual cost incurred in relation to the period up to 10 April would be greater than the £1.83 million which was paid out.</P>

      <P>The person concerned qualified for payment of maternity allowance under the scheme for women in current employment for the 14 week period from 3 April 1989 when her maternity leave commenced to 8 July 1989.</P>
      <P>The rate of the allowance was calculated in relation to her earnings in the 1987-88 year and as this was less than the minimum payable, her entitlement is at the minimum rate of £76 a week.  Regulations provide that the first Monday in April is the start of the benefit year for maternity allowance.  Accordingly, from 3 April 1989, that is the first Monday in April, to 31 March 1990 the relevant income tax year for calculating weekly entitlement is the 1987-88 year.</P>

      <P>Refusal of an offer of employment, including an offer of employment on the social employment scheme, without good cause would call into question whether a claimant fulfilled this condition and could result in disallowance of his or her unemployment assistance claim.</P>
      <P>If, however, the person could show that there was good reason for refusal, the claim would be allowed and, in general, a person on unemployment assistance would not be expected to participate in the scheme where the weekly rate of payment is lower than his current entitlements. It is for a deciding officer to determine, having regard to all of the circumstances, whether a disallowance would be appropriate or not.  Each case is considered on its own particular merits.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works have carried out a detailed investigation of the feasibility of restoring the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal-Woodford River navigation constructed in the middle of the last century to link the Erne and the Shannon.  The report on the investigation, completed in 1986, showed that restoration of the link could be achieved by clearing and enlarging the navigation channel, repairing locks and embankments, constructing new locks and weirs and strengthening or rebuilding bridges. As I stated in reply to a question by Deputy Cooney on 6 May 1987, (Question No. 50), the magnitude of the cost of the project, estimated at the time at £16.5 million, precluded any possibility of undertaking it under the economic circumstances then prevailing.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the project has now been updated to £18 million.  Legislation required to enable the restoration to be carried out is being prepared and, if the necessary funding is made available, the Office of Public Works will arrange to have work commenced as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In September 1988, the Board of the International Fund for Ireland stated that it would consider detailed appraisals and feasibility studies of projects such as the re-opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  A feasibility study has been carried out by independent consultants and the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> furnished by the Government to the European Community provides for the inclusion of the project, depending on the outcome of that study.</P>

Against the background of the priorities and financial considerations which I have outlined, FÁS will provide up to £1 million from its Exchequer allocation for the training of the short-term unemployed over 25 years of age in 1989.</P>

The medical practitioner is required to be available for consultations by eligible persons on his list at his surgery or for domiciliary visiting by agreement with the relevant health board.  Furthermore, the <Col N="85" /> medical practitioner is required to make arrangements for contact to be made with him or his deputy when he is not available.</P>
      <P>Under the new terms and conditions in the GMS, domiciliary consultations carried out between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. other than in the course of routine surgery arrangements attract an additional fee which varies in line with a distance factor.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the person mentioned by the Deputy is the holder of a current medical card and, therefore, is entitled to general practitioner services on the terms outlined above.  If she has difficulty in this respect she might contact the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to arrangements agreed in 1972, on the introduction of the GMS scheme, with regard to guarantees given to former district medical officers in respect of remuneration and other entitlements. The new terms and conditions for doctors participating in the GMS make provision for the continued operation of the guarantees given to former district medical officers on the commencement of the scheme in 1972.  As regards the method of payment under the new terms and conditions, former district medical officers who opted for remuneration by way of a fee-per-item of service method under the previous agreement and who signed the new contract are remunerated by way of capitation payment, in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A to the new contract.</P>

In addition, the general question of my Department's continued support of projects to assist young homeless people will have to be considered in the context of the Child Care Bill, 1988, at present before the Dáil, which envisages the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children up to 18 years of age who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>

      <P>Revenue from the sale of forest products during the period 1989-1993 will be utilised by Coillte Teoranta to offset its operating expenses and will, therefore, not accrue directly to the State.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy, in view of the pollution from the coal burning station at Moneypoint, County Clare, if he has considered the possibility of hydro-electric schemes.</P>

      <P>Moneypoint is fitted with the latest &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; smoke particulate removal technology.  Pollutant emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX), are subject to control under the EC Directive on the reduction of emissions from large combustion plants.  The ESB are complying fully with this Directive.</P>
      <P>The ESB are already making full use of the large scale hydro potential available to them.  A survey carried out in 1985 by An Foras Forbartha on behalf of my Department into the potential of small hydro in this country indicated that there was a total generating capacity of 38 Megawatts (MW) worth developing. Clearly, therefore, there is no prospect of hydro displacing such a large station as Moneypoint which has a capacity of 900 MW.</P>
      <P>However, both my Department and the ESB are supportive of the further development of viable hydro resources. This is clearly evidenced through the involvement of the ESB in the construction of a number of small hydro schemes over the next few years under the EC Valoren Programme.</P>

      <P>My Department has no authority over the felling of trees adjacent to the River Liffey at Chapelizod, Dublin 20 as these trees are in an urban district and are, <Col N="97" /> therefore, excluded from the requirements of the Forestry Act, 1946.  Any complaints about tree felling in this area should be directed to Dublin Corporation.</P>
