      <P>Last week the Taoiseach undertook to have a debate on Anglo-Irish relations but I understand from our Whip that the reason it was not held this week was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs could not be present.  However, I see him in the Chamber now in glorious technicolor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I ask the Chair to give some information to the House.  It appears from the discussion that took place yesterday in this House in relation to the staff dispute that you, Sir, have to take some action.  We now have the unfortunate situation that staff of this House are outside in appalling conditions. I ask you to inform Members of <Col N="1926" /> this House what action you propose to take to bring this dispute to a resolution.</P>

      <P>I gave notice under Standing Order 30 seeking leave to raise this matter of public interest which requires urgent consideration, to use the words of the Standing Order.  I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing the matter, that being &ldquo;that the House deplores the continuing dispute involving staff members of the House and calling on all relevant parties to the dispute immediately to agree to submit the dispute to independent arbitration&rdquo;.  The matter is obviously urgent.  It is interfering with the normal functioning of the House.  It is a matter of intense public interest and I ask the Chair to accede to my request for a debate on the issue under the terms of Standing Order 30.  I submit the present circumstances clearly come within the terms of that Standing Order.</P>

      <P>I have considered the Deputy's request but I regret it is one I cannot accede to.  As Deputies are aware, I allowed two Private Notice Questions on this issue yesterday addressed to the Minister for Finance. The matter was also discussed yesterday at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House.  I wish to advise the House that I propose to make a statement on the question to the House at approximately 12 noon today.</P>

    <P>SECTION 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  direct the local authority to take such steps as may be necessary <Col N="1932" /> so as to ensure that a development objective or objectives for the purpose of reserving land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not result in any land subject to any such development objective becoming or continuing to be a derelict site,&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>My reason for proposing this amendment derives from the intent of the legislation, which is designed to bring to an end the problem of dereliction, particularly in our cities.  It confers on the local authorities a series of powers which are welcomed by all sides of this House with regard to properties in private ownership which are in a state of dereliction.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, particularly in Dublin &mdash; this has been a problem in other parts of the country such as Cork &mdash; is that the Dublin Corporation development plan has made a major contribution to dereliction within our city.  It was not uncommon for the plan to contain long-term road widening objectives that the corporation think &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;think&rdquo;&mdash; might, possibly, perchance implement in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years' time.  From inquiring into the matter, it is quite clear that if the corporation's road engineers think they want a small bit of land on a street in the city, it is not unusual for them to simply mark the entire portion of the street down for long-term road widening.  The impact this has is to cause serious urban dereliction. It means if property falls into disrepair, the owners see no purpose in investing in their property because they do not know, even if they do make such an investment, whether, within a couple of months, a compulsory purchase notice might be served.  It might not be served for ten or 15 years.  Nobody knows, but there is little point in conferring power on local authorities to take proceedings regarding dereliction against the private owners of property if on occasion the local authority is the cause of urban blight itself.  This amendment is designed to deal with that <Col N="1933" /> problem, it is designed to ensure that where a local authority prescribes objectives in a development plan those objectives are realisable within a reasonable period and that where an objective is inserted in a development plan &mdash; for example, long-term road widening &mdash; that that is not repeated willy-nilly in each further development plan regardless of the possibilities of its implementation or, indeed, regardless of whether there has been a change of policy within the local authority.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider this amendment as we now seem to be reverting to the position we were in when Governments have majorities, that Ministers now take the view that they simply rule out any amendment proposed by Opposition parties for the sake of it.  If the Minister agrees with the difficulty I describe as requiring a resolution but disagrees in any particular way with the substance of the amendment for any technical reason, I would invite the Minister to consider tabling his own amendment to deal with this problem on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would be interested in not merely hearing the Minister's view of the technical drafting of the amendment but his view as to how we overcome the problem I describe in the contents of the Bill we have before us, which I do not think addresses that problem.  If the Minister has an alternative solution to the means with which we can address it that could result in a different type of amendment being incorporated, we would obviously be pleased to hear of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that it is not the practice to rule out amendments from the Opposition except when I am convinced or advised that they have no substance or that they would not add anything of significance to the text. As I have said previously in relation to this amendment, I understand Deputy Shatter's attitude and I share his concern that the objectives of a development plan should not give rise to dereliction.  That is the fundamental issue as far as I am concerned.  It would frustrate the purpose <Col N="1934" /> of planning legislation if that were so, since all development plans are required by law to embody development objectives for the development and renewal of obsolete areas.</P>
      <P>This amendment is proposing that the Minister should have power, under legislation separate from the Planning Acts, to direct a local authority not to operate the Planning Acts in a contradictory manner.  Surely the Planning Acts should have sufficient coherence in themselves to prevent this from happening.  If they do not have that coherence, should we not be amending the Planning Acts &mdash; amend them directly to remedy what might be perceived as a deficiency?  The effect of the amendment put forward by the Deputy could be to confuse the status or the validity of development objectives in development plans all around the country with possible consequences for the validity of planning refusals based on these objectives and for planning compensation.  If a Minister were to issue a direction envisaged in this amendment it would mean that every relevant development objective could come under scrutiny as to its validity. The courts would have to be called on to judge whether one particular development objective could conceivably result in land becoming derelict. Contrary to the long tradition of the courts, dealing only with points of law in planning matters, this would involve the courts in making a practical planning assessment as to the likely impact of any particular planning policies.  I do not think the Deputy would wish that to be the case.  Because that is the likely consequence of what he is suggesting &mdash; it would not be beneficial to the thrust of what we are trying to achieve &mdash; I would ask the Deputy to reconsider and perhaps to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment has a lot of merit, if only to put down a market to local authorities not to embark upon grandiose road plans which can never be fulfilled within a reasonable period.  Deputy Shatter has referred in a broad sense to dereliction caused in <Col N="1935" /> Dublin by such plans.  I do not think it is contradictory to have such a provision in this legislation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the existing planning and development legislation. The Minister is not obliged to exercise it.  It is an enabling power.  It gives him another category under section 13 whereby he can direct a local authority to reverse the process of dereliction which their grandiose and over-expansive road schemes have brought about.  We are all aware of examples of these and indeed, they are on the record of this debate already.  I would invite the Minister to consider, either now or on Report Stage, retaining some such specific provision.  I am not aware that in the confirmation of development plans for individual local authorities, which have to be approved ultimately by the Minister for the Environment, they have been significantly altered in respect of major road plans. Dereliction has definitely been caused by such road plans.  If this additional provision was in the Act, the Minister may not wish to use it at this point in time but his successors may well welcome the opportunity and, indeed, his foresight in providing it.</P>

      <P>I would like to agree with what Deputy Quinn and Deputy Shatter have said on this amendment.  We all know of sites which have been left derelict where reservations have been made for roads.  It seems to me that this is the appropriate Bill to deal with that problem. I do not understand the Minister's comment that it should be dealt with by way of amendment to the Planning Acts. This is a Bill dealing with dereliction. Road reservations give rise to dereliction and it is appropriate that it should be dealt with in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's response that he is open to amendments. Perhaps my unfriendly attitude to the Minister, and his likely reception to amendments, was dominated by the stonewalling approach we had from the Minister for Health last night &mdash; I am not going to re-run that debate &mdash; but that <Col N="1936" /> was a classical example of how this House should not do its business.  I would hope that the Minister will not be following in the path of his colleague on this legislation or, indeed, on any other legislation that comes before the House.</P>
      <P>We are all in agreement on both sides of the House that we do not want to see local authorities, as Deputy Quinn so rightly puts it, producing grandiose road development plans that have no prospect of being implemented and inserting them into inter-development plans and keeping them in being for years to the detriment of the urban area that it is alleged they will impact upon.  I do not think it is correct to say &mdash; and I am sure the Minister from his own experience would acknowledge this &mdash; that our current Planning Acts do resolve this problem. Unfortunately, our current Planning Acts have been a partial catalyst to the problem by virtue of the fact that in reality development plan reviews, although in theory they should take place every five years, tend to be in force for a minimum of ten years because of what is involved, particularly in regard to urban areas such as Dublin city or county.</P>
      <P>Clearly, we have a problem in the city of Dublin.  The Minister has seen that problem.  There are parts of the city of Dublin where dereliction is due solely to development plan objectives for road widening purposes that will never ever be implemented.  There is no guarantee that when the new development plan is prepared for Dublin city all the problems in that area will be removed.  If the Minister accepts that we have had a problem &mdash; and everything we have seen in the last 25 years has made it clear that that problem is not in any way resolved by the Planning Acts which are currently in existence &mdash; this amendment is designed to give the Minister a means of requiring a local authority to deal with that problem and a means of directing a local authority to take steps to change its approach where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that when this amendment was first tabled last spring I made the point that it conferred a discretionary <Col N="1937" /> power on the Minister.  It does not require the Minister to interfere in the workings of a local authority in the generality of their work.  It is a discretionary power, just as are all the other powers under section 13.  The Minister can direct a local authority to serve notices or to take steps in circumstances where the Minister believes that such a directive is necessary to fulfil the objectives of the Act.  It is quite possible that the Minister may not invoke this power under section 13 but it would give him and his successors a useful legislative, statutory base for resolving problems of dereliction which derive directly from the actions of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In that sense I invite the Minister to accept this amendment.  If he believes that a more appropriate approach would be to incorporate a provision in the Planning Act, I would invite him to accept this amendment now and if he is agreeable to bringing forward a more comprehensive amendment or a different provision having the same impact in the planning compensation legislation all of us would be quite happy and would agree that such a provision could repeal this amendment. In the context of the planning compensation legislation, we appreciate that the Minister may have been subject to some considerable criticism on the publication of that Bill because of its inadequacies, but he was willing, unlike some of his colleagues, to take on board many of the criticisms made and many of the constructive proposals put forward on Second Stage.  The Bill will be substantially amended on Committee Stage and no doubt will be a far better Bill than the original.  This House was allowed to perform a legislative function in regard to that Bill and I would ask the Minister to adopt the same constructive approach to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to delay this Bill and I should like Committee Stage to be completed today.  The passage of the Bill was interrupted by the general election and other problems.  This is an important amendment and if we do not confront the problems of dereliction caused by the direct actions of local authorities we will leave a major gap in our law.  This is the <Col N="1938" /> first time for many years that we have tried to solve problems in this area and I doubt if there will be another such Bill before the year 2000.  If we do not get this Bill right we will leave problems which we would all wish to see resolved.</P>

      <P>An interesting remark was made about grandiose road plans and the possibility of those plans creating dereliction. I would always have regarded reservations for road development as a normal procedure necessary for proper planning and future infrastructural development.  Reservations are part of the development plan process and always a matter for prolonged debate by the local authorities.  Reservation has always been the subject of public notice and individuals and bodies have been entitled to have their opinions heard.  Reservations for roadworks have always been dealt with in a very democratic way.</P>
      <P>I should like to think that even reserved land for such purposes which had been cleared through the planning processes with full public debate would be kept in a tidy condition.  It is incumbent on the road authority seeking to have a reservation put in place.  All this should be set within the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has wide powers under section 7 of the Planning Act, 1982, whereby he can issue special policy directives on planning.  That would seem an extensive power which could deal with many of the matters raised by Deputy Shatter.  One must consider the powers of the Minister under this legislation in addition to section 7 of the Planning Act, 1982.  Under section 30 (3) the Minister may, if he so wishes, direct local authorities to take such steps specified by him to prevent land continuing to be or becoming a derelict site.  That is quite an extensive power.  The explanatory memorandum states that specific steps can be taken to prevent any land owned or occupied from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  Adding to existing legislation the provisions of section 13 of this Bill, we have a good framework for dealing with reserved land and we can prevent it from becoming derelict.  The <Col N="1939" /> fears expressed by Deputies are not well founded in this regard.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 9 to 13, to delete subsection (3). </P>
      <P>Section 14 enables the Minister to require any statutory body, in consultation with the appropriate Minister to whom such body is responsible and where he is satisfied that land in the possession of such body is not necessary to the performance of its functions, to dispose of any interest that the body has in any derelict site included in the Derelict Sites Register. Under the provisions of subsection (2) the Minister must give notice of a proposed direction to a statutory body so that any objections of the latter can be considered.</P>
      <P>The intent of the section is fully accepted.  Indeed, there is little purpose in having legislation which allows local authorities to deal with the problems of the private property owner whose land is derelict but which leaves a position obtaining in which Government Departments and other bodies can hold land that falls derelict and hold it indefinitely.  In a sense, this is another side of the problem with which I endeavoured to deal in the previous amendment, which was dereliction caused by local authorities, whereas here we have dereliction caused by State bodies.</P>
      <P>I was concerned that subsection (3), as drafted, was far too wide.  Subsection (3), in so far as its provisions would give a State body an &ldquo;out&rdquo; from allowing the Minister to exercise these powers would in fact defeat the intent of the section.  Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not give a direction under this section unless he is satisfied after consultation with the appropriate Minister that the land to which the direction, if given, will relate is not being used by, or is not, or is unlikely to be, required by, the statutory body for the performance of its functions. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the subsection read: &ldquo;... if given, will relate is not being used by or is not required by the statutory body for the performance of its functions&rdquo; I would have no major objection to it.  But the words used in this subsection &mdash; which, in a sense, allow another Government Department to tell the Department of the Environment: &ldquo;We are not using the land at present.  It is not required by us at present but it is likely that in five or ten years' time we might have use for <Col N="1943" /> some particular site or some particular building&rdquo;&mdash; I believe render this subsection inoperable.  In the real world we all know that Government Departments &mdash; and I do not mean any disrespect to any of those working in any Department &mdash; in this context like to hold on to what they have.  The permanent staff of Government Departments do not easily give up buildings the Department have had in their possession.  There is always the view that the Department might expand further, that they might get additional areas within their remit.  They have the view: &ldquo;Perhaps we may not need this building now but it is likely, for example, if there were a change of Government, we would need the building&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In proposing that this subsection be deleted I reiterate that, as drafted, it is far too wide and defeats the intent of the main provisions of the section.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on what I am saying.  If the Minister were prepared to say that he would consider an amendment to this subsection on Report Stage, we would be prepared to accept that assurance and not push this amendment to a vote.  But, as drafted within the section, it is self-defeating and will render the section largely ineffectual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this subsection is reasonable but I have listened carefully to what the Deputy said.  This amendment would dispense with the requirement that before giving a direction to a statutory body to dispose of their interest in a derelict site, the Minister must be satisfied that the land involved is effectively redundant to the performance by the statutory body of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for incorporating this requirement in subsection (3) is that section 14 could otherwise result in directions which might run counter to the intentions of the various statutes dealing with statutory bodies.  The section as it stands seeks to balance the will of the Legislature, as expressed in these statutes, with the requirements of this Bill. <Col N="1944" /> The amendment would discard any consideration of the purposes for which various pieces of legislation have empowered statutory bodies to acquire and use land, and allow ministerial directions under section 14 to be framed in isolation from these purposes.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that, whatever the shape of section 14 and whether a ministerial direction is given in a particular case or not, all statutory bodies will be fully subject to the general duty on landowners, under section 10, to prevent dereliction.  They will also be subject to any remedial measures which a local authority may require under section 12.</P>
    <P>Section 14, enabling ministerial directions to be given to statutory bodies to dispose of their interest in land, is a parallel to the compulsory acquisition provisions set out in sections 15 to 20, which are applicable to privately owned lands. These CPO provisions, as is usual in this area of law, contain many restraints designed to respect the rights of the existing landowner.  Subsection (3) of section 14 is designed to enjoin similar respect for the intentions of other legislation regarding land in the ownership of statutory bodies, having regard to the public investment involved and the possible loss to public funds which could arise if land were disposed of which was still necessary for that body's functions.</P>
    <P>We should show some respect for legislation affecting other bodies.  I would not like to think that a Minister would like to be able to ride roughshod over statutory bodies in that they have enshrined in legislation passed by this House powers which are available to them for the purposes of their own developments and progress. To comply with what Deputy Shatter has said would seem to be going too far in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should avail of this opportunity to make rapid progress. On the section, I should just like to say that this really is the nub of the problem so far as I am concerned.  I would equally argue that one or two of the subsections could be left out as they reinforce one <Col N="1945" /> another.  The operative words in subsection (3), and I am not particularly excited by Deputy Shatter's amendment, are &ldquo;the Minister shall not give, unless he is satisfied&rdquo;.  If a particular Minister for the Environment is not satisfied that a statutory body seriously needs the land in question then he can proceed to give the direction.</P>
      <P>The real problem, and I think we have had it repeatedly here, is that the main offenders in regard to substantial site dereliction in urban areas, whatever about rural areas, are statutory bodies and unless the Minister of the day is prepared to use the teeth which are contained in this provision then the problem is not necessarily going to go away.  For the purposes of making laws, I am reasonably satisfied, within the constraints of any legislation we have to enact in this House, and having regard to the relationships between different Government Departments and statutory bodies, that, taking sections 14 (2) and (3) together, there is enough balance between the two to enable a determined Minister to proceed with a direction and at the same time give a statutory body reasonable protection before they are finally ordered to do what they might have to do.</P>

      <P>I want to respond to Deputy Quinn, who made a very fair and reasonable contribution.  I agree with the Deputy that statutory bodies can and do create and generate dereliction.  We are all aware of that.  The interesting thing about this is that the Minister will be empowered to direct a statutory body to sell only if particular lands are derelict. They can circumvent all of that by maintaining their land in a non-derelict state, and that is the whole purpose of this.  The important principle enshrined in all of this is that authorities and statutory authorities, as well as individuals, have rights and those rights are established in law.  When they are enshrined in legislation we should respect them.  In effect, <Col N="1946" /> whether the statutory body wishes or does not wish to comply with whatever the Minister may want them to do it will not be a matter between the statutory body and the Minister but between the Minister and the Minister responsible for that statutory body.  That is the critical point enshrined in this provision and it makes it watertight.</P>

      <P>With regard to a local authority having power to compulsorily acquire any derelict site situated within their functional area, I wonder what the description of a derelict site would be.  It seems to me that much of the dereliction is related to the front and back gardens and often the side gardens of houses let out in flats which are not looked after by the owner who is not the occupier.  That is a terrible problem in many parts of this city.  In some cases cowboy operators have houses in which they do not live converted into multiple flats and it appears that they can ignore the High Court, Dublin Corporation and get away with that.  One of the greatest problems with dereliction in Dublin is the derelict state of certain houses.  I am not referring to houses which are unoccupied but to multiple flat dwellings.  They are in a terribly derelict state, disfiguring the streetscape in many cases while the owners live in the comfortable suburbs of Foxrock and so on.  They do not live in those conditions but they require others who live adjacent to or in their property to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider compulsorily acquiring derelict houses and taking the power to compulsorily acquire the gardens, side, back and front, of certain houses if they are disfiguring the city. The question of what is a site in this <Col N="1947" /> regard should have a broader interpretation. We should have the power to tell the people who leave their premises in that state, and who live in nicer suburbs, that they cannot do this and it will not be tolerated.  The power should be extended to include the compulsory acquisition of houses left by owners in a derelict state and which take from the value of the property of the neighbours, often where the neighbour is the sole dweller or is residing in his or her home. In many instances those owners get a handsome profit from their houses.  There are many examples of that dereliction in the city but particularly in Rathmines, where there are many flats.  In the middle of very nice streetscape one finds derelict houses, multiple flat dwellings returning a handsome profit to the owner who lives in a nice fashionable suburb but leaves people living in terrible conditions in those multiple flat dwellings and adjacent houses.</P>
    <P>We should have the power to compulsorily acquire those houses if people are making profit from them and if they are destroying the city from the point of view of tourism, the environment and affecting those living in the multiple flat dwelling and adjacent to them.  It is time we took those people on and put down a marker that the condition of those houses is not acceptable.  One of the biggest problems in residential areas is dereliction. There are many multiple flat houses in a derelict condition and they are not looked after by their owners, who are making a handsome profit.  I should like to ask the Minister to refer to this issue on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill whereby a local authority can serve notice on an individual if the individual is known.  If the individual is not known there are procedures whereby they can acquire the property compulsorily.  They will, under other arrangements in the Bill, have to pay compensation into court, or the fund of suitors, like other unclaimed moneys, so that they will have discharged their total liability in the matter if they do not know who the owner is.  They will have ownership under the compulsory acquisition powers available to them.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>A local authority intending to acquire any derelict site compulsorily under this Act... shall (b) serve on every owner, lessee and occupier (except tenants for a month or a period less than a month) of the land a notice in the prescribed form stating their intention to acquire the derelict site compulsorily under this Act, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to rural dereliction rather than urban dereliction and I made the point on Second Stage.  There are numerous houses around the country that are steadily disintegrating into a state of dereliction but the cost of acquiring them is prohibitive not because of the purchase price but because of the difficulty of trying to contact the ten or 12 people who own the property.  As I said on Second Stage, they may stretch from Brisbane to Boston.  The Minister will be aware of properties in his own constituency which are held jointly by members of families who are scattered across the globe.  If a local authority cannot comply with the <Col N="1949" /> section, are they effectively prohibited from proceeding?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the quickest way to respond to that is to refer the Deputy to section 7 (2), which, I think, caters adequately for the problem there. It might not be possible to identify a person in the normal way and the notice can be pinned to the property without naming the individual owner concerned. That is the reason, recognising the difficulty that might arise in the circumstances the Deputy referred to, which is the case in many of these derelict positions, more in provincial Ireland now than in the city, where people have gone away and nobody seems to own anything. In one case in my constituency the local authority had to pursue not as good a <i>modus operandi</i> as is outlined here and it took quite some time to get possession of the property.  We believe this will make it easier under section 7 of the legislation. As to the Deputy's suggestion, we would have difficulty in making this enforceable, but I think we have cornered that aspect.</P>

As I said, I believe in giving the local authority this power, but there should be safeguards. We live in a democracy and everybody should have the right to know precisely the view of the local authority in this matter.  It would be reasonable for the Minister to communicate to the objector within 21 days after receipt of such comments from the local authority the views of the local authority together with any documents which are relevant in so far as the local authority's reply affects the objection.  It is not a major consideration but I think it would strengthen the Bill and help to democratise the whole process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25a:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (5), line 22, after &ldquo;site.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Minister shall make his decision within 6 months from the date of the application.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take amendment No. 25b with this amendment.</P>
      <P>This is expediting matters.  It seems that the real clout in this Bill is the giving of powers to the local authority to compulsorily acquire the derelict sites.  Presumably that power will be exercised by local authorities only very much as a last resort, presumably after a local authority had pretty well exhausted themselves in serving notices and attempting to get the owner or occupier of a derelict site to take measures to put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> There are two areas in which the provisions of section 17 water down considerably the powers of local authorities in this respect.  First, the procedure as I understand it is that, after a local authority serve notice on the owner of a site that they intend to purchase it, the owner of that site may then lodge an objection to that.  That then puts the onus back on the local authority to state a case to the Minister for the Environment that the site should be compulsorily purchased. The problem, however, is that no date is set.  There is no limit set within which the Minister may give his decision on that matter.  We have many examples of local authorities putting cases to Ministers for the Environment and it drags on for a considerable time before the Minister makes a decision.  That would give considerable lattitude to the owner of a derelict site and would leave it open to that owner to believe all he has to do is to lodge the objection and by whatever means arrive at where the Minister for the Environment either delays making a decision or puts it on the long finger. The amendment I am proposing would require the Minister for the Environment to give his decision within six months, which is, I think, a generous period for the Minister to consider all the matters relating to it and to make a decision on it.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in my name under this section deals with what I consider really contradicts section 13 of the Bill.  Section 13 allows the Minister for the Environment to direct a local authority to serve notices on the owners of a derelict site to take certain measures to end the dereliction of that site.  Let us say the owners of that derelict site do not comply with those notices which have been served on them, ultimately at the direction of the Minister for the Environment himself.  Again, should the local authority decide to compulsorily purchase that site, the owner lodges an objection.  Again there is ambiguity as to whether that site will eventually be compulsorily purchased.  It should be quite clear in the Bill that, where the <Col N="1952" /> Minister himself has initiated it and has directed the local authority to serve the notice, in the event that that notice has not been complied with and the local authority subsequently decide to compulsorily purchase the site it should not be open to the Minister to refuse the permission to the local authority to go ahead and compulsorily purchase that site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first part, I would not be keen to agree to a six month period on the grounds that it could be done more quickly than that.  I think six months is too long.  In most of these cases before it gets to that point a substantial amount of time has been taken by the local authority to deal with it.  I would not like to see the six months put into this on the grounds that normally then you would not have a decision until six months' time even though the indication is &ldquo;within six months&rdquo;.  As the Deputy knows, in most cases six months will be regarded as the period.  Has the Minister any idea of the average time in which action would be taken in cases like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate Deputy Gilmore's desire as set out in his amendment to have CPOs dealt with more speedily.  I think that is the thrust of it. As a matter of administrative policy, I support fully and share the aspiration enshrined in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Stafford, the average time for processing this type of CPO under the 1961 Derelict Sites Act has been about four or five months.  Certainly it has always in our experience been less than six months.  I think the reason for that is that no oral hearing is required in a CPO under derelict sites legislation.  That is why it is a much shorter process than is normal in general CPO situations.  Ministerial consideration of a proposed CPO to which the landowner has objected involved an important exercise of administrative justice and the fairness of the process could be compromised in particular cases by an <Col N="1953" /> inflexible time limit if we were to agree to it.</P>
    <P>If the courts were to find subsequently that the Minister had failed to consider adequately important information because of the presence of the time limit you would seek to place on him, it could and probably would set aside the decision.  I would ask the Deputy to consider that aspect.  Our experience has not been what the Deputy considers it to have been. What he seeks might very well hinder rather than improve what he is seeking to have enshrined in the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, I do not see any difficulty with the amendment.  If the average time for the making of a decision is four to five months, surely an amendment imposing a time limit of six months can be accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not consider either that there is anything unreasonable in this proposal. We are dealing with a situation where sites have been left derelict, where local authorities will have served notice on the owners of those sites that they are derelict, where the owners will have been given ample opportunity to put matters right, where the local authority following a decision to compulsorily purchase the site will have served a further notice on the owner and where the owner has the right to object to that.  Ultimately we are talking of the appeals stage of what we all know to our cost is a very prolonged process.  Failure to provide for a finite period would leave the Bill very deficient. We are talking of a six month limit at maximum.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  It would not appear to cause any great administrative difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would involve something that is essential to the whole process.  The process is not very long anyway so far as derelict sites legislation is concerned.  The CPO powers exist for many purposes in local government and related law but in no instance does a time limit, such as is proposed in the amendment, operate. <Col N="1954" /> Against that background I must be reluctant to take the amendment on board. Why introduce such a provision in this area when it is not in any other area?  If the amendment were to be accepted, what would happen if the Minister were to fail to make a decision within the six months? Would the CPO fail?  That is what I must ask myself.  Is it the intention that the CPO would automatically take effect as proposed by the local authority?  If that is what is intended a landowner could argue, and with some justice, that he had been denied a fair hearing of his objection because of the Minister's failure to meet the six month deadline.  That would defeat in another way the purpose of the amendment.  In these circumstances, it is unreasonable to talk of introducing such new arrangement for CPOs.  It is not necessary for the purpose of achieving the desired aim of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25b:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister shall not refuse consent for the compulsory acquisition of all or part of a derelict site, where the owner or occupier of the land has failed to comply with the requirements of a notice, within the period specified by the notice, which has been served under section 13 of this Act.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I have already spoken on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke on this matter and I assume the reference to section 13 is intended to relate to section 12.  This amendment empowers a local authority to serve a notice requiring remedial measures in relation to a derelict site.  The present amendment would mean that a CPO would automatically go through on the proposal of a local authority in any case where a section 12 notice had not been complied with.  That is essentially what Deputy Gilmore is suggesting. Provisions for objections by the landowner and consideration by the Minister would then be irrelevant.  I cannot imagine Deputy Gilmore will be pressing this since the amendment in these cases would give the Minister only one choice &mdash; to confirm the CPO as proposed by the local authority, and that would run contrary to what the Deputy was suggesting should be in other cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of allowing the right of objection and referring CPOs for ministerial decision is so that where a CPO is contested the local authority will not be the judge and jury of their own case. That is the essential principle enshrined in CPOs as we know them.  This amendment would set aside that very important principle of justice where a landowner was in default of a section 12 notice. Enforcement of section 12 notices is already adequately provided for in the Bill and a breach of section 12 can be prosecuted by the local authority in the District Court or, alternatively, under section 12 (5) the local authority can carry out the remedial works required by the notice and charge the costs to the landowner. I consider that these follow-up powers in relation to section 12 are clear and adequate and I cannot see why Deputy Gilmore would pursue this seeing it is contrary to some of the things he and his party have professed and articulated so many times in debates on different Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is incorrect in assuming that the amendment relates to section 12.  The amendment states that it relates to section 13.  That section of the Bill gives power to the Minister to <Col N="1961" /> direct a local authority to serve an order. Indeed, I agree with much of what the Minister has said in regard to the right of appeal from notices served under section 12 but here we have a situation where the Minister, presumably for very good reason, would take a decision to direct a local authority to serve a notice on the owner of a derelict site.  If the owner of that derelict site fails to comply with that order &mdash; the Minister having already directed that the order should have been served &mdash; and the local authority then proceeds to take steps to compulsorily acquire that site, it is contradictory that the Minister would, on appeal, not confirm that compulsory purchase order.  The purpose of the Bill is to take effective measures against dereliction.  If we are going to do that &mdash; and one of the principal instruments provided in the Bill is the power of local authorities to compulsorily purchase a site &mdash; then I do not think we should leave it wide open and full of holes and avenues which the owners of delelict sites can exploit.  It should be made clear to them that if the Minister directs a local authority to serve a notice on the owner of a derelict site that that owner cannot subsequently, many months or a couple of years later &mdash; after the procedure has been exhausted &mdash; come back and expect the Minister to deny the local authority the right to compulsorily purchase that site.  The amendment is confined to section 13 rather than section 12.  It is confined to where the Minister would direct a local authority to serve notices on the owners of derelict sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Deputy, he is getting this somewhat confused.  I would suggest that substantive power is enshrined in section 12 and that section 13 can bear only on local authorities, not on land owners.  The question of whether a derelict site needs to be brought into the ownership of a local authority is a separate one and should, like all contested CPO proposals, be dealt with impartially and on its merits.  I do not favour mechanism for CPO being involved in your amendment. <Col N="1962" /> There is adequate power in the Bill, particularly as it is enshrined in section 12; that is where the substantive power rests.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 14, subsection (3), line 14, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by way of derelict sites levy or&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>These amendments relate to compulsory acquisition of derelict sites which is finally effected by a vesting order.  Amendments Nos. 26a and 26b clarify the provisions whereby a local authority is authorised to reduce compensation in respect of certain sums owing to them by the landowner.  In particular, amendment No. 26a makes it clear that the local authority is entitled to claw back any unpaid amount of a derelict site's levy from the compensation payment for the land.  Amendment No. 34a provides for an exception in the case of CPO from the general rule whereby unpaid derelict sites levy must remain a charge on the land.  This general rule is designed to cater for transfer of land from one private ownership to another.  In such cases the new purchasers will be bound to discharge the unpaid amount of the derelict sites' levy.  this requirement is unnecessary and inappropriate where the local authority is acquiring the land by CPO.  The amendment waives its application in these two cases.  I recommend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the amendments but I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words on the section before it is put.  In regard to subsection (2) in relation to the calculation of compensation, perhaps the Minister would give the House an outline of precisely how compensation will be calculated.  It seems to me that <Col N="1964" /> some of the shysters and chancers who are operating in this city, particularly in regard to houses and gardens which have been allowed to go derelict by people who do not reside in those houses but who expect others to reside in multiple dwellings in those houses and expect people living in private houses to live next door to those derelict sites while they themselves live in nice suburbs. When such people are being compensated &mdash; that is the term the Bill uses &mdash; they should be penalised an amount of money which would then be required to be used in restoring the building and site from its derelict condition.</P>
      <P>I hope that will be a penalty clause in any calculation of compensation.  I do not see why somebody who sells a derelict house or site to the State or the local authority should get the same price as a person living in a house next door who looks after it and does not create a nuisance. This dereliction is created because the people who own the house or the site in question do not reside there and do not have to face it every day.  Some people in suburbs like Rathmines put washing lines in front of their houses which they attach to electricity posts on the footpath.  They have built extensions to the side of their houses in contravention of High Court orders and of the planning authority.  The whole house should be compulsorily acquired, fully restored and sold on.  The local authority should have the power to retain from the compensation a sufficient amount of money to carry out the necessary works.  One person can own a series of houses in several suburbs, destroy the local environment and streetscape and cause a terrible nuisance to neighbours, perhaps even damaging their property.  It is totally unfair.  In calculating the compensation there should be a penalty which allows a substantial amount of money to be retained and used to put a house or site in good order before the net payment is made to the offender.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Sections 69 to 79 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as amended or adapted by or under the Second Schedule to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, or any other Act, shall apply in relation to compensation to be paid by a local authority under this section as if such compensation were a price or compensation under the said Act as so amended.</P>
      <P>(5)  Where money is paid into Court under section 69 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as applied by this section, by the local authority, no costs shall be payable by that authority to any person in respect of any proceedings for the investment, payment of income, or payment of capital of such money.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>These sections of the Land Clauses Acts provide a mechanism for dealing in the context of a CPO with the payment of compensation to persons not fit to manage their financial affairs or to owners who cannot be traced.  Essentially they involve the lodgment of the compensation sum for administration by the courts.  In all other legislation involving CPOs, such as the Housing Act, 1966, the Planning Act, 1963, or the Canals Act, 1986, these Land Clauses Acts provisions are expressly applied to compensation payments.  They were omitted from the compensation provisions of the 1940 and 1961 Derelict Sites Acts but this is considered an appropriate time to state them explicitly in this Bill.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> A local authority may use any derelict site acquired by them under this Act, the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, or the Derelict Sites Act, 1940, for any purpose connected with their functions. </P>
    <P>That seems to be a very strong power to confer on a local authority.  Does this mean they could build a sewage plant in the middle of a residential estate or build a factory where planning permission exists only for private dwellings?  Are we empowering them to do what they like and bypass other legislation?  Local Authorities have widespread functions and it could mean literally anything.  If we, at a future date, removed the <i>ultra vires</i> rule on local authorities, about which there has been much talk, then they would be able to do whatever they liked, whenever they liked, with derelict sites which they acquire.  Any purpose connected with their functions should at least be limited to the words &ldquo;in keeping with good planning law&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seek to do that. <Col N="1968" /> It seeks only to allow that land which is taken under this legislation is covered.

However, if the Minister assures me that that is not the case I will accept it. I do not agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's remark that local authorities are always responsible.  I am aware of one local authority which has been the owner of a very large number of derelict sites.  Local authorities are just as capable of being guilty of an offence as anybody else and it is often very hard for members of local authorities to bring the authority to heel in dealing with the problem.

      <P>I do not have an amendment on this section but I wonder if the Minister could, before Report Stage, give some further consideration to the intervals of time within which the market value of urban land is to be entered on the register.  My understanding of what is proposed in the Bill is that the market value is to be revised once every five years.  At the rate at which property values in some parts of large cities are rising, the market value of urban land would have greatly increased within that period and the amount entered in the register would be considerably below the real value of the land.  Therefore, the levy which it is intended to impose on derelict sites would be very low in comparison with the real value of the land.  In view of the recent, very significant upsurge in property prices, will the Minister give some further consideration to that point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by the Deputy and I can see the wisdom of what he is saying.  There are fluctuations but the Deputy will recognise that they are not always in one direction. They have gone up and down, even in this city, over the past number of years. There is a lot involved in carrying out a revision and we do not think it would be appropriate to do it every one or two years.  We have taken the balanced view that a period of five years is a reasonable time scale in getting a fair balance of judgment in the matter.  I take the point <Col N="1971" /> the Deputy is making, that one must decide on some time scale.  I consider this a reasonable one to suggest.</P>

      <P>This is a rather long section with a number of subsections. Would the Minister set out in layman's language precisely what is the objective of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides for the determination by a local authority, as soon as possible after it is entered in the Derelict Sites Register, of the market value of a derelict site in an urban area. That valuation is to be repeated once every five years.  Where a person disagrees with the determination he may, within 28 days of being notified, appeal to the Valuation Tribunal against the determination depending on the entry in the register concerning the market value of the site.  Urban land is defined in section 3 and excludes occupied buildings, land owned by the local authority in whose area the land is situated, land owned by a State authority and lands covered by a compulsory purchase order which has become operative, or land the subject of planning reservation or for such purposes as roads and parking.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (1) a local authority is obliged to determine the market value of urban land, defined in section 3, as soon as possible after it has been entered in the register and once every five years on a prescribed date thereafter.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of subsection (2) a local authority may authorise a person to determine the market value of the urban land.  Some local authorities, such as Dublin Corporation, employ full-time valuers but most local authorities engage private valuers &mdash; they would engage them on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis &mdash; particularly when dealing with compulsory purchase order cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An owner of urban land may appeal, under the provisions of subsection (4), to the tribunal which shall hear and determine appeals under subsection (5).  Apart from a right of appeal to the High Court <Col N="1972" /> on a question of law, the determination of the Valuation Tribunal will be final.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the statement of a case for the High Court by the Valuation Tribunal.  Where any party to an appeal is dissatisfied with the determination of the Valuation Tribunal as being erroneous in point of law they may, within 21 days of the determination, by notice addressed to the tribunal, require the tribunal to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the matter within three months of the date of receipt of the notice.

      <Col N="1974" />  (a)  in respect of the first local financial year after the passing of the Act, three per cent. of the market value of urban land concerned, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in respect of any subsequent such year such amount not exceeding ten per cent. as may stand prescribed for each urban area or if there is no such amount prescribed three per cent. of the said market value.  </P>
    <P>(4)  Where it is proposed to prescribe a levy for an urban area the amount of which would exceed the levy in force for that area in the preceding local financial year by more than two per cent. of the market value of urban land concerned, a draft of the regulations concerned shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not less than three months before the end of the local financial year and the regulations shall not be made unless a resolution approving of the draft has been made by each such House.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The point was made in the course of Second Stage that too wide a discretion was being vested in the Minister in regard to the amount of the derelict sites levy to be prescribed by him.  In effect, the Minister was free to determine the annual amount of the levy within the range of zero to 10 per cent of the market value of the land.  This amendment is intended to give a clear indication, within the legislation itself, as to the amount of the levy which will apply and to give limited discretion only to the Minister to increase this in subsequent years without full recourse to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the new subsection (3) (a) the amount of levy for the first year will be fixed at 3 per cent of the market value of the relevant urban land for all urban areas.  Subsection (3) (b) stipulates 10 per cent as being the absolute maximum for the levy in any year and provides that, if no amount is prescribed, a 3 per cent levy will apply.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of subsection (4), when the Minister proposes to prescribe <Col N="1975" /> a levy for the urban area which would exceed the levy in force for that area in the previous year by more than 2 per cent of the market value of the land, the regulations involved must be confirmed by an affirmative resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, having been laid before each House at least three months before the end of the local financial year.  Where the Minister proposes to increase the levy by 2 percentage points or less, or to reduce the levy, he may do so by regulation, which will be subject to the normal annulment procedure within 21 days.</P>

      <P>(d)  in respect of the fourth local financial year after the passing of the Act, nine per cent. of the market value of the urban land concerned, and</P>
      <P>(e)  in respect of the fifth and each subsequent financial year after the passing of the Act such percentage of the market value of the urban land concerned, which shall be set by the Minister, but which shall not be less than ten per cent.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are attempting to do here is strengthen the provisions of this Bill.  I have considerable doubt as to whether the levy system will actually work in practice. First, there are considerable resources required by local authorities to make it operable.  The Minister has already mentioned the kind of staff which will be required to establish the register, <Col N="1976" /> to determine the market value of lands and so on.  The whole purpose of the Bill must be to render it as unattractive as possible for the owner of a derelict site to leave it lying derelict.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to fix a levy of 3 per cent for the first financial year.  However, I have grave doubts as to whether that amount will ever be increased subsequently.  Frankly, I do not foresee the Minister or his Department regularly revising the levies to be charged for each urban area.  In practice I do not believe that will happen.  I would be very much opposed to the notion that, where the proposed increase is in excess of 2 per cent, it has to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas, that three months notice and so on is required.  It would appear to me that that will wrap it up in procedures rendering it totally unworkable, particularly when one takes into account the fact that, where the Minister proposes to reduce the levy, he does not have to come before the Houses at all.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable that there be a phased increase of the levy being charged on derelict sites, beginning with 3 per cent in the first year, rising to 5 per cent the second year, to 7 per cent the following year, and so on, until the figure of 10 per cent is reached in the fifth and subsequent years.  That would send out the message very clearly to the owners of derelict sites that the longer they leave a site derelict the more it is going to cost them.  Sites are left derelict because the owners of them, by and large, are waiting for an opportunity to arise when they can either dispose of a site at considerable profit or develop it at considerable profit. The language the owners of derelict sites understand is the language of money.  If this Bill is to have real clout then the provision in regard to the levy must make it clear to the owners of derelict sites that the longer they leave sites derelict the more it will cost them and that that cost will increase each year.</P>
    <P>Once the figure of 3 per cent is fixed for the first year that is the figure which will remain subsequently in practice.  I doubt very much if that figure will be revised in subsequent years and I do not <Col N="1977" /> think that in respect of a site which is left derelict for several years 3 per cent of the market value will be an adequate levy in subsequent years.  The Bill should provide specifically for this by providing for a phased increase in the amount of the levy.</P>

      <P>I think enough concern was expressed on Second Stage to guarantee that Members will be more than anxious to see to it that the register is compiled. I suppose part of the sweetener attached to this provision is that the income from such a levy will apply to local authority revenue.  This will entice them along and I think Deputy O'Sullivan will accept that it will be an incentive to them to see to it that the register is compiled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a lot.  This raises the whole question as to what is intended by this legislation and the levy.  It is intended above all else as an efficiency tax which will promote the better use of land.  I have to reiterate that it is not intended to raise revenue for local authorities. That is not its primary function. I made it clear on the introduction of this legislation what was intended by my attitude to dereliction.  That underscores everything which has been done and is being attempted here.  There is no reason to suggest that the levy will not be raised. Hopefully it will not be necessary to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the derelict sites levy should not be used to raise money for local authorities.  I am a member of a local authority and I would have no hesitation in saying, in regard to <Col N="1978" /> a site which has been derelict for several years, or the raising of moneys which will arise from the levy, that we should get rid of the derelict site.  I understand that the intention of the levy is to provide an incentive to the owner of a derelict site to get his act together and clean up or develop the site.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, under the original proposal in the Bill, the market values of lands will be revised only every five years.  In practice the amount of the levy will be 3 per cent.  That is what this Bill will amount to and in practice that 3 per cent will not be increased.  As the years go on, the amount of the levy will not be a sufficient incentive to the owners of those sites to clean them up.  I do not see why the Bill cannot provide for the scaled progression of the levy which I have proposed.  This would make it clear &mdash; I understand this is the main purpose of the Bill &mdash; to the owners of derelict sites that there is a war on dereliction and that that war is going to result in increased penalties and charges to the owners of derelict sites as the years go on.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said in regard to the provision of a register for local authorities. It is very welcome news that they will be able to compile a register.  Local authorities do not have the staff to compile such a register and I welome this provision.  I accept the Minister's statement that it is not the purpose of this Bill to provide financial gain for any local authority.  What happened over the past number of years was that dereliction cost local authorities money and I think it deterred a number of industrialists from setting up in cities where there is dereliction.  I accept that a progressive levy would probably be the answer to many of the problems facing local authorities at present.  I do not think coming back into the House again is the proper way to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would certainly favour the message going out loud and clear from the Oireachtas that a person who deliberately and blatantly allows his property <Col N="1979" /> to become derelict will have to pay the penalty for doing so, taking into consideration, of course, the safeguards built into the Bill for people who cannot afford to invest in their property.  I ask the Minister to look closely at this provision and perhaps he will be able to come back on Report Stage and say in what circumstances a progressive rate can be implemented by the local authorities.  It is the one area which gives teeth to a local authority and the speculators who are waiting for the price of their property to go up should be made aware that local authorities are being given the power by the Minister to come to grips with this very serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that there is general consensus in the House as to the intention of this legislation, which is primarily to promote the better use of land rather than to raise revenue for local authorities.  This is an essential ingredient of the legislation.  I think implied in that is that the Legislature must allow us to learn from our experience during the early years of operation of the levy.  In effect, I have made a two-pronged attack on the problem of dereliction.  This was the whole idea behind the designated areas under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  That Act provided the carrot to try to get rid of dereliction and this Bill is the stick for those who are reluctant to come along with us and see our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inherent in this legislation is a clear provision for a variation of the levy.  This is an important provision.  We will get good results once the register is in place and people realise they have to pay for the comfort of allowing their property to remain derelict.  Many of the tardy landowners and property owners will move along or pay the penalty in money terms.  The provision in the Bill to increase that levy will be utilised by the Minister.  It is a fair interpretation of what I wish to do and I can move the levy up by certain percentage points &mdash; raising it from 3 to 5 per cent is quite a jump &mdash; without necessarily having to come back <Col N="1980" /> to the Oireachtas.  I think this is a reasonable provision, particularly when we have no experience yet as to how effective it will be in the way it is now proposed.  I am recommending it to the House and in my view it is a reasonable approach to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not entirely happy with the Minister's explanation. The difficulty is that the increase over 3 per cent will not take place.  We all know that the Minister's Department, covering such a wide area of activity, will not, on an ongoing basis, be able to give this the attention it deserves.  I am pressing my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems determined to press everything to a vote but I should like to point out to him that it has always been the practice in the House to give the Minister a certain amount of flexibility on new legislation.  That flexibility is given for many reasons but primarily so that experience can be gained by the Minister in the implementation of certain provisions that involve levying individuals.  The Deputy's amendment would run contrary to that well established flexibility that is allowed to the Minister and would, in fact, represent a determination by the Legislature to impose taxation almost for its own sake. I do not think that is part of the ethos or philosophy that is practised by the Deputy in other places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's view on this.  As a public representative for an inner city area, I have been pushing hard for this legislation.  I found the Minister to be extremely co-operative. He has taken into consideration many of the points we have put to him.  The idea of 3 per cent, and the power to increase it by 2 per cent, is acceptable to me.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Minister would not have any hesitation in moving towards the upper figure if he deemed it <Col N="1981" /> necessary because he has had experience of the north inner city areas.  I understand some of the reasons why Deputy Gilmore is moving his amendment but, as a public representative whose area is directly affected by the problem of dereliction, I am anxious that we get the Bill through as soon as possible.  I am not saying that Deputy Gilmore is purposely adopting the attitude that he should hold up the Bill but it is unfortunate that it is being held up.  If amendments are considered necessary later they can be introduced by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing in the world I want to do is to obstruct the passage of the Bill because, generally speaking, I welcome any measures being taken to deal with dereliction.  However, on Committee Stage of any Bill sections are amended.  I accept, as the Minister has reminded me on a number of occasions, that I am a new Deputy, but I think I am right in my view.  The amendments I have tabled seek to strengthen the provisions and prevent owners of derelict sites, people who are hardened to the ways of the world, from getting around the legislation.  The reason the Bill has been introduced is that those people have found ways of obstructing local authorities and preventing them from taking effective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>I am a member of two local authorities who have used their powers.  It is clear to us that we need more effective legislation.  We use the powers but we still end up with sites which are derelict.  The Minister mentioned the question of flexibility but this is not about giving, or not giving, him flexibility. However, we do not want the owners of derelict sites to have flexibility.  There is nothing wrong with having a penal tax on derelict sites.  There should be a penal tax on such sites.  The 3 per cent on the market value, bearing in mind that the market value may become dated, is quite <Col N="1982" /> small and I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that if it is found that the 3 per cent is not enough it should be increased. We should be able to make owners of derelict sites put them in order and get their act together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34b:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1) line 40, after &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and provided the owner or occupier of the derelict site maintains the site in a reasonable condition to the satisfaction of the local authority&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it is in this section that the owner of a derelict site has the greatest opportunity of escaping from his responsibilities.  As I understand it, it is intended under section 26 that if the owner of a derelict site makes a planning application he can, instead of paying the levy, enter into a bond for a period of five years.  The first thing we have to deal with is the principle of that.  As I read the Bill there is nothing to prevent the owner <Col N="1984" /> of a derelict site from submitting a planning application which would save him paying the levy for five years and making a further planning application before the five years had elapsed.  He could continue to do so and in the end would not have to pay the levy.  The owner can pick his time to go ahead with his development.</P>
    <P>My first amendment to this section suggests that the owner or occupier of the derelict site should have to maintain the site in a reasonable condition and to the satisfaction of the local authority.  My later amendment proposes reducing the period of time from five years to three years.  There may be cases where a site can be developed and a period of time would have to be given to an owner to proceed with that development.  In addition, the owner of the derelict site should be required to keep it in a reasonable condition and that reasonableness should be to the satisfaction of the local authority.  That is the intention of the first amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 34b, would, in all cases, make it a condition of a bonding arrangement under this section that a derelict site should be properly maintained.  It is important that I should state that.  I am not sure that this provision is appropriate in those circumstances. The overriding concern of the Bill, both in the land use type controls of Part II and in the levy provisions of Part III, is, of course, that land should be made non-derelict but, in so far as this occurs, section 24 (6) makes it clear that the levy provisions will have no further part to play.  Looking at it the other way, the levy is designed to deal with the unsatisfactory circumstance that, despite everything, a site may be likely to remain derelict for some time.  It will impose penal taxation on the owner throughout that time in the hope of influencing him to improve the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the case of certain proposed comprehensive redevelopments, it could be counter-productive to front-load the penal tax.  We talked about that before and that is the danger in what the Deputy is suggesting.  For this reason, <Col N="1985" /> section 26 provides for the bonding arrangements which we are discussing. As I have said, it would be contradictory to attach site maintenance conditions to these arrangements, since if these were fully implemented, the site would become non-derelict and neither the levy nor bonding provisions would any longer apply.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there was a theft of a number of antique pistols from the National Museum at the end of 1986 or early 1987; the number of pistols stolen and their value; the circumstances in which the pistols were stolen; if the theft was drawn to the attention of his Department; the action taken <Col N="1988" /> as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The staff of the National Museum discovered on 13 January 1987 that 31 antique pistols were missing.  Their estimated value is between £40,000 and £60,000.  They had been taken from storage boxes in the basement of the museum.  My Department were notified and a Garda investigation was immediately instituted.  The Garda report has been furnished and the matter is still under investigation.  It has not yet been possible to institute criminal proceedings. The various dealers and institutions with whom the museum have contact were notified of the details of the stolen items.  My Department arranged that security at the museum would be reviewed by the Garda and that necessary works would be effected and procedures altered to prevent a recurrence of such a theft.</P>

      <P>His Department having been advised in January 1987 of the fact and an investigation then being instituted by An Garda Síochána, has the Taoiseach made any inquiry as to why no proceedings have arisen from that investigation, given the long lapse of time?  I take it from what the Taoiseach is telling us that none of these pistols has been recovered since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 2 on 2 May 1989, when I informed the Deputy that this matter is being considered by the National Heritage Council in the context of architectural conservation, particulartly vernacular architecture.</P>
      <P>The council are working towards a general policy on the conservation of thatched buildings in this country.  In the meantime, they will consider proposals for individual projects which might be grant-aided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember well when the Taoiseach answered the question on 2 May and I was hoping something would have been done in the meantime.  Daily I can see the thatch being taken off thatched houses and replaced by slates, tiles or, even worse, corrugated iron.  Surely this is a totally undersirable activity, and attempts must be made to subsidise the rethatching of those houses, otherwise their numbers will decline seriously. Would the Taoiseach take the matter in hand with a view to ensuring that there is a general scheme as opposed to one that would apply only to houses in respect of which there are preservation orders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Deputy for his interest in this area.  I am aware that this is an issue he has been pursuing <Col N="1991" /> for some time.  I merely wish to reassure him that at last there are a body who are taking the matter in hand and who will bring forward policies in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if the National Heritage Council will have sufficient finances available to them to enable them to carry out their wishes in this regard?  Will they be in a position to finance a scheme from which people will be subsidised for the purpose of rethatching, rather than replacing, these houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of clarification, has this £1 million been made available for the maintenance and preservation of thatched cottages?  Secondly, is the Taoiseach aware that it seems to be the policy of many building societies not to give mortgages in respect of thatched cottages, that this discourages Irish people from purchasing any of these houses that come on the market, thereby ensuring that they fall into the hands of wealthy foreigners?</P>

      <P>I said they were rare, not that they were non-existent.  I should like to raise a question in relation to a thatched cottage on Blackhorse Avenue beside the Pheonix Park.  This cottage was destroyed by fire some years ago.  The roof has disappeared.  Planning permission was given in respect of the site provided the cottage was retained and maintained but it is lying derelict. Will that kind of cottage qualify under the scheme the Taoiseach refers to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a bit taken aback to hear the Taoiseach tell Deputy McGinley that the £1 million is not specifically for the maintenance of thatched cottages, that it is to do with heritage matters generally. Would the Taoiseach ensure that a scheme is devised either by the National Heritage Council or by the Department <Col N="1993" /> of the Environment whereby a grant or subsidy can be made available to anyone wishing to retain a cottage that is thatched?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for this failure to extend the educational opportunities scheme beyond the pilot areas and his failure to make regulations allowing other courses and voluntary work <Col N="1994" /> schemes to qualify; and the proposals, if any, he has to extend the scheme nationwide to include third-level courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 4, 23 and 40 together.  The educational opportunities scheme was launched on a pilot basis at two centres at Tallaght and Limerick.  The pilot scheme provided an opportunity to long-term unemployed persons aged 25 years or over to further their education while still receiving a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payment.  In 1988 I reduced the qualifying age to 23 years. The courses, which covered second level education only, included both intermediate and leaving certificate subjects and ran for the normal academic year. The vocational education committees in the two pilot areas arranged the classes under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A professional evaluation of the pilot scheme during its first cycle found it to be very worth while.  Participants found that it gave a boost to their morale and improved their job prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 27 September 1989 the Government introduced the vocational training opportunities scheme to replace the educational opportunities scheme.  This new scheme which will also be provided by the vocational education committees will be available in 12 centres around the country including Tallaght and Limerick. The scheme provides long-term unemployed persons over the age of 21 with the opportunity to do a full time education and training course leading to a leaving or other certificate such as City and Guilds.  About 240 places in all are available in the 12 centres.  It is intended to expand the network of centres progressively throughout the country.  The 12 centres are, Cork, Tralee, Galway, Bray, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Waterford, Sligo, Athlone, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas and Limerick.  Participants will receive a weekly allowance from the vocational education committees equivalent to their unemployment payments.  Travel and lunch allowances may also be payable. Recruitment for the new scheme which <Col N="1995" /> is being organised by the adult education organisers of the VECs and the managers of my Department's local offices in the chosen centres is already well under way. A number of classes have already started.</P>
    <P>In relation to facilities for the unemployed to participate in other educational activities, I took power in the Social Welfare Act, 1989 to deem persons to be available for work or to exempt them from the requirement to be available for work in certain circumstances, thereby safeguarding their entitlements to unemployment payments.  Regulations giving effect to those provisions are at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  It is my intention to allow long-term unemployed persons participate in second level education courses and also in projects under community enterprise programmes.  The position in relation to third level education courses is also being examined.</P>
    <P>As regards the first of the questions from Deputy O'Keeffe, the person concerned claimed and was paid an unemployment payment from 12 April 1988 to September 1989.  During this period he was given approval to study for the leaving certificate which he obtained.  In September 1989 he informed the local office that he had been accepted for and intended to commence a full time two year computer studies course at the Regional Technical College in Cork.  His case was referred for determination to a deciding officer who disallowed his claim on the grounds that he was not available for work due to his participation in the full time computer course at the regional college.  He was advised of his right to appeal the decision and was given an appeal form.  To date he has not lodged an appeal against the disallowance.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the person in question is now in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance in respect of his wife and family, plus a mortgage subsidy. When the regulations I have referred to have been made &mdash; as I have said, I expect these to be ready shortly &mdash; I will arrange to have his claim reviewed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> Both individuals referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe in his second question were in receipt of unemployment assistance at the employment office, Kinsale.  Both commenced a secretarial course in the local VEC technical college in September 1989.  Unfortunately, neither of the two sought advance approval from the Department as regards their continuing entitlement to unemployment assistance. When the situation came to light, the claims of both persons were suspended pending examination of whether they satisfied the availability condition.  If it is established that the course is part time and that they will be able to satisfy the availability condition while pursuing the course, their claims will be allowed and payment restored.  If not, their claims will be examined within the context of the new regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to confirm to the House that despite this scheme being set up in 1986 up to two weeks ago only those lucky enough to live in Limerick or Tallaght had any opportunity of availing of the scheme.  In fact, I wonder if this matter had not been raised in Question Time would we have seen an expansion of the scheme at the end of September?  Will the Minister outline to the House why it was impossible to get these schemes in operation in advance of the academic year?  It is difficult enough for unemployed people to get back into education but doing so three months into an academic year lasting eight months is totally tying their hands behind their back.  I ask the Minister to tell us why the delay?  What is the reason for his hesitation in extending this opportunity to all repeat leaving certificate students or second level courses run by the VECs throughout the country?  Why is the scheme still limited to certain areas of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last question first, the regulations will give me power to designate particular courses if some person has the facility to attend such courses.  It is a much more flexible, open arrangement and obviously since it is so <Col N="1997" /> open it has financial and other implications which have to be borne in mind when the regulations are agreed finally.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first scheme, I announced earlier I had approval from the Government to release people and pay them their unemployment payments. The second aspect is providing courses, teachers and so on.  Apparently the approximate cost of the courses just established is about £1.6 million.  There are two aspects with regard to the costs: there is the cost at my end which we have spoken about frequently here and for which I have made arrangements but there is also the question at the education end of providing additional resources. Some of the courses were up and running; there was an extra one in Limerick and one in Tallaght before the extension was put into operation.  Incidentally, it had nothing to do with today's Question Time and I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy on that point.  It had more to do with getting the whole matter operating nationwide.  The Minister for Education hopes and plans to go further with this scheme to include more centres.  There are two elements: the scheme is functioning and people are participating.  The second aspect is the wider question of participating in a variety of courses and that will be covered by regulations that will be available shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has known for some time of the difficulties existing in relation to providing the centres by the Department of Education.  In view of the fact that he took powers under last year's Social Welfare Bill, why did he delay moving in an area that is much more under his control, which is designating existing courses for approval?  Can he give us a specific time when the regulations will be available?  Why is he hesitating in including third level courses which we believe should be open to the unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I merely wanted to differentiate between the two cases. There is no objection to the facts of the case being known.  In fact, it might help to get some sensible decisions from the Departments.  In relation to that matter, will the Minister accept that this case proves conclusively how ludicrous it is to put obstacles in the way of unemployed people pursuing educational courses so that they may get qualifications leading to job opportunities?  Further, will he accept this is a classic case where the Minister, who now has the power under the Act, should use that power immediately, taking into account the circumstances of the person concerned.  This involves a drop in family income from £147 per <Col N="1999" /> week to £102 per week, a willingness on his own part to pay the RTC fees of £395, a willingness to pay travelling expenses to the RTC which cost about £22 per week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 70 together.  The national fuel scheme is intended to assist persons dependent on long-term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their heating needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability benefit is essentially a short-term payment in respect of temporary <Col N="2006" /> incapacity for work.  Where incapacity has lasted for 12 months and is likely to last for a further 12 months, it is open to the person concerned to apply for invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Invalidity pension is a qualifying payment for the purposes of the national fuel scheme and fuel allowances are payable to invalidity pensioners who satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.  There is also provision under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme whereby assistance can be given where a person has exceptional heating needs by reason of ill-health or infirmity.  In this way, the heating needs of the long-term ill are catered for and I have no proposal for further extensions along the lines suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware that it is extremely difficult to be awarded an invalidity pension, that they are becoming rarer as the years go by and, that increasing numbers of those people are losing such benefits?  Would the Minister have before him figures for the average time people are on disability benefit?  To my knowledge there are people who have been on disability benefit for 17 years and upwards.  In view of that and the fact that people in receipt of disability benefit are currently in receipt of £5 less than the long term unemployed, and may have been on it for many years, does he not view this as a serious anomaly?  Where a person has been in receipt of disability benefit for over a year would he consider extending this benefit and other benefits which are referred to in Question No. 9?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number in receipt of invalidity pensions would be increasing rather than reducing.  It is open to people on long term disability benefit to apply for invalidity pension after a year.  The invalidity pension is a taxable benefit. Consequently some people may not wish, especially if there is a second partner involved who has an income, to be in receipt of a taxable benefit and therefore <Col N="2007" /> may not apply.  That is known to be the position in a proportion of cases.  It is not widely appreciated that if a person is on long term disability benefit and is ill enough to require additional heating that is open to them under the scheme and many people are being paid through that mechanism at present.  The total number on disability benefit for over 15 months is 34,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that five years on disability benefit is equal to the classification long term social welfare recipient and equally should be entitled to the free fuel?  Surely it is our collective responsibility to assist people who are on low incomes and disability benefit or invalidity pensions to enhance their standard of living from what is a very meagre level.  It should not be our policy to force people to take up invalidity pensions which might bring that family unit into the tax net because of a meagre pension by the spouse of a claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The disability benefit is a short term payment although there may be people who receive it for a long time. In most other countries it is not paid for any longer than 15 months.  At that stage one either goes on invalidity benefit or stop receiving the benefit.  The relationship between those different payments is a whole debate in itself.  Essentially, it is a short term payment and as such it is equivalent to many other short term payments. To extend these benefits to short term payments would be extremely expensive overall.  As the system operates at present there is a mechanism for people on long term disability benefit who are in need of heating to receive the free fuel.</P>

There are many people on long term disability benefit who are not ill enough to be on invalidity pension; I think the Deputy is aware of that.  If a person is very ill they can come in under the other method.  The criteria for invalidity pension raise a different question.</P>

      <P>The agreement with the social partners in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided that the Government would examine which changes, if any, were required in the social welfare appeals system, with particular regard to ensuring that the system is perceived to be fair.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993</i> provides that a separate Social Welfare Appeals Office will be set up so that the appeals system is perceived to be fair and independent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for confirming that he is setting up this special appeals section to deal with all <Col N="2010" /> appeals in his Department.  Will he set down guidelines as to how appeals will be dealt with because there are great anomalies already in how appeals are heard?  This applies particularly to disability benefit because proper medical facilities are not used at the location of investigation.  The actual procedure followed in appeals for unemployment assistance is that the applicants must be interviewed in their own homes and an interview will not be accepted in the office of the inspector.  These are anomalies which are not seen to be fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the appeals office will be to bring all appeals together under one roof, to have one office and one director.  They are independent, and they must be seen to be clearly independent. This would mean that they would respond to queries, make arrangements, present an annual report and do everything else that goes with it.  It would be a clearly visible system and would be a substantive step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, the Minister will have to have responsibility.  One of the main purposes here is to take it out of the Department and put it into a separate office where it can be perceived very clearly in relation to any of its activities. Ultimately, the Minister will still be responsible for standards and the House will have to consider from time to time how the system should be changed, amended, and improved.</P>

      <P>The independence of the appeals officers has been clearly defined by the Supreme Court judgment and is quite clearcut.  The Commission on Social Welfare also found there was no question as to their independence.  There is, however, a perception that all the literature and information comes from the ordinary branches and offices of the Department.  There would be a separate office and that would be clear to everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In framing any legislative proposals, will the Minister take into account the widespread perception of social welfare recipients that they are cut off automatically after an arbitrary period?  For the lay person there is an inexplicable conflict between the opinion of the medical referee and the person's own doctor.  The latest case I know of <Col N="2012" /> concerns a woman who had been working without a break for 32 years but is manifestly incapable of continuing, yet the medical referee automatically cut her off. This is only one of hundreds of cases.  The view of recipients is that the system is unfair and arbitrary.  Will the Minister take this into account in framing any proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a general perception that it is unfair or arbitrary.  There is certainly a perception that the system is operating within the Department.  The referees are medical people.  There is no other way we can do it.  Unless you get a doctor to make a decision you have to make that decision yourself or ask the Minister to make the decision.  We must have a medically qualified person.  I do not want to go into detail about the extent to which we go into these matters.  There is a first medical referee, then a second medical referee and an appeals system.  There will be problems at any time because of a breakdown of communication for one reason or another.  I have the experience every day as a working Deputy.  Nevertheless this approach is the principal step required.  When the legislation comes before the House Deputies will have the opportunity to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the change, the fact that there are 18,000 appeals in any given year shows that the system does not work.  The criteria are unfair to those people looking for unemployment benefit or seeking work.  On occasions medical referees ask only two or three questions, never actually examine a person and send the report to the Department.  Surely the numbers speak for themselves.  The system does not work.  If the criteria are not changed the same situation will exist under the new proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The system works overall. Millions of incidents and cases are dealt with through the year.  The 18,000 appeals relate not only to disability benefit but to unemployment assistance and <Col N="2013" /> so on.  There are problems in any system with such a huge volume.  It would be much easier for me to do what everybody else has done &mdash; nothing.  Then there would be no hassle.  Why does not somebody say he or she is delighted that this change is about to happen?  Regarding the flexible opportunities for education, why did not somebody come and say thanks, that we have a good Minister now who is doing something worthwhile?</P>

      <P>The Minister must accept that we do appreciate the good things he does but we have an obligation to question the gaps.  There is a widespread perception that the appeals system is arbitrary and unfair.  In establishing this office, will the Minister ensure that people who are obliged to appeal are advised as to how they should appeal, not just given a notice that they are entitled to appeal?  People must get their rights, which is what the appeals system is designed to ensure.  Many people do not know how they may appeal and the kind of evidence they need to prove their case. Some kind of advice leaflet on how to appeal and what kind of evidence to produce is essential if the system is to be seen to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a leaflet can be considered separately in terms of advice.  I have been bringing in a number of simplified leaflets recently.  The purpose of the appeals system is to notify people beforehand and to give them the results of the appeal.  There will be a separate administration dealing purely with these people.  While it will be more expensive, it will provide the kind of thing the Deputy seeks.  I will note his point about the leaflet, which may be very valuable.</P>

      <P>I complimented the Minister earlier on this step in the right direction in establishing a central office.  I also mentioned the lack of facilities for medical referees.  The Minister might ask them to use the local facilities, health centres, hospitals and so on, so that a proper medical can be carried out.  The Minister might also ensure that medical referees accept invitations from applicants at their own offices.  They are available on only one day in most offices but people are volunteering to come in.  If they are missing even to buy a bottle of milk they are left in the lurch for another three or four months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he had any plans to extend the concessions such as free telephone rental which are at present available to recipients of Irish and British State pensions to those outside these categories who are otherwise qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme is one of several schemes including the free electricity allowance scheme and the free television licence scheme, which are provided for persons who are elderly or permanently incapacitated, who are receiving certain social security-type payments and who are either living entirely alone or with other excepted persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this year these allowances were only available to recipients of Irish or British State pensions.  From April 1989 I extended entitlement to these schemes to all European Community social security pensioners aged 66 years or over and those aged under 66 years who are in receipt of EC invalidity pensions for more than 12 months and who are resident <Col N="2015" /> in Ireland.  This extension will cost £0.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I also extended the schemes to cover recipients of certain long term occupational injuries payments from my Department.  In addition I extended the national fuel scheme to households where a long term unemployed person is living with a pensioner or with another long term unemployed person.</P>
    <P>These schemes were widely advertised and my Department ran an extensive media campaign to bring these important changes to the notice of the public.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy may have a particular case in mind which falls between two stools and I will certainly look into the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the anomalies caused by the lack of indexation of the limit, set in 1975, of £6 allowed for means tested social welfare schemes having regard to the fact that this results in losses of pound for pound for any income above £6; and if he will make a statement on his intentions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At present claimants with means of up to £6 a week can qualify for the maximum old age or widow's pension. This also applies in the case of allowances for deserted wives, prisoners' wives, unmarried mothers and the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands. There is no disregard of this kind under the unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>Only a minority of recipients have means in excess of £6.  For example, at the end of December 1988, 70 per cent of old age pensioners, 65 per cent of widows and over 90 per cent of claimants receiving allowances as deserted wives, prisoner's wives and unmarried mothers were in receipt of maximum payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> The Government, while maintaining the overall value of social welfare payments have made significant additional resources available to increase the payments to those on the lowest levels, particularly the long-term unemployed. The policy of using any available resources to provide increases in basic rates of payment rather than increases in the levels of disregards and allowances has been designed to ensure that these resources are channelled to all recipients rather than specifically to those recipients who already have means.</P>
    <P>The question of further increases in payments including any changes in regard to allowances and disregards will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferrris Mr. Ferrris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferrris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply but he did not address the problem, the question of indexation of the £6 limit.  If that sum was index linked to present levels it would now be £30.  I am not just talking about means testing but about the ability of people in these categories, particularly single parent families, non-contributory widowers and those in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance, to be able to earn some additional money to keep them in frugal comfort and not to be penalised under the social welfare code.  It is in that context that I wanted the money to be index linked to allow them to earn a little more &mdash; as many of them want to do &mdash; to maintain their sanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty which comes up in the budget in relation to this is that there are limited resources available and it is obviously better to apply them to the people who have no income and spread it right across the board which means that everybody gets an increase.  Obviously, a time may come when a quantum leap is taken and a sum of money provided to take that step.  This problem has affected previous Ministers for Social Welfare, not just myself.  For example, 95 per cent of the total of unmarried mothers qualify for the full rate which indicates that they are the principal people with no other <Col N="2017" /> income.  I appreciate what the Deputy said in regard to people getting back to the work area but this is a separate question about which I will be concerned in future policy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the figures quoted in a recently published book (details supplied) that more than 30 per cent of all Irish women are living on less than £48 per week; the steps he intends to take to assist women in this category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The book referred to by the Deputy, drawing on data collected by the ESRI in 1986 and early 1987, estimates that slightly over 30 per cent of both women and men were then living in households where the income was below <Col N="2018" /> the equivalent of £48 per week for a single adult.  Since this survey was made, I have taken major steps in 1988 and 1989 to improve the position of those on low incomes, which have been of benefit to both men and women.  These include increases in all payments, with very substantial increases being given to those on lowest incomes, special increases for child dependants, improvements in the child benefit scheme and, for those at work, improvements in the family income supplement.  For example, over the last two years the personal rate of long-term unemployment assistance has been increased by some 25 per cent. Women have also benfited from the special allocations made by the Government this year to assist families, particularly large families on low incomes.  We did this by providing special increases for adult dependants, usually a wife working in the home, and by raising the child dependant allowance to a minimum of £10 per week.  We also improved child benefit, which is paid to the mother, and we introduced a special child-related tax exemption of £200 per child for those at work on low incomes.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that as resources permit the Government will continue their policy of improving the position of men and women on low incomes.</P>
      <P>The following rates which are now paid to women claimants indicate the improvements since the ESRI survey in 1986 and early 1987:</P>

      <Col N="2019" /> Deputies will see from the figures that there has been a considerable improvement since the time of the study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that about seven out of ten women depend on assistance from the State which, quite clearly, puts them in a very poor category.  The Minister said there had been improvements in the family income supplement but will he confirm his awareness of the fact that the take-up has been deplorably low in regard to these benefits?  Will the Minister comment on why the take-up is so low and what he intends to do to increase awareness of these benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken fairly strong measures to increase the awareness in relation to the family income supplement. Our efforts have been complemented by very strong radio advertising which has been very effective. This has resulted in more than a doubling of the weekly uptake so the measures have been fairly effective in that regard. We also recently introduced a pilot study in the North Western Health Board under which those at work and on medical cards have been identified.  Specific information has been directed to them outlining the benefits of the family income supplement.  I hope that sort of targeting will result in an improvement in the take-up.  The third point is that the numbers originally estimated were much higher than the actual numbers, perhaps for a variety of reasons.  According to the research, the numbers who potentially qualify are about 12,000 whereas originally it was thought that about 35,000 would qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he supports the proposal of the Combat Poverty Agency for <Col N="2020" /> a community development fund as a major anti-poverty strategy; and if he was consulted about the Government's refusal to accept £8.5 million EC funds for community development as part of the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency in relation to funding for community development are contained in a report entitled &ldquo;Funding Policy for Community Development&rdquo;. This report, which was presented to me, in September this year, is currently under examination within my Department. At the same time, consultations are taking place with other Government Departments with responsibilities in relation to community development.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which I have a very special interest.  I expect to be in a position to respond to the agency's recommendations shortly.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the <i>National Development Plan</i> and accompanying sectoral operational programmes, the Government recognised the importance of encouraging local development initiatives. Careful consideration was given to the merits of seeking a specific allocation from the EC Structural Funds to support such initiatives but the Government decided that local development needs could be met more effectively through the sectoral programmes.</P>
      <P>A proposal put forward by the European Commission for a global grant scheme to aid community development would not have involved any additional assistance from the Structural Funds and would have been made at the expense of the allocation for the operational programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am afraid I cannot be very complimentary.  Would the Minister accept that this position &mdash; in which on the one hand he accepts the principle of community development and, on the other, his Government refuse £8.5 million which the EC tried to insist that they would take &mdash; clearly indicates that they are guilty of hypocrisy or double-talk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 26 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on the Treatment of Households in the Social Welfare System was set up in May of this year to examine the social welfare code in so far as it affects households, with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has been asked to conclude its work by the end of this year.  When the <Col N="2022" /> report is available it will be considered by the Government to determine what changes, if any, in the social welfare code are necessary.</P>
    <P>While no decision has been taken as yet on the question of publishing the report of the review group, I would envisage that the main findings of the group will be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he expects the report of the review group by the end of this year and intends to introduce legislation next year.  That is what he said originally in this House in regard to households, which question arose out of the Hyland case.  We are concerned about the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; within the context of the review group remit or indeed in the Minister's mind.  It is our understanding that &ldquo;household&rdquo; refers only to households in which there are adults in receipt of unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare or non-contributory.  We are also concerned that the role of the adult spouse dependant in a household has deteriorated from a level of 72 per cent to 61 per cent between the years 1987 and 1989.  The Minister will agree that there is an erosion of the role of the adult dependant in the home and perhaps he would like to clarify the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio at present is slightly above that recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I should like to make that point clear.  The reason the level of allowance for the principal spouse, as distinct from the dependant, has gone somewhat ahead is because we have given exceptional increases of 25 per cent to bring the level to that point. Nevertheless, the ratio as far as the dependant is concerned is slightly above 61 per cent; it is just over the 60 per cent recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The whole question of households and how that question is to be handled in the future, as the Deputy has said, is a complex one.  It was for that reason we set up the expert committee. Deputies will be given a full opportunity <Col N="2023" /> to discuss those matters before any steps are taken.  I look forward to receiving the report of the expert group so that we may then consider what is the best way forward.  I would like to assure the Deputy that there is no question of any steps being taken without there having been full discussion beforehand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my intention initially.  There have been some indications that the problem is somewhat more complex than any of us had anticipated.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I was explaining my reservations about amendment No. 34b.  Basically, I consider that it could be contradictory to attach site maintenance conditions to bonding arrangements because if they were fully implemented the sites would become <Col N="2090" /> non-derelict and neither the levy nor the bonding arrangement would be relevant. I have to emphasise that a landowner will have no right to substitute a bond for the payment of a levy.  The concession in this regard will be at the absolute discretion of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 35a wants the period covered by bonding to be reduced from five to three years.  My amendment No. 35 offers a more flexible arrangement generally in this regard and I hope the Deputy will be able to accept it.  Instead of providing that the bonding period should in all cases embrace five years my amendment will allow a local authority to prescribe any number of financial years, as the case may require, up to a maximum of five years.  I agree with the Deputy that the five year maximum period is appropriate since this corresponds to the normal life of a planning permission as well as to the interval for the development plan review.  This is why we are trying to match up the five year span.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 35b would allow bonding arrangements to be applied only once in relation to the same site.  Given the more flexible provision which I now propose regarding the bonding period and given that a decision to allow bonding will be at the total discretion of the local authority, I do not really see the need for the restriction.  I would ask the Deputy, having considered this proposal, to see the rationale attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned that this section would allow the owners of derelict sites to get around the provisions of the Bill so that they could lodge a planning application and enter into a bond with the local authority by which they would be able to avoid paying the levy and coming up towards the end of the five year period lodge another planning application.  This Bill deals essentially with property speculators who are past masters in getting around the planning process and finding loopholes which the legislators never intended in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the section as originally <Col N="2091" /> proposed would have provided ample opportunities to the owners of derelict sites to get around the provisions of the Bill.  I welcome the comments made by the Minister before we adjourned that the maintenance of sites in a reasonable condition could be dealt with at the stage when the bond is being made.  I accept the Minister's amendment which proposes to reduce to one year, with the possibility of extending it to five, the period of time within which the bond can be made.</P>
    <P>However, I am not entirely happy that the Minister has not accepted my amendment No. 35b.  I am concerned that the owners of derelict sites could continue to make planning applications and thereby frustrate the whole intent of the Bill. Even though the Minister said it would be at the discretion of the local authority, we know that local authorities can be put under considerable pressure to grant planning permissions.  What would happen, for example, where the local authority, by way of a section 4 motion, grant a planning application which may not be for the best planning reasons but for other reasons?  What would happen if a developer came in and perhaps by using the threat of planning compensation extracted from a local authority a commitment to a planning permission and the local authority were unable to give effect to this?</P>
    <P>I am not happy that the Minister has not accepted my amendment in relation to this provision.  I see no reason why this provision cannot be included in the Bill. There are no circumstances in which the owner of a derelict site should on a succession of occasions be able to get planning permission and thereby avoid paying the levy.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Gilmore want me to put the question on amendment No. 34b?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point of clarification which I should like to make to Deputy Gilmore.  Much of what he has said in this regard is true and we all accept what we are trying to do jointly.  It is <Col N="2092" /> important to remember that the bonding period may not be five years; it can be for any number of years and totally at the discretion of the local authorities.  This is a very important aspect to bear in mind. If a development which is used as a reason for going for a bonding option is not carried out then the bond will be forfeited and the total levy which would have applied in the intervening period will be forfeited as well so they can be caught at both ends.  This is an important aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they will be caught at all because any developer I have come across would never allow a planning permission to run out and the bond to be forfeited.  I think it is far more likely that the owner of a site will come in with a new planning application.  That is why I believe this provision should be tightened.  I assume the purpose of allowing this arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Clause (b) provides that notwithstanding the suspension the unpaid levy will become and remain a charge on the land under section 25 until it is paid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 7, after &ldquo;12 (4),&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;30 (2), 30 (3)*,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>For technical legal reasons, I could not accept any amendment which would increase the maximum fine for a summary offence beyond the currently accepted limit of around £1,000.  This figure is advised by the Attorney General as the maximum, in current circumstances, for the jurisdiction on minor offences proper to the District Court.  Similarly, the figure of £100 is also regarded as the maximum permissible under summary jurisdiction for a daily continuance of an offence.</P>
      <P>Whether we should also introduce a jurisdiction for the higher courts, together with higher penalties, is a matter for policy decision by this House.  My own view up to this point is that given the extended and improved powers for which the Bill is providing, as well as the derelict sites levy, the heavy criminalisation of offences under this Bill was neither necessary nor appropriate.  It seems to run contrary to what we have agreed should be the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am however prepared, if the House wishes, to bring forward a Report Stage amendment providing for prosecution on indictment of offences under section 12 (4) and higher maximum penalties for conviction in these cases.  The other categories of offence under the Bill are minor ones which remain more suitable to the District Court.  I am seeking the House's advice on this and if Members are anxious <Col N="2095" /> that I should bring forward such an amendment I will do so.  It is an even bet at the moment whether it is advisable or not.  I will be led by the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to amendments Nos. 43 and 44.  Amendment No. 43 requires owners who dispose of their interest in a derelict site, as well as executors of wills, to inform the local authority forthwith so that the derelict sites register can be amended to reflect the change of ownership. This amendment will ease the burden of updating information on ownerships for local authorities.  Amendment No. 44 is consequential on amendment No. 43.</P>
    <P>I am recommending them to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 9, to delete &ldquo;not exceeding £1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not less than £10,000 and not exceeding £25,000&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to have severe penalties for offences under the Bill.  The Minister seems to be reluctant to criminalise the wrong doings.  I take the view that it is a social crime for the owner of property to leave a derelict site in a way that causes offence, nuisance or despoils the environment. The way we deal with crime, whether it is the type of crime that was referred to earlier or a crime against society as a whole, is by severe penalties. The penalties provided in the Bill are inadequate.  A maximum fine of £1,000 on property that when developed may realise a value of several million pounds is puny.  I accept what the Minister said, that the advice he has received is that legally we cannot deal with penalties in this way.  The Minister indicated that he would be willing to bring proposals before the House on Report Stage providing for higher penalties, perhaps <Col N="2096" /> through a higher court.  I would be willing to wait to see those proposals.</P>

      <P>The Minister put his finger on the problem.  The amendment I tabled, which would have interlinked with amendments Nos. 29 and 42, was designed to provide for the possibility of an indictable offence provision.  The Minister is correct in saying that there is a limit to the type of fine or sentence the District Court can impose.  My concern was the same as that voiced by other Deputies, that it could happen that a developer, considering the amount of money that could be obtained by way of profit ultimately from the sale of a building, would allow it to become so dilapidated that planning permission would be granted for a different type of development.  That could render the fine imposed as a virtually irrelevant sanction. There is a case for allowing for the possibility of an indictable prosecution.  I would be happy if the Minister brought forward a proposal on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the House wishes that I should move in that direction and I will be happy to do so on Report Stage.  Deputy Gilmore referred to the criminality attached to some aspects of these issues but I would rather that we would think of them as more socially irresponsible as opposed to socially criminal.  It is possible that a person might not have the means to address a <Col N="2097" /> dereliction.  It is not a crime if a person does not have the money to do such work. On the other side of the coin, I should like to ask the House to remember that if a property is worth a couple of million pounds, a 3 per cent levy on that type of property is a fairly hefty sum and a fairly hefty incentive to a developer to get on with the work and spare his cash.  Taking both matters into account I would rather go the line I am proposing.  If the House feels something indictable should be put in regard to a prosecution, then I am happy to put it in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`a classification' means a classification of a video work by the Official Censor under section 4 of this Act;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>All the 14 amendments in this group in the Minister's name relate to or are consequential on the proposals for classification of video works and are interrelated. Therefore it would be convenient to discuss them all together.  I would say at the outset that the substance of the proposed changes is in amendment No. 6.  All other amendments I mentioned can be regarded as consequential.</P>
      <P>We had a full discussion on Committee Stage as to whether the Bill should be amended so as to provide for classification of video works and, if so, in what form.  A number of proposals were put forward and discussed.  Having listened to the arguments the then Minister undertook to consider the desirability of putting forward proposals on Report Stage for a system of clarification for guidance by way of providing information as to the suitability of video works for viewing by people of particular ages.  The matter has been fully considered in the meantime, taking account of what I understand to be the general feeling of the House.  This group of amendments is being put forward for consideration to meet the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the main part of the scheme is contained in amendment No. 6.  This provides for the inclusion in the Bill of a new section 4 under which the censor, when granting a supply certificate for a video work, will give the work one of <Col N="2103" /> four classifications and will indicate in the supply certificate what classification he has given.  The four classes will be those set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>The highest classification will be given to video works fit for viewing by persons generally, that is in paragraph (a).  The second highest category will be works fit for viewing by persons generally but in the case of children under 12, only in the company of a responsible adult, that is in paragraph (b).  This classification will serve as a warning to parents, for example, of the possible need to examine the work in question before allowing young children to view it, especially if a child is particularly sensitive.  Depending on the possible effect of the work on the child, the parent or other responsible adult might decide not to allow the child to view the work at all or might think it necessary to stop the playing of the recording or to give reassurance to the child.  The next lowest classification will be for viewing by persons aged 15 or over and the lowest will be fit for viewing by persons aged 18 or over.  There will of course be video works which will not be given any classification and the supply of these will be prohibited.  There is provision for that in the Bill already and the amendments I am proposing now do not make any change in that area.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 4 provides that the censor shall not give a lower classification than fit for general viewing without having examined a video recording containing the video work concerned although he will be able to give a higher classification without necessarily having examined the work.  This provision is in line with section 3 (1) of the Bill under which the censor will be able to grant a supply certificate for a video work without necessarily having examined it because in many cases he will be able to judge from the title, his knowledge of the producer or otherwise, that the work is not objectionable.  On the other hand, the censor's power under section 6 to make a prohibition order will depend on his having examined the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> Subsection (3) will enable the censor to upgrade the classification of a video work if he decides, as a result of representations or of second thoughts of his own, that the classification is too low. In that event, he will revoke the supply certificate and grant another supply certificate showing the higher classification. The censor will not be able to substitute a lower classification.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) will enable the Minister for Justice to make regulations altering the classes specified in subsection (1) if experience shows that alterations are desirable.  Any regulations under subsection (4) will have to be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should, however, point out that the Minister will not be empowered to make regulations providing for a classification for viewing by persons aged more than 18 years.  In addition, the general provision in section 31 under which regulations can be annulled by resolution within 21 days does not apply in the case of regulations changing the classification system.  In such cases a positive resolution will be required.  All other amendments in this group consist essentially of provisions to supplement the existing provisions of the Bill so as to make them apply to classifications of video works or are consequential to the new section 4.  I can refer to them briefly.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 defines classification. Amendment No. 10 relates to section 6 (2) of the Bill.  In its present form, section 6 (2) provides that if the censor revokes a prohibition order a supply certificate is deemed to be granted in respect of the video work in question. This provision would not enable the censor to give a classification in respect of the work, so the amendment provides instead that the censor shall grant a supply certificate in which he will give the appropriate classification under the new section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11, 12, and 13 adapt the provisions of section 9 of the Bill to appeals to the Censorship of Film Appeals Board against prohibition orders to enable persons to appeal against the classification given by the censor.  An <Col N="2105" /> appeal will lie only for the purposes of obtaining a higher classification.  The appeals board will be able to affirm the censor's classification or to direct that the video work should be given the higher classification sought by the appellant or an intermediate classification.  If the appeal is successful, the censor will grant another supply certificate giving the classification specified by the appeals board.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 makes a minor addition to section 11 which relates to the labelling of video recordings.  That section enables the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for the labelling of the spool or other thing on which the video recording is kept.  The section makes it an offence to supply a recording or a spool, etc. that is not in compliance with requirements in the regulations as to labelling.  Under the section as it stands, the Minister will be able to include in the regulations a requirement that the label should show the classification of the video work.  Amendment No. 15 ensures that if for some reason the label indicates a lower classification than the correct one, this will not amount to non-compliance of the regulations.  For example, if the censor should give a higher classification than the one in force when the label was affixed it will not be necessary to change the label.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 relate to section 12 which makes it an offence to supply a video recording containing a video work which has no supply certificate if the recording or the spool contains an indication that a supply certificate is in force in respect of it. Amendment No. 16 extends the offence to supplying a recording with a false indication that the classification of the video work in question is higher than what it is in fact.  Amendment No. 17 makes it a defence that the supplier believed on reasonable grounds that the classification indicated was the correct classification or a higher one.  Amendment No. 18 is consequential.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 relate to the provisions of sections 13, 14 and 22 which enable the terms of a supply certificate, including the classification <Col N="2106" /> given in it, a prohibition order or a licence, as the case may be, to be proved in legal proceedings by a certificate of the official censor.  The amendments provide for a copy of the supply certificate, prohibition order or licence in question to be attached to the censor's certificate given under the relevant sections mentioned above.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential on subsection (4) (b) of the new section 4, to be inserted by amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely delighted that the Government have had a change of heart on the question of a classification system.  During the earlier Stages of the Bill in the Seanad and on Second and Committee Stages, the strongest efforts were made by Fine Gael, Labour and The Workers' Party to get the Government to agree to include a provision for classification of video works.  It reinforces my belief in the democratic process when I see that the Government are prepared to bring in amendments.  They have succumbed to the very logical arguments produced by my colleagues in Fine Gael and in other parties.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the approach now adopted by the Government will improve the Bill considerably.  Perhaps it is somewhat unfortunate that the new provisions with regard to classification were not introduced on Committee Stage because on Report Stage we do not have the opportunity to tease out the small print of the latest amendments.  Having said that, however, my reaction is to welcome the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a few points which I hope the Minister will deal with in his reply.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, when resisting the arguments in favour of classification on Second Stage went so far as to say that he was satisfied classification would not be effective.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Lyons, to confirm that he is satisfied that the approach he has adopted will be effective.  Furthermore, the former Minister, Deputy Collins, said on Second Stage that the inclusion of a classification system would be expensive.  He quoted a figure of £1 million as being the sum <Col N="2108" /> necessary at that time to cover the cost of the classification system in the UK.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister here today that the introduction of a classification system will not involve a charge on the taxpayer and that the approach adopted at the beginning that the provisions of the Bill would be self financing will apply now that we have included the classification procedure.</P>
    <P>I see from the approach adopted that the classification procedure is very similar to what obtains in the cinema where there are four classifications: universal which means a work is fit for general viewing; parental guidance class; fit for viewing by persons aged 15 years or more, and, lastly, fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more.  I believe this is the right approach.  Indeed we have been pressing the Minister to adopt such an approach and I would ask him to confirm that he accepts our view that this will be an effective approach.</P>
    <P>I endorse the Minister's views on the responsibility of parents.  Obviously the extent of the control is at the point of sale or at the point of hire and what happens in the household cannot be legislated for. In that instance, we must rely on parents to ensure that younger children in the household will not be able to view material which is unsuitable for them. However, I believe that we have discharged our duty in providing guidance to parents initially.  I know from experience with my young family that it will be an enormous help to have a classification system.  It will also provide an element of control at the point of sale or of hire.</P>
    <P>There is a number of amendments tabled relating to classification.  Generally we agree with the new approach adopted by the Government.  However, I wish to raise some points before I conclude.  I have been pressing for legislation to outlaw video nasties and pornographic films and to provide general control on the sale and hire of videos. This Bill has been before the Oireachtas on many occasions and my main concern is to see it enacted into law without further delay.  Having said that, I accept there are still some concerns about the <Col N="2109" /> effectiveness of the Bill.  The Minister has come a long way towards meeting us on the question of classification.  I would like to make a firm suggestion, which is in the interest of all of us who are anxious to ensure that we have effective legislation, that the Minister gives a firm and solid commitment that Government will review the operations of the Bill after a period of two years, so that amending legislation can, if necessary, be introduced after such a review to plug any loophole that may become evident during its operation.  The Bill has been before the Dáil and Seanad on many occasions and there is a great desire not only on my part but on the part of my people to let it out of the stable at this stage.  However, because of the complex nature of the legislation and also incidentally because of another issue on copyright, which I will deal with later, there is a need for a commitment that the operations of the Bill will be reviewed after a couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This sequence of amendments tabled by the Minister introduces a classification system, but it is on a voluntary basis.  The intent is that the classification system will operate as a basis of guidance for the retail outlets of these videos.  This is certainly an improvement on the previous position which pertained under the Bill but in our view it does not go far enough.  This was argued at the earlier stages.  It is not going to be very effective in keeping video nasties away from young people when the classification is such that it will still be open to a supplier to hand out even to young children a video nasty which has been certified as suitable for adults only.  We take the view that there should have been a binding system under which it would not be open to a supplier to hand out an adult video to a ten year old child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that there would be difficulties in enforcing rules along these lines and that there could be subterfuge used and so on.  That is true, but that is true in every form of human activity, in every form of criminal activity, in civil activity and so on.  While we were about <Col N="2110" /> it we should at least have made a more definite attempt to control the situation. If the Minister leaves the Bill as it is at present, a ten year old child will be able to hire an adult movie.  There would be no basis for refusal as the supplier would be quite anxious to do business.</P>
    <P>The effects of classification on a voluntary basis will be limited although useful, I suppose, for parents or guardians going to get a movie for a child.  In such circumstances it would be helpful to have guidance from the voluntary classification system and this meets that situation, but that is not the pressing objective of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The pressing objective of the Bill is to control, or at least attempt to control in some circumstances, the ready availability of the material to young people. One would hope that the majority of parents and guardians getting videos for their children would take care and make sure it has a classification certificate.  That being so, the need really was not to provide for the parent or guardian going to get a video for their child but rather to try to bring in a measure of control against the too free circulation of these video nasties.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of standards the censor is likely to apply in fixing these classifications.  I imagine the lowest classification would be those available for 18 plus.  I think there would be some very strong material permitted on the shelves under that classification.  With the classification, there might not be any restriction on the rights of the supplier to sell and some very young people may ask to be shown the videos with the lowest classification, and they will be already there identified for them.  It is a widespread problem and the matter has been discussed in and out of Dáil committees for a very long time.</P>
    <P>A Dáil committee was set up some years back and presented a report &mdash; the Tenth Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. They brought in an excellent report on the subject of video nasties.  I was a member of that committee and it was chaired by the present Minister for Social <Col N="2111" /> Welfare, Deputy Woods.  They examined the various alternative classification systems and eventually came down firmly with the recommendation that there should be a mandatory system of classification which would prohibit leasing a certain category of video to anyone other than a person who came within that particular category.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we go to the trouble of setting up these special committees, summoning witnesses to appear before them, taking up the time of many Deputies and Senators attending these meetings over many months considering in detail the ins and outs, the pluses and minuses of these recommendations, and eventually coming up with a report only to find it summarily thrown to one side and some new idea concocted, goodness knows in what backroom, but certainly not taking into account the opinion of Deputies on all sides of the House.  This was an all-party committee.  I cannot recall whether this provision was unanimous, but my recollection is that it was.  Surely the input and determination after very long and lengthy consideration by an all-party committee when they come up with a unanimous recommendation should be given more careful and serious consideration than has been done here.</P>
    <P>The way the committee recommended the matter be dealt with was excellent. At paragraph 8 they recommended that the controlling authority to deal with censorship and classification should be a special video censorship authority, not the censor.  That certainly would have a lot to recommend it.  The censor is one person or a group of persons &mdash; I am not quite sure how this operates but it is not what one might call any kind of democratic institution.  I am sure the censor does his or her best, as do the censorship board, but when one is dealing with videos I would have thought &mdash; and I agree with the report of the select committee &mdash; it would have been better to have set up an authority which would have consisted, as they say in paragraph 8 (5), of representatives of various organisations, including the video industry <Col N="2112" /> itself, both at distribution level and at retail level, community groups and elected representatives.  The authority, they said, should have a number of women members with, possibly, representatives from the Council for the Status of Women.  As we know, women are very frequently portrayed as the objects of violence and sexual abuse, and it would be essential that there be a strong female presence on the authority.  Such an authority would be like a breath of fresh air in the censorship process and would bring everything into the open instead of as is the case now, being behind closed doors, staffed by people who are not in any way answerable to the public and, for all we know, do not have any direct contact with the mores of the day.</P>
    <P>That was an excellent suggestion and it is to be deeply regretted that the line of least resistence, as always, has been taken on this occasion and the matter is simply handed over to the film censor to deal with videos in the same way as films. When the select committee recommended that there should be a compulsory method of classification I do not know why that could not have been taken up and accepted by the Minister.  I deeply regret that.  I take the view that while what we are doing here today is helpful to some small extent, it does not really meet the needs of the situation.  There is a great need to protect young people from the effects of witnessing the kinds of scenes that are portrayed on these video nasties.</P>
    <P>When bringing in this Bill we should have set up an effective, forceful, legal means of providing better protection for our young people.  What have we done?  We have brought in a guidance, an indicator, a pointer for them, making it easier for the ten, 12 and 14 year olds to identify from the classifications what they are looking at.  All they have to do is go to that section of the shop in which they are interested.  I can see what the position is going to be.  The video shops will be divided up not according to the categories of film but according to the categories of classification.  There will be <Col N="2113" /> a section for children and a section for adults.  People will go to the section already earmarked for them and that will be perfectly legal, perfectly in order, there will be no problem.  The supplier will sell or rent out the videos as he will be perfectly entitled to do notwithstanding the Minister's Bill.  It is a great pity if, after all these years we are going to do the job, we do not do it properly and set about providing that degree of protection for young people which the elected representatives in this House would wish them to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor regarding the failure of the Minister to take on the views he expressed on Committee Stage and here on Report Stage the requests and views expressed on Committee Stage by all sides of the Opposition that the regime at the supply stage would have to be much more coercive than that being suggested in the legislation.  The idea that the scheme of classification being introduced would be one of mere advice or guidance is simply not sufficient, if anything it may well have the opposite effect in giving clear headlines to those who want to seek out the more salubrious.  The more undesirable of the videos in the classifications will have a ready reference or reckoner in the scale of things suggested by the Minister in the amendment he is now putting forward.  I suppose we made some progress by getting a scheme of classification on board.  This amendment will not achieve anything that the Minister suggested it might achieve.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has agreed to the formula that any amendment or regulations to be introduced under this scheme would be a matter for the agreement of this House in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for me to repeat what has been said by previous speakers on this side of the House about our welcome for the change of mind on the part of the Minister in introducing the classification provision.  We regret that he has not gone further by way of penalty.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="2114" /> if he can assure the House and the people who are very interested in this Bill that these new classifications will be appended to the spool, the case or the container in which these videos are handed across the counter or sold to the general public.</P>
      <P>The purpose of classification has an added dimension in that it affords an opportunity to parents and to others who have authority over younger people to at least look at the spool or the container in which these videos come and decide if the video is generally suitable for viewing by the audience which will be looking at it be they children of different age groups or whatever.  This puts some responsibility, not simply on the retailer or the person who sells to the trade videos that we would regard as dangerous for young people, but on parents, when videos are brought into their house or whatever.  It is an opportunity for them to become responsible for what their children see. In many instances parents will do this but it will be a great help to them to know that the various classifications for which the censor feels the film or video is suitable is shown to them.  Then, any doubt they may have as to whether a film is suitable can be readily investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the response of Members.  I should like to say at the beginning that, of course, we are honouring a commitment given during the earlier debate that we were prepared to listen to all suggestions emanating from those debates.  During the various discussions on Second Stage and Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that he was willing to listen to all arguments for improving the Bill.  This was made abundantly clear when he introduced amendments in the Seanad having listened to arguments there for licensing of suppliers and similarly by amendments which he introduced in this House on Committee Stage.  The introduction of classification will not result in any charges to the taxpayer. That question was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  It will, of course, be more expensive but all the extra cost will be met by charges and levies imposed under the Bill.  Deputy O'Keeffe also <Col N="2115" /> raised a point about reviewing the legislation. This legislation, like all other legislation emanating from the Oireachtas, is constantly kept under review.  If it is found to be defective in any way or if it needs to be altered to take account of situations that might arise, amending legislation will be considered.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised by Deputies about adult films and their availability to young people.  My view is that this legislation, and Deputies have indicated this by their interest in the debate that has taken place, has brought the whole area of video recordings into focus.  We appeal to everybody concerned, from the supplier to the licence holder as well as parents, for their co-operation in the implementation of this legislation.  An indication that a responsible attitude is being adopted is that the Irish Videogram Association have already made a start in this area.  They are very anxious that high standards should apply in their business and they are asking all suppliers to raise standards by, for instance, not giving adult films to children.  A point that would concern all of us is that films not suitable for children should not come into their hands.  We should place on record our desire that everybody should co-operate and ensure that the whole thrust of the Bill will be followed through particularly in that respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised a question about classification.  The classification of each video will be clearly identifiable and marked on the outside cover of the video.</P>
      <P>Video nasties are causing much concern. They will not get a certificate.  They are not the same as adult films.  There is a difference and it is up to parents to ensure that their children do not view adult films which are not suitable.  The fact that they are suitable for adults only will be clearly marked on the label.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a point raised by Deputy Kavanagh regarding the exhibition of the classification certificate on the cassette cover. Surely the Minister is aware that the outside case of the cassette when exhibited <Col N="2116" /> in the shop is different from the cover supplied to the consumer.  The retail outlets have their own blank covers.  Is the Minister satisfied that the amendment will cover the blank cassette?  One can see on display in a video shop a particular classification but when a consumer leaves the shop it is covered by a blank cassette cover on which there is no classification certificate.  Is the Minister satisfied that all eventualities are being covered?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `pornographic' means material which&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  is sexually explicit,</P>
      <P>(ii)  depicts women as enjoying or deserving some form of physical abuse, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  regards women only as objects of man's lust and desire, </P>
      <P>but does not include&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  erotica i.e. sexually explicit material premised on equality, or <Col N="2118" /> (v)  bona fide sex education material or medical or forensic literature.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This is a last attempt to make some material changes in the Bill and to deal with the problem of video nasties and films which are regarded as unsuitable for young people.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Justice, speaking in the Seanad on 4 November 1987, tried to give a definition of the video films which would be considered in the Bill.  In column 1205 of the Official Report in the Second Stage debate he said:</P>
    <P>There are some video films available, however, that are thoroughly objectionable.  They depict extreme and graphic violence or uninhibited pornography.  The extremely violent films have attracted the name &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo;.  They depict the most stomach-turning and ghastly violence. The pornographic ones depict sex in a totally objectionable manner. </P>
    <P>The Minister made an attempt to describe what he intended dealing with in the Bill and he mentioned pornography. He also said in column 1206:</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the pornographic films are totally objectionable in what they portray. Anybody who has not seen these films cannot imagine the depths of degradation to which they stoop.  Much of the material could only be described as degrading of human nature generally but all of it is degrading and offensive as far as women are concerned. </P>
    <P>The Minister clearly wanted to deal with pornography as it related to video films. In column 1211 he went on to say:</P>
    <P>The major argument in favour of confining the prohibition of pornographic films to those over 18 years is that adults should be free to decide what they wish to see unless it is clearly harmful.  Pornography can be distinguished in this regard from extremely violent video films... <Col N="2119" /> Accordingly, should video film legislation not provide for a total ban on the supply of pornographic films it would be out of line with existing censorship legislation... </P>
    <P>We can see that the Minister intended to ban pornography.  He went on to say in column 1212:</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I have no hesitation in including pornography in the Bill and in dealing with it by way of a total prohibition on supply.  I am satisfied that that is the proper course and is in accordance with current informed thinking on the topic. </P>
    <P>One would have expected in dealing with this Bill that we would first have seen an attempt at defining pornography and that the Bill would deal with pornography as it related to video films.</P>
    <P>There is indeed a glaring omission in the Bill in regard to what the former Minister for Justice promised in the Seanad in relation to including the banning of pornographic material as portrayed in video films.  I ask the Minister and the House to accept a definition of pornography as set down in my amendment. It is an attempt to explain pornography although I know that other Members will expand on the subject.  If the Minister wishes to define it, we will accept a verbal amendment if he feels that my definition is inadequate.  I regard material as pornographic if it is sexually explicit, depicts women as enjoying or deserving some form of physical abuse or regards women only as objects of man's lust and desire.  However, the definition should not include erotica, that is, sexually explicit material premised on equality. I do not say that that sort of video film should be shown to all categories but we now have classification and this would probably be adult material.  Nevertheless, I do not wish to mix pornographic and erotic material.  I am prepared to listen to other Members in this regard and maybe they will define it more clearly for the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing that bona fide sex <Col N="2120" /> education material or medical or forensic literature should not be included in the definition of &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo;.  That should never be defined as pornographic. If the definition in amendment No. 1 is accepted by the Minister then obviously it must be inserted in the relevant part of the Bill.  My amendment No. 5 proposes to insert, in page 6, between lines 13 and 14: &ldquo;or (c) it is pornographic&rdquo;.  It would require to be inserted again on page 8, between lines 6 and 7 which deals with the Official Censor.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of films about which we are talking are described as pornographic material.  We all know that they depict women as being the objects of sexual abuse, harassment and so on. The Members of this House, certainly all of the women to whom I spoke, who were aware that this Bill was to be debated, wanted to see this change made.  Indeed in saying that I would include most of the male population as well.  This amendment has merit.  I believe that the Minister indicated to the Seanad and to the country at large that he would include this definition which has been a glaring omission to date.  I hope the Minister and the House will accept it.</P>

      <P>From reading the earlier debates on this Bill it seems clear to me that it was the view of both Houses that there be a prohibition on pornographic videos.  I want to compliment Deputy Kavanagh on his gallant attempt to define exactly what is &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. It is my belief that it is the view of the vast majority of Members of both Houses and indeed of the people generally that pornographic videos should not be on sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the change in <Col N="2121" /> outlook there has been on this issue, not just here but in other countries.  For example, I understand that there was a commission in the United States which examined the question of pornography around the year 1970 whose report was to the effect that pornography was not deemed to be harmful.  In 1986 the US Attorney General carried out a further investigation.  At that stage a different conclusion was reached, which was that pornography was harmful to viewers. That reinforces the case for the inclusion of a prohibition on pornography.  Deputy Kavanagh made a gallant attempt to define something which is very difficult.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Barnes, tells me she has an alternative. There are two possible aspects to this amendment.  The first is the principle as to whether the Minister will accept &mdash; as I understood the former Minister for Justice had agreed to accept &mdash; a prohibition on pornographic videos.  That would open the door to other views as to how exactly it might be defined.  Looking at Deputy Kavanagh's definition I suppose questions could be raised.  One could say: is something that is sexually explicit pornographic?  I predict there would be some divided views on that.  On the other hand, if one had something that was sexually explicit in a perverted way, that clearly would be regarded as pornographic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of my party I urge the Minister to accept the principle of the amendment. If that is accepted the House will agree that there should be a ban on pornographic videos.  If the Minister has difficulties with the definition, as proposed by Deputy Kavanagh, he can still listen to what our colleagues in the House have to say.  We would all be prepared to agree any reasonable amendment that might be produced by the Minister if he can demonstrate that it is a better definition <Col N="2122" /> of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; than the one now before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome amendment No. 2 and supporting amendments. I do not believe the Minister could not accept the need for this amendment. I particularly welcome the fact that male Members of this House are making this case as strongly as women.  It is something that affects women principally but also affects men with regard to their perception of women as being equal or to enabling them, in turn, to establish real, lasting relationships with adult women, which becomes very difficult if males have become addicted to pornography.</P>
      <P>The British Campaign Against Pornography and Censorship &mdash; whose definition has been accepted here by the Irish campaign against pornography and censorship defines &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; as:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the graphic, sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words, that also includes one or more of the following: women portrayed as sexual objects, things or commodities, enjoying pain or humiliation or rape, being tied up, cut up, mutilated, bruised or physically hurt, in postures of sexual submission or servility or display, reduced to body parts, penetrated by objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture, shown as inferior, bleeding, bruised or hurt in a context which is sexual.  Pornography does not include erotica (defined as sexually explicit materials premised on equality) and it does not include bona fide sex education materials, or medical or forensic literature.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; as I have read it into the record can be said to be anything that depicts the sexual objectification and/or subordination of women, often including violation and violence.  Some people may have been shocked at some of the more graphic detail in my reading of the longer definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;.  But it is important that we spell it out because as many people can now testify these video nasties <Col N="2123" /> and pornographic videos are freely available and introduced into this country through customs.</P>
    <P>If we allowed this Bill be passed without making this point, without including a specific definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; particularly as it affects women and indeed children &mdash; which constitutes an extended violation and violence &mdash; we would be failing completely in our duty to highlight the most dangerous elements in the whole area of video recording.</P>
    <P>People who believe in free speech, free expression wish very definitely to illustrate the difference between healthy sex and erotica, the latter typifying the violation and vilification of women contained in such videos.  Not alone has it been proved that there is a link between violence and perversion against women through an addiction to these pornographic videos, but it has also been shown that these videos can be incredibly damaging to men in so far as they get addicted to harder pornography.  Some men have given evidence that only the real thing of violating and even killing women, can satisfy them.  It has also been proved conclusively that men who view videos which depict women in this degrading way fail to establish any lasting relationship with women.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kavanagh and others have said, men and women outside this House have expressly asked that this provision be included in the Bill.  In view of the evidence of the research and the damage which has been done I cannot envisage the Minister not accepting this amendment. The elimination and censorship of such pornography is essential to the creation of genuine equality between men and women, something to which every party in this House are committed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh's amendment raises the perennial problem of where the dividing line is between erotica and pornography.  We all have our views as to where that is.  As I said in the earlier part of this debate, one person's erotica can well be another's pornography and there are people in our <Col N="2124" /> society who will try to prevent the display of a naked body in any form, whether it be on videos or in photographs.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in relation to this item is that we are talking about videos which are for private viewing.  Generally videos are not for public display.  They are generally viewed by people in the privacy of their homes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>I know videos are shown in some public houses but by and large people will generally view videos in the privacy of their homes.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, this Bill attempts to ensure that videos do not incite people to commit crime of any kind, for example, robbery and rape.  I would have difficulty with Deputy Kavanagh's definition of pornography because it leaves the door open to very wide ranging restrictions of how pornography can be defined.  We may well end up with a very narrow and restricted application by the censor.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's definition has not been put down to be debated here.

      <P>That is one suggestion we might grab with both hands because it gets us off the horn of the dilemma.  However, as Deputy Taylor said, it would be a bad precedent.  We leave far too much legislation for definition by our courts and we have seen in recent days where the courts are far ahead of us in terms of legislation and defining legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> This is a difficult question.  Deputy Kavanagh's definition is too wide ranging. Deputy Barnes' definition is more acceptable but we do not have it before us.  As we are on Report Stage I do not know what the Minister can do in terms of dealing with this problem.  Perhaps he will indicate what his proposal is on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I do not want to repeat what has been said by the previous speakers.  The first choice the House has is to do nothing and to have no reference to pornography in the Bill.  Our second choice is to adopt the definition submitted by Deputy Kavanagh. If we decide that we want some stab at the definition of what is undoubtedly a complex and difficult issue, we have the choice of Deputy Kavanagh's definition or none at all.  It was open to any Member or party if they thought they had a better definition, to submit an amendment incorporating it and to give the House a wide ranging choice as to what might be appropriate, or to have submitted an amendment to Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.  However, no Member was of a mind to do that, so if we are to have a definition it has to be Deputy Kavanagh's.</P>
      <P>The option mooted with no great enthusiasm by Deputy De Rossa&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>You mooted it but, as I said, with no great enthusiasm.  To leave the matter to the courts would be the worst option of all.  We cannot hand over a vital issue like that to the courts.  As legislators it is our responsibility to try to give at least broad guidelines as to what exactly we want the courts to enforce.  I am not saying Deputy Kavanagh's definition is perfect, and I am sure each <Col N="2126" /> of us has our own views as to what should come within the ambit of pornography and what should not.</P>
      <P>I want to refer again to the point I made on the previous amendment about the unsatisfactory nature of having the decision rest in the hands of the censor. As I said then &mdash; and it is as apt in regard to this section as to the previous section &mdash; it would have been much better to have had a larger board who would have determined the admissibility of videos under a particular category.  The members of this board would be made up of people representing the industry, community groups, elected representatives and women.  Women in particular would be an integral part of any board who would have to look at these videos. I do not know whether any women are involved in the censorship process, but I suspect they are not and it would have been better to be up front and to have given women through such an authority a complete and direct involvement in the issue in which they are primarily concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which dealt with the control of video nasties.  They produced an excellent document and it is a pity that more attention was not paid to it.  The committee referred to one of the submissions made to them by CASE &mdash; Campaign Against Sexual Exploitation &mdash; a group affiliated to the Council for the Status of Women.  It was their view that the specific reference to pornography in the Bill was essential and they explained at some length why they considered that to be so.  They pointed out that pornography was essentially the sexual exploitation of women and, increasingly, of children.  It was their view that its effects are experienced by everyone in the society in which it is available and that men, although they are the consumers of pornography, are also its victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee accepted their recommendation and indicated in paragraph 8.8 of their report that videos which displayed unrestrained sexual abuse <Col N="2127" /> should be banned altogether.  The Minister has not gone down that road in the Bill but he has an opportunity now, by accepting Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, to remedy it and highlight the need which exists and which was examined in great detail by the select committee to ban such videos.  We regard this as a matter of critical importance to the Bill and we hope the Minister will see his way to accept Deputy Kavanagh's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view that an amendment of this nature should be included in the Bill.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; between subsections (i) and (ii) would sort out the problem.  If the section referred to videos that were sexually explicit and depicted women as enjoying physical abuse it would be better because of the danger of a possible misinterpretation. The danger is that it will be taken that the section is against videos that are sexually explicit which clearly is not the case.  It is essential, if the Bill is to deal effectively with one of the major areas of concern and abuse, that it should include such a provision.  Such videos have a deeply corrosive effect on our society leading to problems of a deep nature.  There is increasing evidence of the consequences of such videos in the behaviour of men in particular.  Without an amendment of this type the provisions in the Bill would be seriously inadequate. The Minister should include such an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effort by Deputy Kavanagh, and the Labour Party, in addressing the issue of some prohibition on pornography is to be welcomed.  I do not think Members will be anxious that legislation should endorse or be seen by default to endorse the promulgation of pornographic material.  The problem is exemplified when one addresses the difficulty of trying to identify what is pornographic and to define it for the purpose of legislation.  Deputies Kavanagh and Taylor have accepted that the definition, which is the only one available to us to <Col N="2128" /> adjudicate on, is not 100 per cent workable. In this context one is reminded of an exhibition of paintings in the midlands two or three months ago.  One of a number of paintings was removed from the exhibition at the request of some local person of some standing.  I will not say, because I am not sure, that it was a cleric.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy from the midlands for correcting me.  The painting was removed because it showed the genitalia of a figure.  The artist, correctly, responded by taking all his paintings out of the exhibition.  Indeed, he was outraged at what had happened.  That is the problem we encounter when we try to define what is sexually explicit, when we try to establish what is sexuality premised on equality. We would equally have difficulties in the community trying to regulate views one way or another on what is bona fide sex education.  I am reminded of a film that was shown for quite a long time at a seedy cinema, as it was, in Dublin.  The film, called &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; with scenes of childbirth was presented as an education in sex.  In fact, every voyeur and raincoated gent who could be found in the city was in the back seats of the cinema taking far more than education out of the content of that movie.  That is the difficulty we are left with.</P>
      <P>It is virtually impossible to find a definition that will work.  We need a balance to try to do down the market of the pornographer and his or her wares on the one hand and, on the other hand, to respect the right to privacy of people to enjoy sex films or other material in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no criticism of the Labour Party who are attempting in their amendments to define the concept because difficulties will exist no matter what the definition is but we will have difficulty implementing and interpreting such a definition within the community.  I am terribly concerned that we do not give opportunities to the Mary Whitehouse syndrome, and those who exist in the midlands and elsewhere <Col N="2129" /> who are so quick to come to the fore whenever they get the opportunity to attack what is artistic on some spurious pornographic basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly clear that we have reached an impasse so far as Members on this side are anxious to include a provision outlawing pornographic material but we are not in a position to agree on that definition.  That is not surprising because it is difficult to define pornography.  I should like to ask the Minister to accept the principle of what has been said in the last 40 minutes. If he does we can go on to stage two and decide on a formula that will be acceptable to everybody.</P>
      <P>The Minister must agree that to allow the legislation go through without making a specific reference to pornographic material will be doing an injustice to the Bill.  Deputy Kavanagh, in introducing his amendment, said he was open to accept what might be considered a better definition.  I suggest that we roll subsections (1) and (2) together and state that &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; means material which is sexually explicit by depicting women as enjoying or deserving some form of physical abuse.  If Deputy Kavanagh is not open to that suggestion perhaps the Minister would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The criteria set down in sections 3 and 6 of the Bill were debated at considerable length on Committee Stage and careful consideration was given to the points made in the debate.  The then Minister indicated he was disposed to remove the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; from both sections, and there are amendments listed in this group, Nos. 4-8, to provide for this.  There are also other amendments in this group about which I would like to say a few words.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh has proposed amendment No. 2.  I would like to couple with that amendments Nos. 5 and 9 because, as he has said, they depend on one another, and these deal with pornographic material.  These amendments cannot be accepted.  Pornographic material is already covered by the wording of sections 3 and 6.  A work would be unfit for viewing because the viewing of it &ldquo;would tend by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it&rdquo;.  That would include pornographic material.  As regards exempting the word &ldquo;erotica&rdquo;, this would lead to unsuitable material getting into the hands of young people.</P>

      <P>It is a point that has been considered carefully but has been ruled out on the basis that once material is available it will become available to anybody and it will not be possible to restrict it to adults only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final point on Deputy Kavanagh's amendment No. 2 is that he wishes to provide for bona fide sex education material or forensic literature being exempted.  Video works of this type are already exempted under this Bill.  The types of work exempted are defined <Col N="2131" /> under &ldquo;exempted work&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Members are saying, that the discussion has broadened.  There is nothing wrong with that; that is what we are here for, but neither pornography nor erotica is mentioned in censorship legislation either here or in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The long established practice has been to refer to material which would tend to deprave or corrupt because it is obscene or indecent.  This definition includes material which is objectionable because of the way in which it depicts sexual matters, and it is the definition which our film censor uses at present.  By and large our cinema film censorship has been satisfactory.  The criteria used in the censorship of cinema films are included in the Bill.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Kavanagh in my view would change that.  Surely none of us would wish to make that sort of change.</P>

What is given by the Minister in section 3 of the Bill, that the viewing &ldquo;would tend, by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons...&rdquo; is a very narrow definition.  We wanted to include the definition of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; because it is what the Minister and the vast majority of the people wanted.  I am sorry I was not able to bring forward a proper definition of pornography, but could anybody in the House attempt to do so?  At least I attempted to make a version of it that does not appear to have met with general consensus.  It is a pity others did not try to improve it.  Particularly I would have thought the Minister would have done so.  He was the one who dealt with the topic over two years ago and made no attempt to include it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>At this stage if the Minister is shooting down the inclusion of this provision not simply because of the definition but because of the definition I have given, and if a verbal amendment cannot be introduced such as Deputy Barnes has suggested then my only course of action is to suggest withdrawing my No. 2. However, I intend to pursue amendments Nos. 5 and 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with on Committee Stage, but the debate was somewhat deflected by the then Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, on the understanding that the matter would be dealt with properly and fully in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, 1988, which was running contemporaneously. It is correct to say that the Bill, when it eventually came from the Seanad, addressed the issue of race, nationality, religion and gender satisfactorily but the question of sexual orientation was not addressed and was omitted altogether. We are not satisfied with the way in which this matter was addressed in the related Bill and we are now pressing for the inclusion of our amendments in the appropriate sections of the Bill before us so that a video recording that would be likely to stir up hatred on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, gender or sexual orientation would be provided for in sections 3 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment was addressed at length by Deputy De Rossa on Committee Stage.  The reasons and need for it are self-evident.  On Committee Stage there was general agreement, including agreement by the Minister of State dealing with the matter, that this was an area that should be addressed in legislation.  It was on the <Col N="2139" /> understanding that it would be addressed in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill that we did not pursue the matter then. That is the reason it is now tabled on Report Stage.  I commend these amendments to the House on the basis that they are self-evident and reasonable in a modern caring society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan has made a reasonable case for the inclusion of this provision.  It is very difficult to make a case against its inclusion. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in this regard.  Surely, as suggested by Deputy McCartan, it is quite proper that we should be in a position to prohibit videos which would be likely to stir up hatred against the groups referred to by Deputy McCartan. There is a valid case and I support Deputy McCartan's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also support the amendments tabled by Deputy McCartan.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.  It is a fact that there is an abuse of the medium of video recordings for purposes other than the excessively violent scenes for which they are primarily known.  Another category which is no less objectionable glorifies Fascist type activity and uses that medium for the purpose of building up hatred against people of a particular nationality, religion or sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>Video is a very powerful medium.  It is cheap, accessible, easily copied, widely circulated.  The degree of influence which can be exercised through that medium should not or ought not be under-estimated. We are dealing with controls at the point of sale or hire of videos and it behoves us to deal with all aspects of the problem and particularly with the aspect highlighted in Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will probably be many a long year before this House has the opportunity to deal with this subject in legislation.  This is the last opportunity the Minister will <Col N="2140" /> have for a very long time to tackle this problem.  Videos glorifying Nazism and all that it stood for in all sorts of ways are available.  This is the sort of thing that the amendment seeks to address and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.  Surely he must know from his inquiries that such videos exist.  Do not tell me &mdash; if I may address the Minister through the Chair &mdash; that the matter will be dealt with by the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to tell you that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought so.  I am asking you not to so tell me because that is an unacceptable and incorrect argument. We are talking about a specific medium, which is so important that it warrants a special Bill of the Oireachtas to deal with it.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill will not adequately cover the situation of videos.  As I have said, videos are a powerful medium that warrant their own Bill and it is entirely appropriate that the Minister takes on board and accepts the amendment or an agreed variant of it. I am sure Deputy McCartan would be prepared to consider any variant of it, if it would mean that we would make some progress on the issue.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to deal with the matter. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. He knows that the problem exists and that it is not covered adequately.  I am quite satisfied of that, having read and studied that Bill.  If we do not deal with the issue now we will have lost this opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this issue on Second Stage and on Committee Stage and on each occasion I was assured by the Minister and the Minister of State that the matter would be dealt with in the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious and National Hatred Bill and on occasions I deferred the amendments I was seeking to make to see whether that would be dealt with.  The Bill on incitement to racial hatred, etc., does include a reference to this area but there <Col N="2141" /> is a curious part in it, section 4 (3), which implies that if a person has a video or written material for their own use they may not be prosecuted for that possession. There seems to be a loophole in that with regard to the type of legislation we are proposing here.  Section 4 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>...and it is reasonable to assume that the material or recording was not intended for the personal use of the person, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been in possession of the material or recording in contravention of subsection (1). </P>
      <P>In other words, he would be regarded as having committed an offence if it was not for his own personal use.  That is the first point I want to make in relation to the need to have this amendment in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Incitement to racial, religious or national hatred does not include incitement to hatred on the basis of sexual orientation.  Indeed, the curious part about this is that in the Seanad when the Video Bill was going through, rather than accept an amendment to include sexual orientation as incitement to hatred, the Minister withdrew reference altogether to the question of incitement to hatred on the basis of nationality, religion and so on, again putting forward this reason that it would be in this Bill on national, religious and racial hatred.  So sexual orientation has disappeared from the debate in a sense, and I do not think it can be seriously argued that it is not a problem.</P>
      <P>Some years ago this House had occasion to have an emergency debate on the murder of a young man in Fairview, a young man who was murdered, it subsequently transpired, because of his sexual orientation.  This is a problem we tend not to take too seriously but studies have shown that while, by and large, we are a tolerant society there is an underlying intolerance for a variety of categories of people in our society, and these studies have been done by various reputable bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> We would not be doing our job properly if we allowed this Bill through without having a section in it which deals specifically with excluding certificates for the distribution of videos which would incite people to hatred on the basis of nationality, religion, gender or sexual orientation and I would strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  It will in no way reduce the value of the Bill and in my view will enhance the value of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 7 in the name of Deputy McCartan would change the existing subsection (1) (a) of sections 3 and 6 and generally I do not accept that the proposed wording is an improvement on the existing wording.  As regards the wording in so far as it relates to incitement to hatred, Deputies are aware that a Bill to prohibit incitement on grounds of race, religion and nationality is at present before this House.  The purpose of that Bill is to put on the Statute Book one of the measures necessary to enable this country to ratify the UN convention on civil and political rights.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill it will be an offence to distribute, show or play a recording of visual images or sounds that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or are likely to stir up hatred on the grounds specified.  Thus, the stirring up of racial, religious or national hatred by means of distribution, showing or playing of videos will be covered in the incitement legislation.  Incitement to hatred on any other ground or against any particular named group would be outside the scope of what the Minister is trying to achieve in the incitement Bill and I would regard a provision on incitement to hatred on any ground as being totally unnecessary in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have to acknowledge and be impressed by the arguments that have been made on this section and I will ask my colleague to favourably consider an amendment along the lines suggested in the Seanad debate, if that would satisfy Members.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 8, to delete &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed with amendment No. 2.  The two amendments in the Minister's name are Nos. 4 and 8. These two amendments remove the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;any obscene or indecent matter&rdquo; in section 3 (1) (a) (ii) and 6 (1) (a) (ii) relating to the grounds for refusing a supply certificate and the making of a prohibition order respectively. Some anxiety was expressed in the Committee Stage debate whether the inclusion of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; might imply that the inclusion in a video work of even the smallest piece of possibly obscene or indecent matter would be sufficient to cause the whole work to be banned.  The previous Minister promised to consider the matter.  This has been done and although I do not think that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; would have this effect, especially when the censor will, in any event, have to decide whether the video work is unfit for viewing nevertheless, I accept that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; might convey a misleading impression and, therefore, should be deleted.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, without delaying the House too much, this was an amendment which I and other Deputies sought on Committee Stage. The Minister at the time indicated that he would consider it.  Obviously, we are pleased that he has decided to delete the word.  It makes it far more likely that the <Col N="2145" /> censor can do his job in a more professional way and, indeed, in a broader way.  The fear with this Bill had been that the censor would be obliged to take too wide a view of what was excluded and that the net result would be that adults who are entitled, as free individuals, to view in the privacy of their home material which is reasonable would be prevented from doing so.  On that basis we welcome the Minister's proposal to delete the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>While we in the Labour Party accept the change which the Minister proposes in his amendment it in no way meets the requirements of the amendments which are in my name in relation to the problem we had earlier in defining &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; or &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. The Minister indicated that this section would be adequate to meet that definition but it does not change the Bill sufficiently for me and my colleagues in the Labour Party to accept it as a substitution for the attempt I had made earlier to put in a definition which would have had a totally different and more expanded meaning in this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(c)  it is pornographic.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I will be very brief, a Cheann Comhairle, and I thank you for allowing me to make a short contribution.  In my attempt to introduce this additional category, to the section dealing with pornography, as a separate issue and in taking on the previous Minister's idea that this Bill was going to deal with this topic, I felt it was necessary, in the definitions section, for the Minister to define &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. Because he had not done so I attempted, however inadequately, to do it but that did not meet with the favour of the Minister. I am sorry he did not take the opportunity which I offered him to endeavour to use his expertise and that of his Department to define &ldquo;pornography&rdquo; and to include it in the Bill.  The fact that he has not done so means that in pressing this amendment &mdash; which I intend to do &mdash; and if it is accepted by the House, it will obviously be within the compass of the censor to define it.  If there are objections to the censor it will go to the court for definition.  That is unsatisfactory but, nevertheless, it is necessary that we press this amendment.  It is a very basic topic that should have been included and I must press the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Emigration: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Barry on Tuesday, 7 November 1989:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, appalled by the level of emigration revealed by the recent CSO report, calls upon the Government (1) to take action to stem this haemorrhage (2) to make realistic funding available for advice and support services for our emigrants abroad and (3) to engage in purposeful diplomatic action to persuade the United States authorities to legislate in favour of our <i>out-of-status</i> young emigrants in the US, now numbering tens of thousands. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognises that emigration can best be overcome by the economic policies of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which have the objective of increasing self-sustaining employment through higher economic growth and endorses the efforts being made by the Government to have the position of the Irish <i>out-of-status</i> emigrants in the United States redressed and the measures taken to provide increased resources for support services to emigrants in Britain and the United States.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  Last night I reviewed our historical experience of emigration and the neglect of this subject in orthodox thinking.  I want to make a few points and the first one extends logically from what I said last night. Bleeding heart speeches about emigration and buckets of crocodile tears are of little value if the people who support conservative economic policy insist on dividing economic policy from the social problems of unemployment or emigration. The fundamental point I am making is that you have to put emigration in the context of the population pressure that produces it and the unemployment figures that feed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I spoke of the myth of voluntary migration; I said that most of it was involuntary.  The people who spoke so eloquently last night about those they found in London, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and New York will have a chance, when we are debating financial policy, to decide whether they want to put employment creation to a higher point on the economic agenda than it is at present.  This is the reality, it is an old technical problem.  It is rather like when the debate on the welfare state was taking place in Britain.  There were different models, some people wanted to give what the market would bear to the poor but others wanted the market to work out first and to give the crumbs which were left to alleviate poverty.  Of course, there was a great egalitarian tradition which <Col N="2151" /> said that social policy must not only compensate those who have been forced over the edge but that it must redistribute.</P>
    <P>Our economic policy &mdash; this economic mantra about which I spoke last night &mdash; as outlined in the Minister's speech, talked about the nation's finances coming under control and so on.  It is telling the emigrants and the unemployed that they must wait, yet no serious economist who studied the problem for even half an hour would agree that better export and trade figures, low inflation and lower interest rates, while providing a favourable climate, would solve the problem.  The linkages are missing for positive employment creation and the positive side is that we are in the process of destruction of direct employment creation.  That is why there has been a unique conservative consensus on all sides of the House that the State must not take the lead in providing jobs, that the semi-State bodies must be rolled back and that privatisation must be pushed along, often by stealth and by those who have no mandate from the people.</P>
    <P>I listened to lectures from chief executives of companies set up in the name of the people and they spoke of their bullish tendencies to go private.  They are the culprits in the exile of so many of our people.  By 1 January 1993 these people and their economic policies will be responsible for the exile of at least 200,000 people.  If we want to do anything about it we should have a genuine debate about changing the status of employment creation as an economic priority.  Dr. Kennedy, the director of the Economic and Social Research Institute, is unique in this regard because he said that he worries about this and I pay tribute to him.</P>
    <P>If so many of our people are forced to emigrate it is scandalous that the Minister for Education has not incorporated in the curriculum some preparation for a life often on the margins of society in London.  She said recently that she wanted religious studies to be an examination subject in the curriculum despite the fact that last summer she said she <Col N="2152" /> intended to introduce political and social studies which might create some kind of morality of citizenship which would tell the people at second level that there was a chance they would be unemployed and to prepare for it.  After all they have the second best chance in Europe of being unemployed, closely followed by the Portuguese. That should be a part of life preparation in the schools but of course it will mean puncturing the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>The agencies should be adequately funded.  There is a generation problem in relation to some of the agencies.  The figures I gave last night showed that there was enormous emigration to the United States in a particular period.  These people are now in some of the agencies and in voluntary organisations in the United States.  Their children are American citizens and they are in competition with the new wave of Irish emigrants competing for the same jobs.  I do not know how long all these visitors spend talking to emigrants but that is a reality. These agencies need to be made effective, extended to the west coast of the United States and properly and adequately funded.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, it is terribly important to bear in mind that the figures the Department get wrong are those in relation to Britain.  Having made that allegation last night, the onus is on me to give some substance to it.  The official figure in 1985 for emigration to Britain was 6,000.  The real figure &mdash; that projected from Professor Damien Hannon's work and others &mdash; was 25,000.  In the event the figure turned out to be over 20,000.  They are always wrong about the British figures because they refuse to recognise that kind of emigration.  If we are serious and take into account what is happening in relation to emigration to Britain, we should be conscious of the fact that there are 400,000 people unemployed in London, where a considerable number of people are homeless or living in guesthouses.  The Irish in London are calculated to be between 15 per cent and 18 per cent of those listed as homeless.</P>
    <P>Let us cut out the crap about the new kind of emigrant who will waddle off with <Col N="2153" /> a bundle of degrees and so forth.  Yes, it would be very valuable if they remained at home.  However, a large proportion of our migrants are still those vulnerable people.  One of the great changes between emigration in the eighties and in the fifties is this &mdash; that 1990 will be our year of scandal because, in that year, the largest number of Irish people will leave since the foundation of the State.  The previous worst year was 1955.  In 1955 those who went were from rural areas. To a large extent they went to work in the construction industry, now capitalised and much less labour-intensive. Those who are leaving now are more urban sourced than rural sourced.  If one looks at those who are in hostels the longest time in London, one finds that they carry the myth with them that they can go to a building site and get work. The building industry has changed; their myth that work is available has not changed.  That is why they are remaining longer than female emigrants.</P>
    <P>In the end all this means that if we are unwilling to change the structure of our policies, we must look at the quality of the emigrant experience more sensitively and carefully and we must give them greater assistance.  Perhaps we will also have to build it into the school system.</P>
    <P>I want to end with a very simple point, which is this.  After 20 years studying migration one inescapable fact is as clear to me now as when I started.  If one says we are putting human lives on the marketplace and we are going to let the level of investment and human beings find their level, we will always have enforced migration.  It would be very useful indeed if some brave person stood up and said: all these conservative economic policies have entirely failed us and we should go for something else.  There is even a middle position that could be adopted.  For example, in Austria they went for a slower rate of growth, sustained over a longer period of time which was more labour intensive.  The Finnish and other economic strategies were similar. What we witnessed in the last Dáil and are now in the 26th Dáil is the pathetic parity of imported, right wing, <Col N="2154" /> discredited ideas from the mouths of one Minister after another all beginning with the type of futile phrases with which I began.  People have learned those phrases by heart after two or three years, phrases such as: in these difficult economic times in which we find ourselves; when at last the nation's finances are being brought under control, and so on, as if there were some new confraternity of the right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The motion before the House this evening is one criticising the policy of the present Government and calling for certain action to be taken. While I have no difficulty in supporting any motion calling for improvement of the circumstances of our exiles this motion does nothing to address the real problem of emigration.  It does nothing to eliminate the disgrace of emigration nor to exonerate past and present policies of successive Governments who have hounded countless thousands of our young people from these shores.</P>
      <P>The horrific figures recently disclosed do not illustrate the heartbreak, hopelessness, frustration and anger felt and endured by these emigrants.  Those statistics hide a very human problem which previous Governments failed to remedy nor ever had the will to tackle.  The easy way of solving the emigration problem was the classic attitude of out of sight, out of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days we have seen on television and read in the newspapers of trainloads of refugees from behind the Iron Curtain leaving their country because they were denied their democratic rights.  We have witnessed boatloads of our people leave because they <Col N="2155" /> have been denied their moral rights, that is, the rights to live, work, rear their families and grow old in their native land.</P>
    <P>Listening to this debate one would have the impression that emigration started a few short years ago.  We are inclined to forget that it has been going on for nearly 150 years.  It was begun by an uncaring, ruthless British colonial administration who did not care what happened Irish people at that time.  Thousands of people from Munster left the port of Cork, were battened in the holds of filthy ships, with one hope, that being a new life in a new land, only to find themselves destined for the cruel depths of the North Atlantic.  While those savage acts were carried out by a brutal Government, what is incomprehensible is that emigration, with all its tragic side effects, has been allowed to continue by subsequent native Governments without any effort being made to provide a real solution by fully utilising our resources in providing worthwhile jobs for all our people.  Surely this country, with its resources, can provide for the few million of our population?</P>

      <P>We have heard the Minister outline Government policies for an upswing in our economy.  He presented the House with figures showing increased investment.  He said that employment trends and prospects are the most favourable for decades.  This is a repetition of the attitude of previous Ministers and Governments which will do nothing to lighten the burden, dispel the disillusionment or restore the faith of our young people forced to seek a living in New York, Boston, Birmingham and Camden Town.  What we are at present experiencing is an upsurge in our economy benefiting a select few, whose benefits have not trickled down to the people desperate in search of a job, the thousands of young people in their twenties who have never known what it is to work, <Col N="2156" /> whose only prospect is to seek a living abroad.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour and the Minister of State at the Department of Education spoke last night mainly on what I would call the domestic aspects of the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse and support the essential point put forward by my two colleagues. The only solution to involuntary emigration lies in achieving economic recovery and developing the economic strength of the country.  This, in turn will create the conditions for increased employment and real prosperity.  This has been the priority of Government since March 1987 and remarkable progress has been made.  I can assure the House that the present Government are committed to continuing the policy of building up the economic strength of the country, thereby addressing the root causes of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While tackling in an unprecedented manner the root causes of emigration, the Government have also recognised the need to deal with the difficulties which emigration creates for those concerned. We are very conscious of our responsibilities with regard to those who have gone abroad to gain a livelihood.  I believe that the Government's record in exercising those responsibilities is a positive one. It is my objective tonight to address this part of the question before us and to <Col N="2157" /> deal in particular with the United States dimension.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Labour, has spoken of the excellent work being done on behalf of Irish emigrants in Britain by the DÍON Committee, which is based in our London Embassy.  Earlier this year, in recognition of the importance of this work, the Government doubled the grant to DÍON to £500,000. This will enable DÍON to extend their activities and to support, to a greater extent than before, those dedicated groups concerned with the welfare of our emigrants in Britain.</P>
    <P>The problems facing our emigrants in the United States are of a different nature from those encountered in Britain.  The major problem in the United States relates to the legal status of a number of our emigrants and the need for support services is, in the main, for those who are out-of-status.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline the efforts this Government, and their immediate predecessor, have made, are making and will continue to make in the context of reform of US immigration legislation. From the start the Government identified this area as one warranting special attention on their part.  Within a week of the change of Government in March 1987, the Taoiseach visited Washington and had a series of lengthy and detailed talks with representatives of the administration, prominent Irish-American politicians and representatives of the main groups involved with newly arrived Irish immigrants.  The pace set by the Taoiseach has been maintained since then by another visit by him in the meantime, three visits by the Tánaiste and visits by several other Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>The result of this activity is, I believe, very well known to all in this House.  In May 1987 Congressman Donnelly introduced in the US House of Representatives a major new reform Bill aimed at lessening the adverse effects of the Immigration Act of 1965 which has proved to be a barrier to Irish people wishing to emigrate to the United States. This was followed by the introduction of <Col N="2158" /> a similar measure by Senator Edward Kennedy in the US Senate.  This latter Bill was passed by the US Senate in record time in March 1988.  However, progress in the House of Representatives on the corresponding measure was slower.</P>
    <P>At a time when it appeared likely that a Bill might not be passed before the end of the Congressional term in Autumn 1988, the Tánaiste visited Washington and discussed the situation with our friends in Congress.  This visit was in many ways a crucial one.  The House had before it a number of measures but the time available was not sufficient to take them all on board.  The Tánaiste lent his weight to a compromise proposal put forward by Congressman Donnelly and discussed it with Members of both Houses of Congress.  This proposal was adopted and was duly passed into law as the Immigration Amendment Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>This contained two provisions of great interest to Irish out-of-status immigrants at present in the US as well as to those who wished to go there.  In the first place, it extended the earlier NP-5 visa scheme, which for obvious reasons had been called the Donnelly visa scheme, for another two years &mdash; until the end of September 1990 &mdash; and tripled the total number of visas available under the scheme from the earlier 10,000 to 30,000.</P>
    <P>Ten thousand visas were made available under the initial Donnelly scheme over a two year period ending in September 1988.  More than 4,000 were allocated to Irish citizens.  A very significant proportion of these were living in the US in an out-of-status situation.  I am pleased to say that the Irish allocation was the largest gained by any one country.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the Immigration Amendment Act prolonged this very valuable scheme for a further two years, using the same pool of applicants.  The result has been an even greater success rate, from our point of view.  So far this year, over 10,000 visas have been granted to Irish citizens by the US Embassy in Dublin.  This represents over 60 per cent of the annual global total of 15,000.  Figures which would indicate how we might <Col N="2159" /> expect to fare under the fourth year of the scheme are not yet available.  However, if the figures are in any way comparable with those of this year, Irish immigrants or intending immigrants would have obtained over 50 per cent of the total visas issued under the scheme.  Irish people who have emigrated to the United States or regularised their immigration status under this scheme owe a very large debt of gratitude to Congressman Donnelly. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him, and indeed also to Senator Edward Kennedy, for their sterling efforts over several years in the interest of young Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Immigration Amendment Act, 1988, also contained provision for what became known subsequently as the Berman visa scheme.  This was a scheme which, unlike the Donnelly scheme, was open to applicants from most countries in the world and attracted approximately three million applicants for the 20,000 visas available.  Visas were granted on a random sample basis but, despite this, about 400 Irish people are expected to benefit from the scheme which operates until September 1991.</P>
    <P>Early this year Senator Kennedy brought forward a Bill similar to that passed by the Senate in March 1988.  This was discussed in the appropriate committees of the Senate and, with the assistance in particular of Senators Simpson and Simon, was passed by the full Senate in July by 81 votes to 17.  The Bill, if it became law, would introduce a number of significant modifications to the existing legislation.  The principal modification from our point of view is the one under which a points system would be introduced for the first time in the allocation of US visas.  Fifty four thousand visas would be allocated under this heading and 10,000 of these would be earmarked for countries disadvantaged under the 1965 Act.  The definition of a disadvantaged country would include Ireland.  I believe that emigrants from Ireland would be eminently qualified to avail of these visas.</P>
    <P>The Bill would also provide for 30,000 <Col N="2160" /> additional visas to be divided evenly between the Third and Sixth skills related preference categories.  There are significant queues of Irish people waiting for visas under both headings.  The passing of this proposal would make visas available to many of those who have already applied as well as significantly reduce the waiting time for visas under these categories.</P>
    <P>Work has already started in the House of Representatives on measures aimed at reforming the law in this area.  A number of draft Bills have been tabled, including a draft by Congressman Donnelly incorporating a proposal along the lines of the earlier Donnelly visa scheme.  Under the chairmanship of Congressman Bruce Morrison, the Immigration Sub-Committee of the House had their first hearing at the end of September.  A further two hearings will be held by the sub-committee, the dates of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I visited Washington shortly before the September hearing and met with Congressman Foley, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Congressman Morrison, as well as members of the Friends of Ireland group including Senator Kennedy and Congressman Donnelly.  The issue of an amnesty was discussed but it was the very definite and unanimous view of my interlocutors that the chances of obtaining an amnesty at this time are negligible.  The emphasis now must be on securing a suitable reform measure as soon as possible.  I am confident from what I have seen and heard that a very definite head of steam has built up behind the move for legislative reform and that we can hope to see real progress in this area in the life of this Congress.  I would like to assure the House that the Government will do all in their power to promote this progress and that our diplomatic efforts will continue with this objective as a priority.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the third part of the amendment which the Government have put before the House.  I have referred earlier, as has the Minister Deputy <Col N="2161" /> Ahern, to the excellent contribution of the DÍON Committee in London.  My colleague has already advised the House of how the committee are operating this year and I do not intend to repeat what he has said.  I would, however, like to acknowledge the work of the members of the DÍON Committee.</P>
    <P>In addition to the assistance being thus provided by the DÍON Committee, the Government, and their predecessors, have also actively addressed the welfare problem of the newly arrived Irish emigrants in the US.  In addition to the difficulties involved in cutting their links with their family and friends, a number have encountered problems in adjusting to a new cultural environment.  Some of those have compounded their difficulties by ignoring the conditions attached to their entry into the United States and find themselves in an irregular position from an immigration point of view.  At this stage, I wish to take the opportunity to advise those who may be considering emigrating to the United States, with the intention of working without the proper authorisation, not to do so.</P>
    <P>However, as we know, there are many thousands of out-of-status Irish citizens in the United States.  There is therefore, a serious problem which has to be addressed.  To deal with the issue, the Government identified the clear need to bring together the expertise of the various bodies operating in the immigration area in the US with a view to clarifying the nature of the problems faced by our emigrants and with a view to tackling the most pressing welfare issues, in particular medical care.</P>
    <P>In this connection we have taken the following action: we have set up immigration working committees under the auspices of our Consulates General in New York, Boston and San Francisco; we have appointed an officer to the New York Consulate General to act as an immigrants' liaison officer; we have upgraded the advisory services at all our offices in the United States; we have encouraged city and church authorities to improve the facilities available to emigrants, in particular health services; and <Col N="2162" /> we have prepared and circulated booklets in several of the consulates' areas on the range of medical, legal and housing services available to Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Government attach importance to meeting with the working committees and discussing with them the dimensions of the problem and how it might be addressed.  The Taoiseach met the New York committee during a visit to the United States in April 1988.  During the course of my most recent visit, to which I have already referred, I attended a meeting of the Immigration Working Committee at New York and availed of the opportunity to discuss the issues involved with the members, including representatives of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Catholic Charities, the Irish Immigration Reform Movement and the Irish American Business Coalition for Immigration Reform.  I received a first hand account of their work.  I was most impressed with the sense of awareness of the problems facing our young people and of their determination to help solve them.  I expressed my own personal appreciation for their efforts and assured them of the Government's continuing support for their activities.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the Government have decided that they should go a stage further in demonstrating their support for the work of these committees.  As the House is aware, the <i>Programme for Government</i> expressed the intention to make available financial assistance to support the work of these groups in the US.  I wish to confirm now that funds will be made available.  They will be channelled through the Consulates General in consultation with the Immigration Working Committees.  Organisations wishing to apply for such financial assistance should in the first instance contact the appropriate Consulate General.  This assistance will be further concrete evidence of the Government's deep concern at this problem and will assure those groups involved in such important work among our young emigrants of the Government's support and appreciation.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the aims of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i><Col N="2163" /> in the area of employment creation are being realised.  By this success we are tackling the root cause of emigration. The House is also aware that the Government are positively addressing the complex of problems facing our young emigrants in Britain and the US.  I, accordingly, recommend that the House accept the amendment to the motion before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a part of Ireland which has seen more emigration than any other area.  In the south-west of County Kerry the population over the last 50 years has halved.  Over the last 20 years in the village of Sneem, which won the Tidy Towns Competition a few years ago, the population has halved.  I grew up with young people who are living in America and England today.  I went to school with them; they were friends of mine and still are.  Of the leaving certificate class of 1973 in my home town I would say that I and about two others are left.  I often wondered throughout that period of my life, and today, why these regions were denuded of their population so rapidly, why people left rather than stayed.  After a while it became clear that the problem was not simply emigration but one of migration also out of the smaller towns of the west into the centre, out of the regions to the cities.  Those regions were left behind by successive Governments year after year and decade after decade.  As the east coast progressed, and I was alive to see that happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the west was left behind and with that there followed the inevitable exodus from the west.  That is not something which occurred yesterday or the day before.  It is not something that was caused yesterday or the day before but something which has been with us for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to delve into the history of emigration.  The country has a long history of emigration and everybody <Col N="2164" /> knows that but traditionally the west and south-west have suffered most from emigration and migration.</P>
    <P>We can hardly justify a call for an increase in EC funding for Ireland on the basis of its peripheral location if we do not recognise and deal with the traditional exodus of young people from our own peripheral regions.  It is clear that centralised planning for those areas has failed miserably.  Centralised planning in Dublin or large cities in relation to what should happen in regard to the future of the youth along the west coast has failed miserably mainly because those who were doing the planning and making the decisions knew nothing whatever about the regions they were purporting to make the plans for.  Accordingly, the plans inevitably and ultimately failed.  I strongly advocate a bottom-up approach as opposed to a top-down approach.  A truly integrated and imaginative approach to rural development in Ireland would recognise that localised resourced development companies are best equipped to develop resources and employment opportunities.  Our failure to do that in the past has meant that those who were afflicted by the problem never had a say in the resolution of the problem that existed.</P>
    <P>These organisations must be funded by central Government if we are to end what I can only describe as the injustice which has been perpetrated on these regions for generations.  A failure to grasp the opportunity which increased Structural Fund aid presents for our peripheral regions will mean a continuation of the injustice and neglect which has drained the west and the south-west of Ireland of its youth and, indeed, its future.  Emigration is not a political football but it is certainly a political problem.  It behoves each and every Member to approach the problem in the most responsible manner possible not, perhaps, by going into the past as to the reasons, although learning from that, but looking to the future in an imaginative way to see if we can stem a tide which has bedevilled us for generations, in particular along the west and south-west coasts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> The greatest thing we could do today would be to try to look at ways and means of solving the problem rather than laying blame for the cause of it.  Many of the people I know who emigrated have done extremely well in other countries.  They have contributed enormously to the growth of countries such as the United States of America and Great Britain. Indeed, they have been thankful for that opportunity.  One should not look on all emigrants as unfortunate beings because the majority have been eminently successful in other countries.  The tragedy was that if the resources which Deputy O'Sullivan referred to had been developed, and if in some way the people who were afflicted with the problem could have had a say in the resolution of it, the argument could be made that those people would have made an enormous contribution to their own as opposed to the development of other countries.</P>
    <P>Without any question over the years some of our best people left this country because they did not have any choice.  I sincerely hope that in the context of the new Europe we will not just look at our young people travelling to the Continent to build up other countries in the EC but that we will give them the opportunity in their own because it is my view that in many cases those people have more to offer than most.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I shall make one central point. A number of speakers have pointed to emigration as being a failure of our economic system, as being one of the saddest failures of us as a people.  There is criticism about the fact that emigration continues on the scale that is taking place in modern times.  Deputy O'Donoghue, behind me, has pointed to the failure of planning.  I want to draw attention in the brief time available to me to another failure.  As a manifestation of that failure I want to point to the present practice where so many of our young people who choose to emigrate choose to go to the US or Britain and continue to so do despite the fact that we have been a member of the EC for 16 full years.  It seems to be a great failure on the part of education and on our own part as a nation, that even after 16 years of full and in many ways enthusiastic membership of the EC, so many of our young people still choose to go the US or Britain when they look for work.  On deeper reflection it may very well be that the choice is not there and that we have done very little, if anything at all, to equip them to make a bid for jobs on a par with their qualifications in member states of the EC.  If that is so, we should ask ourselves why.  Where is the lack and how can that lack be put right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Readily people will tell you that the reason so many of our young people do not even make a bid to get jobs in the EC is they do not have language skills. In recent weeks when so many highly qualified young East Germans have been flocking into West Germany and being made very welcome in West Germany, because they have the qualifications and <Col N="2167" /> the skills and the vacancies are there and have been building up over the years, it struck me very strongly that it never occurred to so many of our young people, who are equally well qualified vocationally and academically, to make a bid for those jobs while the vacancies were still open.  They have not done that, first of all, because the orientation is not within the education system.  We seem to go along within the system as if we are going to provide jobs for all of them when school is over.  We have never really faced the hard reality that until things improve, substantially, large numbers of our young people will have to emigrate.  At least if we face that hard fact we might put more energy, time and effort into ensuring that if they have to go they will go to countries where, firstly, they will get jobs on a par with their qualifications and, secondly, they can live as free citizens among fellow Europeans.  It is extremely sad to see so many highly qualified, well-motivated, energetic young people being sucked into the cauldron of life in places like New York and Chicago where they have to live as fugitives, where they are content to work as bar people, waitresses and petrol pump attendants and where they have no security of any kind because they are living as illegals.  That is a terrible indictment of our failure to prepare young people for the reality of living in a modern European context.</P>
    <P>The one case I want to make this evening is for all of us, particularly the Minister for Education, to ensure that within our education system we redouble our efforts to bring modern European languages to young people and give them a competence and a confidence in communication in modern European languages. A great deal of time and a good deal of money are spent on language teaching in schools, but it is presented in such a manner that the language bit seems to have the curtain pulled down on it at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the end of the effort is seen as getting your points in the leaving certificate.  Language is not presented as a means of communication or as a passport to a job. <Col N="2168" /> At best it is presented as a passport to a points rating.  That is a very sad indictment of our education system.  I repeat that we must strive much more earnestly to bring oral competence within the reach of our young people and we must not rely totally on the schools to do this.  We leave it up to schools far too much.  Language is a living thing.  It is used out there in the market-place and in all sorts of places as well as within the classroom.</P>
    <P>One of our failures is to exploit the potential of TV as a teaching medium for modern communication.  It is a disgrace, with the number of channels we now have available, that we have made so little use of TV as a language teaching vehicle.  In the city of Cork, which I represent, we are lucky in that we have as many as five language stations in five different European languages.  Language teachers have assured me that this is of enormous benefit to young people because they encounter the language in a living, non-school context and they can relate the language to things in their daily lives outside the classroom.  I have been told that has made an enormous difference to the approach and the attitude of young people to language learning.  Why is this confined to Cork?  Why is this facility not available to people here in Dublin or throughout the country?</P>
    <P>My second appeal to the Minister for Education is that she should talk to the TV people and take all steps necessary to ensure that the channels of which I speak are made available to young people, and indeed, to all of us, no matter in which part of the country we live.  If it is important now it will be very much more important after 1992.</P>
    <P>The year of 1993 is upon us and so, in summary, let me say if we have to live with emigration, let us, for God's sake, take all steps open to us to ensure that those who have to emigrate can go to countries where they can have a decent standard of living, where they can work with their peers, their fellow Europeans, if that is what they choose to do and can have jobs on a par with the qualifications they take away out of our system of education that has excelled in so many <Col N="2169" /> ways but is sadly so fundamentally lacking in the teaching of modern European languages.  I appeal to the Minister for Education to take action on foot of what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do wish to speak on it. The actual text of the Fine Gael motion which has been accurately described by Deputy Higgins as a bleeding heart solution to the problem of emigration and unemployment, calls for action to end this haemorrhage but what action is proposed in the motion?  The only proposal is some funding for the provision of counselling and advice services, with which we all agree, but then it talks about purposeful diplomatic action in order to keep our emigrants in the United States and keep them well away from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary to sit here, having prepared a contribution for this debate which I now will not have time to deliver, <Col N="2170" /> and listen to the graphic description of the problems of rural emigration presented to this House by Deputy O'Donoghue.  I know and recognise well the picture he paints.  It was almost exclusively a rural phenomenon in the fifties and now it has returned to rural Ireland again.  This must be the only parliament in western Europe where a Government Deputy can speak in Delphic terms about the tragedy amd misery of emigration as if, for example, his Government had no responsibility for this situation.  It is unheard of for a Government Deputy to speak about the damage being done to the fabric of this society and the number of our young people who have to be exported to create wealth for other economies while, for the most part, since the foundation of this State, the hegemony of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have not changed and this problem still exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue or Deputy Máirín Quill can make a plea from the heart for more languages to be taught in schools so that presumably we can now start exporting our young people to Germany and France rather than have them sucked into the kind of employment in Chicago, San Francisco and so on, that Deputy Quill talked about.  It shows up the hypocrisy and humbug of this debate that it does not acknowledge that emigration is a direct result of the failed economic and industrial polities of successive Governments.  The main solution is the provision of job opportunities at home which can be brought about only by new industrial strategies based on the fullest exploitation and mobilisation of our indigenous resources.  In particular there is a need for more selective investment of public money towards the development of large, indigenous, export-oriented Irish enterprises capable of carving out a niche for Ireland in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>Emigration is the most critical challenge to Irish society and the most serious indictment of out status as an independent State.  Under the present Fianna Fáil Government the appalling levels of <Col N="2171" /> forced emigration are the highest in the history of the State and numbers exceeding the population of an entire county like Longford or Leitrim are leaving in any given year.  The exodus of the eighties seems to have brought a shift in established political thinking.  Stopping the tide of emigration is no longer an aspiration. Emigration has become, by default, an instrument of economic and social policy.  Official sources glibly estimate that the emigration rate will continue in excess of 25,000 people to the end of this century, but, as the Tánaiste remarked, the island is too small for us all, or too boring, as former Deputy John Kelly told us recently.</P>
    <P>Fine words about emigration by choice and getting valuable experience abroad conceals the reality.  Some emigrants do gain from the experience but the majority just survive and more than a few struggle and are exploited and subjected to discriminatory and racist treatment.  Indeed, it is an indicator of how divided and demoralised we are as a people that there is no longer any visible outrage that it is now public policy to export our educated young people to create surplus wealth, by their labour, for more advanced economies.</P>
    <P>There is visible relief among the conservative politicians on both sides of this House that this problem is being exported and that a source of opposition to the political hegemony that has governed this State since its foundation is being siphoned off.  To add insult to injury, a private golf club is likely to attract more State funding than the Government are prepared to allocate for the provision of badly needed information, advice and counselling services, both in Ireland for people contemplating emigration and in those countries to which the majority of our people emigrate.  Far from planning to end this trauma of emigration, I believe the privileged and the powerful in this society positively encourage emigration as the traditional safety valve to maintain their own privileged position.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that people have a right to live and work in Ireland. <Col N="2172" /> We are committed to building a society in which all the talent, energy and creativity that Deputy Quill spoke about will be channelled into creating new, worthwhile, well-paid jobs in the production of goods and services that people need and can afford to pay for.  Instead of devising new strategies to create jobs for our people at home &mdash; the thrust of the Tallaght strategy is alive and well judging from the harmless content of this motion which we are debating &mdash; a higher premium is now being placed on begging the United States to legalise our emigrants. We have heard that borne out in this debate by the Minister for Foreign Affairs tonight.  Winning a few thousand visas is now a crowning political achievement to be put on a par with opening a major manufacturing plant in the sixties or early seventies and the window dressing in which the Minister engaged in his recent discussions in the United States bears out that approach, this Minister who apparently intends to succeed to the leadership of his party following in the footsteps of Mr. Eamon de Valera who led the party and who told this Dáil in 1934 that once we had Fianna Fáil and independence, no longer would our children, like our cattle, be raised for export. The reality, of course, is that we are exporting our children in greater numbers now than at any stage in the history of the State, apart from the dark days of mid-1955 to which Deputy Higgins referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the meetings he had about various tinkering with the emigration working committees in the United States.  The last paragraph of his speech states that the House is aware that the aims of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in the area of employment creation are being realised.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is presented as a solution to our emigration problem.  It was promised to create 20,000 net jobs annually.  That subsequently became 20,000 additional jobs. In 1988 roughly 20,000 jobs were created, 18,000 in manufacturing and 2,000 in international financial services&mdash;roughly the same rate as prior to the <i>Programme <Col N="2173" /> for National Recovery</i>&mdash; but 23,000 jobs were notified officially to the Department of Labour under the Redundancy Payments Acts as being made redundant.  A shattering blow has been delivered by the publication of the labour force survey figures in terms of the expectations that we had.</P>
    <P>All the conventional economists predicted that the position was getting better.  For example, the ESRI anticipated an improvement of 7,000 jobs and the Central Bank anticipated an improvement of 13,000 but the labour force survey figures showed a net decline of 1,000.  That has been a continuing trend in relation to the people at work.  In the eighties, there are now 50,000 fewer people at work in manufacturing and that is despite all the money we have poured into the private sector &mdash; £1.3 billion in tax breaks alone in 1987, generally £1 billion in any given year, and an additional £400 million in grants and subsidies. At the end of that, all we have to show is 50,000 fewer people in the workforce now than at the beginning of the eighties.  That is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to come into this House to suggest that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represents an adequate solution is not to deal seriously with this problem.  What Fine Gael are requesting is that we provide money to facilitate the provision of counselling services and engage in purposeful diplomatic activity to make sure that these angry young people stay in the United States, that they are siphoned off and do not provide potent opposition to the political hegemony in this country.  Fine Gael are very happy with this.  We hear graphic speeches like, for instance, &ldquo;the people who went to school through the fields with me and who are now in San Francisco.&rdquo; Deputy Quill wants them to replace the <i>Gastarbeiters</i> in Germany so that the Turks may be sent back and our people change the hotel bedrooms for the Germans, that is if the people who are leaving the German Democratic Republic do not get those jobs, which is very likely.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins has said, unless <Col N="2174" /> the question of economic and industrial policy is tackled all of these fine words and bleeding heart motions on emigration are meaningless.  If the way this House addressed the NESC report is to be taken as an example I do not think industrial policy is taken seriously.  We did not have to wait for the NESC report to highlight the failure of industrial policy as we have known it.  The Telesis report way back in 1982 highlighted many of the things that the NESC report underlines. We took very little of that on board. They were the first independent outside consultants to shatter the myth of IDA job creation targets.  Without the work being done by the IDA and the 80,000 jobs provided by the foreign sector our position would be tragically worse.  The attraction of foreign industries and the throwing of money at them does not represent an adequate answer to the problem of unemployment.  The Telesis report bore that out.</P>
    <P>It was stated in that report that we need strong sustainable jobs, not merely job approval targets.  Down through the years Ministers for Industry and Commerce have abused the role of the IDA by boosting the job target figures for various projects.  Those job targets were never realised. Both the Telesis report and the NESC report referred to the attractions the foreign sector holds for us, such as jobs, net export earnings, new investment capital, and training for our labour force.  However, they also pointed out that there was a need for better measuring systems of industrial policy for example, a better way to measure the success of our industrial policy might be to use total Irish value added exports over three to five years after a project has been set up and total Irish value added per job created and sustained.  Too little attention is paid to the strength and structure required if a firm or enterprise is to succeed in the international market-place.</P>
    <P>Why, despite the proposals contained in the Telesis report, is there still such disproportionate emphasis placed on small industries?  We refuse to re-organise, to underline the building of structurally strong Irish companies rather than <Col N="2175" /> strong agencies to assist weak companies. The 1984 White Paper paid some lip service to the proposals contained in the Telesis report but too few of them were taken on board and they were never underpinned by legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that unless we tackle the question of industrial policy we will never make any impact on the emigration crisis.  Ireland has the most open handed leaders in Europe or in the industrialised world.  Our policies are all carrot and no stick.  At present private companies are making enormous and unprecedented profits.  While the Taoiseach, the Government and conventional economists will tell us that all the economic indicators are right &mdash; unprecedental growth, comparatively low inflation and so on &mdash; we do not know what to do about unemployment.  In the meantime profits are being repatriated at an extent which has everybody baffled. This year the figure will be £2,000 million and the expectation is that this figure will increase.  There is a massive repatriation of profits and we seem incapable of taking any action to minimise it.  Twelve per cent of our GNP is flowing out of the country in this way but no action is being taken. Unless a progressive tax regime and a tax on corporate profits are implemented we will see no gains from the wealth created here except the employment being given to workers.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Fine Gael motion.  It is quite appropriate that a politician from my age group should do so as it is my age group who are most affected by the present problem. I must say that I have found the discussion of the past two nights to be a most interesting one and the one point I have to make is that the central issue facing us tonight is the plight of the Irish illegals in <Col N="2176" /> the United States.  The question we must ask ourselves is what can we do to ease their plight.  It is important that we discuss the question of why so many people have emigrated in recent decades.  Central to any solution is job creation.  It is very easy for my friends on the benches to my right to speak of Utopian solutions to the problems facing us.  It is always far easier to advocate socialism from the Opposition benches but if we take a look at what is happening in Europe today, in particular in those countries where socialism is practised in its most pure form, we would have to question some of the statements which have been made and the very severe criticism of those of us who hold a non-socialist viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am but as I look around me I find it very easy to make those points.  It is about time that those people who have preached that sort of doctrine during the past 20 years took a serious look at their own philosophy and at the problems which have arisen in countries where this philosophy is practised.</P>
      <P>To get back to the motion before us tonight I would like to refer in particular to the problems facing the Irish illegal, in the United States.  We are speaking of at least 100,000 people and we must ask ourselves what we can do for them.  I was very privileged to be part of a Fine Gael deputation who travelled to the United States to meet with many of these people. Regretfully I have to inform the House that they are very angry at finding themselves in the United States and are totally without hope.  Obviously what is needed is for the Govenment to take initiatives, to seek the introduction of pro-Irish legislation in the United States Congress. While Ministers have toured the United States, and there has been the clicking of cameras in recent months, we would all have to admit that very little progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment American politicians, <Col N="2177" /> such as Congressman Brian Donnelly, who have done wonders for the Irish.  If we were to see much greater pressure being put on people such as Congressman Brian Donnelly by the Government we might make major strides.  It has to be noted that the position of Irish illegals in the United States has not improved to any degree during the past two years. This morning I was informed by a person involved with the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, who have done tremendous work, that two Irish illegals were arrested yesterday evening in a New York bar.  This is a hazard faced daily by the tens of thousands of Irish illegals in the United States.  They are the people I see as our main priority tonight.  We all have to agree that employment creation is central to the solution but we will not create the 100,000 jobs within the next year that these people can come back home to.  We must ask ourselves what we can do for these people.  Many people, if they had the choice, would remain in the United States and it is vital that we ensure that there is legislation in America that gives as many of those people as possible the opportunity to remain in the United States.  It is very important that the maximum degree of care and concern is demonstrated by the Irish Government for the illegal young Irish in the United States.  If the official Government channels are unwilling to do so, unfortunately there are many groups with questionable intend who are only too willing to get involved with the Irish illegals &mdash; and I refer to those who would be far more worried about procuring money and arms than they would be of procuring visas and legal status for the Irish.</P>
    <P>While I regret I have not had more time to outline my views, I again add my support to the motion.</P>

      <P>In summing up the debate I would like to acknowledge at <Col N="2178" /> the outset that many more of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party would like to have participated in this debate which we consider to be of the utmost importance. This debate on Irish emigration is taking place when the eyes of the world are focused on the massive emigration from East Germany in recent weeks, days and hours.  Yet, the level of Irish emigration in the past year has been <i>pro rata</i> as the East German exodus.  East Germany has a population of 17.5 million, almost five times the population of the Republic of Ireland.  Last year 46,000 people left this country and five times that rate is the equivalent of 230,000 people leaving East Germany in one year.  That exodus from East Germany has shocked the world.  Tens of thousands of Irish people, mostly young, are seeking to escape from a society which they see as hopeless, just as German youth flee through gaps in a rusty and collapsing Iron Curtain.  Yet the lethargy and inertia of Irish national reaction is such that the exodus has happened as silently as a rippling stream on a dawdling summer's day.</P>

      <P>The stream out of Ireland is one for all seasons and is the gushing life blood of Irish youth.  This Government's response has been to provide a grant of only £500,000 for emigrant services this year, which is the equivalent of £10 for each of those 46,000 people who left our shores last year.</P>

      <P>The Government stand condemned of failure, inertia and being out of touch on the same scale as the now departed Politburo in East Berlin.  The people of East Germany, deprived as they are of democratic rights, have nonetheless rid themselves of a despised government and Politburo.  The Irish people, endowed as they are with full democratic rights, will wreak retribution on the present Government if emigration is not stopped and reversed. Fianna Fáil are in office for the past two <Col N="2179" /> and a half years.  Before the last election, they had the unequalled opportunity of an offer from the Opposition for an allparty approach to the necessary tax reform, which we see as an essential prerequisite to job creation and job maintenance, but that generous offer was flung in the face of the Opposition by an opportunist Taoiseach who fled to the country and was taught a lesson, which he will be taught again.  The main causes of emigration are unemployment and taxation. It is also the sort of society we are.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the contributions from my colleagues in The Workers' Party, a Marxist-Leninist party.  The silence from the benches indicates that they do not deny this.  They advocate that we construct a society similar to that which the hundreds of millions of people who live under subsistence are trying to break down and flee from.  The leading enemies of work are those who seek to impose a régime that makes it impossible to employ people or makes it difficult, to say the least, to sustain meaningful jobs.</P>

I criticise the <Col N="2180" /> Thatcher Government almost as strongly, but not quite, as I criticise the Marxist-Leninist philosophy that has destroyed Eastern Europe.  However, I must acknowledge that for 38 months in a row, up to and including this month, they have managed to reduce their unemployment in the United Kingdom.  Unemployment there is 40 per cent of what it was 38 months ago which is about the time this Government took office.  They have been able to introduce policies and inducements to tackle the unemployment problem.  At present there are more people at work in the United Kingdom than ever before, whereas after two years of Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; despite the outrageously untrue claims of Government Ministers, repeated week in and week out &mdash; the CSO state in their publication that there are fewer people at work now than there were a year ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the distribution of free EC beef in relation to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to you for having given me the opportunity of raising this important matter.  I should mention that I propose to share my time with Deputy Ferris.</P>
      <P>A quantity of EC beef has been made available to this country and it is apparent that the Minister has devised a selective basis for its distribution which leaves thousands of needy families without the possibility of getting any of that beef. People in receipt of an invalidity pension are excluded from any entitlement to a share of this beef.  This also applies to people in receipt of a disabled person's allowance under the regulations made by the Minister.  Why does the Minister not provide an allocation from Government sources to ensure that every person in receipt of social welfare gets an entitlement of this very modest allowance of four kilos of beef spread over two weeks in the run-up to Christmas?</P>
      <P>This is an indication of the heart and mind of the Government.  Who do they choose to exclude from the scheme?  The invalids and the disabled are the categories the Government singled out to be excluded from an allocation of beef at a time when they would have us believe that the economy is on the upturn and that Government revenues, income tax receipts, capital gains tax and VAT are also increasing.  However, the very modest amount required to avoid this divisiveness to social welfare recipients is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the scheme has only started I have already heard pathetic, sad stories of people who had heard about the allocation of beef and who went to the St. Vincent de Paul, who &mdash; in Dublin at any rate &mdash; have been given the responsibility for distributing it.  One man told me that he has been unable to work for the last 15 years as he suffers from a serious liver complaint and asthma.  His wife has had a series of three strokes in as many years and their total income is £74.10 per week. They thought they would be entitled to the bounty from the EC and the Minister and that they would get an allocation from this miserable four kilos of beef. <Col N="2185" /> They went to the centre but were told to consult their local TD as, unfortunately, they were not eligible.</P>
    <P>We pride ourselves on being one of the major beef producing countries in the world but we know that there are many families in need who cannot afford to buy that product.  In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the attitude of one woman from Ringsend seemed to sum up the feelings of most.  She said that she had never had to take free meat before, that she was embarrassed at doing so but that as everyone in the house was out of work it would be a treat to have a roast.  However, if her husband is an invalid or disabled, that family, for some strange reason, will be singled out by the Minister and will not get an allocation.</P>
    <P>I know that the amount of beef made available to the Minister is fixed and limited. However, when a generous allocation is made from the EC, the Government should ensure that no-one in receipt of social welfare will be deprived of an allocation.  They should make up the difference so that nobody is disappointed.</P>
    <P>We export vast quantities of beef to Iraq and we have been talking about that in the House recently.  Those exports amount to millions of pounds, they were sent years ago and the country has not yet been paid for them.  Indeed, the Minister guaranteed these exports and it is strange that we can support millions of pounds worth of beef on credit to Iraq and yet be waiting for payment for it when at home the poor are denied the opportunity of having beef on the table once or twice coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Taylor for allowing me to comment on this because although it is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to provide this product, we had hoped that the main beneficiaries would have been those in receipt of social welfare or people who were physically or mentally disabled or sick.  As persons in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance are already means tested they should not have been <Col N="2186" /> excluded from this scheme.  Those on invalidity pensions could benefit medically from this product.</P>
      <P>Everybody talks about the mountains of beef, so there is no problem about the quantity available.  There is no problem regarding the expense because the Government have the product at first cost.  We should avail of every opportunity within the Community Directive &mdash; using non-Government agencies and statutory bodies to get full information &mdash; to ensure that every category identified by Deputy Taylor should be specifically included in the allocation of beef.  Our request is not unreasonable and if it is not granted it will create an anomaly and &mdash; in the light of what was said about the export of meat to Iraq &mdash; it will create an impression here that although our poor are hungry we can still support multinationals and others who export meat with a guaranteed price for it.  It will be a tragedy if the Minister does not respond positively to the reasonable request from Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight the EC free food scheme, which is at present under way and which involves very many people around the country giving of their time and effort on a completely voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The scheme is designed to allow member states provide food from intervention stocks to charitable organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.  Each member state is allocated an annual budget with which to buy food from intervention.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food I have been one of the strongest supporters of this scheme and was, in fact, instrumental in ensuring that allocation between member states is based on relative prosperity as well as population levels.  This, of course, ensures that we in Ireland get our due share of the available funding.  I have decided that in our case, this should be used to provide prime quality beef free of charge from our intervention stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the limitation on the quantity <Col N="2187" /> of beef available it has, of course, been necessary to restrict eligibility to those in greatest need.  In 1988 it was decided, following consultation with the Department of Social Welfare, to concentrate on serving the needs of people on long-term unemployment assistance who were also eligible for the fuel allowance.  As a result some 50,000 people benefited under the scheme last year.</P>
    <P>I succeeded this year in obtaining some additional funding for Ireland for the 1989 scheme.  This has allowed us to expand the scheme this year to include all those on long-term unemployment assistance &mdash; about 120,000 people in all, more than twice the numbers who qualified last year.  About 800 tonnes of beef will be distributed over a fortnight to those eligible, in 2 kg. portions per week. The distribution commenced on Monday last.  All the evidence available to me suggests that the scheme is operating smoothly.</P>
    <P>I wish to offer my sincere thanks to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is arranging for distribution of the beef to eligible beneficiaries.  This has obviously involved an enormous effort by society members, all of whom, of course, are giving of their time on a voluntary basis. I wish also to record my appreciation to those meat processors who processed the beef into family sized quantities, free of charge, and to Molloy and Sherry Limited for their generous assistance with transportation.</P>
    <P>This combined voluntary effort has ensured that again this year a significant proportion of welfare beneficiaries &mdash; much more than last year &mdash; will receive a meaningful quantity of prime quality beef.  That this has, once more, been so smoothly arranged is, I think, a great tribute to all involved.  The fact that beneficiaries are more than doubled this year is an indication of the Government's concern that the benefits of the free food scheme are enjoyed by as many as possible. I will be seeking to ensure that the scheme can continue to be improved in future years.</P>
    <P>But I should emphasise that the money <Col N="2188" /> available is strictly limited.  This year's allocation &mdash; although increased compared to last year &mdash; amounted to just £3 million and compares very favourably, in relative terms, with the amounts available in other member states.  I was able to arrange to have money or food that was not being used by other member states under this scheme transferred to Ireland for the needy purposes concerned. We are very anxious that as many as possible benefit, hence this year's extension of the eligible categories.  But the numbers qualifying must necessarily be limited if beneficiaries are to obtain a meaningful quantity.  Therefore, we endeavour to concentrate on those in greatest need after consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  My advice is that the categories selected meet that criterion.  Of course I am prepared to review the categories in the future but, unless there is a very substantial increase in funding &mdash; which is not at present in prospect &mdash; any extension would have to be very limited.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that the Department of Agriculture and Food or I, as Minister, have a specific qualification in this area. Our job is to have this free food made available, then to consult with those who advise us as to priorities.  I will transmit the views expressed in the House to those who advise us.  But my function is to provide as much beef as possible for the most needy categories, not to determine who falls into those needy categories.  I am satisfied that more than double the amount that was provided last year is certainly moving in the right direction.  I will endeavour to have that trend continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter this evening because of the deep concern and the great sense of helplessness expressed to me by numerous parents of small children who were treated by Mr. Patrick O'Neill and who now feel very let down by the sequence of events that have taken place in Beaumont and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, since March of last year.</P>
      <P>Many questions surrounding this matter demand a response and the time available this evening does not allow me go into them all.  First, I might give a brief background to the problem for those who are not familiar with it.  Mr. Patrick O'Neill is a brilliant paediatric neuro-surgeon, born in Tralee, who studied medicine in UCC, specialising in neuro-surgery. He worked in the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and has a clinical fellowship in paediatric neurosurgery. In March 1988 he took up his position in Beaumont Hospital and was also available from that time to patients of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and Temple Street Children's Hospital. Poor work relations developed during Mr. O'Neill's time in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is now history that he was sacked by the hospital, in March 1989 allegedly because of bad temper.  He has also ceased to function in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  Mr. O'Neill is now out of the realm of public hospitals and functioning in the private sector.  He is employed solely by the Mater Private Clinic available only to the children of the wealthy who can afford the necessary fees to consult him there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the appeals of parents <Col N="2190" /> whose children were treated by Mr. O'Neill.  Those children had had brain and spinal tumours.  He performed 260 operations on children in the past 18 months.  Those parents want to continue their relationship with Mr. O'Neill.  I am seeking an assurance from the Minister that he will make that possible.  After all, if it were mine or the Minister's child would not we want the best medical service available?</P>
    <P>I might now quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 September 1989 in regard to what one mother said about her child:</P>
    <P>Alison Bailey from South County Dublin telephoned <i>The Irish Times</i> after seeing a reference in an article to a parents support group.  Her first child, born with a growth at the back of her neck, had to be operated on at less than a day old.  &ldquo;The prognosis was as bad as it could be; even if she survived she would be mentally handicapped.&rdquo; Her child is now perfect &mdash;&ldquo;and not just perfect for someone born with that growth.  She is simply perfect in every way.&rdquo;  Alison Bailey remembers small things with gratitude &mdash; like the way Patrick O'Neill used to stroke her baby's cheek while he talked to them.  &ldquo;I cannot believe that this is the person I've been reading about in the papers.  It's as if they're talking about somebody different.  I found him incredibly courteous.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that there is now no paediatric neurosurgeon here and that the Minister has assumed no role whatever with regard to this row.</P>
    <P>According to an article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 6 October 1989 there is concern about this lack of paediatric neurosurgery.  One neurosurgeon, Mr. Seán Ó Laoire, has expressed his grave concern, which is reported in this article as follows:</P>
    <P>...He said that while he had training and expertise in the management of tumours in older children he was concerned that in the absence of a formally trained paediatric neurosurgeon, such <Col N="2191" /> as is the case in the vast majority of European and North American centres, the provision of &ldquo;best standard&rdquo; treatment may be difficult to achieve. </P>
    <P>I contend the Minister must become involved and take immediate action restoring the confidence of public patients in the service of neurosurgery.  I have been informed that there are many children in the country whose parents now want to send them abroad for neuro-surgery. I ask the Minister the straight question: how much will that cost the State?  There are other questions to which I want answers, such as: if a baby under four years old is admitted to Beaumont Hospital now requiring neurosurgery what will happen that child?  There is, from what I have heard, a six weeks waiting list for operations in Beaumont Hospital.  Is it true that many parents are mortgaging their homes to pay for treatment for their children?  Is this not another classic example of the two-tiered health system?</P>
    <P>This problem will not disappear.  The Minister cannot absolve himself or his Department with regard to it.  We here have a responsibility to voice the concerns of ordinary people.  Ultimately this is the place of accountability for public spending and public servoice.  The Minister will hear a great deal more about this issue because it is my belief that the argument is only beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fennell for having allowed me some time to join her call and that of many other Members for the reinstatement of Mr. Patrick O'Neill to Beaumont Hospital.  It is nothing short of a national disgrace, of a national tragedy, that this man has been made the scapegoat of gross incompetence in the administration of the affairs of Beaumont Hospital and for internal political wrangling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody with the surgical knowledge of Mr. O'Neill, his surgical know-how or experience in this country available to the ordinary people, to the <Col N="2192" /> children of ordinary people whom he has treated in a manner that enables them to lead a meaningful life.  I have had numerous letters, as I am sure has the Minister, from grateful parents wanting to express their gratitude for the marvellous work he has done.  This is not the man about whom they read in the papers, who has been so maligned by people totally opposed to him.  Indeed, it is unbelievable that such could happen in this country.</P>
    <P>Nothing short of reinstatement will restore the good name and reputation this nuerosurgeon has earned for himself by being considerate, polite and caring to the patients he has treated over a great number of years.  His services are now available only to people who can afford them.  This is not good enough and is not in the best interests of medical care for young people.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Boylan in thanking Deputy Fennell for giving me some of her time in order to express my dismay at the lack of initiative in the Department of Health whereby there is no paediatric neuro-surgeon in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child in my constituency has been diagnosed as having cranial stenosis.  This child was to have been operated on before it was six months old.  The child is now eight months old and its parents have no idea of when this operation will take place.  They have been in contact with qualified people in the medical profession who believe they are not competent to carry out this operation.  The only surgeons available who can look after this child are in the UK &mdash; in Glasgow, Birmingham and Nottingham.  It has not been established whether these surgeons will be available.  I believe a crisis point has been reached in regard to this child and it is a most traumatic time for the parents.  The lack of initiative in the Department of Health leaves much to be <Col N="2193" /> desired so I expect some positive answers from the Minister tonight.</P>

      <P>The position is that the consultant in question was appointed as a consultant neuro-surgeon with a special interest in paediatric neuro-surgery in March of last year.  The appointee's main commitment was to Beaumont Hospital with a lesser commitment to Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals. As is usual in these instances the appointment was in a probationary capacity for one year.  At the end of the one year probation period the appointment was not confirmed by Beaumont Hospital and subsequently was not confirmed by Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that the consultant's contract of employment was with the three hospitals concerned and not with <Col N="2194" /> the Department of Health or myself as Minister.  The matter of confirming or discontinuing the consultant's appointment was determined between the consultant and the hospitals involved after detailed consideration.  In the case of Beaumont Hospital this involved hearings in the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely inappropriate for me as Minister to become involved in a matter which has been before the courts and been decided on by the boards of the three hospitals involved.  As the Deputy stated, the consultant in question has recently taken up employment with a private institution and it would not be proper for me to comment on any arrangements which might have been entered into in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the medical implications of what has happened in case there is any disquiet among the Members of this House or the public at large.  The position at present is that services for children in need of neuro-surgery are being provided by the consultant neuro-surgeons at Beaumont Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultant neuro-surgeons at Beaumont Hospital have dealt with a large volume of children's cases over the years and were entirely responsible for the service for children before 1988.  I am satisfied as to their competence to provide a high quality level of service in this instance.  In other European countries neuro-surgeons who do not specifically specialise in paediatric surgery have been fully recognised as being competent to perform neuro-surgery on children. Indeed the British Institute of Neuro-Surgeons have confirmed that all <Col N="2195" /> accredited neuro-surgeons are competent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> I am delighted to inform the House that a Christmas bonus will be paid this year and will be increased to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments instead of the 65 per cent which applied for the last three years.  It will be paid in the first week in December and will benefit almost 940,000 people comprising 590,000 recipients, with an estimated 350,000 dependants.  It will for the first time also be paid to widowers and deserted husbands on the new allowance scheme.  The cost of the bonus this year is £24 million compared to £21 million last year.</P>
    <P>This increased Christmas bonus will be particularly helpful to old age pensioners and other long-term recipients in meeting the extra costs which arise at this time of the year.  The impact of this increase can be seen from the following examples showing the payments in the first week in December: (a) An old age couple (contributory pension), both aged over 66, will receive a bonus of £71.50, giving a total payment of £173.70, an increase of £10 over last year; (b) A widow (non-contributory pension) with three children will receive a bonus of £61.80 giving a total payment of £150.10, an increase of £8.70 over last year; (c) A married man with three children on long-term unemployment assistance will receive a bonus of £74.90 giving a total payment of £181.90, an increase of £18.90 over last year.</P>
    <P>I introduced for the first time a special Christmas bonus for pensioners equivalent to a full week's payment in 1980.  A similar bonus was paid each year up to and including 1984.  In 1985 the bonus was reduced to 75 per cent in order to finance the inclusion of the long-term unemployed.  The bonus was further reduced to 65 per cent in 1986 and remained at that level up to and including last year.  This year, the Government have increased the bonus to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments.</P>
    <P>The categories who benefit from the Christmas bonus payment are those in receipt of the following: old age pensions (contributory and non-contributory); <Col N="2026" /> widow's and orphan's pensions (contributory and non-contributory); widower's (non-contributory) pension; retirement pension; blind pension; invalidity pension; deserted wife's benefit and allowance; deserted husband's allowance; social assistance allowance for unmarried women, prisoners' wives and single women; unemployment assistance at the long term rate; occupational injuries benefit paid by way of pensions; long term health payments such as disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit is a short-term payment and those who receive it on a long-term basis can apply for invalidity pension which qualifies for the bonus.  I would remind Deputies of the value of our Christmas bonus which compares very favourably with the £10 bonus, paid to pensioners only, in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>In 1987 I arranged for the Combat Poverty Agency to fund Coolock Community Law Centre for a three year period to the end of 1989.  This funding amounted to £60,000 per annum.

      <P>The PRSI exemption scheme, details of which I announced on 23 October of this year, provides for the waiving of employers' PRSI contributions in the tax year 1990-91 in respect of additional employees taken on during the period from 23 October 1989 to 28 February 1990.  This scheme is part of a wide range of measures to improve job creation which were recently announced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 5,000 additional jobs, to which the Deputy refers, represents the extra number of people expected to take up employment as a result of the current scheme.  The operation of similar <Col N="2028" /> schemes on two previous occasions suggested that the length of the recruitment period over which the scheme operated influenced the number of employees taken on.  The number of additional jobs anticipated to arise from the current scheme reflects the fact that this time the recruitment period will be in excess of four months.  In contrast to previous occasions, however, the introduction of the scheme is taking place against a background of substantial economic recovery. In targeting 5,000 extra jobs, it is anticipated that the improved economic climate will afford employers increased job creation opportunities, which the scheme will encourage them to avail of during this period.</P>

Following reinvestigation, his claim was disallowed from 30 September 1987 on the grounds that by failing to disclose full details of his means, he had failed to show that his yearly means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate from that date.

      <P>Regulations made under the <Col N="2032" /> Social Welfare Acts modify the rate of PRSI contribution payable in respect of certain employments and occupations mainly in the public sector.  Pensionable employment as a teacher is one of the employments so affected.  Normally the modified rate of contribution is only payable in respect of persons in employment which is both permanent and pensionable. However, under the existing regulations the modified rate also applies to national teachers and teachers in domestic science training colleges who have been appointed to pensionable teaching posts in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>At the time these regulations were introduced the teachers concerned were normally made permanent after a short period.  Accordingly, the additional cost both to them and their employers of the full PRSI rate of contribution during the period they were employed in a temporary capacity could not be justified as the cover provided would not be required by them.  However, the situation has changed in recent years in this regard and a number of teachers are now remaining in pensionable posts in a temporary capacity for much longer periods than heretofore.  In view of this I accept that the insurability position of these teachers needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have decided in principle to extend the social insurance cover of all public sector workers on the modified rate and substantive negotiations will be taking place shortly with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with a view to implementation on an agreed basis from April 1990.  The position of temporary teachers insurable at the modified rate will be examined in this context.</P>

      <P>Participation on the social <Col N="2033" /> employment scheme, which is administered by FÁS, is open to recipients of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  The scheme enables unemployed people to work for an average of two and a half days each week for which they are paid a weekly allowance of £65 (single) and £92 (married).  These allowances are higher than the equivalent rates of unemployment assistance.  Furthermore, participants are free to engage in other work or activities during their time off.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to assist persons dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their heating needs.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find, employment suitable to him or her having regard to his/her age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  The legislation provides also that the onus is on individual claimants to prove that they are genuinely seeking work.  It does not, however, state what form such proof should take.  It is accordingly a question for the deciding officers and appeals officers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence. All claimants are asked when claiming for unemployment benefit or assistance to complete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment. Claimants may also be asked subsequently at any stage of their claim about this matter.  In most cases, the replies given by claimants to this questionnaire will, when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, be sufficient to satisfy the deciding officer that the person concerned is genuinely seeking work.  If, however, there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed; the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions which the claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do and whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on the basis of the replies given to questions such as these that the deciding officer determines whether the person is <Col N="2037" /> or is not genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits and it is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant. Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeal officer.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained of the number of claimants who are refused unemployment assistance on the basis that they are not genuinely seeking work. The total number of unemployment assistance appeals heard in the 12 months to September 1989 was 1,698.  As statistics on the reasons for these appeals are not available, it is not possible to say how many persons who were found not to be genuinely seeking work by a deciding officer appealed against such decision.</P>
    <P>There are currently 12 appeals officers who deal with appeals against decisions under all of the Department's schemes.</P>

While there is no formal requirement on the part of An Post to consult my Department in relation to such matters, my Department is kept informed of any proposals in relation to post office services that would affect the payment of social welfare payments. I have not been informed of any proposals by An Post for large scale closures of post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post have been made aware of the impact that such closures can have on social welfare clients.  This factor is taken <Col N="2038" /> into account when the question of closing an individual post office is being considered. Where small rural and urban post offices have closed in recent years the pensioners affected were advised and payment of their pensions was transferred to other post offices nominated by the pensioners.  An Post through their countrywide network of post offices, provide a comprehensive cash payment service to social welfare clients.  The network of offices forms an important part of the overall social welfare payment structure.

For this reason, I am actively pursuing ways of introducing as wide a degree of flexibility as I can into the various payment methods that my Department use.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the widespread unease in the north city area at reports that the Department of Social Welfare public offices in Phibsboro Tower, Dublin 7 is about to close; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the transfer of functions and staff of my Department dealing with widows' pensions and various social welfare allowance schemes from offices located in Phibsboro Tower, Dublin to new offices in Sligo under the Government's decentralisation scheme.  The final phase of the transfer took place last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public office in Phibsboro Tower has been an integral part of the widows' <Col N="2039" /> and orphans' pensions branch since it was established in that location.  In the light of the Sligo transfer, its functions will in future be discharged as part of the services to be provided in Sligo where a new public office has been opened.</P>
    <P>I have, however, carefully considered the resultant situation in the north city area and I have made arrangements to keep the Phibsboro public office open on an interim basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he recognises that hardship can be caused through the operation of the means test for unemployment assistance, applied where a spouse is working, as a consequence of the fact that the cost of a mortgage is no longer deemed an allowable expense in carrying out a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner of assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes is set out in social welfare legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to November 1986, any income that the wife of an unemployment assistance applicant had from employment was assessed in accordance with section 146 (1) (b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which provided that all income an applicant might reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year as head of household was to be taken into account as means.  In applying this provision, my Department's deciding officers and appeals officers took the view that the husband, as head of the household, could not normally expect to receive that portion of his wife's earnings which was used to make rent or mortgage payments.  Accordingly, the amount of weekly rent or mortgage payment was deducted from the wife's earnings before assessing her income as means.  The Social Welfare (No. 2), Act, 1985, provided for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  On the introduction of this legislation, the <Col N="2040" /> reference to &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; in section 146 of the 1981 Act had to be deleted because the concept was incompatible with the principle of equal treatment.</P>
    <P>The position now is that any income from employment which the spouse of an unemployment assistance applicant may have is assessed in accordance with section 146 (1) (e) of the 1981 Act, as inserted by section 13 (1) of the 1985 Act. This section provides that the estimated value to the household deriving from all income earned by an applicant's spouse in respect of current personal employment under a contract of employment is assessable as means.  As any portion of the spouse's earnings which may be used to make rent and mortgage payments is of value to the household, it cannot be disregarded in assessing the spouse's income as means.  The current provision applies to spouses, whether men or women, and not just wives as was the situation previously.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that discontinuation of the allowance in respect of mortgage and rent would have meant an increase in the means of many married men applicants whose claims were current in November 1986, special regulations were made which preserved the right of such claimants to continue to enjoy the allowance.  These regulations originally prescribed that this concession should last for no more than a year. However, in November 1987, I took the opportunity in amending regulations to extend this period indefinitely.  The position now is that any claimant who was enjoying the allowance in November 1986 may continue to do so for as long as he remains continuously unemployed.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also that anyone having difficulty in meeting rent or mortgage payments can claim a supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Application for this supplement can be made to the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been <Col N="2041" /> drawn to the difficulties experienced by the unemployed in signing off and signing on when taking up temporary or part-time work; and if he will consider the nomination of an officer at every employment exchange to be responsible for easing these difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A period of interruption of unemployment for unemployment benefit purposes is 13 weeks and for unemployment assistance is 20 weeks.  These periods are extended by a further 12 months where claimants have been participating in training courses or employment projects run by An FÁS.</P>
      <P>This means that where a person ceases signing-on for less than whichever of these two periods is appropriate in his or her case, the claim is not broken and, as soon as the claim is renewed, it would be authorised for payment immediately. The only exception to this is where there has been a material change in the person's circumstances since he or she last signed on.  For instance, if there was a change in the number of dependants being claimed for, the claim papers would have to be submitted to a deciding officer for rerating. But this is a routine operation which should not involve delay.  Where the break of claim is over 13 weeks or 20 weeks, the person's entitlement would need to be determined in the same way as a new claim.  For example, where unemployment benefit is concerned, the claim may need to be determined by reference to the number of contributions paid in a different governing contribution year, in which case the deciding officer would need to obtain the new contribution data before he could determine the claim.  But in the normal way, any delay involved should be no more than a week or so.  In unemployment assistance cases, where a change of means has occurred, the case may need to be referred for reinvestigation but the normal procedure is, pending the outcome of the review, to continue to make payment on the basis of the existing means assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2042" /> As regards part time employment, where a claimant obtains casual employment of a few days a week, the scheduled payment is adjusted on the spot when he or she attends at the local office.</P>
    <P>The arrangements outlined above have operated satisfactorily over the years. The processing of such renewed claims is a regular feature of exchange work and I have no reason for believing that any new procedure of the kind suggested by the Deputy is called for.  If the Deputy is aware of any particular problem regarding the processing of the unemployment claims of claimants who secure temporary or part time employment, I would be happy to inquire into them.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer ceased employment on 30 September 1989 and a claim for repayment of tax was received by the Inspector of Taxes on 24 October 1989.  However, as the claim form was improperly completed, the inspector returned same to the taxpayer for completion on 1 November 1989.  On receipt of a properly completed form, the inspector will refund any tax due to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Should the taxpayer remain unemployed he may submit, at four weekly intervals, further claims for repayment of tax deducted in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the policy changes which the Government propose to reduce unemployment and emigration, having regard to the following facts: (a) that 156,000 people have left the country in the five years to April, 1989 according to the Central Statistics Office (b) that the actual number of people at work in the past year has dropped according to recently published Central Statistics Office figures and (c) that 232,000 persons are on the register for unemployment for the month of September 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policies on employment are clearly set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>National Development Plan</i> and the <i>Programme for Government.</i>  The focus of policy is to create the conditions in the <Col N="2057" /> economy that lead to improved competitiveness and continuing growth in sustainable employment.  An analysis of the evidence shows that these policies are succeeding.</P>
      <P>The preliminary results of the 1989 labour force survey show that total employment in April last was 10,000 higher than in April, 1987.  Given the fall of 20,000 in public sector employment over this period, this points to a very buoyant performance from private sector employment.  The evidence since April suggests that employment is continuing to improve.  Data from the CSO show that the seasonally adjusted level of employment in manufacturing was 1,200 higher in June compared to March. Building employment is also expanding rapidly with the index for larger firms in the year to September up almost 11 per cent.  Services employment is likely to be performing strongly given the excellent tourist season and buoyant domestic economic activity due to increased investment and consumer spending.</P>
      <P>The level of unemployment is falling in response to these favourable employment developments.  The seasonally adjusted level of unemployment at end-October was over 9,000 lower than at the beginning of the year.  The actual number on the live register is now 13,000 lower than the level a year ago.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Government's policies on employment and job creation are working and it is the Government's intention to continue to pursue these successful policies.</P>
      <P>Sustainable growth in employment is, in the final analysis, the only viable approach to tackling unemployment and emigration.</P>

It was the intention of the management regime which had been agreed with the fishing industry for this fishery that it would be exploited in such a way that it could have remained open until into December.

      <P>In the three months to August 1989, the consumer price index increased by 1.4 per cent.  Of that increase, food accounted for 0.6 percentage points and housing accounted for 0.3 percentage points.  The increase in housing costs of 0.3 percentage points was largely due to the increase in mortgage interest which accounted for 0.26 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Act, I introduced a variety of measures which gave low income families substantial increases in income.  For example, a person on long-term unemployment assistance with a spouse and five children received an increase of £12.90 bringing their weekly payment, including child benefit to £145.90.  As part of the social welfare package, the Government also tackled the problem faced by families of workers on low incomes through a special scheme of tax exemption, together with improvements in child benefit and family income supplement.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to improving the living standard of social welfare recipients and special increases will continue to be provided for those on the lowest payments, depending on the resources available.</P>

      <P>I understand that under the community milk cessation scheme milk producers who surrender their milk quotas may be entitled to receive payments under this scheme provided they discontinue milk production for seven years or while the super-levy remains in <Col N="2087" /> force.  Under these schemes, payments to eligible persons will be made in seven annual instalments.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme the reckonable income to be determined for the purposes of the award of a grant is gross income from all sources of the candidate and his/her parents, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding, also, children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings, if any, of the candidate and payments under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department have indicated to the local authorities, who administer the higher education grants scheme, that for the purpose of determining reckonable income under this scheme, payments under the milk cessation scheme, Parts 1 or 2, should be included in the reckonable income of the year it is received.</P>
