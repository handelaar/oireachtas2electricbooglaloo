      <P>asked the Taoiseach the policy matters which were discussed at the recent meeting with the ICMSA.</P>

      <P>The policy matters which were discussed at the meeting which the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I had with representatives of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association on 1 November 1989 are outlined in the joint Government/ICMSA statement that issued after the meeting. The statement is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach outlined the content and objectives of the <i>National Development Plan</i> to the representatives of the ICMSA on that occasion, did they express views on whether they now accept the <i>National Development Plan</i> and its objectives which they did not agree with or sign at its inception?  Are the ICMSA now in agreement with the <i>National Development Plan</i> in as far as it relates to farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to act as spokesman for the ICMSA but I think the general position is they support the National Development Plan, or perhaps more specifically the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is <Col N="3" /> well aware that the ICMSA have campaigned vociferously for many years against tax on accounts.  Was this matter discussed and what were their proposed alternatives in the form of a land tax or produce tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the positions of both of us are well known in that regard. The Government are firmly committed to the taxation of farmers on the same basis as the rest of the community.  The ICMSA have their own policy in regard to farmer taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Taoiseach said that the matter was discussed. Given that from the EC support mechanisms at present in place 20 per cent of producers get over 80 per cent of the benefits, will the Taoiseach be working with the ICMSA to bring about change in this position for the benefit of small farmers in particular?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the figures given by the Deputy, but an important thrust of Government agricultural policy is to promote the best interests of the small farmer, and particularly the small family farm, in every way.  In that regard we have the support of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has decided to answer this question from Deputy Spring, as indeed he should have, why did he then transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food a question I put down to him asking whether the consultative machinery that is being set up by the ICMSA and the IFA on the one hand and the Government on the other hand represents in any sense a departure from the process set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to delays in the production of books of evidence in criminal cases as a result of inadequate staffing levels in the Chief State Solicitor's Office; to the fact that these delays are threatening proceedings against persons accused of serious offences; the number of solicitors currently working in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor; if it is intended to increase such numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the backlog of work in the Chief State Solicitor's Office causing indefinite delays in producing books of evidence for the Director of Public Prosecutions which in turn result in defendants being held in custody for weeks before a trial date can be given; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The number of solicitors at present serving in the Chief State Solicitor's Office is 28.  Provision is being made in the 1990 Estimates for an additional £270,000 for extra staff in that Office and the Office of the Attorney General. Arrangements are also in hands for the immediate recruitment of ten temporary solicitors and two technical staff, and a review is at present in progress of the staffing needs of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that of the 28 assigned to the Chief State Solicitor's Office only two on most occasions, occasionally more, are made available or assigned for the purpose of dealing with books of evidence cases and that because of the huge workload these people are expected to carry books of evidence are not being presented to court in time and, as a result, persons charged with serious offences are being released from the court?  This is not simply a new <Col N="5" /> development but is a pattern that occurs from time to time because of the crisis in staffing in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that the immediate recruitment of ten temporary solicitors and two temporary technical staff is in hand and there is a general review of the staffing needs of the Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate how many of those ten, together with the technical staff he talks about, will be specifically assigned for the purpose of relieving in whole or in part the huge workload that is expected of those dealing in the District Court prosecution area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The internal distribution of resources of that kind is a matter for the Chief State Solicitor himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with me that the real problem has been created by the reduction in numbers in the grade of legal technician through wastage, transfer or leave of absence and they are not being replaced?  Is he aware that at least seven have gone in a very short period and this work is either being farmed out to barristers and solicitors at a very inflated cost which apparently is not meeting the time-table in which these specialists could do the work?  The grades should be brought up to the former levels at least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think that the whole judicial system is being brought into disrepute and, indeed, we set a very bad example to everybody, and particularly our near neighbours, by allowing persons to languish in prisons without trial for long periods?  Would he move as quickly as possible to see that people can be brought to trial and dates given to them as quickly as possible?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach to take a particular interest in this problem and keep the matter under constant surveillance, particularly having regard to what Deputy Kavanagh has said regarding the fact that persons are allowed to go free, including persons who are wanted on extradition charges in other jurisdictions?  On occasion their cases are not processed as readily and as quickly as we would expect because of staff shortages and will he agree to keep the matter under review?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a number of elections have taken place over the last couple of years that may have disrupted the Taoiseach's intentions in that area, would it now be a good time, if necessary, to set up a committee comprising the heads of Departments or a committee of the House to investigate the possibility of such an honours list? Would he confirm that there is general acceptance of the need for such an award in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Taoiseach has said, would he take the initiative and ask the Whips to have initial consultations?  In the context of the Presidency of the European Community, he might see his way to progress the idea further.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in respect of women's affairs for which his Department have responsibility, if he will indicate the following: (i) the terms of reference of his role (ii) the budget allocation which he has to carry out his functions (iii) the total staff involved both full-time and part-time in carrying out his functions and (iv) whether he intends to publish a White Paper or policy document outlining the activities which he will pursue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The achievement of equal status and equal opportunities for women is a matter which arises across the whole range of Government policy-making. For this reason, the terms of reference of all members of the Government are to advance the position and status of women in all aspects of their responsibilities.  My Department's role, which is exercised by Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of equality between women and men in all areas of Government policy.  My Department also make an annual grant to the Council for the Status of Women amounting in the current year to £93,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> The economic and social policy division of my Department, which has a total staff complement of 11 persons, has responsibility for reporting to the Minister of State in respect of her monitoring role in this area as well as for a wide range of other functions in the economic and social fields.</P>
    <P>In addition to the responsibilities of all Ministers and of the Minister of State to which I have referred, the Government are committed to the establishment of a second Commission on the Status of Women to draw up a set of programmes and measures to continue the work of achieving equality and promoting the status of women.  The different aspects of the establishment of the commission are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I would like clarification on three points if he has the information available.  Do I take it that other than the specific grant of £93,000 to the Council for the Status of Women there is no other money specifically ear-marked for women's affairs and that this section is combined with other functions for which the Minister of State has responsibility?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 8 and Questions Nos. 18 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency will be established by primary legislation and it is intended that it will be operational in 1990.  While detailed <Col N="11" /> legislative proposals have yet to be considered by the Government, it is envisaged that the agency will have specific statutory functions relating to the following: the control and regulation of development likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality; general monitoring of environmental quality; support, back-up and advisory services for local authorities and other public bodies, and the co-ordination and conduct of environmental research.</P>
    <P>Firm decisions will soon be taken on the constitution and form of the agency and the method of appointment of its members but I can assure Deputies that it is intended to provide for procedures which will be seen to guarantee the independence and competence of the organisation. The agency will be a fully independent and dynamic body with the necessary expertise and sophisticated equipment to enable it to carry out its functions effectively.</P>
    <P>Decisions on the location of the agency, staff numbers and operational budgets would be premature at this stage. However, I can tell the House the Estimates for 1990 include a specific allocation of £0.5 million to meet initial start-up costs for next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be in order to thank the Minister of State for answering the question.  I think I am correct in saying it is the first time she has been in a position to answer such a question. Does she not think that an allocation at this stage, of a provisional sum, subject to the publication of the Estimates to provide for start-up cost of £500,000 is grossly inadequate?  In relation to the amount of moneys that would be made available to carry out the functions which she has described, can I take it that the existing amount of money, which is approximately £3.2 million in the environment Estimates for 1989, will be transferred in whole to the budget of the environmental protection agency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be for me to announce today how the exact funding <Col N="12" /> of the agency was to be decided.  The Government are anxious that much of the funding will come from those who are posing major threats to the environment and, as a result, this agency has to be established.  The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is something which this Government are endeavouring to enshrine in this legislation.  Obviously, where central funding is required, it will be available through additional resources and through the diversion of existing resources to the agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment when he envisages that Dublin will be a smog-free city; the further steps he proposes to take to bring that about; in particular, if he has any proposals to ban the sale of bituminous coal in Dublin; if he has any proposals to subsidise the installation of natural gas central heating systems on a capital basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 20 and 198 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have confirmed the special control area orders, Ballyfermot B and the special control area order Ballyfermot C which were made by Dublin Corporation. This brings a total of almost 5,000 houses in the Ballyfermot area within smoke control areas.  I have modified both orders which now provide that householders in the special control areas may burn any fuels specified in the orders and any &ldquo;authorised fuel&rdquo; and any other fuel, provided it is burnt in an &ldquo;authorised fireplace&rdquo;.  The provision for an &ldquo;authorised fireplace&rdquo; has been included in the orders so as to allow for the possibility that suitable appliances may be put forward for use in the smoke control areas. However, I have no proposals to make regulations in relation to &ldquo;authorised fireplace&rdquo;; in particular, having regard to the evidence presented at the oral hearing, and the report thereon, I do not propose to authorise the appliance known as the full burning fire, distributed <Col N="14" /> by Coal Distributors Limited, as an authorised fireplace for use in Ballyfermot special control areas B and C.</P>
    <P>I have specified 31 May 1990 as the date on which the two orders are to come into operation.  This takes account of section 41 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 which provides that an order cannot come into operation earlier than six months after it is confirmed.</P>
    <P>The Government are making £3 million available in 1990 on top of £1 million provided in 1989 to help householders meet the costs of any heating adaptations necessary in order to comply with the requirements of special control area orders.  Grant schemes will now apply in relation to Ballyfermot Areas B and C, along the lines of the scheme which already applies in Ballyfermot Area A. Grants will be available until 31 May 1990 to allow conversions to be carried out before the two orders take effect.  It will be open to householders to avail of the grant-assisted option of their choice.  Full details of the scheme will be made available to householders from Dublin Corporation, who will be making the necessary arrangements for publicising the schemes and for processing grant applications.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the data now available, and in particular the May 1989 Eolas report which detailed the results of an intensive programme of baseline smoke emission tests on certain solid fuels and appliances, including the full burning fire, the Minister for the Environment has revoked regulations made in 1988 which declared that fireplace to be an authorised fireplace for the purposes of the Ballyfermot, Area A, special control area.  The fireplace may not therefore be used for burning bituminous coals or any fuel other than the specified &ldquo;smokeless&rdquo; or low smoke fuels and grants will not be paid in respect of it.  However grants will remain available in respect of a range of suitable heating options, and householders in Area A who may now wish to convert to one of these systems will be able to avail of these grants.</P>
    <P>A further special control area order in relation to more than 2,500 houses in <Col N="15" /> Ballyfermot Area D remains to be confirmed. Objections have been made to this order and if these are not withdrawn, arrangements for an oral hearing will be put in train without delay.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the provisions of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 in relation to special control area orders as a matter of urgency with a view to determining what amendments of the Act might be proposed in order to simplify procedures and to speed up the making, confirmation and commencement of special control area orders.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage a switch to cleaner fuels, and to inform the public of the options available, I am launching a comprehensive media campaign this week using television, radio, press, and billboards.  In addition, an information leaflet prepared in the Department will be delivered to each home in the Dublin area, beginning today.  This media campaign will continue over the winter months.  Individual householders may get additional information on the options available by contacting the Energy/ Environment hotline.</P>
    <P>I am also making regulations under section 53 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 in order to ensure that smokeless and low smoke solid fuels are available at all outlets where solid fuels are retailed.  At my request, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has agreed to request the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to look urgently into the price structure of coalite as compared with coal.</P>
    <P>Further measures to deal with the short term and long term aspects of the smoke pollution problem, including measures such as those suggested by Deputy Spring, are being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree <Col N="16" /> that the manner in which the Government have approached this problem so far has been a shambles?  Would she further agree that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, made a very serious error in originally including the full burning fire in the Ballyfermot A order?  Would she also agree that the leaflets with the heading &ldquo;Smog Busters&rdquo; which are to be put through everybody's door are not really part of a smog busting campaign but rather a matter of the Minister and her colleagues hiding behind a public relations smog screen? Would the Minister agree that what we have heard today and her announcement yesterday amounts to no more than the fact that two additional orders are being made for the Ballyfermot area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concluding now and I have been a great deal more brief than the Minister was in her reply.  Can the Minister indicate to the House in what way this announcement, which still confines conversion grants to a portion of Ballyfermot, will help people in Crumlin, Finglas, Rathmines and other areas which are affected by smog?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Shatter responds to campaigns which are about to be launched, he should wait to find out what is said.  He responded yesterday two hours before my Department issued a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help him if he waited since then he might know exactly what we are doing.  I would not agree that the campaign is a shambles.  As Deputy Shatter knows, there are problems with <Col N="17" /> the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and I hope to be in a position shortly after Christmas to bring forward amendments.  If we are to solve the smoke problem in Dublin it will cost all of us money.  Let us not kid ourselves.  There is no inexpensive, cheap way of doing it.  We will all have to make sacrifices and I hope we will be prepared to do so.  In relation to the campaign launched yesterday, it is not true that I simply confirmed two orders.  A total of £3 million is to be made available in grants and regulations are to be made for people to stock fuels.  This is part of an ongoing process.  A prices inquiry is to be established by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is asking the Fair Trade Commission to review the price of coalite as opposed to coal.  Regarding the media campaign, the public want information. My Department and the Department of Energy are inundated with requests for information on this matter. It is right that we should inform them.  In the circumstances the Minister for the Environment was right to include the full burning fire because until Eolas made the full report available in May this year we were not in a position to establish the exact status of the coal burning fire.  In those circumstances it would have been irresponsible of the Minister not to include it.</P>

The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Regulations, 1982 oblige landlords to provide tenants of formerly controlled dwellings with rent books.

Is he aware that those most vulnerable in this respect are single, ageing citizens, young students and workers? Would the Minister confirm that the position as outlined by Threshold is not being given any serious consideration? Furthermore, is he aware that very often tenants are intimidated when they attempt to demand of landlords their rights to receipts or rent books, resulting in many cases &mdash; with particular respect to this vulnerable section of the community &mdash; in their being given notice to quit on account of such attempts?

      <P>In view of the statement made by the Minister for the Environment in the House in March last that he did not want to do anything which would lead to the withdrawal of accommodation from the market, discourage investment and so on, would the Minister of State now agree that it appears to be Government policy to continue to encourage the black economy and the resultant massive tax evasion resulting from the absence of such rent books?</P>

      <P>I am giving full and careful consideration to the objections made to the order, the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and the report of the person who held the inquiry.  I will give my decision on the order at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assist the House by explaining how her senior Minister has had this order on his desk for almost two years?  Would she say how this delay can be reconciled with the newfound concern for the environment within her Department?  Furthermore, would she confirm that in the time this order remained on the Minister's desk a controversial development application was granted in respect of approximately 93 houses, the effect of which will be to despoil the valley and that, while the Minister continues to delay, another such application is anticipated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to assist the House.  I presume the reason for the delay is that the issues involved are complex. That is the reason the Minister for the Environment has not been in a position to take a decision before now.  I understand he promised to visit the area. I have spoken to him about this matter. I am anxious that a decision be taken. Without indicating my view here I should say I did do so when the matter came before the local authority of which I am a member.  Hopefully a decision can be taken very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that two years and two months have elapsed since the public local inquiry was held would the Minister agree that while procrastination is the thief of time, there was a period during which theft of this magnitude would have merited at least transportation to Van Diemen's Land? Would the Minister explain to the House exactly what are the circumstances which <Col N="28" /> preclude the Minister for the Environment from travelling the few miles down the Lucan by-pass to take a look at this site and say what are the real considerations which merit delay in arriving at a decision in relation to this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the original sponsor in November, 1983, advocating the special amenity order would be brought forward, might I urge the Minister of State to impress on her senior Minister that there is now great potential for the linear park development as a consequence of the toll bridge going over the valley?  The council are putting together the various elements of the linear park so that a special amenity order would be effective and should be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House the further assurance that applications similar to that at Riversdale &mdash; which got through the net since the local public inquiry was held &mdash; will not get through the net before a final decision is taken on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for the Environment informed the House on 9 March 1989, Galway County Council submitted a proposal for this area for inclusion under the 1989 small schemes programme.  As the proposal would cost in excess of the limit of £50,000, it was not possible to consider it under this programme.  The council submitted a revised proposal on 10 November last and this is being examined in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that effluent from the Headford sewerage scheme is untreated, that it flows into Limnaugh Bay on the Corrib river one mile from the town and that two major group water schemes draw their water supplies from that bay?  This is a matter of urgency and it is not a question of saying that because the scheme did not qualify for inclusion under the 1989 small schemes programme the work should not be done. This work should be carried out as a matter of urgency.  There is a risk factor to the health of those people who draw their water supplies from Limnaugh Bay into which the Headford stream runs one mile from the untreated sewerage at Headford town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the existing service in the Headford area is not adequate and is causing pollution to the Headford stream.  My colleague, the Minister for Energy, has made me more than aware of this.  I agree it is a priority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is misleading to say that it is causing pollution only to the Headford stream; it is also causing pollution to Limnaugh Bay on Lough Corrib.  This lake is the source of water supply for all of Galway city and Limnaugh Bay is the source of water supply for two large group water schemes, one with over 10,000 members and the other with over 600 members.  The Annaghdown water scheme and the <Col N="34" /> Caherlistrane-Kilcoonagh group water schemes draw their water directly from Limnaugh Bay into which untreated sewerage flows.  It is not good enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the research, if any, which has been undertaken in the last three years into measures to reduce casualties from road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Research relating to road accidents in this country is centred on establishing total casualty figures with particular emphasis on identifying the main causes of the accidents, the risk factors associated with each of the identified road user categories and devising appropriate countermeasures.</P>
      <P>This ongoing programme is related to the annual &ldquo;Road Accident Facts Ireland&rdquo; publication which is prepared by the Environmental Research Unit on the basis of reports compiled by the gardaí. Copies of these annual publications are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the assessment of these reports, the appropriateness of specific measures targeted at reducing child, pedestrian, pedal cycle, motor cycle and <Col N="35" /> lorry casualties are examined on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Research relates to a wide range of areas including the locations of accident blackspots, monitoring of the skid resistance, regularity and intrinsic strength of road surfaces, extent of seat belt usage, speed limits, cycle priority measures, use of laminated windscreens, side guards, rear under-run devices, special traffic warning signs at approaches to schools, &ldquo;rumble strips&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-vehicle&rdquo; signs for heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in effect telling the House that the major research carried out in his Department on the question of casualties from road accidents is the monitoring of statistics in connection with road accidents?  Can the Minister tell the House exactly how much his Department have spent in carrying out this research, the positive results which have emanated from it, the action being taken to bring about a reduction in road casualties, the action being taken in relation to drunk driving, providing rumble strips, lay-bys, the control of articulated trucks, etc.?  What are the results of the research?  How much money is being spent on research?  What is being done as a result of research? Would the Minister agree that furnishing statistics will not save one child from being knocked down and injured on the road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence for some time past is that the returns on the number of road accidents in Ireland bear a favourable comparison with returns from EC countries.  In 1987, the last year for which full figures are available, the ratio of road deaths per 10,000 of the population is 1.3, which is lower than the Community average of 1.5.  Only Holland and the United Kingdom had a lower ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that he is satisfied with the present position and nothing further needs to be done? Could the Minister tell us how much <Col N="36" /> money is being spent in his Department on research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to give the Deputy the figure of what is being spent on research.  However, the Deputy can appreciate that we would like to see fewer road accidents.  With traffic controls and traffic wardens and through our advertising campaign we have tried to bring about a position where road accident figures are as low as they possibly can be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that to say our statistics are as good as other European countries indicates that in his mind there is an acceptable level of traffic casualties?  Would the Minister further agree that it must be our aim to reduce the number of casualties on our roads?  Would the Minister indicate whether he and the Department intend to take any new initiatives?  For example, is it intended to make the wearing of seat belts in the back seats of cars compulsory? Does the Minister intend to take any special measures to deal with drunk driving?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, nobody could be happy with the accident ratio. However, it is our intention to improve it as best we can.  We have laws on drunk driving and it is a matter for the law to enforce them.  As I pointed out already, <Col N="37" /> we now employ school wardens.  We launched an advertising campaign which has increased public awareness.  The Garda implement the speed limits.  We have laws to take the necessary action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 26, 38 and 190 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary object of waste disposal policy is to ensure that all wastes, and particularly any hazardous wastes, are safely disposed of without risk to public health or to the environment.  In furtherance of this objective, and bearing in <Col N="39" /> mind developments at the international level, it is necessary to aim at achieving, as far as possible, self-sufficiency in hazardous waste disposal within a realistic time scale.  The provision of a hazardous waste incineration facility is a key element of the necessary waste disposal infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Five consortia have recently submitted detailed proposals to my Department for the provision of a facility for the incineration of hazardous waste on a contract basis.  These proposals are being examined at present but I cannot say, at this stage, when a decision may be reached. It would not be appropriate at this stage to name the consortia involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the location, of such a facility, it has been made clear at all stages that site selection will be a matter for the proposer subject to the requirement to obtain all necessary permits, permissions, and licences under planning and environmental law.  In addition, the environmental impact assessment procedure would apply in relation to a proposal of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the quantity of toxic waste being produced in this country warrants the construction of an incinerator?  Would it not be better to apply a European solution, and that a number of incinerators in existing locations could be used as the level of toxic waste produced is very small?  Could I also suggest that instead of leaving the siting of the incinerator to the developer it would be more in the national and safety interests if it was indicated to the developer that the incinerator should be sited nearest to the point of the greatest production of toxic waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the amount of toxic waste being produced is very small &mdash; 52,000 tonnes per year. However, developments at international and EC level require that we be self-sufficient. I do not think we will be able to continue exporting our waste forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> The recent Basle Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste enshrines the principle of eliminating cross-border movements of hazardous waste, in so far as this is feasible. I believe it would be unrealistic of this country not to provide &mdash; although the amount of waste is small &mdash; some form of incineration.</P>
    <P>On the question of site location, I do not think it would be appropriate to select the site centrally.  It has been made clear all along that that would be a matter for the proposer who, of course, would be subject to strict planning controls and the requirements of an environmental impact assessment study.  Those procedures will be sufficient to ensure that an appropriate site is found.</P>

      <P>Have the Government decided that the waste disposal unit will be hived off to private enterprise?  Are the Government not prepared to consider setting up a public authority to deal with this?  Could the Minister clarify for the House the position regarding the site at Baldonnel, County Dublin, which was once proposed for the incinerator?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a suitable site. Deputy Taylor asked if this would be left to the private sector.  Because of the low quantity of waste involved some incentive will have to be given as it would not be economic for the private sector. Because of the difficulties in this area the Minister for the Environment felt it was appropriate to seek tenders from the private sector for the provision of this facility.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State is aware since the time Britain refused to accept our asbestos and industrial waste we have found an outlet in France. However, because of the extreme cost in shipping this waste to France cowboys are getting in on the act and undercutting legitimate contractors.  There is also a temptation for these cowboys to dump illegally asbestos stripped from old factories and other locations.  Is the Minister of State aware of this problem and what does she intend to do about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the failure of the Department to locate or identify a site for a toxic waste incinerator is nothing more than a piece of political buck passing to whoever is the suitable tenderer so that the Minister can wash his hands of making any decision on this matter?  Will the Minister of State agree that given the failure of the Department to identify a site, it is unlikely that this project will go ahead and would she indicate in the light of her statement that an environmental impact assessment will be required when the necessary domestic legislation will be brought into force to give effect to the EC directive on environmental impact assessments so that if such a project does happen to make progress it will do so within the law prescribed by the EC and the environmental impact assessment will fulfil the requirements of the EC directive?</P>

      <P>Even though the final part of the Deputy's question is a separate question I can confirm that the necessary regulations to have the environmental impact assessment enshrined on a statutory basis will be ready in a matter of weeks; certainly well in advance of <Col N="44" /> Christmas.  In answer to the earlier part of the Deputy's question, which suggested that the decision on the site should be made centrally, I disagree.  I think a unilateral decision of the Minister for the Environment to impose this site in a particular area would be going over the heads of the planning authority and would be highly improper.  It is for the local planning authority to decide on the appropriateness having regard to the question of whether a site is suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the major accident plan which is in being to deal with major accidents in the event of their occurring; and if he will outline any specific plans drawn up to deal with specific disasters that could occur such as a train carrying toxic chemicals crashing and releasing such chemicals into the atmosphere or a major motorway or air disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the adoption of a common framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies by the Government in 1984, major emergency plans are drawn up by each of the following agencies: the Garda, health boards and local authorities.  The relevant local authorities have all drawn up major emergency plans and these set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the functions of the different agencies involved, procedural and other arrangements to ensure effective co-ordination and control both within individual services and on an inter-service basis and details of activation procedures and contact points for the organisations concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contents of these plans are generic in character and are therefore applicable <Col N="45" /> to all types of major emergency.  I understand, however, that an inter-departmental committee operating under the aegis of the Minister for Tourism and Transport has drawn up a special plan arising from the carriage of dangerous substances by rail.  This plan, which would normally be activated by Iarnród Éireann, is compatible with the overall emergency planning framework to which I have already referred.</P>

      <P>No.  In respect of the Trustee Savings Bank Bill the Whips met last Thursday and in the light of information then available we agreed to a proposal that the time should be ordered as set out in the Order Paper.  Since then the Minister, Fine Gael.  The Workers' Party and the Labour Party have all tabled substantial amendments to this Bill, the core issues of which are dealt with in the latter sections.  They are the sections designed to facilitate the privatisation of the Trustee Savings Bank.

      <P>I support the remarks of Deputy McCartan and point out to the Taoiseach and to the House that this most important Bill, involving something like £1,000 million worth of public assets in the Trustee Savings Banks, will enable the Minister, on his own account, to privatise them.

      <P>On the Order of Business, there is a request that I would like to make of the Taoiseach.  We understand that President Mitterrand has arranged <Col N="250" /> a meeting of European Community Heads of State on Saturday next to discuss the emerging situation in East Germany and perhaps other issues.  Will the Taoiseach consider making time available in this House between now and Thursday evening so that, in advance of his attendance at that meeting, this House could debate the issue and give the Taoiseach our views, because I am sure that all of us would want to make statements on the developments we see <Col N="251" /> in Eastern Europe.  An hour and a half or two hours should suffice to give this House an opportunity to make its views known.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1989, copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 8th day of November 1989.</P>
      <P>This motion, which was to give effect to an increase in bovine diseases levies from 1 August 1989, was, in fact, put before this House and agreed on 20 July 1989. However, as the Seanad had risen at that time, it was not possible to have the earlier motion approved in that House.  A motion now giving effect to the levy increases from 1 December 1989 was approved by the Seanad on 9 November 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, and are designed to secure an increased financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The proposal to increase the rates of levy has the full backing of the farming organisations.  The rates of reactor grant under the disease eradication schemes were originally revised as from 1 February 1989.  The revised rates at that time were fixed so that ERAD could continue to work within its fixed budget.  However, an analysis carried out some months afterwards showed clearly that the rates then fixed had, for some categories of animals, fallen significantly out of line with their market value.  It became clear that the inadequacy of the level of reactor compensation would be a serious impediment to progress on disease eradication.  The ERAD board, therefore, recommended a fresh adjustment of the rates of grant and also proposed that any increases should be borne jointly by the Exchequer and the farming community.  The farm organisations accepted that approach and expressed their willingness to support an increase <Col N="267" /> in the bovine diseases levies and thereby fund their share of the increased grants. The new rates of levy from 1 December 1989 will be 1.2 pence per gallon of milk processed and £6.90 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live.  The expected yield from the levies this year is £21.4 million.</P>
    <P>The increased levy receipts will be used to finance the increased reactor and depopulation grants together with the new income supplement introduced as from 1 February 1989.  The increased reactor grants focus on the small to medium sized animals where it is recognised that the greatest need for increased compensation arises.  The special income supplement applies in cases where total depopulation of the herd is not appropriate or warranted but where a disease breakdown still results in the removal of more than 10 per cent of animals from the herd.  Payment of the supplement is confined to herds of 100 animals or less and I think it greatly alleviates hardship suffered by individual farmers in many cases.  Expenditure on grants paid to farmers is expected to come to about £16.0 million during this year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the establishment of ERAD has proved to be a successful initiative, bringing together all interested parties to provide a clear, coherent and co-operative approach to the disease eradication schemes.  To achieve the target set for ERAD of halving the existing bovine TB levels over four years, a more intensive and sharply focused programme is being implemented.  Following a detailed appraisal by the board of the operations and resources of the bovine TB and brucellosis schemes a comprehensive eradication strategy has been developed. The various support elements of the schemes have been revised and reinforced and some new elements have been added.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most noteworthy aspects of the ERAD regime is the inauguration of a significantly expanded research effort concentrating on the following major areas of interest: continuing <Col N="268" /> analysis of the extensive data base on bovine TB being built up by ERAD with a view to evaluating the impact of alternative testing strategies and leading to the provision of a more effective epidemiological back-up; the development of blood-based diagnostic tests to supplement the existing field tests; the spread of TB from badgers to cattle.  In this regard, ERAD commissioned an ESRI review of existing information on the present state of knowledge on the relationships between badgers and bovine TB in Ireland.  In addition, a major project has been initiated in east Offaly to quantify the contribution of badgers to bovine TB.  Other related projects currently under way include studies of the colony and population distribution of badgers, as well as trials to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine in controlling the spread of TB from badgers to cattle. Also, a TB investigation unit to undertake continuous and comprehensive analysis of bovine TB in Ireland has been established.  Routine disease data is being analysed in a comprehensive fashion to provide a full understanding of the results and to assist in setting targets and adjusting the programme accordingly; and a research/analysis group, comprising representatives of the veterinary college, Teagasc, veterinary research laboratories, private veterinary practitioners and ERAD staff is continuing to advise on the further development of the research programme.</P>
    <P>The increases in the levels of compensation announced by the board of ERAD in May 1989 and backdated to 1 February are very generous and represent concrete evidence of the commitment of the farming community and the Government to the success of the initiative in setting up ERAD.  There must now be full concentration on ensuring that the targets set for the reduction of bovine TB levels are achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the increase sought in the disease levy serves as a useful opportunity to reflect on our dismal record in regard to efforts to rid <Col N="269" /> the national herd of TB and brucellosis. Unfortunately, I must speak within the time constraints imposed on the debate. For over 30 years the Department of Agriculture, led by various Ministers, have tried unsuccessfully to rid this country of a disease which has already cost over £1 billion.  Failure to come to terms with TB could seriously damage our export market, not to mention the financial hardship it is causing thousands of farmers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of ERAD and I believe the composition of its board ensures that all interests are represented. The media splash on their inception, which did not find favour with farmers anywhere, was their easiest task and there are many testing times ahead for ERAD.  They have a very short time within which to answer conclusively a number of pertinent questions which relate to the core problems of the TB eradication scheme.  I will put these four problems to the House, hoping that I may get a more extensive opportunity at a later date.  Most of what the Minister had to say has been heard many times before. Everybody who has any commitment to agriculture hopes that the ERAD board will succeed.  Even allowing for the surveys and other matters mentioned by the Minister, he did not refer to three or four important matters which, if not tackled, will not rid the country of TB.</P>
      <P>Have we a uniform method of reading the TB test results at farm level?  Does the interpretation of the reaction to the tuberculin vary from one farm to another and from one area to another?  Can we be sure that we have a correct and uniform interpretation?  Second, can ERAD advise me as to why they do not use tuberculin of the same strength in all tests?  For the first test, which is a screening test, why is the tuberculin only half the strength of that used in a reactor herd?  It is only reasonable to ask why the same level of tuberculin is not used all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third question is perhaps the most important.  Are ERAD convinced that TB is spread laterally to the degree it is supposed to be?  I was always led to <Col N="270" /> believe that the lateral spread of TB caused the problem, in other words that it was spread from one animal to another. That could be right but I should like to know what conclusive research there is to prove that animals contaminated with the disease pass it on to healthy cattle with whom they are intermixed and how quickly this occurs.  When I have looked at surveys of tests I have never been able to get a conclusive answer regarding lateral spread.  I could not agree more regarding the need for research and I sincerely hope that it will be carried out, not merely talked about.</P>
    <P>The increase in the levy is unfortunate, coming at a time when cattle are losing £100 per head.  There is a litany of levies to be paid by the farmer when he gets his cheque from the factory.  Farmers are waiting with bated breath to see if ERAD will succeed where nobody has yet been successful.  Unless the four questions I have asked can be answered positively we will be no better off than we have been for the past 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be conscious of what the public regard as a major scandal, namely that we have spent in excess of £1,000 million on the eradication of brucellosis and bovine TB, yet they still persist despite that great expenditure of public money.  We should also be very conscious that it is not just farmers who are affected by these diseases.  All the public are affected and the meat industry is affected, as is the dairy industry.  Cold storage and haulage are directly affected as well.  All of us as consumers are affected and we have a clear interest in putting the matter right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask why our incidence of disease is ten times worse than that in Northern Ireland.  Why are we the worst in Europe despite this massive expenditure? Why did we not have annual testing rather than a stop/go system of eradication?  The main difference between us and our European counterparts is that they have an annual testing scheme.  The Minister must clearly indicate that this is not just another start up <Col N="271" /> and that it will be seen through on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the lack of compulsory permits for movement.  Permits should be required for movement if the testing system is to be effective.  The Minister in a reply earlier this year admitted that there are faults in the testing scheme.  He now proposes a further blood test as well as a skin test and I should like to see money going into further expansion of research and facilities.</P>
    <P>The main change since ERAD were established is that there has been a great deal of advertising telling us how good they are instead of spending the money on research into the causes of our failure even though we spent £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the role of the testers involved.  I rightly question the role of testers who have a vested interest in the outcome of tests and ERAD should look very closely at the involvment of such people in tests.  There is no scientific proof &mdash; although there may be broad statistics in support &mdash; that badgers are the cause of the trouble in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The patience of the taxpayers and farmers is now beginning to run out because of the failure of successive Governments to deal with the problem of bovine diseases.  We are prepared to support the introduction of these new levies but will we back here in another ten years increasing the levies again to fund another campaign of disease eradication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> The operation of the bovine TB eradication scheme was described some years ago by the former Secretary of the Department of Finance and former Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. T.J. Whitaker, as the greatest financial gamble in the history of the State.  It is hard to argue with this description in the light of the huge amount of money spent over the years and the spectacular lack of success.  Twenty-five years ago Deputy Haughey, who was then Minister for Agriculture, claimed that the country was virtually free of TB in cattle.  A quarter of a century later the reality is that we are as far away as ever from achieving that objective.  The cost to the State of this unsuccessful campaign has been enormous; in today's terms over £1,000 million of taxpayers' and farmers' money has been spent and thousands of public servants have had to be deployed in administering the various schemes.  The taxpayers in particular cannot be expected to continue footing this bill indefinitely.  I agree that those who have a vested interest should not make the badger a scapegoat because, as was pointed out, they eradicated bovine tuberculosis in Northern Ireland without having to eliminate the badger.</P>
    <P>A number of vested interests have strongly resisted measures which could have contributed to the more effective tackling of bovine diseases.  About one-third of the money spent each year has gone on veterinary fees.  Fees paid annually to private veterinary practitioners testing under the disease eradication schemes in recent years were as follows: in 1983 the figure was £10.6 million, in 1984 it was £8.3 million, in 1985 it was £11.5 million, in 1986 it was £11 million and in 1987 it was £12 million.  As there are fewer than 1,000 veterinary surgeons in the country it means that in recent years they have been earning an average of £10,000 each per year from disease testing alone.  Much of the work done by veterinary surgeons in this area could just as easily be done by qualified technicians. If a person has a blood sample taken in a hospital, it is usually done by a nurse. Why cannot blood sampling under these <Col N="273" /> schemes be done by properly trained technicians?  When the Bill to establish Teagasc was going through the Dáil last year they were specifically excluded from carrying out disease eradication tests, largely, I understand, as a result of objections from veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>The small number of farmers who continually flout the regulations have a lot to answer for.  They are not only endangering their own livelihood but also the interest of their neighbours and the taxpayers who are footing the bill.  Unless we are prepared to tackle the vested interests in this area we will fail to make progress.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation.  We have about six minutes left, so, with the co-operation of the House, I propose to call Deputy Cotter and then Deputy Carey.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Monaghan is a black spot in relation to the incidence of bovine TB?  Our big worry is that farmers who never had this problem before are now in trouble.  I am speaking of farmers who are good managers and who never buy in cattle.  They have had a very good record over the years but many now find that after a test their herd is locked up.  In some cases when their cattle are sent to the factory there are no lesions, which means that farmers are being heavily penalised for what we consider to be a weakness in the system at the moment.</P>
      <P>The farming community in Monaghan and the veterinary surgeons have lost confidence in the testing system which now applies and the Minister should immediately carry out an inquiry to find out why there is such a serious problem in Monaghan, much more serious than in any other county.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  One must admire the way in <Col N="274" /> which you utilised time in this debate, you have done a very good job.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight a particular difficulty in my constituency.  Since the State started to investigate bovine TB, north Clare has never been clear.  That is not the case in the rest of the country, as all the other counties have had at least one disease-free period.  In north Clare there has been a continued incidence of the disease and I have appealed to successive Ministers to declare that area a black-spot. Special attention should be given to north Clare and grants given to enable farmers and other people involved to be enthusiastic about the complete eradication of disease so that we might get at least one short period free of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>Amounts paid by individuals are minimal compared with the costs incurred by those whose herds are abolished on account of the incidence of the disease.  There must be something frightfully wrong with the methods we have been using for 30-odd years to eradicate this disease since we are now no freer of TB within our herds than we were on commencement.</P>
      <P>Before embarking on a programme to eradicate badgers we should undertake somewhat more research into the strain of TB affecting the badger and that affecting cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was damn lucky.  In fact, my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, was luckier still.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that lateral spread plays a major role in the breakdown of eradication. There is increasing evidence to that effect.  Additionally, wildlife involvement is recognised to be a cause of some difficulty.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to badgers, contending that they may be a contributory factor in the spread of the disease, and advocated that they should be slaughtered, gassed or whatever.  I find that argument very difficult to accept.  I am very supportive of the application for licences on which the wildlife people insist before any are issued.  In some instances if a badger is found to be the cause of the spread of the disease then the process of applying for a licence is gone through.  There will be no wholesale slaughter of that unfortunate animal.</P>
      <P>We now have a full four-year programme in progress.  The matter of interpretation was raised also.  For example, in 1989 the ERAD strategy was based on ensuring that black spot areas are focussed on.  Severe interpretation is applied with regard to all herds in those areas.  Therefore, there is a uniform method applied in the reading of tests in black spot areas throughout the country. A standard interpretation is used in all other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not the same.  I want to tell Deputy Cotter that of course Monaghan is designated as a black spot area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that double-strength tuberculin is used on infected herds only <Col N="276" /> to ensure that animals which may be showing a reduced response can be identified. The TB investigation unit are currently evaluating the use of double-strength tuberculin.  A movement permit system will be introduced from 1991, that is, a computerised movement permit system which will be deployed in the case of all movements of cattle throughout the country at all stages in their adult life, which has been a major weakness of the whole system to date.  Of course, there is another major weakness in overall eradication, that is, that farmers themselves should be much more vigilant.  Indeed, people who stray in and out of farmers' yards, including canvassers at election time, should be compelled to dip their wellington boots in some type of disinfectant solution lest they spread the disease from one farm to another.</P>
    <P>North Clare is another black spot area. The TB investigation unit are due to report on this area soon, hopefully next month.</P>
    <P>Generally that summarises the position in regard to the TB eradication scheme. It has been a sorrowful tale over the past 30 years.  Even lay people could identify elementary weaknesses in the hygiene and operation of the scheme.  It is no wonder that it has not proved to be successful. I am glad that a very serious effort is being made, once and for all, to tackle the eradication of this disease. This will be of great benefit to the farming community and, in turn, to the general taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, line 27, after &ldquo;provisions.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;No order may be made by <Col N="277" /> the Minister, under this section, after the 1st day of July, 1990&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Committee Stage of this Bill is being taken at such an early date.  For many decades now the Trustee Savings Banks have provided a tremendous service to small savers and, since 1968, have not operated only as institutions which take savings on deposit but have also operated and extended some other banking services to many of their depositors.  In recent years they have established a niche for themselves in the market in providing home loans.</P>
    <P>There are now two Trustee Savings Banks only as a result of the recent amalgamations &mdash; the Dublin-Waterford and Cork-Limerick Trustee Savings Banks, which means that this Bill is all the more timely.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the manner in which the Minister has decided to legislate in this matter.  Of course, I have no objection whatsoever to the intent of the Bill, which is to allow the Trustee Savings Banks to extend other banking services to the general public, to operate on a level playing field with the associated banks and building societies, thereby providing necessary competition in the banking sector.  That is the reason I believe there is a certain urgency about the implementation of its provisions.  I asked on a number of occassions, on the Order of Business, when this Bill would be introduced.  While I remain critical of the manner in which the Minister is legislating here, it would be appropriate that the Bill, as amended on Committee and Report Stages, would be implemented at a very early date.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 2 allow the Minister by order to set a commencement date for the Bill in its entirety or portions thereof as he sees fit.  We have had examples in this House of other Bills having been passed by these Houses and of a Minister failing to introduce the necessary orders or regulations to give effect to their provisions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to give the Minister the freedom to implement the provisions of this Bill, in <Col N="278" /> whole or in part, over the next seven months.  But if he has not implemented its provisions by 1 July 1990 he will have to return to these Houses.  Seven months is a reasonable time limit within which the Minister can implement all of its provisions. The precise purpose of my amendment is to put a time limit on the Minister, to ensure that this Bill, which has been in gestation for over nine years, promised by successive Ministers for Finance, requested on numerous occasions in this House, is implemented as soon as possible.  The intent of my amendment is to ensure that this be done at the earliest possible date.  Mid-summer 1990 affords the Minister plenty of time to do so.  I recommend that the Minister accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two completely separate and distinct aspects to this Bill. The first is the expansion of the powers of the trustee savings banks, to enable them to widen their range of activities and compete in the marketplace with the cartel banks.  At present there is no free competition between the banks; they operate as a cartel and each is supportive of the other.  This Bill will give the Trustee Savings Banks the opportunity to provide a complete range of financial services.  This aspect of the Bill is very much to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, there is a second, more sinister, dimension to the Bill which is not to be welcomed at all, that is, the enabling provisions under which the Minister will be empowered to privatise these banks and sell off, without further recourse to the Dáil, these banks to private interests. As I said in my Second Stage speech &mdash; I want to assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle right away that I do not intend to repeat my Second Stage speech here &mdash; the Minister's proposals in this regard are reprehensible and cannot and will never be accepted by the Labour Party.  We intend to fight these proposals in this House in every way we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that issue, I want to highlight the fact that this Bill is being rammed through the Dáil with unseemly haste. This is quite outrageous.  This is a most <Col N="279" /> important Bill involving public assets of upwards of £1,000 million, and containing 65 complex and difficult sections to which 81 amendments have been tabled, some by the Minister and some by the spokespersons of the other parties. We have been told that we will have until 7 o'clock, and a few hours tomorrow morning, to debate the Committee and Remaining Stages.  It is now almost 5.15 p.m. and the reality is that there will be no Report Stage and most of the amendments will not be reached.  It is a highly suspicious factor that such unseemly haste is being adopted by the Government with the connivance of the Fine Gael Party, who, of course, as we know, go along with and support the whole notion of privatisation, hence their failure to support us when the House divided on the issue this afternoon.  That is something which must be highlighted and the public ought to be made aware of what is going on here.</P>
    <P>Why is there this unseemly haste?  The Trustee Savings Banks have traded in this country for 100 years.  Why all of a sudden do they have to be wrapped up and prepared to be sold off to the private interests of the Minister who are waiting in the background to get their greedy and greasy hands on them?  Why does this Bill have to be rushed through in two hours today and a couple of hours tomorrow morning?  Why can we not debate these issues frankly and fully in this House and tease them out?  It is not some trifling, minor matter involving £1 million here or there; we are talking about public assets of £1,000 million plus.  The whole matter is invidious and deeply suspicious.  We want to debate those issues and we will fight to debate them both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as anybody buying or selling money deserves commendation, the Trustee Savings Banks demonstrate something of a social conscience, and I regret that the entire thrust of this Bill is to prepare them for privatisation.  The enabling provisions to which Deputy Taylor referred are the <Col N="280" /> main purpose of the Bill.  We have seen numerous examples across the water of measures which have to be taken in advance of privatisation by the Government of some of the major companies there.  If we were considering in isolation the provisions in this Bill to allow the Trustee Savings Banks to enhance their services and loosen the restrictions on them in the competitive market, I would welcome that in the interests of the consumer, the depositors and people who are clients of the Trustee Savings Banks but I believe it is only a prelude to privatisation.</P>
      <P>This leads me to the amendment suggested by Deputy Noonan, which in normal circumstances I certainly would be disposed to support.  It is unreasonable to put legislation through this House and leave it so open-ended as is suggested in section 2.  However, having regard to what I now perceive to be the line up, I am not so sure that The Workers' Party will lose too much sleep about when the Bill will be enacted.  It is clear that Deputy Noonan and the Fine Gael Party are very much in favour of the end purpose of this Bill, which is to sell off the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
      <P>Having missed Deputy Noonan's contribution on Second Stage, I read with great interest a rather compelling case &mdash; as I read it initially &mdash; against major sections but it now seems that when it comes to the question of adequate time being made available to discuss at least a number of substantive sections.  Fine Gael have decided to revive the Tallaght strategy and to co-operate with the Government in bringing in the guillotine on the time available for a discussion of this Bill.  I regret that that is the case. There was plenty of time during the long summer holidays to devote to matters like this.  It is an impossible demand to make of us in the time now available to deal with these 81 amendments in the detail necessary.  I regret that the decision has been made to treat the debate in this manner.</P>

I concur with much of what Deputy Noonan, in particular, and some of what the other Deputies said.  We must take into account the background to this Bill.</P>
      <P>At present the 1863 Act controls the Trustee Savings Banks and puts them at a complete disadvantage in the financial environment.  It was the Government's wish and desire &mdash; the former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, and the present Minister, Deputy Reynolds, did their utmost in this regard &mdash; to ensure that the Bill would come before the House as quickly as possible.  It is the Government's desire to ensure that there is a level playing field for all financial institutions so that value for money can be given to the citizens of our land.</P>
      <P>I have to take issue with statements made by Deputy Taylor in particular, who used the words &ldquo;sinister&rdquo;, &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;unseemly haste&rdquo;.

      <P>In direct reply to Deputy Noonan, who tabled this amendment and who wishes to limit the commencement of all the provisions of the Bill to 1 July 1990 at the outside, while every effort will be made to implement the Bill as soon as possible, it would not be appropriate to limit it in this way.  In any event, as in the case of the recent Central Bank and Building Societies Acts, the normal commencement provisions do not contain any such limit.  It is normal in legislation like this to allow the Minister the flexibility to introduce enabling orders to bring in the entire Bill or sections of it as quickly as possible and where appropriate.  This amendment, tabled by Deputy Noonan, would limit the power of the Minister to do that and, consequently, we regret we will not be able to accept it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the other Deputies for their comments on my amendment.  I am quite prepared to debate this Bill for as long as necessary. The time is not ordered by the spokespersons for the parties but is ordered by the Whips.  I understand that the Whips had agreed on Thursday last &mdash; certainly before many of these amendments were tabled &mdash; to a certain length of time and I understand the Whips representing the other parties also agreed.  When we in Fine Gael make an agreement we like to stick to it, so on the Order of Business we did not vote against what we had agreed at the Whips' meeting last Thursday. If the other parties feel free to give a commitment on a Thursday and renege on it the following Tuesday, that is their business and I will not cast aspersions on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor has suggested that something sinister is happening and that <Col N="283" /> from his point of view only one section, that is section 58, of the Bill matters.  He is afraid we will not arrive at section 58. When I was studying Latin, the word &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; meant left.  I do not see anything sinister or anything left-wing about the way business is organised in this House, but if that concerns Deputy Taylor and Deputy Rabbitte I am prepared to pull out every amendment up to section 58.  I am prepared to do it now if the other Deputies want to do the same. Alternatively, I am prepared to debate sections up until 7 o'clock this evening and to pull out every amendment up to section 58 and we could start on section 58 at 10.45 a.m. tomorrow.  I am prepared to talk to any of the spokespersons or the Whips later on tonight, if they feel there is an arrangement between the Government and the main Opposition party to prevent them from debating section 58.  I would like to point out to Deputy Rabbitte that there is an amendment in my name to oppose the section, which is the last amendment to section 58.  If there is any fear that this section will not be adequately debated, I am prepared to discuss with them later any mechanism they see desirable to ensure that section 58 is adequately debated.</P>

I am particularly interested in section 5, which I think is a disgraceful section, and the sections which fail to state clearly how interest rates will be arrived at when the Minister for Finance consults the Central Bank.  I am also interested in the section which fails to make arrangements on what proportion of the moneys deposited in the Trustee Savings Banks will be required to be invested with the Minister for Finance, either on deposit or in Government paper.  The present arrangement is 80:20 and I would like to debate the section which leaves it wide open for the Minister and the Central Bank to introduce a different arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has tabled a sheaf of amendments, possibly nine or ten pages.  I have looked through them and, as far as I could see, there is nothing controversial about what the Minister is introducing by way of amendment.  I could wave all the amendments tabled by the Minister through virtually without debate and we could clear the list of amendments very rapidly if we wanted to accommodate each other.  Indeed, I will accommodate the Minister further.  I had intended calling for a vote on this amendment, but I will not call it now as we are as well off using the time to debate the Bill as calling a vote.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not accept, of course, what the Minister states.  This is not to ensure that the Minister can exercise his full power in a flexible fashion but to allow the civil servants the necessary time to draft the orders. There is always Civil Service opposition when one decides a particular cut-off point to prevent the Minister from drifting on without bringing in the regulations for a long time.  The civil servants in the Department of Finance have a difficult job to do, they are under-paid and overworked and frequently the work falls on a number of expert people.  Work is certainly not divided equally in Government Departments and there is often very little regard for hard work.  As a compliment to the civil servants in the Department of Finance, if they want the flexibility to bring in the orders to introduce different sections of this Bill at different times as they see fit, then I will withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  I observe that amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Pat Rabbitte is related, likewise amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are alternatives.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 31 to 37, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of effecting the transition from the enactments repealed by section 7 of this Act so far as the same may be necessary to give full effect to any provision of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will discuss amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6 together.  The wording of section 4 (1) is altogether too vague and too wide. The powers the Minister is attempting to take upon himself to make regulations under the Bill are too wide.  It is perfectly acceptable that a Minister should have power to make regulations on certain specific, defined matters to enable an Act of the Oireachtas to operate in a proper manner to cover the minutiae and the detail that one would not expect to see in the Act itself and which would make an Act of the Oireachtas far too unwieldy.  This business has got out of hand and the powers taken by the Executive of Government, by the Minister in particular, have been widened until more and more Ministers are taking on to themselves plenary powers on wide-ranging areas, using vague terms to describe them.  That cannot be right.  It cannot be good law and should not be accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example in section 4 (1) such words as &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;&mdash; what is an incidental matter? &mdash;&ldquo;consequential&rdquo; and &ldquo;transitional supplementary provisions&rdquo; are <Col N="286" /> used.  This language is too vague to make good law, too vague to be acceptable, and too vague to meet the broad constitutional principle, that when powers are to be delegated to a Minister at least they should be clear, succinct and specifically defined.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of what is intended in section 4 (1) is that transitional matters should be within the ambit of the Minister to regulate.  However, I have suggested an alternative to section 4 (1) which is perhaps somewhat more limited, but in my view it is clearer and defines with more certainty and exactitude exactly what power is being delegated to the Minister.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of effecting the transition from the enactments repealed by section 7 of this Act so far as the same may be necessary to give full effect to any provision of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would have thought that would be perfectly adequate to meet all the Minister's needs in the matter of transitionary powers and functions without there being the necessity for him to have recourse to such woolly expressions as &ldquo;incidental, consequential, transitional, supplementary provisions&rdquo; and all the vagueness attached to them.  One would have to have a High Court or Supreme Court decision before one could start to interpret each of those words.  I do not think they are right, proper or appropriate to legislation.</P>
    <P>My other amendments, amendments Nos. 4, 5, and 6, are in effect of the same import as amendment No. 3, which will be moved shortly by Deputy Rabbitte, which seeks to ensure &mdash; this would be far better law and should become standard practice &mdash; that when the regulations and orders are made by the Minister they do not become law or have full effect until both Houses have adopted resolutions approving them and do not become law by a default procedure following the expiration of 21 days.  That is a totally unacceptable and unfair provision for the simple reason that the smaller parties in particular do not have the opportunity <Col N="287" /> because of the way Dáil time is structured to bring motions before the House to annual such ministerial regulations, if they were so minded.</P>
    <P>You are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, that such a motion could only be tabled in Private Members' Time and nobody knows better than you do how limited the smaller parties are in that regard.  The position would be that 21 sitting days would pass without the Labour Party and, <i>a fortiori,</i> The Workers' Party having time available to them in Private Members' time to discuss a motion to annul the regulations.  Where is the equity and fairness in that?  This is an old chestnut which has been debated many times in this House and I can recall not one but many occasions when Front Bench spokesmen of the Minister's party, sitting on the Opposition side of the House when similar provisions were inserted into legislation by the Government of the day, waxed lyrical about how appalling this was and how it was untenable.  It should be remembered that this is a major party in the House who would have little difficulty in Private Members' Time in bringing in motions to annul regulations. Is it not remarkable how views change, depending on whether a party sit on the Government side of the House or on the Opposition side?  This is a poor reflection on the principle involved here and the principle shown in controlling these matters.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister not do the right thing on this occasion and show that he is prepared to listen to reason, fairness and fair play and enable the smaller parties to exercise their democratic right and parliamentary functions?  By accepting these amendments, he would give them that right and that is, after all, the theory and basis behind our parliamentary democracy.  Deputies of the smaller parties, who are elected through the democratic process and who have an alternative philosophy and position to offer in this House, should be given the opportunity to express themselves when these important ministerial regulations are made.  If we fail to do this we will be <Col N="288" /> denying in effect true democratic representation to the smaller parties.  I am sure the Minister would agree that would be very unfair and I hope he will see his way to accepting these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy Taylor which I submit is a more definite, precise and certain statement than the one contained in the existing subsection (1) of section 4.  In keeping with our earlier discussion, I do not want to take up the time of the House in reiterating the arguments advanced in favour of it but I submit it is necessary that we argue in favour of precision and that there is a certain amount of deliberate uncertainty and lack of precision in the present wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you have suggested, a Cheann Comhairle, my own amendment follows on from that amendment.  Again, I do not wish to dwell on it for too long but it is the view of my party that the Minister should take this amendment on board.  In the past we have moved similar amendments on other legislation for the very good reasons which have already been adverted to.  For example, we believe the requirement that regulations be laid before this House and that a resolution annulling those regulations be passed by either House within 21 days to be a negative approach which is of almost no value, especially to the smaller parties.  In practice, this is pushed into Private Members' time.  Under the regulations pushed through the House, The Workers' Party may not get such a facility within 21 sitting days.  Therefore, this default mechanism or negative construction provides no facility whereby we can contest a particular order or regulation.  Indeed this <Col N="289" /> has been shown to be the case in the past. Over the past decade my colleagues have unsuccessfully attempted to challenge such regulations on a range of matters in the social welfare code and this facility was not given.  I see no good reason the Minister cannot approach this matter in a positive fashion and require that any given regulation must have the positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I submit that accepting this amendment, which would require the Minister to lay a draft of the regulations he proposes to make before the House and which seeks to ensure that those regulations would not come into effect until a resolution approving them has been passed by both Houses, is the democratic way to approach this matter, where the Minister feels it is necessary for a number of reasons as instanced by Deputy Taylor to bring regulations before this House.  I trust, therefore, that the Minister will have due regard to the rights of the smaller parties in this House and facilitate that positive construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is a common misunderstanding both inside and outside this House that there is primary and secondary legislation and that what we do on the Floor of this House has a force in law which is stronger than what is done by way of ministerial regulation. That of course is a total misunderstanding of the position.  What the Minister does by way of regulation has a stronger force in law and is as enforceable in the courts as anything we do on the Floor of this House.  It is not a matter of little consequence when we are discussing what powers should be properly vested in a Minister to regulate under specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 starts &ldquo;Without prejudice to any specific provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  Once one leaves out the specific provisions of the Act, section 4 is all right as drafted, because the really important parts of this Bill are covered by sections where the Minister has regulatory powers other than those incorporated in section 4.  In section 5, for example, there is specific <Col N="290" /> power to regulate to modify the Bill in almost any way the Minister thinks fit for a three year period.  In section 6 there is power for the Minister by regulation to incorporate into this legislation any provision of related legislation, of the Companies Act, the Building Societies Act and so on.  The section causing the most anxiety is the one under which the Minister may incorporate the Trustee Savings Banks, by leaving a draft order before the House in accordance with the provisions of section 58 of this Bill where there is a provision for an affirmative resolution, which is exactly what Deputy Rabbitte has requested here.</P>
    <P>Ministerial resolutions are necessary precisely for incidental, consequential, transitional and supplementary provisions but they are not necessary and should not be used for matters of principle. Whether we should proceed to fetter the Minister either by affirmative or negative resolution is a point worthy of debate.  When matters of detail arise directly from the provisions of the Bill, the veto of the House by negative regulation is sufficient, because when it comes to regulations we are not talking about the principle of the Bill or the principle of the section but about details arising from a section.  It is probably sufficient for the House to have a veto in matters of detail.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arises when the Minister seeks to deal with matters of substance by regulation.  The House is unhappy about that and feels that a veto is not enough and we need a provision whereby the Minister is obliged to bring a regulation on to the Floor of the House so that we can debate it.  That is an understandable feeling on the part of Opposition Deputies and on the part of all committed parliamentarians. When one thinks about it, however, it does not really answer the problem because the difficulty with regulations is that one is not opposed to the principle of the Regulations but one wants to get at the detail of the regulations. One cannot get at the detail of regulations in an affirmative resolution or in a negative resolution in the form of a Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> It is irrelevant whether we have an affirmative resolution or a negative resolution to cover section 4, because once it comes on to the Floor of the House we will not be able to get at the detail of the regulation and on behalf of our parties we will make statements &mdash; Second Stage type statements which do not meet the issue.  What we need is a mechanism where we can search the detail of the regulation, rather like Committee or Report Stage where amendments can be proposed by the Opposition, and the Minister can come back to us.  If that kind of mechanism were put in place it would be a distinct reform of Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to what either Deputy Taylor or Deputy Rabbitte proposed; but in the context of section 4 it will be ineffective, whichever way the resolution ultimately comes before the Dáil, either by negative resolution where we can exercise a veto, or by a positive affirmation introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I have listened with interest to the contributions.  I take particular note of what Deputy Noonan says regarding primary and secondary legislation and the misunderstanding there will be about it.  In response to Deputy Rabbitte, I would say that the function of Government is to bring forward and improve legislation, and the function of the Dáil is to debate and ensure that it is the best possible legislation for the common good.  Legislation is not brought in to suit large parties.  It is up to each party to treat legislation in whatever way they think fit.  Legislation introduced is looked at in an overall way and not in a miniscule way that would deprive Deputies of the opportunity to take appropriate action within the rules and regulations of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard provision dealing with the making of regulations and the giving of directions to give effect to <Col N="292" /> this Bill.  The section calls for every regulation made under the Act to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and allows for the giving of directions by the Central Bank to the Trustee Savings Bank in relation to the business carried on by the bank.  Subsection (1) allows that any regulation made by the Minister under this Bill may include whatever incidental or minor provisions might be necessary to give full effect to the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a standard provision necessary to avoid any legal or technical difficulties that might arise in the making of the regulations.  Deputy Taylor wishes to restrict the power to make the regulations under this section purely transitional provisions following repeals of other Acts under section 7.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) as drafted is a standard provision allowing the Minister to make the regulations to implement the Act.  It is essential to the Act and it is included, for example, in the 1976 and 1979 Building Societies Acts in this form.  Subsection (2) is standard in relation to the making of regulations.  This negative resolution procedure will apply to all regulations made under this Act and it is not thought that the positive resolution procedure would be required in respect of any regulations to be made under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte have amendments which would require prior <Col N="293" /> approval by the both Houses for any regulations under the Act.  Again, this subsection is standard for this type of legislation and should not require regulations to have prior approval.  Consequently, I regret that I will not be able to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister has not addressed the points I made.  As Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out, the regulations the Minister brings in have the force of law just as an Act of the Oireachtas.  We are not talking necessarily about minor matters.  The Minister let that word slip, but that word does not appear in the subsection.  It could well be that matters within the contemplation of section 4 could be of some importance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan was talking about matters of substance and matters of detail and drawing a distinction between those two categories.  That is fair enough up to a point but in between those two broad categories is a large grey area where opinions might differ as to what is a matter of substance and what is a matter of detail.  I might regard as a matter of substance what Deputy Noonan might regard as a matter of detail.  Consequently, I might wish as an elected Member, in common with 165 others, to have an opportunity to say something about that.  I thought we were elected to the House for that reason.  To deliberately devise a mechanism under which not only an individual &mdash; I shudder to think of the position of the Independent Members who do not have any Private Member's time &mdash; but parties which have an appreciable number of seats are denied an opportunity to have an input into a debate, if they see fit to do so, even if it is a Second Stage type debate, is wrong.  I agree with Deputy Noonan about teasing out provisions on Committee Stage.  However, we do not see that much in the amendments.  It is our democratic right, which should not be denied us by the Government, that if we are minded to have something to say in a general way on a Second Stage type debate we should be permitted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if by a quirk of coincidence it <Col N="294" /> happens that the meagre allocation the Labour Party receive, and the even more meagre allocation The Workers' Party get, slots into the 21 working day period it is a bit much to suggest that they should give up that precious Private Members' time to be used for the purpose of attempting to annul an order.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (1) (2) provides that if the regulations made by the Minister are to be annulled that will have to be done in a negative fashion by resolution of the House.  I was making the point that the only way a party can do <Col N="295" /> that would be to use up their meagre allocation of Private Members' time. That is the relevance of my reference to Private Members' time.  If, by coincidence, it so happens that the Labour Party or The Workers' Party have an allocation of Private Members' time it would be unfair and unreasonable to expect them to give that up for the purpose of seeking to annul a regulation made under this section.  That time is meant for weightier matters and it is a very scarce and precious commodity to the smaller parties.  The more likely outcome is that they would not have the opportunity to have an allocation of Private Members' time within the 21 working days.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain to the House the purpose of including the provision, of appearing to give a semblance of a democratic provision under which the House could be enabled to move a motion to debate and annul a regulation made by the Minister on an important matter when the practicalities of the operation of the House are such that Members will not have the opportunity to do that.  Will the Minister explain to the House why such a provision has been included?  Are we attempting to give a semblance of democracy while denying the reality to Independent Members and the smaller parties?</P>

      <P>I was a bit taken aback by the Minister's riposte to the amendments to this section.  He said that legislation is not brought before the House to meet the needs of any particular party. The whole point at issue is that the Minister has designed a section that seeks to give the appearance that the House can do something about the regulation that it does not like.  The argument being made is that the negative mechanism adopted for so doing leaves effectively two parties comprising the Opposition in the House without realistic access to using that negative mechanism effectively.  I take Deputy Noonan's point that there can be a difference between a matter of principle and a matter that falls within the meaning <Col N="296" /> of section 4.  Certainly, if one were to refer to the extraordinary and unprecedented powers being sought by the Minister in section 5 one would see that that difference becomes very evident.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan will have to accept that his belief that the power of veto should be sufficient when it is not a matter of principle, that in a circumstance when we are talking about banks &mdash; we seem to be in agreement that the purpose of the Bill is to prepare those banks to be sold off in part or in whole to the private sector &mdash; it is perfectly within the remit of committed parliamentarians to approach that question from different philosophical standpoints.  The banks we are talking about are effectively in public ownership.  I am aware of the trustee arrangement and so on but it would have been just as easy to bring legislation before the House to devise a form of public ownership that would go some way to releasing some of the restrictions on the functioning of the banks at present.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing, if the Minister accepts that there is a different philosophical approach to that question, to hear him say that we have a facility by veto in a manner described in section 4 to challenge any regulation or order brought by him before the House.  That is completely unrealistic.  It has been explained that if such a facility should accidentally fall to either the Labour Party or The Workers' Party during the period of 21 days it would be accidental. There is no precedent I can find in the eighties where such a regulation by a Minister was effectively challenged.  The facility simply does not arise and we are merely engaging in legislative window-dressing to suggest that the negative mechanism set out in section 4 copes adequately with that.  From the Minister's point of view I cannot see what has been conceded.  I suggest to him that in order to allow us to move through what I concede are more substantive sections he should consider taking on board at least the import of the amendments, one of which has been moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The <Col N="297" /> reason I do not have much difficulty with section 4 is that its provisions are the normal regulatory provisions one would find in a Bill of this kind and they are without prejudice to any specific provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has talked about approaching this from different philosophic standpoints and has used that as a basis for an argument that we should have a positive form of endorsement of the regulations.  If there is any section in the Bill which allows the Minister to privatise, it is section 58.  In section 58 (11) a draft of any order proposed to be made should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Order shall not be made until the resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each of the Houses.  That is an affirmative resolution so it is not necessary to put it in here in section 4; it does not apply to section 58 anyway.  Neither does section 4 apply to sections 5 and 6, because there are specific provisions within those, certainly in sections 5 and 6, and in regard to most of section 58, the one with which the Deputy is most concerned.  In section 58 (11) there is a provision for a draft to be placed before the House and it cannot be enacted until we all discuss it here, and it has to be introduced by affirmative motion by the Minister.  That is not my problem with it.  What is sought to be done by regulation under section 4 is acceptable.  What is sought to be done by regulation and by draft order elsewhere is totally unacceptable whether the Minister proceeds by a positive order or by negative order.  If we give him this regulatory section, which is a normal section anyway, and take our stand where he is looking for power which is not proper to regulate on anyway, it would be more to the point.</P>

      <P>We have teased this section out pretty well.  Deputy Taylor stated that this section dealt with matters of some importance.  Of course, that is so.  Otherwise we would not be seeking any change whatsoever, nor would we have this section inserted.  Deputy Taylor <Col N="298" /> said that weightier matters have to be dealt with in Private Members' Time.  I accept that that is the prerogative of the Deputies taking up Private Members' Time.  The same applies to this Bill, in that section 4 is dealing with minor matters and section 58 deals with weightier matters.  I cannot understand why we are having such difficulty with section 4 because regulations under this section would not be dealing with matters of principle.  It is precisely because a matter of principle is involved in regulations under section 58 that we have provided for prior approval.  I hope this section, which is very explicit and clear so far as I am concerned, can be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I hope the various proposals to delete &ldquo;Central Bank&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; are consistent through the various sections. Theoretically there should be no difficulty about giving these powers to the Central Bank in the various subsections of the section but I am afraid, as we remarked on Second Stage, that too often bodies set up to regulate become prisoners of the people they are designed to regulate in the first instance.  I see no reason the Minister should not retain the authority here, which would, in addition, give a role to the Oireachtas which, in all probability, would not be the case if the functions listed under these various sections were developed on the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The proper regulatory authority is the Central Bank and I have no objection to the way this is drafted.  I share some of Deputy Rabbitte's fears in regard to the difficulty he identified.  One of the problems with the powers and the independence of the Central Bank is that when they deal with third parties there is no way of raising the issue in the House.  I presume if this section goes through as drafted it will not be possible to put down a question to the Minister for Finance about directives by the Central Bank to the Trustee Savings Banks because it would be ruled out of order.  I wonder if Deputy Rabbitte had the same concern and if he would consider putting in an amendment on Report Stage to provide that the Central Bank, in consultation with the Minister, may give a direction, because then we would be in a position to question the Minister in the House about the activities of the Central Bank and we would not have taken from the Central Bank its authority as the financial regulatory authority in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of these amendments.  I presume the intent of them is, as Deputy Noonan says, that there should be an answerability here in the House for the affairs of the Trustee Savings Banks.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that we are talking here about a State institution, and it is right and proper that it should be possible to raise questions as to the conduct of such an institution here in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind the Central Bank being the regulatory authority so far as the banks are concerned.  That is its function, but I would say that the Minister also must have a role in this.  It should not be acceptable that the Minister should neatly sidestep his answerability in this House for the affairs of such a major State company.  Not only in this country but in other parliamentary democracies all over the world, Ministers, the executive branch of Government, like nothing better than to be able to say in their House of Parliament that they are not the persons answerable when awkward <Col N="300" /> questions arise affecting a major semi-State company, matters affecting possibly hundreds and millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, the savings of the old, the young, of widows etc.</P>
    <P>We in this House should have a caution and a care before we allow that to expand and extend more than we have to do.  I would have thought the way to handle this aspect would have been to provide for either the Central Bank or the Minister, rather than Deputy Noonan's suggestion of the Central Bank in consultation with the Minister.  In other words, give a power of direction both to the Central Bank and the Minister where certain matters of policy or whatever in the Trustee Savings Banks would arise, for the purpose and in the intent that the Minister would be answerable for doing something or not doing something which could have dire consequences for members of the public.  I have tabled other amendments with a similar intent in connection with other sections, but the idea behind this is precisely the same, to try to ensure that there would be responsibility on the Minister to answer in this House in connection with the affairs of so substantial a semi-State company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies have expressed concern <i>vis-à-vis</i> the fact that responsibility would pass from the Minister to the Central Bank.  Subsection (3) empowers the Central Bank to issue directions to the Trustee Savings Banks, which would be in the interest of proper and orderly regulations to the Trustee Savings Banks.  This is in addition to the bank's specific powers set out in other sections of the Bill and provides for those circumstances where the Central Bank might have to issue a direction to a Trustee Savings Bank not originally envisaged at the legislative stage. Subsection (4) sets out how a Central Bank direction shall be made and given to a Trustee Savings Bank.  It also ensures that the flexibility provided for in subsection (1) in relation to regulations will apply too, to Central Bank directions and allow for revocation and amendment of <Col N="301" /> Central Bank directions made under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte wishes to substitute the Minister for the Central Bank in the giving of directions to the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Central Bank as the supervisory authority for the Trustee Savings Banks as proposed in the Bill is the appropriate body to give directions under this section.  All the other financial institutions are under the supervision of the Central Bank and I see no reason when we have the Central Bank, whose statutory function is to operate a supervising authority over other financial institutions, for not including the Trustee Savings Banks in that supervision.</P>

If we are to create a level playing field environment for all financial institutions, surely the supervision must be fairly uniform and standard, and it is only reasonable to expect that that supervision be given by the authority which already controls and supervises the other institutions. Consequently, I regret I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not merely a question of answerability, although that is obviously a very important dimension of it.  I was looking for a quote earlier but I have not been able to find it.  I was anxious to use it because it comes from Milton Friedman who said something to the effect that regulatory bodies end up being captured by those they are supposed to regulate.  I thought that might commend itself to the Minister and maybe even to Deputy Noonan because <Col N="302" /> I think that is what has happened in the case of the Central Bank.  The obligations placed on the Central Bank by, I think, the 1942 Act, have not worked always in the interest of the community.  Effectively, policy of the Central Bank is made by directors drawn exclusively or almost exclusively from the private sector and to a significant extent from the commercial banks.  Here we are not talking about institutions like the building societies or the commercial banks.  Whatever about this distinction between trusteeship and public ownership, this is a bank with a difference.  It is not to be made analagous to either the building societies or the banks where the regulatory authority is the Central Bank.  There is a point of principle here.</P>
      <P>On the question of answerability, there are conceivably many areas where Members of this House would like to be able to question the Minister for Finance but the proposal to transfer the responsibility from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank would prevent that.  For example, one section of the Bill contains the words &ldquo;nothing in this Act&rdquo;, implying that the State, the Exchequer or the Minister is responsible for underwriting any loss suffered by a depositor.  My understanding, naive though it may be, is that the meagre savings of the public are underwritten and protected by the Exchequer.  I am sure that is also the view of those who are depositors with Trustee Savings Banks.  Deputy Noonan has dealt at some length with this point and instanced what happened when a run was caused on the bank and the then Minister for Finance assured the public that this was indeed the case.  In such event again or in the event of any individual having a grievance, I am convinced that, once the authority is transferred to the Central Bank, the answer to any question that might be put here to the Minister would be that he was not responsible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and Deputy Taylor have made suggestions on how at least some of the thrust behind these amendments might be incorporated in the Bill. These suggestions could be debated at Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of brief comments in response to the debate so far on this amendment.  The Minister says, quite correctly, that the Central Bank is the regulating authority for Banks.  Then he goes on to ask what is the difference between the Trustee Savings Banks and the other banks in respect of which the Central Bank is the regulating authority.  He asked what the distinction is here.  There is a very vital and important distinction.  The Trustee Savings Bank is a completely different animal from all the other banks that operate in this State.  The Minister made that quite clear in his Second Stage speech when he said that the Oireachtas has the power to dispose of the assets of the Trustee Savings Banks or to alter their status as it sees fit.  That comment applies to the Trustee Savings Banks and the Trustee Savings Banks alone and not to any other bank that operates in this State. Therefore, when you ask what the difference is between this bank and all other banks, I say in reply that that is the difference, and a very important and vital difference.  It leads one inevitably to the consequence that where public assets or assets under public control, which means the control of this Oireachtas, are concerned there must be an answerability here, and that can only be from the Minister in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the question as to who is now the controller and the person with responsibility for giving directions to the Trustee Savings Banks.  Who has that been since the Trustee Savings Banks were established?  The Minister is that person at this time, not the Central Bank. The Central Bank at present has no responsibility for the Trustee Savings Banks, does not even license the Trustee Savings Banks so far as I know, but has responsibility for controlling them. Therefore, this is not just some cosmetic change that is involved here; this goes to the root of the matter, and it is a very important change.  I for one would be totally opposed to relieving the Minister <Col N="304" /> completely from that responsibility.  As I said, I have no objection to a supervisory role and a licensing role perhaps being put on the Central Bank as well, but not to let the Minister off the hook, not to take away from the Minister that responsibility he has to be answerable.</P>
    <P>Where answerability is concerned there also has to be responsibility.  I hope the Minister will still be shaking his head in the same affirmative manner when we come to the amendments dealing with that subject because the concomitant of saying that you control an institution and that you have the responsibility, power and authority to issue directions is that if you get that wrong and you do not control it in a proper manner to the extent that people lose, whether you are the Central Bank or the Minister you must pay for your mistakes the same as anybody else must pay for their mistakes.  If people lose their savings or investments as a result, then there should be a concomitant responsibility on the Central Bank and or the Minister.</P>

When I challenged the Minister on it at Second Stage he said there were precedents and he quoted the Building Societies Act as a precedent.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is extraordinary that any Minister should come before the House and say: &ldquo;I am putting certain proposals before you. These proposals may not work.  These proposals may be entirely wrong.  These proposals may not deliver on the intention of the Bill, and because I am fearful about the inadequacies of my Bill I want power under section 5 to change this in any way that is necessary when my original proposals run into difficulty, because I half expect that they might&rdquo;.  That is an extraordinary approach for any Minister to adopt when coming into the House. Section 5 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision <Col N="307" /> into effect for the purposes afore-said ...</P>
    <P>Then the saver, he can only swing the machete for three years.  God help us, that is some saver.  What does that mean in layman's language?  It means that if the Minister finds that the powers he has given to himself and the Central Bank are not sufficient to regulate the Trustee Savings Banks or to do with them what he considers to be necessary over the next three years he may issue regulations to change this legislation, he can drop sections or he can cancel the whole Act because he can say we got it totally wrong and a difficulty is arising from the very nature of it and he has to bring it back in.  I know the Minister of State will say that is not the intention and that it is only for minor matters, but this is only a saver in case things occur in the middle distance that we would not be sure of.  I say this advisedly; it is outrageous for a Minister for Finance to come into a House of Parliament and look for power to modify, in any direction he sees fit, a piece of legislation which is being enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and to seek to exercise that power for a period of three years is a further outrage.</P>
    <P>If the Minister finds that the legislation he is proposing is inadequate he can redress it by bringing in amending legislation. That is the way things have been done since the foundation of the State. That is the way things should be done.  If the Minister and his advisers got it wrong then they have an obligation to come back to the House and say so.  Then they can say they are introducing the Trustee Savings Bank (Amendment) Bill, 1990, there will be a full five Stage debate on it, and then it will be sent to the Seanad. That is the way to behave but not in the fashion described in this Bill, especially in matters of such consequence.</P>
    <P>In legislation to a large degree we are giving away the power to scrutinise the activities of the Trustee Savings Banks. As my two colleagues have already pointed out, the regulatory provisions are to a large extent vested in the Central <Col N="308" /> Bank and the Central Bank is not answerable to this House.  Yet the Minister may, by regulation, modify, to any extent he sees fit, any provision of this Bill.  I think it is an outrage.  I am opposed to it in principle and I will be calling a vote on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support every word Deputy Noonan has said on this issue.  It is outrageous to bring forward such a section.  Let us look at the wording for a moment.  It states that any such regulations by the Minister may modify any provisions of this Act.  The enormity of what we are saying there is mind boggling. The Minister is taking to himself power to modify an Act of the Oireachtas.  I have grave doubts as to whether this is constitutional.</P>
      <P>The Constitution sets out the separation of powers as between the legislative branch of Government, which is the Oireachtas; the executive branch, which is the Government; and the interpretative branch, which is the Judiciary.  Here the executive in the form of the Minister is taking upon itself the function of the Oireachtas.  It is extremely serious to purport to do that.  How is the Minister limiting himself?  There is a guilt in his mind, in the mind of the parliamentary draftsman and in the minds of the Minister's officials.  They are not quite happy about it; they feel a bit uneasy and know it is not quite right, so they put in a cut-off point after three years.  If it were right there would be no need for such a provision.  The guilty conscience comes through, so the Minister puts in what he considers to be a saver, to the effect that it applies only for three years.  That does not fool anybody or pull the wool over anybody's eyes.  The naked grasp at power in the Minister's hand alone, without reference to this House and the Seanad, is absolutely appalling and untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wide-ranging, too, not just limited or specific.  It is stated that any such regulations may modify any provisions of this Act, so far as they may be necessary or expedient.  The Minister's idea of what is expedient and what may facilitate him in <Col N="309" /> operating the Act is not something that should entitle him in a democracy to sit down with his officials and write out a list of regulations which have the force of law when he signs them.  That should not be. It is going back to the time of Henry VIII when government was by royal decree. The Minister is making himself out as if he were Henry VIII, promulgating decrees without reference to Parliament. There are to be royal decrees, as it were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair enough because this is harking back to the days when the struggle went on between the king and Parliament on these kinds of issues.  The king said he did not need Parliament and would rule by decree. That is what the Minister is trying to do here.  He offers a section to the House, backed by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat parties, which refers to any difficulty which may arise in bringing any provision of the Act into operation. He is supposed to know what difficulties there will be; that is his job and he has a big enough staff of civil servants, assistants and advisers to think this through.  There are enough of them, all paid at public expense, to work out now what those difficulties might be and to address them in this Bill so that we might tease them out as we are supposed to be able to do in the fullness of time in a Committee Stage debate.  The Minister should not take the easy way out by putting in a provision that if any difficulty arises he can do anything he wishes.  He may by regulation do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient. He can simply bring in a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People throughout the country, be they companies, savers or borrowers with the Trustee Savings Bank, are entitled to know what they are dealing with, with whom they are dealing and how matters will evolve.  They should know their position and not be forced to buy a pig in a poke.  That is what the law is for. Under this Bill the Minister may, by a <Col N="310" /> back door arrangement, bring in modifying arrangements under his seal and signature, where he considers that a difficulty has arisen.  It is one of the most outrageous provisions I have ever seen. It is dangerous, the thin end of the wedge. What next?  The next time the Minister will insert a wider provision for amending an Act.  It is a creeping development which must be stopped short.  It must be recognised that a trend is developing here which is an infringement of true democracy. If we do not put our foot down and step in at an early stage it will extend and expand and before we know it we will be passing enabling Acts for the Minister to deal with subject X or matter Y.  He will deal with matters by means of regulations and the House will become no more than a rubber stamp.</P>

      <P>There is a vast difference between section 5 and the powers the Minister is trying to take from this House and the normal kind of power taken by a Minister to make regulations.  The House should recognise that now.  I will be calling a vote against this section.  I hope the Minister will reconsider, even at this late stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed on this section by Deputies Noonan and Taylor.  I do not have the equivalent experience in the House of either Deputy but I am amazed that a section of this scope could be brought before the House.  I am certainly very dubious about the constitutionality of giving such all-embracing power to the Minister, enabling him to do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that we need this <Col N="311" /> kind of section in a Bill which has been nine years in gestation.  If the Bill has been contemplated for some nine years this is not some last minute, hurried insertion to protect against situations which the Minister cannot foresee.  In view of the negotiations which have taken place, I cannot understand the necessity to seek such all-embracing powers.  Deputy Taylor quite reasonably suggested that even in its construction there is some evidence, niggling doubt and residual concern on the part of the authors of this section about its implications so that we will have it in force for a limited period of three years only.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion could be that the Minister is in possession of some knowledge which we do not have.  Could it be that the purpose for which this Bill was advanced in the first place will effectively be executed within that three year period and that whatever lobby has caused the demand for the disposal of the bank to the private sector should be facilitated? Does that lobby feel that the groundwork is laid and that the work can be done inside three years?  If that is not so it is very hard to understand why a Minister who is so anxious to divest himself of his current responsibilities to the bank &mdash; to pass on some of these responsibilities to the Central Bank &mdash; wants to retain in this Bill the power to effectively set the Bill at nought if he so chooses.  It seems to be a power without precedent and if this House is to accept this kind of precedent being established in the case of the trustee savings banks, where will it all end?  It is extraordinary to bring before the House a Bill that must have taken much painstaking compilation and then to put in an all-encompassing section which says that the Minister may do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient and that he may bring in any such regulations that may modify any provision of this Act as far as may be necessary or expedient.  It is an all-embracing power which this House should not accept as a precedent to be established for serious legislation.  I will <Col N="312" /> be opposing this section and calling for a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the very strong language used by the speakers in relation to this section.  Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte &mdash; and maybe Deputy Taylor &mdash; said that the Bill had been nine years in gestation.  We all accept that there is a need to update the legislation in relation to the Trustee Savings Banks.  Members of the House and the public have been clamouring for these changes for many years.  Obviously this legislation has not been rushed as there is nothing concealed, latent or residual in the Bill and there is no reason to conceal anything pertaining to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that if any difficulty arises in bringing any of this Act into effect, the Minister is empowered to remove that difficulty by way of introducing regulations which may also modify the legislation to such an extent as may be necessary to facilitate its enforcement. This power will lapse after three years from its date of enforcement.</P>
      <P>Deputies Noonan, Taylor and Rabbitte are opposing this section.  Deputy Noonan wanted the three year limit changed to six months but then he decided to leave a proposed amendment in this regard to Report Stage.  A similar provision in the recent building societies legislation give rise to some adverse reaction in its passage through the House.  For that reason it is important for Deputies to be quite clear regarding the purpose and intention of this section.</P>
      <P>The section provides that if any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into effect the Minister is empowered to remove that difficulty by way of regulations which may also modify the legislation to such an extent as may be necessary to facilitate its enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing Trustee Savings Banks legislation is antiquated and labyrinthine and this Bill is the first major reform of that legislation.  There is a strong possibility of unforeseen technical difficulties arising in giving effect to the provisions of the Bill and this provision is to enable the Minister to deal with them.  The <Col N="313" /> advice is that this power can effectively be exercised only within the context and intentions of the Bill.  There is no possibility of the provision being used to subvert the intention of the legislation and there are precedents for it.</P>
    <P>Attention should be drawn to the time limit of three years in this section and to the fact that, as provided in section 4, any regulation made under this section would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, who would have the power to annul the regulations within 21 days if they so wished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a big help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The precedents for a provision of this type can be found in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Farm Tax Act, 1985, the Canals Act, 1986, and the Valuation Act, 1988, which I piloted through the Oireachtas.  The Building Societies Act, 1989, has a three year limit and a similar limit is appropriate in this case.  Limits in the other cited precedents vary.  In the case of the Social Welfare Act it is one year.  In the case of the Farm Tax and the Valuation Acts the period is two years and in the Canals Act it is three years.</P>
      <P>Regarding the scope of any amendments, all the precedent legislation referred to limited the scope of amendments under this section to the Act in question except for the Canals Act, which allowed for the possibility of amendment to any other enactment.  The advice available to the Minister for Finance is that this section can be used only in a relatively limited context despite the apparent breadth of the wording.</P>
      <P>I am confident that all Ministers for Finance will take careful, measured and judicious decisions based on the best available expert advice.  I hope the House can accept the necessity for this section.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am surprised at the claim of the Minister of State that there is nothing concealed, latent or residual in this Bill because, where it really matters, everything is concealed, latent or residual.  The provision as to <Col N="314" /> how interest rates will be arrived at is latent, as it is to be discussed between the Minister and the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill in regard to the designated proportion of depositors' funds which will be invested with the Minister either on deposit or by means of Government paper.  That is also a residual matter which is left for discussion between the Minister and the Central Bank.  It is concealed latent and residual, to use the Minister's own words.  Section 58, which deals with the prospective incorporation of the Trustee Savings Banks, is concealed, latent and residual. We do not know the Government's intent, the Minister's intent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are provisions for incorporation which will have a majority ministerial shareholding &mdash; and indeed provisions for incorporation which would have minority ministerial shareholding &mdash; in the same section.  When one legislates for absolutely opposing contingencies it is concealed and latent and are there not residual powers in the section which have not been made clear to the House?  The Minister chose a very unfortunate phrase when he said there was nothing concealed, latent or residual in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objection to this section is that the Minister may, by regulation, modify matters of principle in the Bill.  I contend that regulations should be confined to consequential matters and not matters of principle.  I accept the Minister's assurance that he will not move to subvert the principle of the Bill. However, in addition to the overall principle of the Bill, there are principles proper to specific sections.  There is the principle involved in specific sections and that may be modified at the Minister's say so.  It is not merely a matter of technical difficulties, as the Minister has contended or endeavoured to point out.  In section 5 the Minister is taking power to change sections, matters of principle in regard to sections.  Indeed, matters of substance in <Col N="315" /> the Bill can be modified by these provisions. It is the intent of the section to allow the Minister do so.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister, or on any of his predecessors or successors; that is not my intention. We like to operate on the basis of all of us being men of good will.  Nonetheless there is a balance between the Executive and the Houses of Parliament and that balance is now being upset.  I accept that there are precedents, as the Minister has outlined, but it is about time we stopped creating such precedents because in matters such as this there should be certainty. I know that the trustees, management, staff and depositors of the Trustee Savings Bank have been awaiting this legislation a long time.  In their anxiety, perhaps their desire to scrutinise its provisions has been somewhat lulled. I can assure the House that were this a company in which I had an involvement I would not accept that kind of provision without fighting it because there is no certainty in this Bill and that makes an uncertain Bill even more uncertain. There will be no trustee or manager of a Trustee Savings Bank who will be able to return to his depositors, saying: we have a new Bill now governing the Trustee Savings Bank and this is what it means, because we do not know what it means. We do not know what will be the main provisions.  Worse, the Minister is here taking power to modify even those areas in which there is certainty.</P>

I contend that <Col N="316" /> a period of six months is even dangerous. The only reason I have tabled &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; in my amendment is that it constitutes my second line of defence, in that we would be hoping to stop the Minister on the detail if we cannot stop him on the principle, when he rolls those famous Progressive Democrats through to add to the 77 his party has, the cohorts of democracy, the six honourable men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not good enough that the Minister is not in a position to give an example of what he has in mind when he takes upon himself such a wide-ranging amending provision within the terms of the Bill.  He should be in a position to give examples when he comes into the House.  He should be in a position to give such examples now.  It is no good his saying he will come back on Report Stage and give an example of the sort of thing envisaged because if he thinks a difficulty will arise of which he has knowledge it should be included in the Bill, not just in his mind or some figment of his imagination.

This is the time to consider what difficulties may arise and deal with them now when the Bill is before the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to give the Minister of State an example of circumstances in which I envisage the Minister for Finance or his successors could act.  At present the statutory provision is that deposits made with the Trustee Savings Banks are deposited with the Minister for Finance.  He restores 20 per cent, so that there is then an 80:20 ratio.  The provision in the Bill is that this will be a matter for discussion between the Minister and the Central <Col N="318" /> Bank to decide what will be the designated proportion in the future.  Suppose the Minister and the Central Bank fail to agree on a designated proportion; then there will arise a difficulty in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  Under this section the Minister may, by regulation, come back to this House and modify the provisions in respect of that section.  He may say: the Minister has now decided that, say, for reasons of shortages in the Exchequer rather than loosening up the 80:20 ratio, it will be restricted; it will now be a ratio of 90:10.  Are we are going to have a ratio of 75:25, or we are going to adhere to the 80:20 ratio because there is a difficulty being experienced in the implementation of the provisions of this section?  I do not know whether the people who run the Trustee Savings Banks have thought of that contingency but it would appear to me that is not what they would be expecting, yet this section allows the Minister to act in that way.</P>

It had been my belief at least that the Minister must have a number of such circumstances in mind in which it might become necessary to invoke the provisions of this section. It is stretching credulity too far to expect us to accept that this provision was inserted as an afterthought, as a catchall section, in the event of unforeseen circumstances arising.  Surely one does not include an all-embracing section such as this unless there are some specific difficulties anticipated by the Minister?  I was not aware of the precedents the Minister read out.  Certainly I should like to have an opportunity to examine them to ascertain whether their adoption in the example he gave will have the same potential implications in this case.  After <Col N="319" /> all, we are talking about a unique banking facility available to the public.  I would very much regret if it is about to be parcelled up and sold off.  Is it that the Minister envisages there may be last minute difficulties in the way, so that he may invoke the provisions of this section to remove those difficulties?  It is not sufficient to leave us hanging and be expected to believe it is some kind of safeguard against the unexpected arising.</P>

      <P>It is very clear that the system of registration of title is breaking down.  The Land Registry was established about 100 years ago by the Registration of Title Act, 1891, which now operates under the 1964 Act.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, in introducing that Bill, stated that the system of registration provided for in the 1964 Bill was intended to be cheap, simple and effective.  Twenty five years later it is clear that the Land Registry measures up to none of these criteria.  In fact, the entire system is on the verge of collapse.  This has frightening implications for anybody who owns a house, farm, shop, or plot of ground where the title is registered in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While substantial fees totalling around £7 million are charged for the approximately 80,000 dealings lodged each year and for the 120,000 or so applications for copies of title maps, etc., the core of the problem is that the Land Registry is just not able to do the job for which these fees are being paid.  Essentially it is a monopoly created and charged by statute to carry out a commercial self-financing function which is not working.  It is failing <Col N="321" /> utterly to provide any reasonable standard of service for its customers and the general public.  This will have severe and adverse repercussions for economic activity and employment.  That is why we in Fine Gael and many others demand radical change at this stage.  It is important that the House should know the present position in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>Firstly, additional arrears are accumulating by the day.  At the end of 1988 the overall arrears in transactions totalled 32,000.  This figure has increased every month since January and reached a total of 49,000 at the end of October.  In fact, 12,000 dealings which have been lodged in the last couple of months have not even been accepted and numbered within the system.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it can now take up to 20-24 months to register a plot of ground in the Land Registry and up to six months simply to obtain a land certificate proving ownership of property.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this is a system which obviously lends itself to computerisation. A fair amount of progress was made in the early part of this decade but this has now ground to a halt.  The computer expert in the registry resigned at the end of last month.  When one is talking about computerisation I think it is fair to say, in case the question of staff numbers is raised, that completion of computerisation would lead not only to efficiency in the operation of the registry but also to substantial staff savings in the long term.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I have to refer to the position of maps in the registry.  All the advice I have received is that these maps are deteriorating rapidly.  This will, of course, make computerisation even more difficult as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the 1964 Act envisaged compulsory registration of all the property in the State.  That was one of the basic rationale behind the 1964 Act.  What is the present position?  To date, 25 years later, only three counties &mdash; Carlow, Laois and Meath &mdash; have been brought within the ambit of the compulsory registration provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Sixthly, I want to touch on the position of the management and staff of the registry, all of whom, from my experience initially as a lawyer and latterly as a politician, have shown unfailing courtesy. Because of the present position in the registry, the operation of that system has been described to me as &ldquo;crisis management of the worst order&rdquo;, while, needless to say, staff morale is one of helpless frustration.</P>
    <P>Seventhly, the Act provides that the registry, and I quote from the 1964 Act, &ldquo;shall be under the control and management of an officer who shall be called the Registrar of Titles who shall be appointed by the Government&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is very interesting.  Why?  A year ago the registrar retired but what has happened since?  Nothing.  Why has no appointment been made by the Government?  This matter has been raised a number of times with the Government but no explanation has been given for this failure.  The only credible explanation offered to me is that the position is being left vacant to suit the convenience of a Fianna Fáil Party supporter at present in another position in the employment of the State.  If this is correct it reflects a totally cynical attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to hear a satisfactory explanation from the Minister.  I demand it and the 49,000 people who have been waiting for months for their transactions to be completed in the registry, which is without a captain at the helm, also want an explanation.  I demand that explanation and if I do not get a satisfactory one from the Minister I could not accept any protestations about an early improvement in the registry.  I will gladly wait to hear what the Minister has to say in this regard and the full explanation which I expect him to furnish to this House.  It is outrageous that the registry should be in the frightful position it is now in and that it has been left for a whole year without a chief executive being appointed, as is required by the Act.</P>
      <P>From speaking to solicitors I am aware that High Court mandamus proceedings are being prepared because of their inability to register their clients' titles. What are the consequences of the Government's total neglect of the registry? In a country with 250,000 out of work and 1,000 emigrating weekly, is it not time we took stock of our systems and structures which are contributing to this appalling record?  In all State procedures and systems which affect investment decisions delay is the enemy which must be avoided.  Where it is present it constitutes a negative on the balance sheet as to whether the investment takes place. This applies in very many areas, but none more so than in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> To put it very bluntly, the consequences of the present total disarray in the Land Registry are that economic activity is slowed down, building work is postponed or cancelled, and industrial or commercial projects have been affected. Furthermore, many people trying to establish homes are saddled with the enormous additional cost of bridging finance when they are awaiting their title to produce to the financial institutions.  This can add up to an extra £2,000 in the cost of a home.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we analyse the limitations of the present system in the Land Registry.  At present the functioning of the registry is subject to a number of crippling limitations which totally frustrate the efforts of management to respond to the requirements of the work situation and the demands of the public.  No major decisions can be taken in the management and control of the registry by the registrar.  The control of staffing, the fixing of fees and the acquisition of equipment are controlled by the Minister for Justice who, in addition, has to obtain the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, accommodation is controlled by the Office of Public Works. These cumbersome procedures involve a plethora of civil servants in the Departments of Justice and Finance, justifying their existence by making, or, in most instances, impeding, decisions which should be made in the registry itself.  As a consequence, there is a total lack of authority to make management decisions locally and, of course, management's time is wasted in the long process of trying to extract decisions from two Government Departments.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the rigidity of the Civil Service staff structures ensures that the registry cannot operate in an efficient, commercially orientated manner and, in particular, hinders the registry from acquiring and retaining particularly scarce skills which are critical to the development of a modern legal technological service.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the departure of the principal computer expert &mdash;<Col N="325" /> obviously I have not spoken to the man &mdash; but I am quite sure he was totally frustrated when the computerisation programme ground to a halt.  It is that type of person who has had years of training and experience that we cannot afford to lose.  What is the solution?  It is my belief that to foster job creation the glue in the works of all State systems must be removed.  The way to do it in the Land Registry is to radically change the manner in which it operates and to establish the registry as an efficient business orientated semi-State corporation.  It is time to remove the dead hand of bureaucracy from the Land Registry and to establish a system which would eliminate a major blockage to job creation and economic activity.  In so doing, the customer who pays the piper will be given his money's worth for the fees paid to this monopoly.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for the approach that Fine Gael advocate.  We now have An Post, Telecom Éireann and Coillte Teoranta, which run the forestry service. All these operations have improved enormously, although they are not yet perfect, since they were removed from direct control by the Civil Service.  In making a similar change for the Land Registry it would, of course, be necessary also to include the Registry of Deeds, about which there is not the same volume of complaints, but it would make sense to amalgamate the two.  In any event the registrar, if we had one, would not only be the Registrar of Titles but of Deeds as well.</P>
    <P>While there has not been the same volume of complaints about the Registry of Deeds, it is evident that difficulties have arisen in recent times.  In fact, I had a question tabled to the Minister on that subject last week and he confirmed that there were difficulties and that efforts were being made to clear up the problem. However, from the evidence available to me, the problems in the Registry of Deeds are not as serious as the awful problems in the Land Registry. However, in the changes I propose, the Registry of Deeds should, of course, be <Col N="326" /> included with the Land Registry in the proposed semi-State corporation.</P>
    <P>We also have to examine the question of finances.  Under the 1964 Act the registry essentially has to be self-financing.  I agree with that approach.  There is no reason, in its new manifestation as a semi-State corporation, that it should not continue to be self-financing.  It should also be mentioned that virtually every year the registry produces a surplus for the Exchequer.  Therefore, we are not talking about the problem of money.  There is a surplus for the Exchequer year by year. The Minister may claim that instead of a surplus there would be a deficit if account were taken of the Votes of the Minister for Justice on the administration of the Land Registry and the accommodation in the Four Courts complex, but, on the other hand, the Minister should note that money at present wasted in duplication at Civil Service level would be considerably reduced if the Fine Gael proposal were adopted.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister will have to take account of the fact that the registry do not charge fees for Government or ACC work at present.  One would balance out the other.  The main point I am making is that the problem is not one of finance.  Under the new structures which I propose I do not envisage any difficulty about finances.  There is also the possibility of a considerable increase in the level of income if an efficient service were available from the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>The scale of rejection of applications for registration would be reduced from the present 25 per cent &mdash; 30 per cent level and this would eliminate a substantial part of the refund of fees for rejected applications.  Immediate implementation of a comprehensive programme of computerisation would simplify procedures and provide an instant public service which would be availed of to an increased extent.  There would be a considerable increase in the throughput of applications and the improved efficiency would beneficially affect the flow of conveyancing generally.  The possibilities are there to increase income without increasing the level of fees.  I <Col N="327" /> would envisage that under the new system any increase in fees would have to be approved by the Minister.  Therefore, there are immense possibilities for improvement if the change proposed is made.  The registry would be free to recruit its own staff to meet its specialised needs &mdash; and that is very important &mdash; rather than having to take staff from the Civil Service pool as at present.  Staff morale would be considerably improved and there would be a better chance to retain specialised staff in whom a heavy training investment would have been made.  Management could plan and budget on the basis of their own perception of the demands on their resources.  It would be possible to draw up and adhere to a planned programme of computerisation.  There would be a huge benefit following the reduction in correspondence with the registry regarding delays, and I am sure that that alone would free a great number of the staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore &mdash; perhaps I am drawing now on my experience when I was Minister of State in charge of overseas aid &mdash; I would envisage that if we could establish a properly functioning registry here, it could be a model for registries in the developing world and could, through DEVCo, the semi-State body with responsibility in that area, create and establish consultancy possibilities in the developing world in the future.  At the moment, I would not hold it up as an example to the poorest and weakest countries in Africa or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is probably some consolation to know that recently an efficiency scrutiny of the Land Registry in Northern Ireland was conducted under the auspices of the Prime Minister's efficiency unit in Whitehall. The conclusions of that report confirm the great annoyance and inconvenience to many customers with the system there which was referred to as inflexible, slow and expensive.  Of course it is modelled on the same system as we have.  Those who had a choice in Northern Ireland rejected the Land Registry <Col N="328" /> system because of the high cost and lengthy delays associated with title registration. There was a conclusion that there was a need for a single system of title registration in Northern Ireland and that the existing machinery for registration there is inappropriate to its present and future needs.  As a consequence, a radically new approach was recommended there, one that is somewhat different from the kind of solution being discussed here.  Obviously the circumstances are different but the essential point I am making is that they see the need for a radical new approach there also.</P>
    <P>We are entering an era of magnetic land cards, digital maps and direct linkage between computers in legal offices and those in the registry.  It is clear that there is total incapacity on the part of a Civil Service structure to respond to the challenges of such an era.  The present structure has led to a totally unsatisfactory system, with inordinate and increasing delays and well justified criticism from all sources, both internal and external.  The proposal I am making to establish a semi-State corporation has the approval of the Incorporated Law Society.  I am aware that within the Land Registry there is a general acceptance of the need for radical change and would you blame them?  I have no doubt that the long-suffering customers and general public will enthusiastically endorse the proposal.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few concluding remarks before my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, comes in on the motion.  I wish to refer to the Minister's amendment.  At least he has the grace to accept that there is need for substantial improvements.  In regard to the problems in the Land Registry, let me point out that these did not arise today or yesterday.  It is over 12 months since the Incorporated Law Society made their proposal.  I mentioned that at the end of 1988 there were already 32,000 transactions in arrears and, as I have said, that figure has increased considerably.</P>
    <P>Since the urgent general review allegedly being carried out by the Minister which he announced last July, as far as I <Col N="329" /> know, nothing has happened in the Land Registry.  No steps have been taken to convass the view of those employed there.  I fear that what the Minister is talking about is a smokescreen for a further 12 months of inactivity and indecision during which time quite clearly the problem will deteriorate further.  The Minister should decide now that radical change is needed and he should also decide the direction which that radical change should take.</P>
    <P>As far as the amendment from The Workers' Party is concerned, that causes no problem.  In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, the motion includes the Registry of Deeds also.  Similarly in regard to the Labour Party amendment, that causes no problem.  Of course we want modernisation of equipment and facilities and we want adequate staffing levels.  I believe the number employed in the Land Registry should be no more and no less than that required to discharge its statutory functions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I refer to a very apt cartoon which I saw recently in a magazine about somebody applying for a mortgage.  The caption states that if you take your mortgage for the full 30-year period it should give the Land Registry time to process the title deeds.  Admittedly, that is stretching things a bit but it indicates the view of the problem that exists in the Land Registry.  What I am saying, therefore, is that we must drive a political motorway through the tangled undergrowth of State bureaucracy and free the Land Registry from its constraints.  Only in that way can the problems in the registry be resolved.</P>
    <P>I urge support from all sides of the House for this motion.  I would also suggest that it would very much accord with the philosophy which was enunciated prior to the election by the junior partner in Government, the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to be in a position to second this motion in the name of my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I am happy to have an opportunity of contributing to what I would regard as a very important debate on the future of the Land Registry.  As a House we can learn of our mistakes as far as the funding of the Land Registry since 1963 is concerned.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with a discussion document produced by the Incorporated Law Society in November 1988 which stated that the Land Registry and indeed the Registry of Deeds are inappropriately placed under the auspices of the Department of Justice.  I think the lessons we have learnt since 1963 should prompt the Minister to have a very serious look at the future of the Land Registry and the length of time it should remain under the direct control of his Department.  The purpose of the motion is to change matters and I hope that irrespective of or whether the motion is passed here tomorrow evening it will spur the Minister for Justice into some badly needed action.</P>
      <P>I refer to a Second Stage debate on the Registration of Title Bill in 1963 which was introduced to the House by the present Taoiseach, who stated in the course of that debate, in column 1134 the Official Report dated 7 November 1963:</P>
      <P>Registration of title is in essence a system of simplified conveyancing. One of its biggest advantages is that the forms used for sales, mortgages, and other dealings are readily intelligible to the layman.  The transfer of land becomes, as it should be, a painless, simple and inexpensive process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can judge those comments in the light of the crisis that exists in the Land Registry at present.  Later in that debate the Fine Gael spokesman at the <Col N="331" /> time, the late General Sweetman, when speaking on the principle of registration of title, stated in column 1146 that in theory there can be no possible doubt that it is desirable to have registered land. The late Mr. Sweetman warned: &ldquo;Whether the practice lives up to the theory is a matter that is to be considered otherwise&rdquo;.  The crisis that exists in the Land Registry at present should be sufficient to warrant great change on the part of the Minister.  I do not think the late Gerard Sweetman when expressing those doubts in 1963 would have envisaged that 26 years later we would be bringing to the House a motion of the type put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe arising out of the very serious crisis.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the practice in the Land Registry leaves so much to be desired that the whole purpose and object of the Registration of Title Act, 1963, has been defeated due to the fact that the Department of Justice cannot provide an efficient Land Registry to meet the necessary requirements.  Even in 1963 in the course of the debate in the Dáil, Deputies on all sides of the House spoke of delays in the Land Registry as it was at that time.  They stated it was unacceptable that it should take six months or more to complete a dealing.</P>
    <P>It was felt in 1963 with the dawning of the age of the photographic reproduction machine that unnecessary delays in the Land Registry would come to an end but, unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.  I see no reason, and I ask the Minister to give me an answer to this, that the simple exercise of photocopying a map or a three page land certificate should take six, seven, eight and in some cases nine months to complete.  The simple answer must be that the staff of the Land Registry are so overworked they cannot get around to dealing with a simple matter such as issuing a Land Registry map to an applicant who wants it in connection with an application to register a site on which, perhaps, a son or daughter, who may be thinking of getting married, may wish to build a house for which they wish to take out a loan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> The intolerable delays which exist at present in the Land Registry have widespread consequences not only for members of the solicitors' profession but also for vast numbers of people throughout the country.  For example, it is not possible for a young farmer to avail of installation aid because the cheque will not issue from the Department of Agriculture and Food until such time as a copy of his or her title deeds is lodged in the appropriate departmental section.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister for Agriculture and Food will not accept a certified copy of a transfer deed together with an undertaking from a solicitor to lodge the title documents on completion of the dealing with the Land Registry some months or years down the road.  The fact that the cheque will not issue until such time that the Land Registry have dispensed with all the various requirements and the documents have been fully registered has led to hardship for young farmers.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of people, mainly young couples, who are becoming extremely anxious that in relation to their recently constructed dwellinghouse on a building site which they purchased there is a defect in the title because the registration has not yet been completed.  They find it difficult to be satisfied with the work of their legal advisers while the papers remain unfinished for years on end.</P>
    <P>Banks and other financial institutions, particularly the four main banks, are delegating staff to deal solely with members of the solicitors' profession in connection with undertakings given between three and five years ago to lodge the necessary title documents.  Because the banks are finding it so difficult to keep track of what is happening in regard to the lodging of title documents they are now delegating staff solely for that purpose. For many members of the legal profession the inadequacies of the Land Registry have become a nightmare.  Day to day office efficiency has been eroded by a constant flow of queries from banks, building societies, clients and public representatives inquiring as to when the <Col N="333" /> Land Registry will complete a dealing long after all the necessary documents have been executed and submitted to a process which was described by the Taoiseach in 1963 as being basically a simple operation.  The good name of the legal profession has been undermined because of the failure of the Government to act on the problems in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Justice to reflect on the number of questions, either oral or written, addressed to him or his predecessor, Deputy Collins, during the past two and a half years concerning the delays in the Land Registry.  These questions were not put lightly by Members on all sides of this House.  The number of people attending clinics and contacting Members of this House in order to seek preferential treatment must be an indication to the 166 Members of this House that the problem in the Land Registry is one of crisis proportions.</P>
    <P>Another angle which the Minister might bear in mind is that during the past number of years we have witnessed the advent of the self-styled law searcher who advertises his wares to the general public and members of the legal profession, who puts himself out as being somebody who can for a fee expedite a dealing in the Land Registry as he may be in a position to exercise influence over an examiner and who purports to have inside knowledge as to how quickly one can get a map. His fee of between £15 and £20 adds considerably to the already heavy burden on the hard pressed consumer when it comes to buying a house or indulging in the transfer of property.  If we had an efficient system in the Land Registry and if there were sufficient staff employed there would be no need for people to make money out of the inadequacies in the Land Registry at present.</P>
    <P>When replying to an Adjournment debate earlier this year the Minister recognised that the Land Registry is a vital cog in our commercial life affecting the agricultural, industrial, building and other sectors of society.  He went on to state that it is essential that we clear the four to six month backlog and that everything possible be done to achieve <Col N="334" /> this.  I ask the Minister to tell us what progress has been made in this regard and to indicate where he gets the idea that there is only a four to six month backlog.  Applications for first registration are now taking three to four years to complete and applications to transfer a portion of land from one folio to another are now on average taking over 12 months.  I invite the Minister to investigate this matter with a view towards solving the problem.  It is shameful that it takes six months to process a simple application for a photocopy of a map and it is sad that the Minister for Justice can stand over this.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry is self financing, yet it takes on average over 12 months to process an application for registration of title at a cost on average of £200 to the consumer.  This leaves much to be desired and underlines the fact that the general public are getting a bad service from the Department of Justice and the Land Registry at present.  Certainly there is no such thing as value for money so far as applications are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment on the Registry of Deeds which in practice is a sister of the Land Registry other than to say that it is an antiquated institution which has managed over the years to preserve an atmosphere more suited to the days of Queen Victoria than the final decade of the 20th century.  It is unfortunate that the occurrence envisaged on the passing of Registration of Title Act in 1963 that compulsory registration would be extended to all parts of the country has not happened.  It is unfortunate, too, that on the threshold of the nineties compulsory registration in the Land Registry only exists in Counties Laois, Carlow and Meath.  It will not be possible therefore to rid ourselves of the cobwebbed way of life in the Registry of Deeds until such time as the necessary orders are made pursuant to the Registration of Title Act, 1964 to extend registration to other areas.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not intend to proceed along the lines envisaged in the motion, would he indicate to the House the positive steps he is going to take to <Col N="335" /> relieve the very serious problems in the Land Registry?  I have intended on several occasions to raise this matter by way of parliamentary question.  I was disappointed that, in answer to a question on 16 May this year, the Minister stated he had no proposals for the expansion of the role of the local Land Registry office to allow such offices to provide facilities to purchase by way of cash transation maps or land certificates and also to cater for search facilities and the lodging of transfer dealings.  I would have thought that by extending the role of the local office the Minister might find some way of alleviating the very serious problems which exist in the central office.</P>
    <P>I raised by way of parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice the question of staff and sought details of staff levels on 1 January 1987 and 1 January 1989.  I raised this question because in response to an Adjournment debate the Minister stated that there was an increased amount of conveyancing dealings and that these were adding to the workload of the hard pressed people in the Land Registry.  How can the Minister stand over that comment and allow a depletion of staff of the order we have since 1 January 1987?  On 1 January 1989 there were 388 people employed in the Land Registry &mdash; perhaps there are even fewer now &mdash; whereas on 1 January 1987 the number was 452.  I do not have time to specify the grades of those involved but even the cleaner has been dispensed with.  Between 1 January 1987 and 1 January 1989 dealings pending increased so that on 1 January 1989 there were 32,332 dealings outstanding, yet staff levels in the Land Registry have decreased almost by the month.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the conclusion reached by the Incorporated Law Society in their discussion document of November 1988 and to the conclusion reached by my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, when commenting on the motion.  It is ironic that the present Minister for Justice has direct experience as to the workings of a public corporation along the lines of An Post <Col N="336" /> and Telecom Éireann and, perhaps because of his other hat as Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke might be the necessary catalyst prompting urgent action so badly needed on the Land Registry delays.  Many hundreds of people are suffering because of Land Registry delays.  This matter will not receive headlines in the newspapers or be aired on television, but we should not take from the importance of the Land Registry as an institution.  Many hundreds of people, having paid their legal and Land Registry fees, are getting nothing but hardship due to the extraordinary delays in the Land Registry.  I hope the Minister will act accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Flanagan in relation to the numbers who have been caused distress by the Land Registry delays.  With that in mind, immediately on taking up office in July, I informed the House in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice, that I had undertaken a full review of the operations of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  That review is ongoing as a matter of urgency.  As I indicated to the House previously, including during Parliamentary Questions last week, that review has been carried out with a view to bringing about substantial improvements in the level of service being provided to the general public.</P>
      <P>At the outset it is important to outline briefly the objectives of the registration systems in both registries.  The registration system in the Land Registry aims at providing a well-ordered, well-indexed and well-mapped record of the ownership of each parcel of registered land.  The main object of the registry is to provide in one simple folio a complete and authentic record of the title of each registered parcel of land and of the exact extent and boundaries of such land illustrated by a map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the registration system in the Registry of Deeds is to protect purchasers, mortgagees and other persons acquiring interests in property for valuable consideration against claims to it arising under unknown or undisclosed deeds.  According to the general law of property, the period during which a vendor or mortgagor must show that he and his predecessors were entitled to the property he claims is, normally, about 40 years; and a purchaser or mortgagee is bound by the deeds that have been registered during that period.  In contrast to the Land Registry, which deals with land <Col N="338" /> and property which are in process of being or have already been registered, the Registry of Deeds transactions are all in respect of unregistered land and property.</P>
    <P>The services provided by the registries are essential to the public interest and I fully accept the point made in the motion that the delays currently being experienced by members of the public and by the legal profession who use the registries are unacceptable.  It is my intention to take the necessary steps to minimise delays and to ensure that the services are provided in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  However, before I can finalise the steps which are necessary, I need to review the operation of the registries and to examine carefully the various options which are open to me, including the option of establishing a semi-State corporation.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made tonight to the fact that the law society referred to the semi-State structure as being the ideal structure in their review of the operation of the Land Registry.  Like most other people, including all the Members of this House, their main concern was not the structure but to try to remove the delays for people.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall review which I am carrying on at the moment, I visited the Land Registry offices in Setanta Centre and I have had discussions with the personnel involved with a view to obtaining their views on the best way forward.</P>
    <P>To give some indication of the size of the operation in the registries, perhaps it would be helpful to mention some figures. The total number of applications annually exceeds 250,000.  The Land Registry applications can be divided into seven broad categories, viz.  Dealings, Examiners Cases e.g. first registrations and conversion of title, Land Commission cases, copy maps, land certificates, copy folios and instruments and ground rent purchase scheme cases. Requests for copy folios and instruments can be dealt with very speedily.  However, applications which require examination <Col N="339" /> of title can be complex and time-consuming &mdash; approximately 100,000 applications fall into this category.  In addition in the case of many applications queries are raised which can involve considerable correspondence with solicitors and this can be very protracted.</P>
    <P>On the delays in correspondence, which was also referred to by Deputy Flanagan in relation to the number of questions put down by Members in the House, and by Deputy O'Keeffe, who said that if the system were more efficient the work could be cut down considerably and there would not need to be the same amount of correspondence for public representatives and others, one of the big problems I have come across so far in the review which I have been conducting and in response to the questions in the House, is that inevitably in at least 50 per cent of cases a solicitor has sent in some documentation which has been found to be deficient and a request has gone back for additional information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that that causes all the delay but it is part of the delay process.  I am not justifying the delays, which are totally unacceptable, but as part of the delay process that is what is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy from my own experience that it is quite substantial.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Registry of Deeds the work can be divided into three main categories &mdash; registration, negative searches and common searches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the work intake of both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds in recent years which can mainly be attributed to the upturn in the property market.  The number of applications to the registries has been increasing steadily since 1985. In the first ten months of this year the <Col N="340" /> number of Land Registry dealing applications, which comprise the bulk of Land Registry work, increased by 21 per cent over the same period last year.  This increase, combined with the staffing restrictions common to the entire public service, continues to have an impact on arrears in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.</P>
    <P>Without commenting at this stage on the merits or otherwise of the proposal to establish the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds as a semi-State corporation I should point out that serious issues such as whether and how to ensure the present State guarantee of title in the changed situation and how to reconcile that situation with the concept of compulsory registration would need very careful examination.  Reconstitution of the registries as some form of semi-State corporation would require legislation which would take a considerable amount of time.  Apart from difficulties in drawing up detailed proposals and drafting a Bill, the legislation would not be without controversy.</P>
    <P>The difficulties currently being experienced in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds require urgent solutions.  It is my intention to tackle this problem by relieving the immediate arrears difficulties within a structure which in the future will be able to respond speedily and efficiently to the demands which will continue to be made on it.</P>
    <P>The resources necessary to carry out the functions of the registries can broadly be divided into three categories &mdash;&mdash; accommodation, staff and machinery. The accommodation needs are kept under constant review and storage space for documents is a big problem.  I am sure I do not need to emphasise the importance of good storage facilities readily accessible for retrieval of files and the importance of storing them under proper conditions.  The Office of Public Works are reviewing storage space on hand which can be fitted out and ready for use by the registries next year.  This will considerably relieve pressure on accommodation in the Chancery Street and Setanta Centres.  That was stressed by <Col N="341" /> the staff in their submissions when I met them.</P>
    <P>While the registries in common with the public service generally have been subject to restrictions on staffing numbers, an additional 35 staff were sanctioned for the Land Registry last year, but taking account of further resignations, retirements, and so on the net increase is now only two.  I have, however, provided in the Estimates for 1990 for the additional 33 staff sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The post of registrar in both the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, to which it has been the practice to appoint the one person, is vacant at present.  I have not moved to fill the post since I took up office.  As I was immediately aware of the need for an urgent review of the operations of both registries, I considered that decisions regarding the filling of the post should not pre-empt the outcome of the review.</P>
    <P>I want to categorically deny the suggestion made by Deputy O'Keeffe that I was holding this position for any individual. That could not be further from the truth. I am trying to ensure that I do not pre-empt the outcome of the review by appointing a person who may not be the most suitable individual for the new structure, whether that structure is a semi-State one or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am outlining the position that has existed since July.  A programme of computerisation of the Land Registry folio data base commenced in 1982 with a pilot project in the Dublin region.  Following an intensive programme of file creation, the Dublin region folios of the Land Registry and recording of application details and movement are now fully computerised.  The system provides immediate access to and retrieval of title information through a sophisticated indexing and tracking system.</P>
      <P>In 1987 an extension of the system commenced in the western region of the Land Registry, which comprises counties Galway, Clare, Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo.  From then on all new folios opened for those counties were computerised, with consequent user benefits similar to those at present available in the Dublin region.  These benefits will increase as the database is increased.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the extension of the programme to the western region, an examination of the requirements and long-term strategies of the Land Registry's 25 local offices was undertaken and it is the intention to extend computerisation into other regions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made great play about the position of registrar and I told him some time ago that his accusation was without foundation.  I have given him the background to this matter and explained why I am holding the position vacant.  I acknowledge that that is unsatisfactory but there is no basis for the wild allegation he made in the House. I have no doubt that tomorrow night the Deputy will withdraw his allegation; he might do the gracious thing and withdraw it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the benefits to be gained from a computerised <Col N="343" /> system for the registries.  The benefits gained from the system already in place can be illustrated by the example of producing copy folios.  Prior to computerisation there was only one original folio per registered property which was available to only one person at any given time for photocopying.  With computerisation an unlimited number of copies is available within a matter of seconds resulting in immediate service for people calling to the public counter.</P>
      <P>It is planned that computerisation of the data base in the Registry of Deeds will commence at the beginning of 1990. A computerised Registry of Deeds system will provide for immediate access and fast, accurate search facilities.  Computerisation is often put forward as a cure all solution.  While I recognise that there are many benefits to be gained from a comprehensive computer system, particularly in a high volume retrieval system such as operated by the registries, it is, however, a longer term solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding about this issue from the virginal pure Fine Gael Party, I should like to say that the delays and arrears in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds are not new phenomena.  The figures for arrears in all categories of applications at the beginning of each year show that this has been a problem for a considerable time. For example, at the beginning of October this year the arrears of Land Registry applications in the &ldquo;dealings&rdquo; category was 47,448.  There has been an increase in applications in the first ten months this year of 21 per cent, but it is important to bear in mind that there was an arrears figure of 29,994 in that category at the beginning of October 1985.  The position in the Land Registry has been appalling for years and all parties must accept responsibility for it.  As I have already said, there has been a steady increase in the work intake since 1985.  I intend to come to grips with the problem.  Deputy O'Keeffe kindly referred to Coillte Teorantá and said it was established to deal with the problem in regard to forestry.  I <Col N="344" /> should like to remind him that that took place when I was Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking up office in July I informed the House that I had undertaken a full review of the operations of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  That review is still on-going as a matter of urgency and is not being long-fingered. There are a number of options open to me and I believe that all possible solutions must be carefully examined so that in the end the best interests of the public will be served by whatever solution is implemented.  I am, however, aware of the need for urgency in finalising my review and I can assure the House that I will not delay in putting proposals to Government in the matter as soon as the review is complete, which will be shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment which notes that he is carrying out an urgent general review of the operation of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds with a view to bringing about substantial improvements in the level of services provided by the registries. It is well known that the registration system in the Land Registry aims at providing a well ordered, well indexed and well mapped record of the ownership of each parcel of registered land.  Of course, it is the delay in doing that that is causing the problem.  The object of the registration system is to protect purchasers, mortgagees and other persons acquiring interests in property for valuable consideration against claims to it arising under unknown or undisclosed deeds.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be careful before he transfers the duties and functions of the Land Registry to any other organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the delays being experienced by the public, the legal profession who use the registries and the public representatives are unacceptable. There is an extraordinary delay in relation to applications for first registration of title, better known to public representatives as section 49 applications. The large number of applications to the Land Registry is due to the fact that there has been an upswing in the <Col N="345" /> property market over the last three years. The construction of more and more new houses, where mortgages are tied in, results in additional work for the Land Registry.  It also causes problems for purchasers, vendors and the legal profession. Solicitors' applications for rectification of boundaries are being dealt with in a rather slow fashion by the Land Registry at the moment.</P>
    <P>I believe that local authority work is given a very low priority in the Land Registry and I ask the Minister to urge the registry to give a high order of priority to local authority work.  There are extraordinarily long delays on the part of the Land Registry in dealing with applications for rectification of boundaries and mapping problems, in dealing with registration of titles and applications for transfers of sites for county council cottages. In addition, cases passed on by the Land Commission to the Land Registry appear to have low priority.  It is also known that loans approved for housing, small industrial projects and farm development grants cannot be paid for a considerable period, resulting in undue hardship, and the Land Registry is implicated in this in a significant manner.  These delays mean that people are put to extraordinary expense paying bridging loans at high interest rates.</P>
    <P>The delays are understandable when one takes into account the number of staff employed in the Land Registry in various areas as opposed to the total number of applications annually, exceeding 250,000.  This figure is frightening. The Land Registry today could not hope to cope with this work in the same way as it did ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  I welcome the Minister's decision to deal with the situation in the Land Registry as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>All public representatives have experience of the type of delays that occur in the Land Registry in examiners' cases, Land Commission cases, copying of maps, certificates and so on.  It is well worth noting that computerisation of the Land Registry folio database commenced in 1982 with a pilot project in the Dublin region.  This was completed and was a <Col N="346" /> success.  I note as well that such an exercise commenced in the western region in 1987 and I would ask the Minister to take into account in his review the suggestion that such an exercise should be carried out in other areas as fast as possible.  With computerisation an unlimited number of copies could be made available in a matter of seconds, resulting in immediate service for people calling to the public counter.  It will, of course, take time to get everything accurately on computer.  We know well what the results could be should any errors be put into the computers.</P>
    <P>The delays have been increasing and this is due to the increasing number of transactions going through the Land Registry.  I do not blame solicitors; they have a tough job to hold the fort between the Land Registry and their clients.  I have full confidence that the Minister will formulate proposals for a speedy solution to this major problem, which affects all of us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a problem that has arisen overnight or during the term of this or the previous Government; it has been with us for years.  The mover of the motion, Deputy O'Keeffe, must realise this from his experience as a solicitor. Solicitors looking for copy folio and file plans have to wait up to six weeks.  Consequently, there are unnecessary delays in completing sales.  I believe that these delays are now reduced.  I am not sure how long it takes to complete the registration in the Land Registry but there was a time when it took anything up to 12 months.  Particularly troublesome was <Col N="347" /> the transfer of a site for a new house. Loans could not be paid until title was established.  As a result high losses were incurred at the very time when an unfortunate couple trying to provide themselves with a house were under the greatest pressure.  This problem has now been considerably eased as once the solicitor is prepared to certify that all necessary legal documentation has been lodged with the Land Registry and only registration is awaited the loan can be issued. This is a welcome advance and one which has eased the pressure on many young couples.  I must give credit to those involved in bringing this situation about.</P>
    <P>I am not certain what the real problem is but possibly it is shortage of staff and old-fashioned manual methods.  The medicine I would prescribe is the recruitment of suitably qualified staff.  The embargo in recruitment must be lifted in cases like this.  I am sure that among the 250,000 unemployed there are some very well qualified persons who could be taken on.  This embargo probably caused the boycott or go-slow among the staff which occurred some time ago when solicitors or their agents were not allowed to see the staff or help to expedite business.</P>
    <P>Is it not about time computerisation replaced the old-fashioned cumbersome manual methods that are still employed in parts of the Land Registry?  In a world of ever improving communications it is unfortunate that these improvements cannot be made in the Land Registry.  It would not be necessary to do away with the Land Registry to take these two suggestions on board.  I advise the House not to scrap the Land Registry first for the sake of scrapping it.  One must have something better to put in in its place. There is no guarantee that a semi-State corporation is the answer to all our ills. The Land Commission created a lot of enemies when they were in existence. They were scrapped but what replaced them?  Nothing.  As a result, some of the good work that was done by the Land Commission is now being neglected. There is a saying that if one gives a dog a bad name it will stick to him; the <Col N="348" /> opposite is also true, if one gets a good name for getting up early one can stay in bed all day.</P>
    <P>I often think that the Land Registry has become a very handy whipping boy for some of the inefficient solicitors operating here who blamed the Land Registry for delays that originated in their own offices.  I know that Deputy O'Keeffe is an early bird but I am sure that even he will agree that not all of his colleagues rise with the lark.  However, I realise that many of our efficient solicitors believe that delays are at an intolerable level and that a reorganisation of our resources is called for in order to remedy this chronic situation.  The Minister has undertaken a full review of the operations of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds with a view to bringing about substantial improvements in the level of service provided by them.  This has to be taken as a very welcome statement from the Minister and I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Let me join you, Sir, in welcoming the new Member's maiden speech.  I know what it is like to make a first speech in this House.  One wishes one might be in another place.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment to this motion reads:</P>
      <P>with the freedom to retain and invest whatever surplus it accumulates in modernisation of equipment and facilities, and in adequate professional staffing levels.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy J. O'Keeffe for having communicated to the House the fact that he has no objection to the Labour Party addendum to what is a very important motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that there is a crisis in the Land Registry Office.  He said that the difficulties currently being experienced in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds require urgent solutions. Because of that the Opposition Parties, by way of amendment and addendum have tried to identify for the House a problem which has been accepted by all sides as having been in existence for an unacceptable time.  It was <Col N="349" /> important that the Minister responded positively, as he did, but we hoped he would have gone further, and perhaps before this debate concludes he or spokespersons from the Government side will indicate further action that needs to be taken in the Land Registry to eliminate the delays there.</P>
    <P>There is now a major crisis in the Land Registry Office, caused solely by Government cutbacks, particularly by the Government's early retirement scheme, which, because of the sensitivity of the Land Registry, as part of a staff embargo, was particularly unsuitable. The consequence has been a virtual collapse in the services offered by the Land Registry, and enormous delays in completions of house and land transactions. It would be remiss of me as a representative of the Labour Party if I did not compliment the existing staff on their dedication.  They work under tremendous stress and are there to help Deputies from all sides and the legal profession. The staff who remain after the numbers have been reduced because of the early retirement scheme are totally frustrated but in spite of that and in accordance with the good practice of civil servants they have continued to carry out their job as best they can.</P>
    <P>As a House of the Oireachtas, we have not given them the support they deserve, particularly in the staffing area.  In spite of that they meet all our representations with a certain degree of understanding. They know we are under tremendous pressure from land owners, house owners, people involved in property deals, from widows trying to register their own titles to property acquired on the death of their husbands to local authority tenants awaiting proper registration of titles and property purchased and vested from local authorities.  At times such applications are submitted in bulk by the local authorities and, as previous speakers have said, do not and cannot possibly be processed with the urgency they deserve.</P>
    <P>In all land dealings and house property transfers nowadays there is the dead hand of the banking institutions by way of <Col N="350" /> mortgages, increased mortgages and increasing rates of interest for mortgages, involving further extractions of money while people are awaiting loan facilities. Bridging finance has become a second industry because of the difficulties experienced in registering titles to property up for sale and because registration has to come through before proper loan facilities can be made available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has a direct responsibility to the House in this matter under his Vote and the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the level of staff in the public service.  In spite of the Minister's efforts, which he itemised in his speech, and in spite of increasing the numbers in the Land Registry since he came to office because of resignations, the net increase in the staff level is only two.  That is not sufficient for the type of service we want.</P>
    <P>In the middle of this year there was a backlog in the Land Registry of almost 40,000 applications, the highest figure ever and an increase of almost a quarter on the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big turnover in land dealings and Deputy Davern should be aware of that.  Whether or not we have vested interests in this area, as public representatives we have one cardinal responsibility, to enable our constituents who make legitimate applications to have their property registered and their titles secure so that they can either buy or sell.  That responsibility rests with the Government initially in the preparation of Estimates and in the Opposition, whose job is to highlight the deficiencies in the service at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average delay in transferring sites as a result of the increased backlog is approximately two years.  That is totally <Col N="351" /> unacceptable to the Labour Party.  There are 12,000 Land Commission vestings in arrears, and this Government are about to abolish the Land Commission.  It takes approximately 11 years to complete any such land registry vestings from the Land Commission.  The Land Commission were set up for the purpose of dealing with fragmented holdings and trying to secure adjacent pieces of land so that the farmers can work their holdings properly. Now, because of the need to borrow, all these titles must be properly registered to comply with the law and with banking regulations.  Unfortunately, gone are the days when outside the chapel gate on a Sunday land transactions took place with a slap on the hand and a spit in the fist and trust in one another.  There were no borrowings at that time, so possibly there was no need to register holdings to the degree necessary nowadays.</P>
    <P>Since 1986, according to the Department of Justice's figure, the Land Registry have lost 75 staff, approximately 17 per cent of their total complement.  It is now 11 months since the Land Registrar retired, and he has yet to be replaced.  I take issue with the Minister's reason for not replacing this most important official. Surely it was not beyond the bounds of possibility or imagination on the part of the Minister that any new registrar might be advised that a review of the operation of the office and his possible functions at the time of his appointment, or in the future, might take place.  That is no excuse for the Minister allowing this post to remain unfilled for 11 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there may be reasons, but I am sure any new appointee would accept that a review was being carried out and that existing structures in the Land Registry Office might be changed.  If he were of the same calibre as the previous office holder, he would be willing to adapt himself to any new procedures the Minister or this House might lay down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Experienced staff ar leaving in frustration all of the time.  Morale in this organisation is at an all-time low.  It is at a low because we all subject them to pressure. The media have taken on board the fact that this office is one of the most understaffed, overworked and abused offices in the country.  No wonder, then, that there is frustration among the staff.  Even if all the new staff were appointed tomorrow it would take six months for them to be sufficently competent to be of any use whatsoever in this office because &mdash; and the Minister admits this &mdash; this office needs a special degree of expertise to deal with the kind of work we require them to do on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry have been seeking computerisation for five years but only the most rudimentary service has been provided.  The Minister talked about the pilot scheme that was initiated in 1982. He says it was successful and that he has extended it to other areas to cover parts of the west of Ireland, in particular, counties Galway, Clare, Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo.  We welcome that and we also suggest that the Minister consider the whole concept of decentralisation for this type of office throughout other parts of Ireland where we would be able to contact it at local level.  With the extension of a proper computer system to which many legal offices throughout the country would have access, perhaps the Minister would consider decentralisation of the Land Registry.  What is most ludicrous of all is that the Land Registry are more than capable of standing on their own feet.  They are a viable operation.  For instance, this year the office is expected to contribute over £8.9 million to the Exchequer through Land Registry fees and other sources of income.  That represents a profit of more than £1 million to the Exchequer.  In these circumstances it is clear that the time has come to consider &mdash; and this has already been suggested and has not been ruled out by the Minister &mdash; whether the Land Registry would be able to operate more efficiently and more effectively if they were not stultified by the bureaucracy of the Department of Justice and, possibly, the <Col N="353" /> Department of Finance.  On 10 October last we suggested the establishment of the Land Registry as a commercial semi-State company with their own policy making board and a professional approach to generating business and discharging it efficiently.  They could do so always with the overall responsibility of being answerable to the State.  That could happen at Estimates time or when a report of their proceedings would arrive before this House for discussion.  At all times, although they would be semi-State and autonomous, they would still have a reporting back procedure to this House and we would be of the opinion that that would meet the legal requirement on behalf of the State to properly register title.</P>
    <P>Such a move would require legislation and you would find that the Labour Party would be supportive of change in the legislation that could bring that about. The passage of this motion tomorrow would be no guarantee that legislation would follow immediately.  However, there is reason to believe that every Member of this House, irrespective of party affiliation, is equally aware of the difficulties being experienced in the Land Registry.  All speakers, so far, from Fine Gael, the Government and the Labour Party are of one voice, that we are all aware of the difficulties being experienced in the Land Registry since all of us, individually and collectively, have experienced these difficulties on behalf of our constituents.  If there was a free vote on this motion, I believe that Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Deputies would support the modernisation of the Land Registry as proposed by the Labour Party and by the movers of the motion as well as by those who have tabled the other amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>There would be little point in taking the radical step of turning the Land Registry into a semi-State company if the consequences were that there was no real change.  That is why we have put down the addendum I proposed earlier.  We believe the Government should establish <Col N="354" /> general policy for commercial and semi-State companies and then let the companies manage their own operations free of Government or ministerial interference. There are too many examples of semi-State companies who are afraid to make a surplus or a profit because they know that if they do this Government, and any Government of the day, would probably appropriate the profits for their own coffers.  This would be the attitude of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>If the Land Registry are to be allowed to stand on their own feet they must do so in the confidence that they would be able to invest in their own future and out of their own resources.  The corollary of that is that we are entitled to expect performance from a properly resourced, properly managed and properly staffed semi-State company.  It is on that basis we are supporting this motion.  We are seeking the support of others and we welcome the support of the movers of the motion for our addendum, which is not unreasonable.  We want to ensure that any changes will give a certain amount of autonomy to the Land Registry, particularly regarding staff and the management of their own affairs.  We also want to ensure that any additional money generated is ploughed back into resources within the section to be used for the continuing computerisation programme which is desirable and which is nowadays considered to be the most efficient means of access to folio numbers and any other dealing number we give to the Land Registry.  Through the computerisation programme and the data base which would follow they would have immediate access to some of the information we need.  We need to be able to tell our constituents where exactly an application is, where exactly it is being processed and how quickly the deal will be processed.  Sometimes legitimate deals between people concerning land or houses fall through if they cannot be completed on time and if financial institutions are not prepared to advance money, except under the most expensive form of bridging finance, to people who wish to acquire property; they want to <Col N="355" /> know if it is the legitimate property of the vendor.  That is not an unreasonable request and certainly our addendum would lead to the evolution of an office that has a most important role and function in this country and that has a Constitution that is so strong in the defence of the private property owner and in the defence of private property itself that it is imperative that all land dealings would be registered and would never be subjected to question by courts hereafter. Anybody who expends funds on property is entitled to know whether it was a question of right of way, proper mapping etc. In whatever area information is required the Land Registry must be staffed and competent to deal with it.</P>
    <P>We could then eliminate the trauma of, for instance, widows who are waiting for proper title to property inherited, a title that their husbands may have achieved outside the chapel gate on a Sunday by a shake of hands in the old days.  Unfortunately, those days are gone and now everything needs to be registered. That is the reason that in a period of 12 months the workload has increased by as much as 25 per cent.  This must be an indication to the Minister and to the House that the question of the Land Registry is urgent.  I am glad the Minister has committed himself to addressing and revamping the registry.  He has not ruled out the possibility of making them a semi-State company if, on the advice available to him, he considers this to be the most efficient way of dealing with the problem. I am quite sure &mdash; and Deputy O'Keeffe has said this &mdash; that they are open to the suggestion that this may be the way forward.  Because of the volume of business involved and the fact that the registry are self sufficient by reason of their ability to raise their own funds, they could be efficient and could be a credit to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be afforded this occasion to address the Dáil on the situation in Cambodia, a situation which is continuing to cause concern both here in Ireland and internationally.  The announced withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupation forces in late September, and the fears of many that the Khmer Rouge could once again seize power by force, have refocused attention on this small country, whose inhabitants have had to endure so much suffering.</P>
      <P>Who among us could forget the infamous &ldquo;Killing Fields&rdquo; of the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge regime, which reigned with such absolute terror between 1975 and 1978?  The memory of the deaths of over one million of their fellow citizens caused by the Pol Pot regime is etched irreversibly on the collective consciousness of the world.  The absolute horror of that period must never be repeated.</P>
      <P>The Government have, therefore, been deeply concerned at the recent intensification of hostilities in Cambodia in the wake of the Vietnamese pullout. We have been particularly concerned by the reported successes of the Khmer Rouge forces on the ground, since a central plank of our policy on Cambodia has always been that everything must be done to prevent the return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime, which is guilty of so many heinous crimes against its own people.</P>
      <P>But our policy must not be, and is not, based solely on a negative reaction to any prospect of a return to power of the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge.  The Cambodian people need and deserve our best efforts to chart a course towards a comprehensive political solution to this conflict, which has so scarred their country in human and physical terms.  Our policy throughout the years has remained consistent and coherent in its adherence to a set of core principles, around which, in our view, any settlement must be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believe that a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement must be based on the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Cambodia. It must include the withdrawal of <Col N="357" /> all foreign forces under United Nations supervision.  We also insist on the absolute right of the Cambodian people to determine their own destiny free from outside interference.  The exercise of this right must find expression in the holding of internationally supervised, free and fair elections.  Any settlement must, of course, ensure that the people of Cambodia are never again subjected to the inhuman barbarities which they suffered under the Pol Pot regime.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with its partners in the European Community, has welcomed the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.  We would have wished that the withdrawal had been effected under the supervision of the United Nations in order that it could have been fully verified and accepted by the international community.  The fact that it has not been so verified has given rise to controversy regarding the extent of the Vietnamese withdrawal and a refusal by certain key countries to accept that the withdrawal has been total.</P>
    <P>The occupation of Cambodia by foreign forces was a fundamental stumbling block to progress towards a settlement, as well as being a transgression of one of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.  The Government consider that the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces provides a valuable opportunity to move towards a comprehensive political settlement. We therefore strongly urge an immediate end to hostilities by all sides in Cambodia, as well as an end to all foreign and military aid to the parties to the conflict.  Ireland has already made a plea at the United Nations, as recently as last month, that all sides to the conflict resist the temptation to seek to advance their objective by force of arms and instead devote themselves to the search for a solution by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The window of opportunity provided by the Vietnamese withdrawal must not be allowed to be closed by the forces of intransigence.  The Government believe that the recent international conference on Cambodia held in Paris in August, under the chairmanship of France and Indonesia, managed to make worthwhile <Col N="358" /> progress towards a settlement.  The conference had to be suspended before a number of important issues could be resolved.  It is now time to resume the conference and tackle these issues in a spirit of flexibility and compromise.  The Cambodian people deserve no less.</P>
    <P>The issue of Cambodia is due to be debated at the United Nations during the course of the next two days.  At the end of the debate the General Assembly will be asked to vote on a draft resolution setting out the Assembly's view on the current situation in Cambodia.  A number of representations have been made to me concerning Ireland's vote on this resolution, and whether we will be voting to allow the present incumbents of the Cambodian seat to remain in control of that seat.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Sean Calleary, informed the Dáil during the Adjournment Debate on 2 November last, the issue of the representation of Cambodia at the General Assembly is not due to be voted on during the current session of the Assembly.  In the past, this issue has been raised in the form of a challenge to the credentials of the delegation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Such a challenge has not been made at the current session of the General Assembly.  Whenever such a challenge has been mounted in the past, Ireland has abstained in the vote, on the grounds that neither the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, nor the Government of Mr. Hun Sen in Phnom Penh, has received any form of endorsement from the people of Cambodia. We hope that at the next session of the General Assembly the Cambodian seat will be held by a delegation which truly represents the people of Cambodia, following the exercise by them of their right to self-determination through participation in free and fair elections.</P>
    <P>The draft resolution on the situation in Cambodia, which has been tabled by the ASEAN counties and which has a large number of co-sponsors, has been carefully examined to ascertain the extent to <Col N="359" /> which the fundamental principles espoused by Ireland have been included in the text.  From Ireland's point of view, the draft resolution contains all of the points which we regard as fundamental, notably: withdrawal of all foreign forces under UN supervision; restoration and preservation of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutral status of Cambodia; the right of the Cambodian people to determine their own future through internationally supervised free and fair elections; and the incompatibility of a return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime with the achievement of lasting peace in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>As a result of the inclusion of these fundamental points in the draft resolution, Ireland will vote in favour of it when the voting scheduled for Thursday, 16 November, takes place.  Although Ireland will vote in favour of the draft resolution, we have declined to co-sponsor it &mdash; despite having co-sponsored the corresponding resolutions in previous years &mdash; because there are some points in the draft resolution with which we are not entirely satisfied.  For example, we would have preferred a stronger emphasis on the need for an immediate cease-fire and a return by all parties to the negotiating table.  We also believe that the references to the non-return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime could be more explicit.  Therefore, in voting in favour of the draft resolution, Ireland will deliver a statement in explanation of its vote, which will state clearly the fundamental principles on which our policy is based and which will particularly emphasise our total opposition to a return to power of the genocidal Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime.</P>
    <P>The Cambodian people have suffered for long enough.  It is time to give them the opportunity to put the past behind them and to elect a Government which can lead the country on the difficult path to national reconstruction.  To achieve this aim, the international community must prevent a return to power of the discredited and barbarous Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> As an expression of our solidarity with the long-suffering people of Cambodia, the Government have decided to make available the sum of IR£50,000 for emergency humanitarian relief inside Cambodia.  We hope that, when peace has finally been restored in Cambodia, the international community will join in assisting the democratically-elected Government in the massive task of reconstruction which they face.  I am sure that I reflect the views of all Deputies when I express the hope that the Cambodian people will not have too much longer to wait before they are allowed to get on with living their lives in peace, free from outside interference.  I can assure Deputies that Ireland will continue to do whatever it can to advance this aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's remarks because there is a conflict between saying that the resolution maintains the incompatibility of the return of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge régime with the achievement of a lasting peace in Cambodia and then voting in favour of that resolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution leaves the seat in the hands of those who hold it now, which is disappointing.  However, I congratulate and strongly welcome the allocation of £50,000 for humanitarian aid to the Cambodian people, which is very badly wanted.  Having said that, I urge the Minister in the strongest possible terms to instruct the Irish delegation at the United Nations to vote against the resolution the day after tomorrow because of the effect it will have of leaving the seat in the hands of the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should also use their influence with their European Community colleagues to get support for the strategy to seek to remove the mantle of United Nations recognition from the present coalition.  Although statements have been made by many members of the United Nations, it is extraordinary that even at this stage they still support a <Col N="361" /> coalition that had effectively broken up 18 months ago and which now sees the Khmer Rouge on their merry way as they did for three years when they ruined Cambodia.</P>
    <P>The Government should also undertake diplomatic and political action to ensure that material support and legitimacy is cut off from the Khmer Rouge. The almost incomprehensible level of violence and genocide which have marked the conflict in Cambodia shows us that the roots of social and political upheaval there are complex in the extreme.  There is a shift in the balance and influence in that part of Asia and people from outside are trying to influence events there.  While I welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation in the Dáil, a short exchange such as this cannot even begin to explore the complex problems in Cambodia in particular and in South-East Asia generally.  In such a short time it is impossible to tease out each Member's position.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have proposed an all Party Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs. I understand it has been agreed between the two parties in Government that such a committee will be set up.  That is the objective of all the parties in Opposition and if such a committee was in place now the issue could have been debated at greater length there than in the Dáil by means of a series of statements.  Many of the issues which would come before such a committee are not Fine Gael, Labour Party or Fianna Fáil issues; they are national issues and there should be a national stance in that regard.  A committee of that kind would bring about the kind of consensus which is necessary in relation to our dealings with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the situation in Cambodia is very complex and is changing almost daily.  The Khmer Rouge took control of the country and engaged in a policy of genocide and tyranny for the three years they were in power, which was ended by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.  The Cambodian people &mdash; and perhaps others outside the country &mdash; were initially not displeased with that <Col N="362" /> turn of events and it is ironical that, ten years later, the Vietnamese, in spite of the diplomatic efforts centred on removing them from Cambodia, are probably not displeased to go given the fact that they lost 25,000 people in their foray in the area.  They badly damaged their economy and their <i>per capita</i> income is now less than that of Bangladesh.  When the USSR said they should withdraw they had no option but to go.  I know some doubt has been cast on whether they went but the only country of substance that holds the belief that they did not withdraw from Cambodia in the past 12 months is China.  Everyone else accepts the fact that they have gone.  That fact will help to improve their relations with the Chinese and perhaps with the Americans whom they hope will use their influence to lift the sanctions that have isolated them for the past ten years.  They also want to be on good terms with their ASEAN and South-East Asian neighbours.</P>
    <P>When I was President of the Council of Ministers in the European Community I remember two very long meetings, one in Jakarta with the ASEAN countries plus New Zealand, Australia, America and the Pacific bowl countries.  Almost two days were devoted to what was then the problem of Kampuchea and how it could be resolved using the influence of that group of nations to bring about the restoration of the right to run their own affairs, the removal of the Vietnamese and the assurance that, whoever took over after the Vietnamese pulled out, a vacuum would not be created which the Khmer Rouge could fill.  However, that is precisely what happened.  There is a vacuum and a grave danger that the Khmer Rouge will fill it.</P>
    <P>We had another subsequent meeting in Dublin in which the ASEAN countries and the Foreign Ministers of the European Community took part.  They devoted a very lengthy period to the same problem, they came to the same conclusion as to what we wanted to achieve but they were powerless to achieve those ends.  Five years have passed since then and some of the ends have been achieved <Col N="363" /> but there is a grave danger that the outcome we most dreaded &mdash; the return of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to power &mdash; will come about against the wish of the Cambodian people.</P>
    <P>Our position with the rest of the west was that we could not support Vietnam because they invaded Cambodia.  Neither could we support the coalition Government because of the presence in it of the Khmer Rouge.  However, that situation has now changed because of the Paris Conference and the withdrawal of the Vietnamese.  The collapse of the peace conference in Paris was because the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, refused to allow Pol Pot or his representatives to share in the formation of a government.  The other partners felt that if civil war was to be avoided Khmer Rouge participation was necessary and that is the impasse in which the United Nations and the Minister find themselves in the vote coming up the day after tomorrow.  The Minister is, in effect, voting for what is impossible because voting for this resolution will mean that the Khmer Rouge will take part in talks and that the existing Government will not.</P>
    <P>Until the United Nations in particular and the collective wisdom of the members of that body apply their minds to the problem, the danger of Pol Pot coming back to power in Cambodia is increasing.  The failure of those talks has brought that possibility much nearer: many would say that it has arrived.  The Khmer Rouge troops, probably an army of more than 25,000, are battle-hardened, very skilful, well-trained, disciplined and very well armed by the Chinese with modern rockets and so on. They could overrun the country because the capabilities of the Phnom Penh army are unknown, although there are probably as many as on the Khmer Rouge side.  However, they are not as experienced in battle as the Khmer Rouge and the danger is that they will be overrun by the Khmer Rouge whose hatred for them is every bit as deep and bitter as their hatred for the Khmer Rouge.  Of course the danger is that if the Khmer Rouge <Col N="364" /> did win, so far as I know, it would be against the wishes of the Cambodian people who do not want, under any circumstances, to see a return to power of that tyrannical organisation.</P>
    <P>The Cambodian people may be very much divided as to who should rule them, whether it should be Hun Sen, Prince Sihanouk or whoever.  Certainly the vast majority of them hold the view that the person who should not rule them is Pol Pot.  Anything that this House, the EC &mdash; acting in political co-operation &mdash; or the United Nations can do to prevent that happening is something to which all of the Minister's energies should be applied. The Cambodian people now face either a civil war, of nearly balanced forces, war that would drag on for another three years, tearing apart further that country which has seen far too much bloodshed, death and destruction.  The Minister said in the course of his remarks that in the period 1975 to 1978, 1 million people were killed by the Khmer Rouge.  Indeed, that is an under-estimate; conventional wisdom is that that figure could be greater.  We certainly do not want to see a recurrence of those atrocities.</P>
    <P>That takes us to the point at which we must ask what we should do.  What advice can we give the Minister?  What would we like the Minister to do acting on our behalf bearing in mind that the position we adopt, as is the case in regard to most matters dealing with foreign affairs, should represent the collective view of this House and country voiced by the Minister in office at the time.  The foreign affairs committee we propose would allow that to come about.  But what should we do now?  The position has changed since Ireland abstained on votes in recent years.  The Vietnamese troops have now left, the Paris Conference has collapsed.  We should be working in the EC with other western nations and with the ASEAN countries who no longer constitute the unquestioning coalition supporting phalanx.  Thailand is no longer a steady rock.  Thai is the front-line nation in this regard, the nation most exposed, that has had to take in refugees from Cambodia.  Thailand are no longer <Col N="365" /> unquestionably in support of the coalition as it was for the past ten years.  The Thai Prime Minister himself has been in conference with Hun Sen on a number of occasions in the last six months.  They are not as firmly committed to the same ASEAN policy as they were up to six months ago.  That point should be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but they are still talking to the Hun Sen Government.  The two Prime Ministers have been in conference on, I think, three occasions in the past six months.  That point should be borne in mind that even though they may be co-sponsoring the resolution, the effect of that resolution will be to achieve something nobody wants, that is to give the Khmer Rouge back some influence. That is something the Minister would want to watch.</P>
      <P>I should say I have no doubt about the Minister's good intention in this regard. Like everybody else in this House what the Minister wants to see brought about &mdash; as was set out in the course of his remarks &mdash; is the isolation of the Pol Pot régime, the Cambodian people being re-enabled to organise their own affairs, with free and democratic elections being held there.  I doubt that the way the Minister is going about that objective is correct. I do not doubt at all that he wants to achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be using our influence both within the EC and at the United Nations to get the Paris Conference re-convened. That is the first essential and, emanating therefrom, to get an interim administration, installed without the Khmer Rouge.  I do not under estimate the difficulty of achieving that aim because of course the Khmer Rouge will insist on their power of veto, as they are doing at present, in the coalition.  They are bogging down any political move in that regard because they have the power of veto and will do the same in any interim Government.  We want to get that interim Government installed without them, to <Col N="366" /> make preparations for elections as early as possible in 1990, which elections should be overseen by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In that regard we should change our position and vote against this resolution on Thursday.  Given the statements issued by the Belgian, Dutch and German delegations who are considering change, and the very harsh statement on the part of the US Secretary of State, Schultz, last year and that by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, earlier this year when she visited the refugee camps in Northern Thailand &mdash; at least they are thinking of changing their position &mdash; we should reconsider ours. Sweden, which co-sponsored last year, will change their position.  They have not yet reached a conclusion on whether they should vote, abstain or vote against.  They will not be co-sponsors this year and will not vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; they will either vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; or abstain.  Given all of that, we should follow that example.  I would recommend changing our position of abstension to voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I would impress on the Minister that that is the course he should follow on Thursday.</P>

      <P>First, I join Deputy Barry in welcoming the allocation of £50,000 toward urgent relief for the Cambodian people.  We should put that allocation in context.  That allocation is to a country that has been denied inter-governmental aid from a number of countries, including the European Community, for a very long time for reasons to which I will come in a moment.  It must also be put in context in relation to the amount of money spent by UNICEF in any one year in Cambodia which is five million dollars on a number of projects including education, health, irrigation and so on.  It will be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with the previous speaker in his call for a foreign affairs committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I made that suggestion for the first time as a Member of the other House in November, 1986.  I welcome the fact that parties are now supporting the concept because, on that occasion, there was support for <Col N="367" /> the concept but not for the model I suggested. I hope we will be given the opportunity of having a foreign affairs committee of these Houses.</P>
    <P>In that regard we are placed in an extraordinary position.  It is not my purpose this evening to go into that and waste the time of the House on this valuable subject except to say that the Irish people are interested in how Ireland votes at the United Nations: Ireland votes on their behalf.  They are entitled to have foreign policy accountable to them.  They are insulted when they are told that diplomatic complexity is a professional activity that does not need to be trammelled by democratic accountability as is foreign policy in other countries in Europe.  On that bizarre notion we set ourselves apart in Europe as being the only country without a foreign policy committee.  We are superior in our reverence for the awe of diplomatic activity.</P>
    <P>To turn to the statements before the House this evening I must say I cannot muster enthusiasm for the ministerial speech I have just heard.  I find it trite in a number of parts.  For example, knowing what I know of the Cambodian people's experience, I should not like to have drafted a sentence in the Minister's speech and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is time to give them the opportunity to put the past behind them and to elect a Government which can lead the country on the difficult path to national re-construction.</P>
    <P>The people of Cambodia will rightly tell anybody who wants to listen that they do not want ever to forget what happened. Indeed the reason the present Government of Hun Sen have said he left the Paris talks was because he could not defile the memory of the people who had died in Cambodia.  I do not think we should invite the people of Cambodia to any amnesia.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very important moral issues involved for Ireland.  I want to stick to the text of the Minister's remarks for the moment.  It is very important that we get absolutely clear what is <Col N="368" /> taking place.  The Minister referred to what is suggested as the non-challenge of the representative of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations.  I respectfully suggest that that is a gloss on the factual position.  I believe that if challenges, in a technical sense, were prepared by other countries Ireland could lend its voice.  If I were simply to stick to the text of the Minister's remarks my problem with it is this, and it is a repetition of a statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Calleary of 2 November:</P>
    <P>Such a challenge has not been made at the current session of the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, a challenge to the representation of Cambodia.  We were not told on 2 November what the Irish attitude would have been had their been a challenge, and we have not been told tonight.  There are many people in this country who are interested in this issue and they want to know where we stand in regard to the representation.  It is true that later in the speech a kind of muted horror is expressed at the prospect of the return of the Khmer Rouge to any position of significance.  Yet the motion for which we have been told a vote will be cast in our name includes them in the equation.  The resolution also expresses confidence in Prince Sihanouk, which probably very few others share, and that, for example, he is able to influence events and so forth.</P>
    <P>I think what the Members of all parties wanted the Minister to do on this occasion was to make a statement ahead of the session to say that Ireland found the representation of the people of Cambodia at the United Nations by a representative of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot as absolutely abhorrent to them. I have written elsewhere that it could probably be put on a parallel as saying that Hitler would be an adequate representative of the victims of Dachau and Auschwitz.  That is what it is.</P>
    <P>On that first moral point about who should represent Cambodia at the UN, <Col N="369" /> the speech is silent and Ireland is voting for this motion which includes the names of the ASEAN countries and a number of other countries which have been moved to sign the draft.  In the time available to me this evening I have not got time to untangle the complex motivation of the ASEAN countries in sponsoring a text of this kind but it is not unrelated to the economic connections of the different ASEAN countries with some of their patron countries, in particular, the United States.  Neither have I time to start getting involved in undoing the casuistry of statements from the American Embassy during the week that they oppose the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>On the fundamental moral issue, what the public wanted the Government to do was to express their abhorrence at the representation.  They also wanted the Government, if they had the oportunity, to vote against the present representative to seek support for at least a minimum position of declaring the seat vacant. Many others, including me, wanted the Government of Hun Sen recognised. That is my position.  I advised the Labour Party on this position and it is the one the Labour Party asked me to indicate.  I had a very good reason for this, and this brings me to the second difficulty I have with this speech.</P>
    <P>This Parliament do not have a foreign policy committee and they go on saying they are worried whether the Vietnamese have really withdrawn and if the UN have supervised the withdrawal.  We supervise nothing officially in this country and we do not send people anywhere, unless they go themselves and publish their reports. I believe it is a bit mealy-mouthed to ask for UN supervision after the event.  Are they not happy that the Vietnamese withdrawal has taken place?</P>
    <P>I want to ask a technical question of the good old diplomatic advisers: now that the Vietnamese have gone what qualitatively is different in Ireland's position now since the time we were saying that the Vietnamese had installed a puppet government?  Where is the change reflected in the Irish position?  It is truly offensive to say we are voting <Col N="370" /> for the resolution but we will issue an explanatory statement that we were unhappy with parts of the resolution.  If someone suggested that at a Labour Party conference they would be laughed at.  It is as daft as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not suggest it or anything like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I want to make relates to the representation because there is a certain kind of bland disregard for the realities of what the Cambodian people are suffering.  The recognition of the Pol Pot representative and the non-recognition of Hun Sen's Government have effectively isolated the Cambodian people from governmental aid or the aid of such people as UNICEF, Trócaire, Oxfam, Christian Aid, Goal and other agencies.  I want to say in passing in this Parliament of ignorance in foreign affairs &mdash; this is not our fault; we do not have the structures &mdash; that we are continually indebted to these agencies for the assistance they give us, precluded as we are from the professional advice for which we pay our taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of recognition is inextricably tied to the question of aid.  It is because of what happened post-1979 that we are now giving IR£50,000 &mdash; Irish punts as the Minister went to the trouble of explaining in the text.  Why am I saying that I would take the step of recognising the government of Hun Sen?  It is because I find that the evidence of reconstruction is real in relation to what happened when between one million and two million people were killed during the years 1975-79. In 1980 infant mortality was running at the rate of possibly one child in every three born.  This rate has decreased to maybe one child in five.  There have been significant achievements in relation to food production, even if they are far short of the levels achieved before the country was dragged willingly into the Vietnamese conflict.  There have been improvements in the areas of education and water supply and attempts have been made to redress the situation where the number of doctors in the country had <Col N="371" /> dropped from 500 to perhaps 50.  A government who are isolated and trying like that deserve at least the aid we are giving them.</P>
    <P>I must say &mdash; and this really bothers me &mdash; that at the end of the day I am only too familar with the suggestion in relation to votes of this kind &mdash; that &ldquo;it is all too complicated, and much more complicated than you could possibly understand; the way we go about things is by drafting resolutions; sometimes we participate in those; we might not sponsor them and so forth.&rdquo;  There is a great impatience in this country at the lack of moral nerve in Irish foreign policy.  We know perhaps as much or more than most.  An Irish agency have 15 field workers there and they told us what happened. They told us the efforts which have been made since 1980, in isolation. They told us that they need assistance and they have established without doubt that the aid embargo was linked to the fact that Hun Sen's Government were not recognised.  If we recognised them we were opening the gate to aid.</P>
    <P>What have we done instead?  We have continued, at least on this occasion, to vote for a resolution which superficially suggests that while we would abhor the return of the Khmer Rouge influence, we are voting in the context of accepting their representative as the spokesperson for Cambodia.  In that regard, even at this late stage, I would press, the Minister to contact our delegation and explain that it is the parliamentary will of this country, supported by the public, that we take initiatives.  The Minister may say it is too late for this and the process is all over, but why has he not said this evening that he regards it as outrageous that Pol Pot's representative sits at the UN and that the flag of the people responsible for genocide, as he said in his speech, will fly outside the UN while the Irish representative will be inside voting for a composite resolution which will accept representation of Cambodia by somebody responsible for brutal murder and genocide. This is an outrageous position. When the explanatory statement is being <Col N="372" /> issued in New York, will the Minister give every Irish person a copy so that they can hand it out to their friends and say we did not vote against it, sponsor anything different or say anything but we issued this interesting piece of paper to say why we voted, although we did not really want to vote.  It is a piece of casuistry that brings disgrace on professional diplomacy.  It is an outrage to decent Irish people of all parties who wanted us to take a moral lead and who wanted to see at least a vacant seat.  The more positive thing to do would be to recognise the Government of reconstruction in a post-Vietnamese withdrawal arrangement and allow the aid to flow to the people who urgently need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the disappointment of Deputy M. Higgins and Deputy Barry at the Minister's statement here tonight.  It is full of platitudes and plámás and I am appalled that the Irish Government intend to vote in favour of the resolution before the United Nations, which will do nothing more than confer legitimacy on the disgraced and despicable Khmer Rouge, who have wreaked such havoc on the Cambodian people.  The current Irish policy towards Vietnam and Cambodia is in dire need of review, especially in the light of the recent withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.</P>
      <P>While I understand, the resolution to be taken at the United Nations tomorrow will not explicitly address the question of who should occupy the United Nations seat, this is the crucial issue and in my view the Irish representatives at the United Nations should challenge the continued presence of the Khmer Rouge in the UN.  The Irish policy, which has been to abstain on the competing claims of the Heng Samrin government and the so-called Kampuchean coalition for the United Nations seat has been shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuation of such a policy poses an obstruction to development and stability badly needed within Cambodia and, in addition, suggests indifference on the part of our Government towards the prospect of Pol Pot forces running this <Col N="373" /> south-east Asian country once again. Moreover, abstaining on the vote in the United Nations suggests Ireland's inability to differentiate between the present Government of Cambodia and the coalition, which includes in its ranks the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the unprecedented mass murder of its own people while in power.</P>
    <P>The basic facts surrounding Pol Pot controls in Cambodia cannot be disputed. In 1975 Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge conquered the country, closed the frontiers and inaugurated a reign of terror in which about one million people were slaughtered.  This is clearly the worst case of genocide in this century next to the annihilation of the Jewish community during World War II.  When the Vietnamese army helped the people of Cambodia to drive out Pol Pot in January 1979, they found the country devastated and the remaining population close to starvation.  Ten years later, the Khmer Rouge leaders, instead of being arraigned for genocide under the UN Convention of 1951, are actually regarded as part of the legitimate Government by the majority of member states in the United Nations.  The current government which has made valiant efforts to restore the shattered morale of the people is now considered a Vietnamese puppet.</P>
    <P>The continued support which the Khmer Rouge enjoy diplomatically is intimately bound up with the support they receive from China and the United States, both of which seem to put a higher premium on opposing Vietnam than ensuring a possible re-run of the <i>Killing Fields.</i>  Are we to be guided by the policies of a Chinese Government, a government which has in recent months massacred a large number of its own people?  Additionally, are we expected to succumb to the reprimands of the United States, especially in the light of its own disgraceful record in south-east Asia?  In the meantime, the unwillingness of western Governments in the United Nations to take a strong line against the Khmer Rouge and its allies prolongs the suffering of its people and perpetuates the plight <Col N="374" /> of the quarter of a million refugees living in camps in Thailand.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government and other EC countries have for many years been calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.  Now that this goal has been accomplished there is an obligation on us and the other EC countries to respond in a positive manner.  The Government should now unequivocally support the right of the Heng Samrin government to unseat the Khmer Rouge, or at the very least support a position that the seat should be left vacant and we should urge the EC to adopt a similar position.  The only sure way of ensuring recognition for the Government of Cambodia is through prompt diplomatic and political action. The Irish Government should be ready to support resolutions which would highlight the dangers of reinstalling members of the Khmer Rouge and the other EC member states should take a similar position.  At this point, it is crucial to explore all avenues to sponsor or support moves to remove the mantle of legitimacy and material support from the present occupant of the UN seat.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the dynamics of the conflict in Cambodia have now changed and, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has pointed out in the past, the lasting solution to the conflict in Cambodia is contained in the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.  The declaration calls for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the exercise by the Cambodian people of the right to determine their future.  Now that the removal of troops has come to fruition, are we not under an obligation to acknowledge this change and act accordingly?</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that now is the time for Ireland to exercise its political vote in the UN, and indeed to exercise some independent initiative to unseat the Khmer Rouge.  If the seat is left vacant, there is little doubt that the <i>de facto</i> government will continue to consolidate and gain popular support throughout the country and the nightmare of a Khmer Rouge return to power will be dispelled.  To this end, we should be initiating action within the European <Col N="375" /> Community to remove the ban on the recognition of the Government of Cambodia and encourage reconstruction and development aid to be delivered by the EC.  After all, preventing the resurrection of the Khmer Rouge can only be accomplished by winning the economic battle.  The sooner this happens, the sooner the current Government will gain the confidence and support of the rural population, which makes up 80 per cent of the total population.  Then and only then will the people of Cambodia have the freedom to determine their own future.</P>
    <P>How bad do things have to get before Ireland wields whatever political power is available to aid the desperate lives of the people in Cambodia?  The humanitarian aid supplied by the EC and by independent organisations such as Oxfam and Trócaire has been extremely important. The indifference displayed by the Irish Government to this situation is no longer a timely or appropriate response in the light of the severity of the situation in Cambodia.  While I welcome the Minister's statement that £50,000 is to be provided, I think we need to go much further than that, and develop a programme of aid for Cambodia.  Ultimately, is not within our realm of responsibility to brave the opposition and encourage members of the United Nations to vote in favour of denying the Khmer Rouge a seat within that organisation? As the director of Oxfam pointed out &ldquo;history will condemn the international community if they award the seat to the illegitimate coalition&rdquo;.  Certainly, a strong stance on the part of our Government today would contribute to cultivating some semblance of a future for the people of Cambodia tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The people of Cambodia have endured appalling suffering and deprivation as a result of almost 20 years of continuous fighting and destruction.  They surely now have a special case for sympathetic consideration in regard to food and development aid.  A number of voluntary organisations such as Trócaire and Oxfam are already providing aid from <Col N="376" /> their own limited resources.  As I have said previously, the Government should initiate their own programme of aid.  I believe that despite our own economic difficulties, the Irish people would support such a move.</P>
    <P>Despite the appalling level of suffering and deprivation, EC food and development aid has been withheld for purely political reasons.  This is shameful and must change.  In addition to our bilateral aid, the Government should press for a change in EC policy and ensure that adequate international aid is now provided to assist the people of Cambodia in their efforts to reconstruct and develop their country.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat what I said at the beginning.  I consider the position being adopted by the Government at the United Nations is totally wrong.  I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins when he called on the Government to reconsider their position and to respond to the will of this House, to what I believe is the all-party view, that we should oppose the resolution in the United Nations, that we should make it quite clear that we do not want to collaborate with the Khmer Rouge presence in the UN.  I believe that position is supported by the great majority of the people of this country.  I agree with Deputy Higgins when he says it is time that foreign policy &mdash; and this perhaps is as good as place as any to start &mdash; should respond to the wishes of the Irish people who have traditionally shown great generosity towards the suffering of people in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The people of Cambodia have suffered massively under this horrific regime.  The people of this country have been horrified at what they have seen on their television screens and what they have read about the horrors and the massacres that have been committed by this regime.  We should have absolutely no truck with them.  The response of the Government is not adequate.  The platitudes in the Minister's statement and the cop-out, the explanatory statement he talked about in relation to our vote in the United Nations, are not adequate.  Again, I <Col N="377" /> would call on the Minister to, even at this very late stage, reconsider the position and issue different instructions to our representatives in the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to state that I share the widespread growing concerns that have been expressed internationally about the present situation in Cambodia and the implications of the draft resolution to be voted on at the UN on Thursday, 16 November.  The Governments of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands have, in the last few days, moved away from the unquestioning support of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.  The UK Government have recognised that Vietnam have indeed withdrawn their troops from the country.  The sad reality is that these three countries are co-sponsors of the draft resolution tabled at the UN. However, I welcome the movement that the German and Dutch Governments have made in expressing strong statements on the need to explicitly condemn the Khmer Rouge and ensure safeguards against their return to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that Ireland with Belgium and Portugal are the only European Community countries that did not co-sponsor this resolution.  Indeed, in 1982 we quite rightly abstained on the vote giving the ousted Democratic Kampuchean Government the Kampuchean seat at the United Nations.  However, I feel we should go that step further on this occasion.  As many of the troubled areas of the world such as Namibia, South Africa and the Middle East send us hopeful signals of peace and progress and as a wave of freedom sweeps across the continents and tyranny and oppression crumble before increasingly powerful popular forces, it is regrettable and a matter of grave disquiet that a dark cloud still hangs over the troubled lands of Cambodia.  Workers with agencies such <Col N="378" /> as Trócaire and Oxfam who have been operating inside the country for the last ten years have witnessed the fear of the people of Cambodia at the possibility of the return in any form of the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>As a small neutral country with a healthy international reputation on human rights around the globe, we in Ireland must align ourselves firmly and without equivocation with all those who are demanding freedom and democracy and the right of self determination.  The co-sponsors at the UN want us to recognise &ldquo;the continued and effective struggle of the Kampuchean people under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk&rdquo;.  To support such a resolution would mean, I believe, siding with the Khmer Rouge who are allies of Sihanouk in the civil war.  To adopt this stance at the UN would in effect put this country on the side of the oppressor.  I believe Ireland should vote against or at least abstain on this UN motion.  It is a crucial motion which could result in the troops of the Khmer Rouge over-running Cambodia again as it will give encouragement to the Prince Sihanouk led forces.</P>
    <P>The memories of the Pol Pot régime are still very vivid in our minds.  Sadly the world did not know until it was too late what was going on during those dark days in Cambodia.  Now we have a clearer picture, thanks to reports from relief agencies and also an informed and vigilant media.  A new situation now exists in Cambodia.  The Vietnamese forces have left.  The Hun Sen Government have been governing the country and feeding the people against great odds, with very little help from the outside world. According to numerous journalists and aid workers they are a responsible Government who have the support of the people.  They have made changes in their economic policy allowing free market principles.  Sadly the genocide of the Khmer Rouge has left its mark in that the country has been left bereft of much expertise at Government and official level.  Emergency development assistance is required and I certainly hope the European Community will match the <Col N="379" /> efforts being made by the Government.  I warmly welcome the announcement that £50,000 will be made available by the Irish Government for humanitarian relief in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>As a breath of freedom sweeps through Eastern Europe and dramatic changes in the political map of Europe take place, nurtured by an enlightened Soviet leader, one cannot but feel gravely disappointed that the western world and the United States in particular cannot adopt a similar role in South East Asia. The US and the European Community have close and growing economic relations with that region and can play a key role in bringing peace and stability to this troubled area.  We will have to bring ourselves to realise that the Vietnamese have left and that the Cambodian people inside Cambodia and in the camps on the Thai border must be given a chance to express their will in any future participation of the Khmer Rouge in a comprehensive political settlement.  This could be done through an internationally supervised referendum which would lead to a fair and free election.  The international community must act quickly as the Khmer Rouge have a large army and are waiting in the wings training and recruiting in refugee camps on the Thai border.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Irish Government to stand apart from our European Community partners and oppose or at least abstain on this UN resolution which continues to legitimise the Khmer Rouge dominated coalition's seating at the UN. Indeed we should support any forthcoming initiatives to declare Cambodia's seat vacant at the UN.  A vacant seat would mean that the United Nations could become directly involved in a peace initiative.  Since the breakdown of the Paris peace conference in August, no agreement has been reached on an interim administration.  The current impasse that exists presents us with a very volatile and dangerous situation and this peace conference must be reconvened. In conclusion, I would urge the Irish Government to maintain a strong humanitarian stance at UN level and <Col N="380" /> either oppose or abstain on this resolution. I thank the Minister for agreeing to make time available for this important debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Tom Kitt for sharing his precious time with me.  I very much appreciate the opportunity of making a contribution, although a very brief one, to this debate.</P>
      <P>It is entirely fit and proper that we in this House this evening are debating the issue of Cambodia.  First, this is the eve of a vital two-day debate on that country at the United Nations; secondly, events within Cambodia are at a very crucial juncture at this time and thirdly, the upcoming presidency of the EC confers on this country a privileged position, a position that enables it to use its influence to change events within Cambodia and also to influence other countries to alter their attitudes towards the Cambodian question.</P>
      <P>The people of Cambodia have suffered more than most, not just at the brutal hands of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge but equally, if less directly, at the often callous and self-interested hands of much of the so-called civilised world &mdash; that was touched on very well by Deputy Barry here this evening.  The recent history of these people is horrific.  We are all now familiar with the horrors inflicted on a defenceless people during the reign of terror of Pol Pot.  We are familiar with the brutal stories of the killing fields, stories of the genocide, the acres of crushed bones, the systematic torture, starvation and murder of anyone who had even the most modest standard of education and who in any way was seen to deviate from Pol Pot's vision of what Cambodia ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cambodia has suffered more than most, as I have already indicated, from the intricacies of diplomatic manoeuvring between the super powers and the geopolitics of the ill-starved region of South-East Asia.  These considerations, and particularly the stance adopted by the <Col N="381" /> United Nations in recognising the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea which includes the Khmer Rouge as a legitimate voice of the people of Cambodia, must be seen as a threat of return of Pol Pot to that country.  Recognising Pol Pot and his forces as the representatives of Cambodia can only be compared with recognising Hitler as the representative of the Jewish population of Germany after the Second World War. This point has already been made with some force and passion by Deputy Higgins and is one that must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>That being so, we have a moral responsibility as members of the international community to work for a fair and just solution to the enormous problems facing Cambodia.  I accept there are aspects of the resolution to be debated in the United Nations over the next two days with which this country is in broad sympathy, such as the call for a return to the Paris peace negotiations, respect for the right to self-determination for Cambodia and the holding of free elections in that country, but it is essential that we use the opportunity of the coming United Nations debate and every subsequent available opportunity to demonstrate our total abhorrence of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in much stronger and clearer terms than those set out in the United Nations motion.</P>
    <P>We must also make crystal clear our total rejection of the recognition by the United Nations of the coalition of Democratic Kampuchea, including Pol Pot, as having any legitimate role as a representative of a new Cambodia.  The continued recognition of a coalition which includes representatives of the Khmer Rouge which has sought so desperately to destroy is an indictment of all of us in the civilised world.  It is a cruel parody of what the United Nations stands for and it is also a cruel parody of the charter on which the United Nations was founded and as long as this position persists we will all have blood on our hands.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to compliment the Minister on his announcement this evening that he is sending aid amounting <Col N="382" /> to £50,000 to Cambodia.  I hope this money will go directly to the people of Cambodia and will not be diverted or intercepted in any way by Khmer Rouge apologists.  I also hope that this is only the beginning as more and more help will be needed.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long and honourable tradition at the United Nations.  We have acted with courage and honour on many occasions in the past.  We will have an opportunity tomorrow and the day after to act with equal courage and honour. The representatives of this generation have a duty to the representatives of previous generations to uphold and maintain the proud tradition of Ireland at the United Nations.  Anything less than casting our vote to unseat the coalition of Kampuchea with its Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge influence and element will be a betrayal of our proud position and tradition at the United Nations.  At this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, is present in the House tonight for this debate.  When I was given the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment on 2 November, I commenced my contribution by expressing my disappointment that he was not present in the Chamber and was not able to hear some of the worries which Members of this House have expressed.  I also hoped that in raising this issue on 2 November the Minister would have had time to reflect and alter Ireland's position at the United Nations.  I cannot believe that <Col N="383" /> the Minister can be so insensitive to or unaware of the enormous rise in public opinion against Ireland's position at the United Nations with regard to representation of the Khmer Rouge.</P>
      <P>He cannot be blind to the fact that during the past few weeks many people have telephoned his Department.  Today groups of students from the Presentation School in Bray, from St. Louis' Convent and from St. Finian's College in Swords joined in a demonstration of peaceful vigil outside this House along with many ordinary citizens who were asked to come here to express solidarity with the people of Cambodia and to call on the Members of this House to influence the Minister in any way they can to change Ireland's stance at the United Nations.  The Minister cannot be blind or insensitive to the call of the ordinary people of this country.</P>
      <P>I understand that in mainland Britain and Belfast today similar vigils were held in an attempt to get the UK to change its position.  I have been given information to the effect that the UK is dramatically changing its opinion.  They have already given a commitment to send £250,000 to Cambodia, to send a British diplomat to Cambodia and to hold discussions and negotiations with the Hun Sen Government. Perhaps between now and tomorrow we will see a change but they have already made moves to change this resolution. I do not know as of yet, perhaps the Minister does, what action the UK will take over the next two days on this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can we in Ireland not take a lead in this?  Why do we have to be hiding behind shirt tails of other countries? During the campaign and vote on the Single European Act we got a categoric assurance from the Government that we would maintain an independent foreign affairs stance, that we would act with courage and conviction and would not all the time seek the full support of or go along with the Twelve.  The Minister now has an opportunity to show his bona fides in respect of all those statements made <Col N="384" /> during the debate on the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>I condemn the Minister for what he has done to the motion which comes up for discussion at the United Nations.  He has dined <i>à la carte</i> on the motion.  He has found some little pieces of the motion which he feels he can sell and support but he has ignored some other more critical elements of the motion.  He has decided instead that he can sell the line: &ldquo;Of course, we are in favour of the restoration and preservation of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Of course all those things are good and proper and we are in favour of humanitarian aid&rdquo;. Hidden inside this omnibus motion are the crucial lines which imply that the Khmer Rouge will be part of any independence and restoration of sovereignty. The motion calls for a comprehensive political settlement and this includes the Khmer Rouge.  If the Minister cannot see this or if his officials cannot explain to him what that means, then shame on him. Does he not realise that in voting for this resolution he is voting for the continued presence of the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations.  As Deputy Higgins and I have already said, this would be identical to saying to the Jews that Hitler is alive and well and gone to the United Nations to represent them.  It is shameful for the international world to continue in any way even under the guise of an omnibus motion such as this to support the presence of the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister could and should take a positive initiative.  Why has he not since 2 November, when I first raised this issue in the House, gone about sponsoring and putting forward a motion calling for the removal of this coalition from the United Nations?  Why has he not said that the seat should remain vacant, if necessary, until such time as free elections can be organised in Cambodia?  He has had the time to do so.  Why has he not had the courage to do this?  He cannot continue to support the decimation and annihilation of humanitarian aid and <Col N="385" /> long-term development aid.  The EC supports a policy of not giving such aid.</P>
    <P>I believe this region of south east Asia has become the playground, arena or theatre for the big powers but this cannot continue, nor can we continue to take part in a sham of diplomacy and debate at the United Nations while continuing to support the Khmer Rouge.  The position has changed dramatically, even since we decided to continue with the line that as long as Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia we would have to continue to abstain on a vote on the presence of the Khmer Rouge at the United Nations. The Vietnamese troops have withdrawn from Cambodia.  How then can the Minister come into this House and criticise a country for not allowing the United Nations to supervise that withdrawal while at the same time the United Nations allows the murderers of the people of Cambodia to sit in the hallowed halls of the United Nations building? How can they ask those people to put aside all their sorrows and say: &ldquo;come in, UN&rdquo;.  As long as the Khmer Rouge have a seat at the United Nations it will be impossible to ask the people of Cambodia to allow the UN in.</P>
    <P>The troops have withdrawn.  All thinking countries in the world have accepted that.  Members of the European Parliament, members of various agencies throughout the world supervised that withdrawal.  The situation has dramatically changed.  Ireland can no longer hide behind saying that they cannot support any changes in the UN as long as foreign troops are on the soil.  This motion that the Minister will instruct our UN representative to vote on in the next two days has not accepted that the troops have withdrawn.  Why can the Minister not accept that and realise that the ball park has changed?  After tonight's debate, if the Minister is not willing to listen to Opposition speakers perhaps he would take account of the fact that two backbenchers of the Government have called on him to change Ireland's stance. Perhaps the Minister would reflect on that, if he will not reflect on what we are saying.  Members of the Minister's party <Col N="386" /> are deeply concerned about the action he is proposing to take.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Quill and Deputy Kitt for taking a courageous line because so often backbenchers are wheeled in to support their Minister's proposal.  There is an independent line here tonight and it is very welcome.  It again sells the idea that we need this Foreign Affairs Committee.  Already this week there have been three major issues which could be rightfully debated in a Foreign Affairs Committee: the issue of east Germany, this issue and Namibia from where I have just returned from observing the free and fair elections for a country getting its democracy for the first time.  Not a word was said in this House or at any committee to discuss any of these issues.  We neither have the time nor a forum to debate the intricacies of south-east Asia.  There are many intricacies there and there would not be a straightforward discussion.</P>
    <P>However, there is a straightforward decision tonight.  I would ask the Minister to listen to the pleas from around this House and I would ask him not to disgrace Ireland and shame our people by going into the UN or sending a representative in tomorrow or the next day to vote for a motion that is riddled with references and hidden words to the effect that it will continue to support the return of the Khmer Rouge, the Pol Pot régime into a country that has seen one million people die in three years, a country that has no infrastructural development, no water, sewerage or health services, and no schools except those that the nongovernmental agencies have been able to supply with their limited funds.</P>
    <P>I join with the other speakers to say that without the courage of those agencies the people of Cambodia would have been abandoned by the international world, to our great shame. Those agencies have gone in against all the odds and carried out vital work, but they need the support of governments. They need Government aid.  They need full, long term sustainable development aid from the EC.</P>
    <P>In a few months, the Minister will be <Col N="387" /> sitting in a very important position when Ireland holds the Presidency of the EC. Let it be the Minister's desire that during our Presidency we will see full development aid being granted to the people of Cambodia.  I welcome the fact that £50,000 aid has been announced here tonight.  It is the least the Minister could have brought in here, in view of the enormous interest and concern being expressed by the Irish people.  The Minister should ensure that that £50,000 is channelled to the people of Cambodia through bona fide Irish agencies already working in that country and who have contacts, so that not one penny is wasted on administration or unnecessary loss of time because of lack of contacts.  That money should be spent as quickly and as relevantly as possible and it should be only a start of the money that this Minister, this Government and the country are pledging and committing to Cambodia.</P>
    <P>We need a policy that is coherent, believable honest and moral.  We have not had that over the last ten years.  I respect the fact that there were sustainable reasons put forward as arguments why Ireland continued to abstain. Those reasons no longer exist.  I hope the Minister is aware of that, after this debate tonight, if he was not aware of it before. I hope the Minister is aware that our people are demanding a change of Ireland's position.  If the Minister is genuine he will listen to our pleas tonight and tomorrow morning he will have the triumph of coming into this House and admitting that following tonight's debate he is pleased to announce that Ireland will be voting against this motion.  I will finish with that urgent plea to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  My first reaction this evening was one of disappointment and almost of disbelief at the arcane and hair-splitting attitude that the Minister has taken in this matter. However, I was very heartened by Deputies Quill and Kitt who have shown a degree of independence in this House. If there was a free vote of this House I am sure the House would direct the Minister to direct our representative in the UN to vote against this resolution. I have no doubt that if there were a nationwide referendum on this issue the vast majority of people would call for our representative to vote against this régime.  Most of the points have already been made and I will not delay the time of the House talking about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that most western governments would rather support a genocidal régime than a communist <Col N="390" /> régime.  The Irish Government have been consistently guilty on this issue by abstaining at the UN.  That was an incredible decision over the years and is totally untenable now in view of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  I hope that in the course of his reply he will tell us that he will be instructing our representative at the UN to vote against this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude and I should like to appeal to him to look again at this issue.  It all seems to revolve around the question of Vietnamese withdrawal.  That was the point put forward over the years by the American Government and it was adhered to by everybody else.  Of course, everybody forgot that but for the Vietnamese the Cambodian people would have been wiped out.  It was they who saved them from Pol Pot.  Nevertheless, that excuse no longer holds good because the Vietnamese have withdrawn.  The Americans now say they do not believe that the Vietnamese have withdrawn, that there are some of them still in that country.  The Minister in the course of his speech said that the Government would have wished that the withdrawal had been effected under the supervision of the UN in order that it could have been fully verified and accepted by the international community.  The fact that it has not been so verified, he said, has given rise to controversy regarding the extent of the Vietnamese withdrawal and a refusal by certain key countries to accept that the withdrawal has been total.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to accept that position, that the possibility is that the Vietnamese have not withdrawn.  He appears to hold the view that that gives him the excuse for maintaining the same posture of abstension at the UN.  I should like to ask him if it is not a fact that the UN are prevented from going into Cambodia to supervise any withdrawal because the Pol Pot régime is accepted by them, having a seat at the UN.  They do not want the UN making any moves whatever in Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The Minister said he is sorry and surprised that the Vietnamese withdrawal has not been verified by the UN but that statement is made with tongue in cheek. The Minister should, as Deputy Owen said, accept the withdrawal.  He should visit that country, or send a delegation, to verify that the withdrawal has taken place.  The Minister should change his stance and give the lead to the other nonaligned countries of the world, at least at the UN, and exert pressure on the Chinese and the United States to refuse a seat at the UN to Pol Pot.  The Minister should re-examine the draft motion scheduled for the debate at the UN.  He should reconsider his decision to support it because of its dangerous implications. He should seek to amend the motion to take account of the Irish Government's view on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation and thanks to the Members who participated in the debate.  As I said in my opening statement, the question of Cambodia has caused great concern to all of us in particular because of the fears that anything Ireland did might contribute to the return of the dreaded Pol Pot-Khmer Rouge.  Even a small country like Ireland must weigh carefully all the factors in play so as to ensure that Ireland is seen to uphold internationally the principles of justice, democracy and freedom which the Irish people hold dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the views of Deputies that we must utterly reject the idea that the mass murderers of the Khmer Rouge be allowed back to power.  We have not, and never will do anything whatever to help their cause.  When they ruled Cambodia in the seventies Pol Pot and his minions were responsible for the deaths of more than one million of their fellow citizens. I am sure the Cambodian people would never wish to see them in positions of responsibility again.  The Khmer Rouge claim to have the support of the people of Cambodia.  I would say, well let them prove it by asking the people of Cambodia for their support in free elections. <Col N="392" /> I am totally opposed to the fact that the Khmer Rouge, and other parties to the conflict, are being supplied with arms from the outside and I agree that what the Pol Pot régime did amounted to genocide in the normal meaning of that word. Unfortunately, there is no international court competent to try people for the crime of genocide and the UN Convention on the crime of genocide leaves the main responsibility for trying such crimes with the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Hun Sen Government, many of whose members including Hun Sen himself were active members of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot's leadership, to undertake this responsibility.  It will be for a future democratically elected Government to decide if former members of the Pol Pot régime should be brought to justice for crimes against their own people.  I agree that the failure to stop Pol Pot's &ldquo;killing fields&rdquo; is not to the credit of the international communities' efforts to vindicate fundamental human rights.  Unfortunately, the human rights of the ordinary man and woman are often a silent victim of great power rivalries and I do not think anybody realised the extent of the horrors being perpetrated by Pol Pot until, sadly, it was too late.</P>
    <P>On the question of withdrawal and the confusion as to whether the Vietnamese pulled out I should like to say it is a great pity that the Hun Sen Government and Vietnam did not agree to have the United Nations supervise the withdrawal.  If they had we would not be having the dispute we have today.  I utterly reject the idea that the United Nations could not have acted impartially in monitoring the withdrawal. Indeed, we have memories of many great Irish soldiers dying in the service of the UN.  They always acted in an honourable and impartial manner that brought credit to this country.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with those Deputies who have stated that Mr. Hun Sen is probably an improvement on Pol Pot but we must remember that he was installed by a foreign invasion and I certainly cannot endorse his Government.  We should also remember that Mr. Hun Sen, <Col N="393" /> and many members of his administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants the genocide to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were actively involved in the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot.  Indeed, Hun Sen was second in command of a Khmer Rouge regiment at the height of the ghastly &ldquo;killing fields&rdquo; episode.  Those who claim that the choice between the Hun Sen Government and the coalition led by Prince Sihanouk is like that between good and evil should remember those realities.</P>
      <P>Normally, we do not get involved in the question of who should run a country; that is the business of that country's people.  If we have to take a position, as in the case of Cambodia, we say that only a government democratically elected by the people will have Ireland's support.  I am confident that the Irish people would support the Government on this.</P>
      <P>Good foreign policy decisions in a case like this are not made by taking into account only one side of the argument. Hun Sen, a former Pol Pot lieutenant was installed in power by the Vietnamese who invaded their smaller neighbour and occupied it for ten years.  Now that the Vietnamese have apparently decided to withdraw, though it should be said that they rejected a proposal made at the Paris Conference that this withdrawal should be verified by the UN, they would like the international community to support the continuation of their protégé.  Hun Sen is head of the Government in Pnomh Pehn.</P>
      <P>The Government's view is that the Cambodian people should be given the opportunity of determining for themselves what their government will be.  We will not, therefore, contribute to giving democratic respectability to a regime which far from having been elected by the Cambodian people was installed by a foreign power.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This does not mean that we support Pol Pot.  As I explained, we shall in voting for the resolution make absolutely clear our rejection of any return of Pol Pot to power in Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have suggested that I should instruct our Ambassador to the UN to abstain our vote against the UN Resolution on Cambodia because they claim that the resolution is favourable to the Khmer Rouge.  As I said earlier, the resolution mentions twice that there should be &ldquo;no return to the universally condemned policies and practices of the recent past&rdquo;.  I agree that more explicit language on the Khmer Rouge would have been preferable and this is one of the main reasons I have instructed our ambassador not to co-sponsor the resolution.</P>

      <P>I would not know anything about the price of drink.</P>
      <P>Over the last few days I have accused the Minister for Industry and Commerce of misleading the public in the matter of petrol prices.  I repeat those accusations here to night.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister has misled people in two ways: first, by concealing the increase he granted in petrol distribution and retailing margins at the start of this month, and, secondly, by relying on the interim report of the Fair Trade Commission to justify that increase, when that report clearly states that:</P>
      <P>It is not possible ... for the Commission to recommend a particular margin which would be appropriate. To do so would entail an in-depth examination of costs within the industry. Such an examination might be intensive and time-consuming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that the behaviour of this Minister over this matter has been little short of astonishing.  Within the last 24 hours, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats who has made a career in recent years out of promulgating the virtues of the unrestricted marketplace and the free play of market forces, has threatened to impose price control on every business that sells imported produce and <Col N="396" /> that has failed to pass on the benefits of a stronger punt to their customers by way of reduced prices.  I would be tempted to applaud this convention: yet, when the same Minister had the opportunity less than two weeks ago to do precisely what he is urging business to do, when he had the opportunity to ensure that Irish motorists enjoyed the benefit of an improved exchange rate, he did precisely the opposite, and gave those benefits to the businesses instead.  He made a present of almost £5 million to the oil multinationals, some of the richest companies in the world.  I cannot see how he can justify that in any terms.</P>
    <P>He went further than just giving that present to the oil companies.  He also concealed the fact.  He concealed the fact that an increase in the wholesalers' and retailers' margins are being applied from the start of the month, and that a reduction in the price of petrol due to motorists was being withheld.  If I had not revealed that in my statement last Friday, the Minister would never have made any announcement and when he was caught out he misused the interim report of the Fair Trade Commission to cover up his action.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the Fair Trade Commission was published on 5 September last.  My statement yesterday accusing the Minister of not publishing the report was based on the erroneous assumption that in his television interview on Friday night he was referring to a later report, or perhaps the final report, which is due now.  That mistaken assumption was reinforced by the fact that the interim report simply does not justify the action he took.</P>
    <P>The publication of the interim report does not alter the fact that the Minister has seriously misled the public.  I have already referred to his concealment of the increases he gave the oil companies, and I want now to deal with his misleading reliance on the interim report.</P>
    <P>As far as I can tell, the Minister in replying on recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission has been saying that in fact he has only <Col N="397" /> implemented a fraction of what the Commission actually recommended, saying on television last night, for example, that the Commission has recommended increases ranging up to 13p a gallon. What the Commission as a body said about the wholesale margin is worth repeating:</P>
    <P>It is not possible ... for the Commission to recommend a particular margin which would be appropriate. To do so would entail an in-depth examination of costs within the industry. Such an examination might be intensive and time-consuming.</P>
    <P>The Commission also called for the establishment of a Prices Advisory Body, which would, among other things, examine the wholesaler and retailer margins, based on a thorough assessment of their costs.</P>
    <P>There were two members of the Commission involved in the preparation of the report &mdash; the Chairman (Mr. Myles O'Reilly) and Mr. Patrick Lyons.  Since they were unable to agree on a range of issues covered in the report they each wrote individual reports which were then published together as one report.  One of the relatively few issues they did agree on was the inappropriateness, as described above, of attempting to set a margin for retailing and wholesaling, without any way of analysing the costs involved in those operations.</P>
    <P>They did put forward individual suggestions, based on different interpretations of how the consumer price index might be applied to these margins. The chairman suggested an increase in the wholesale margin of approximately 4.5p a gallon, and Mr. Lyons suggested an increase of around 6p a gallon in the wholesalers' margin.</P>
    <P>Taken together with other changes they suggested in the overall price structure of petrol, as opposed to the multinational mark-up, which is the only subject we have raised, the chairman's views could have led to an increase of around 8p a gallon, and Mr. Lyons' view to an increase of around 13p.  But none of these views can be regarded as an <Col N="398" /> explicit recommendation by the Fair Trade Commission that the margin payable to the multinational companies should be as large as the Minister appears to be willing to give, and I believe the Minister knows that.</P>
    <P>Some changes were implemented by the Minister immediately on publication of the report, and the result was an increase of 3p a gallon in September last. Almost all of that increase went to the wholesalers and retailers.  There was a further increase of almost 1p a gallon in October, and as we know, a 2.3p reduction was retained by the Minister in November and passed straight to the wholesalers and retailers.  The Minister has therefore been working every month to ensure that the wholesalers and retailers &mdash; the multinationals &mdash; got increases in their margins.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the Fair Trade Commission report was brought forward need to be remembered.  The previous Minister had reduced the wholesalers' and retailers' margins at the time that he abolished gift stamps.  In March last, for instance, the wholesalers' margin was 4.270 pence per litre.  When stamps were abolished, this was reduced to 3.97 per litre.  Now after the Minister's intervention at the start of November it stands at 4.39 per litre.</P>
    <P>In effect, despite all the rows with the companies, what has happened is that the companies now have a higher margin than when they were offering stamps &mdash; even though the purpose of abolishing stamps was to reduce the margin.  Since the abolition of stamps only a few months ago, they have got an increase of almost 2p a gallon in their profit margin, just over 10 per cent in seven months.  The same pattern has been followed in the case of retailers.  I question why the previous Minister took on or gave the impression of taking on the oil companies at a number of meetings which took place in his Department earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has also argued that he had to take this step because at least one of the companies in the business is in serious trouble.  It is widely believed in the oil <Col N="399" /> industry that one company in Ireland are facing financial difficulties.  This company have about ten per cent of the wholesale and retail markets in this country.</P>

      <P>I will.  The total value of the increases given at the start of this month to the oil companies was £4.8 million. The company in difficulties have about ten per cent of this market.  In order to give them about half a million pounds the Minister in effect has also given Texaco, Esso, BP and other multinationals over £4 million.  I do not see how one can justify that in relation to serving anyone's interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has a number of obligations to the people he serves.  He has a responsibility in relation to inflation, development and protection of jobs and to consumers.  He has also the responsibility to let the public have information to which they are entitled.  I believe he did not live up to this responsibility in the past few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they confirmed that he wanted to raise the alleged concealment of increases in the price of alcoholic drinks, as everybody who heard it today can verify.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with the press statement of yesterday in which the Deputy accused me of refusing to publish a recent interim report of the Fair Trade Commission on the price formula used to control prices in regard to petrol and autodiesel.  This allegation of his yesterday was the central allegation he made in the statement on which everything else hinged.  I wish to state categorically, as I did yesterday, that, as in many of his other assertions, the Deputy is misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that the interim report was not only published by me as long ago as 5 September last but was accompanied by a detailed press release setting out my reaction to the report.  A quotation from the report in the press release issued by Deputy Spring is totally selective and misleading, as well he knows.  Contrary to what Deputy Spring implied, the very next sentence in that report after what he quoted and which is set out in paragraph 6.9, page 25, contains the specific recommendatiions of the chairman of the commission as to what the increases in the wholesale margin for petrol should be. Furthermore, Deputy Spring attempted to misrepresent what I said about the matter when I was interviewed on Friday last.  As I confirmed yesterday, I made it clear that the concern that prompted me <Col N="401" /> to implement a small part, a very small part, of what the Fair Trade Commission had recommended by way of increases in their interim report in relation to the wholesale and retail margins was that there was a threat to the viability of a number of small Irish oil companies and not to the multinationals.  My decision to grant a fraction of what the commission had recommended was taken to ensure that employment involved in Irish companies would not be jeopardised.  In addition, had I not taken the action I did, there was a danger that we would be left in this country with only multinational oil distributors.  Surely that is not what the Deputy or this House would require.  Certainly I would not wish to encourage it.</P>
    <P>As I also made clear last Friday, there was no alteration in the retail price.  I did not consider it necessary to make a public statement any more than I made a public statement in August last when again there was no change in the retail price. There is nothing unusual, as a &ldquo;no change&rdquo; situation would not be particularly newsworthy. The question of concealment does not in any way arise as each and every one of the petrol companies and all the 3,500 garages and filling stations throughout the country which distribute this product would have been fully aware of the changes.  In addition, as is the practice, copies of the maximum prices order were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, presentation No. 6889 of 3 November 1989.  This order sets out clearly both the present wholesale and retail prices for both petrol and auto-diesel and how they are calculated.  Thus what is being bruited as having been concealed has been on public record since that date, 3 November, which is 11 days ago.  I am accused in this House of concealing something.  I do not think I can make it any more public than to lay it on the table of this House for the inspection of any Member of either House who cares to look at it.  I did that 11 days ago.  The matter could not be more public.  It was also made public to 3,500 different businesses throughout the country, plus, of course, the oil companies.  If that is <Col N="402" /> secrecy I would hate to think what announcing something publicly would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The next item for consideration on the Adjournment has been raised with me in the name of Deputy Eric Byrne, the subject matter being the need for grant assistance to facilitate people living in smoke control zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to record my appreciation that smoke control zones are being created in our city.  Having said that, I want to put on the record my disappointment at the speed at which we are creating smoke control zones.  I want to see if the Minister will respond to some of the following allegations.</P>
      <P>Areas A, B and C of Ballyfermot have now been declared smoke control zones, but area D has been excluded for some odd reason, notwithstanding the fact that as long ago as 3 May 1989, seven months ago, the local authority declared the area a smoke control zone.  Neilstown and areas 1 and 2 in Clondalkin were declared by the local authority, the county council in that case, as smoke control zones, yet in the Minister's statement yesterday area D in Ballyfermot and Clondalkin 1 and 2 have been excluded.  In Dublin South-Central, Crumlin area A, where the local authority last month took the decision to declare a smoke control zone, has been excluded by the Minister also for grant facilities.  The monitoring centre, which is on the Eastern Health Board site on the Old County Road, revealed the highest levels of pollution ever recorded in the city which make the point that, as recorded figures show, it has been one of the most polluted districts in the city, yet no grant facilities are available to people who wish to change over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument here and at Dublin City Council has been consistent, that as soon as the local authority, be they Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council, having done all the necessary preliminary <Col N="403" /> work and the surveying and having satisfactorily completed all their legal obligations, declare an area a smoke control zone, on and from that date, and no other, grant applications should be entertained. Why, since 3 May, have the people in area D of Ballyfermot not been eligible for grant assistance?  There is absolutely nothing in the legislation that prohibits the Minister from making grants available.  Thousands of people throughout Ballyfermot, Neilstown and Crumlin would be only too happy in the morning if the grant assistance was available to enable them to do their civic duty and move away from burning bituminous coals to using alternative fuels and appliances.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also agree that there are incredibly long delays in the process whereby public oral hearings are held?  I think this is being abused by the coal companies, particularly CDL.  Under no circumstances should CDL or the coal industry, no matter who represents them, the bellmen or whatever, be allowed to have oral public hearings restating the points that have already been decided at previous oral hearings.  They are engaging in a filibuster that is doing nothing for the health of this city.  I would like to hear what the Minister intends doing about that.  I would argue that only new issues should be allowed to be raised at oral hearings if the Minister is to go to the trouble and expense of bringing in inspectors to have those oral hearings. When the local authority decide to declare an area a smoke control zone, there is a statutory one month in which to make objections.  The period taken by the Minister to establish an oral hearing is often two or three months, maybe more, and another three or four months may elapse before the inspector reports back to the Minister.  The period between the inspector reporting to the Minister and his ratifying the proposal seems to be indefinite.  Therefore, from the time the surveyors from the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with Dublin Corporation, begin their survey a minimum of 12 months may elapse before there is <Col N="404" /> a declaration that an area is a smoke control zone.  That is a ridiculously long period.  It should be short-circuited.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about tackling the smog problem in Dublin and if he is serious about complying with the EC air quality regulations, which must be complied with before April 1993, grants should be made available from the time the local authority declare the area a smoke control zone.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the stipulation that grants can only be payable from the time the Minister ratifies the order for six months thereafter.  Many people will remember what happened in the home improvements grants area where the people who were most in need of those grants did not get them.  I would argue that a person may be unemployed and may not be capable of taking up the grants available.  There is no reason whatever that the grant assistance can be available only for six months because people's conditions change, from employment to unemployment and <i>vice versa.</i>  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to agree to extend the qualifying period to an indefinite period.  Why should someone who is unemployed today have only a six month period in which to take up this grant option when in six months' time, or later, he may be lucky to get a job and be happy to change over from the burning of bituminous coal.  The statistics are startling when you realise that today only 155 people have got grant assistance from Dublin Corporation for this purpose.  The Minister speaks in terms of £1 million being available; in fact, only £106,000 has been paid out.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons for my being here tonight making this point is to ask what can we do to protect those who cannot afford to change over to a more costly fuel?  What are we going to do about the old, the unemployed and those on social welfare?  They cannot change over to a cheaper form of fuel, logs, for example, because they are a pollutant and would not be allowed in the smoke control areas.  The areas which have been chosen to be smoke control zones are, in fact, areas which are predominantly <Col N="405" /> working class and in which there is extreme poverty.  What will the response be when people discover that old folk and those on social welfare or on low incomes are liable under this legislation and that if they continue to burn bituminous coals &mdash; the only fuel they can buy cheaply &mdash; they will be faced with a fine of £1,000 and a possible six months jail terms.  In all honesty, can we use the force of this legislation to intimidate people who by their socio-economic status are incapable of changing over to another form of heating? There was a 27 per cent increase in the cost of coalite during the summer. Would the Minister agree that the switch to the use of unleaded petrol by so many motorists is because of the price differential? Would he agree that it is not sufficient to have the Director of Community Affairs and Fair Trade investigate the cost of coalite but that the solution lies in the Minister's hands, that he could effectively cut the VAT rate applying to coalite?</P>
    <P>In summary, firstly, my arguments are in defence of the people in our society who will not be in a position to take up the grant because of their financial circumstances.  Secondly, the grant scheme, instead of applying only for six months, should be extended indefinitely. Thirdly, people of limited income cannot be forced to buy coalite which is 40 per cent more expensive than the coal they have been burning to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in addition to the £1 million which is available this year, the Government are making available in 1990, £3 million extra to help meet the cost of heating adaptations which may be necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the special control area orders.  That total sum is sufficient to provide generous grant assistance towards approximately 6,000 owner occupiers in heating conversions.  The <Col N="406" /> Deputy referred to area D, the Ballyfermot area.  Today we heard in the House that there had been objections to the order.  These objections have to be dealt with and, therefore, it is not possible to give a grant in those cases.  It has already been made clear that we are not happy with the rate of progress in establishing and confirming special control areas in Dublin.  For that reason the provisions of the 1987 Act, in relation to these areas, as being reviewed as a matter of urgency to see what can be done to speed up matters.</P>
      <P>In regard to the smokeless product, coalite, being more expensive than coal, I am quite satisfied that it would not be appropriate simply to pay a subsidy to consumers.  It is not clear why there is such a differential between the two fuels. As the Deputy will be aware the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is being asked to look urgently into the price structure.  If I had more time at my disposal I could go into it in more detail with the Deputy.  He will have to accept that what we are doing is a step in the right direction but it may not be as speedy as the Deputy would like.  As he will see, the Government have shown their good will by increasing the financial contribution for next year from £1 million to £3 million.</P>

The <i>National Development Plan</i> highlights the generally accepted fact that the major infrastructural deficiency in Ireland relates to the internal transport network, particularly roads.  Transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe are approximately twice those incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland, due mainly to the deficient state of national roads and access roads to the principal ports and airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the specific point made by the Deputy, the case made by the NESC for basing the economic argument for road improvements on the needs of passenger rather than freight traffic is the importance of time savings to people as passengers.  The measurement of time <Col N="50" /> savings is an important tool in the economic evaluation of road improvement projects.  Their value is measured in relation to both passenger and freight traffic and in terms of working time and leisure time savings.  The weighting given to working time is approximately four times the value of non-working or leisure time.  Almost two-thirds of traffic on national roads is work related.</P>
    <P>I consider that no alteration in the relative priority of different roads, as already identified in the Operational Programme, is warranted on the basis of the NESC's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1987 Air Pollution Act provides a flexible statutory framework for the control and prevention of air pollution, including the emission of pollutants from combustion plants.  These controls are administered by the local authorities.  Under Part III of the Act an obligation is imposed on persons to obtain licences for the operation of certain industrial plant.  Before the licensing authority grants the licence, it must be satisfied that the best practicable means will be used to prevent or limit any emissions from the plant.</P>
      <P>Regulations implementing the licensing requirements for new plant and specified existing plant were made in October, 1988.  It is intended to bring further classes of existing plant within the licensing system on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Most combustion plants are associated with industrial processes but where such is not the case the Air Pollution Act contains general provisions, particularly in Part 2, for the control of emissions of pollutants and for enforcement procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC Directive 88/609/EEC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants requires us to maintain emissions of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from such plants below given levels.  In the case of existing plant, SO2 emissions must not exceed 124,000 tonnes by 1993 with no increases between then and 2003 while NOx emissions cannot exceed 50,000 tonnes by 1993 with no increase in the period up to 1998.  In addition, emission <Col N="55" /> limit values for SO2, NOx and smoke varying with plant size, must be imposed on all new plant.</P>
    <P>The directive must be implemented by 30 June 1990 and Ireland will be fully complying with all its requirements in regard to emission ceilings.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a signatory to the Sofia Protocol to the Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution.  The objective of the Protocol is to stabilise overall national emissions of oxides of nitrogen at 1987 levels by 1994.  A programme is being prepared to meet the requirements of the Protocol in Ireland; the ESB's commitment to fit low NOx burners to existing plant at an approximate cost of £7m in 1989 terms will be a significant contribution to complying with the Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of concern to me that the number of fish kill incidents this year has increased, particularly after the success of the efforts made to reduce such incidents in 1988.  I am aware that certain factors can be cited to explain, in part at least, some of this increase.  These include low river flows due to the fine summer, and heightened public awareness which resulted in a greater level of reporting of incidents, including some involving only a few fish.  In general, however, the experience this year serves only to reinforce the importance of pursuing the implementation of a comprehensive programme of measures to tackle all sources of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis already placed on education about pollution risks and appropriate safeguards, and the part played by official <Col N="56" /> agencies and farming organisations in promoting awareness, have resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of fish kills due to agricultural sources.  The recent increase in the level of grants available for the provision of pollution control facilities on farms outside the disadvantaged areas should contribute to a further reduction in the number of pollution incidents from such sources.</P>
    <P>The main element of the programme to control pollution which remains to be put in place is the enactment of legislation amending the Water Pollution Act, 1977, so as to strengthen the powers available to local authorities to prevent and deal with water pollution.  The amending legislation will also provide for substantially increased penalties for water pollution offences, civil liability for pollution damages and remedial measures at the polluters expense.  The Bill has already passed all stages in the Seanad and it is scheduled to come before the Dáil during the present session.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>EC Directive 85/337 on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was brought into operation from 3 July 1988 in accordance with arrangements notified by my Department.  Statutory effect has been given to its provisions, in relation to motorway projects, by the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1988 (SI No. 221 of 1988).  Work has been proceding on comprehensive regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, to give express statutory effect to the directive in respect of the other types of projects to which it applies.  I intend that these measures will be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>The directive requires projects of the classes listed in annex II to be subjected to EIA where member states consider that their characteristics so require. Accordingly, the new regulations will require EIA to be carried out for projects of this kind where they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. The regulations will specify criteria and thresholds for the purpose of determining the environmental significance of different classes of development.</P>
      <P>As to the particular question of mineral prospecting, this is not specifically dealt with by the directive.  Annex II does, however, cover deep drillings, and provision will be made for EIA where this activity would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.</P>

      <P>For some time past, environmental considerations in relation to the Irish Sea have been raised at both ministerial and official levels with the United Kingdom authorities.  Co-operation between the two sides and joint action within the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has led to the publication of a report on &ldquo;The Status of Current Knowledge on Authropogenic Influences in the Irish Sea&rdquo; as part of the ICES co-operative research series.  In addition, Irish Sea issues were discussed in considerable detail at a meeting in May of this year attended by Irish, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Isle of Man officials.  Agreement in principle was reached on the development of co-ordinated monitoring arrangements and <Col N="62" /> details in this regard are to be the subject of further discussions.  In addition, there was agreement that general discussions of this kind might usefully be held at intervals of about a year.</P>
      <P>I believe that arrangements such as these can lead to effective co-operation in relation to the environmental management and protection of the Irish Sea. The initiatives taken will provide the scientific data on conditions and trends which are essential to a fuller understanding of the marine environment and to the implementation of effective management strategies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following is the statement.  Regarding County Louth, I am aware that it can take about seven months to get a driving test.  The main reason is that in recent years, there have been too few testers available to carry out tests because of public sector staffing constraints.  There are 48 driver testers throughout the country at present.  Recently four extra staff were redeployed to driver testing duties and these are now being trained. I have also made arrangements to recruit further testers to bring the permanent corps up to 60 and additional temporary testers on a contract basis in order to <Col N="63" /> reduce the waiting periods for tests to an acceptable level as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to introduce such regulations.</P>
      <P>The suggestion, if implemented, would involve the inclusion of additional information on the change of vehicle ownership form, which does not appear to be warranted.  In the case of a speedometer reading, it is possible for inaccurate details to be entered on the form and the licensing authorities would not be in a position to verify details of mileage.  The inclusion of this information could not, therefore, be regarded as reliable.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, details of mileage on the odometer are not required on motor registration forms in any other EC country.  I consider that the best approach to the alteration (or &ldquo;clocking&rdquo;) of odometers to show false mileages is to make odometers more tamper proof.  Ireland has requested the EC Commission to consider the drafting of an EC type approval directive on odometers, including a requirement to make odometers tamper proof.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the embassy in Canberra has overall consular responsibility for all of Australia.  There are no plans at present to establish a consulate in Melbourne but I will keep the matter under review in the light of the criteria which we apply to the establishment of a consulate in a particular country or region.  These include the size of the Irish community and its need of, and access to, consular services; the existing or potential situation regarding foreign earnings and the availability of the necessary resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are considerable difficulties with cross-country comparisons of this type because of problems of definition and the imprecise nature of the data used.  This is recognised by international organisations.  However, on the information available to the Central Statistics Office the methodology used in respect of Greece appears to be broadly similar to that for Ireland, but no information is available for Portugal.  I am also informed by that office that the figure quoted for Ireland included elements of pensions and other similar receipts from outside the State, which of course are not within the scope of &ldquo;emigrants' remittances&rdquo;. If these are excluded, the figure for emigrants' remittances for Ireland is about one quarter of that quoted in the OECD survey.</P>
      <P>As regards the accuracy of the Irish data, I would point out that the relevant information is supplied to the Central Statistics Office, on a voluntary basis, by financial institutions.  Although the data could be subject to imprecision in classification, it is not considered that this would materially alter the comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of research into reasons for the differences in the levels of these remittances between Ireland and the countries mentioned.  Among the relevant considerations would be relative domestic incomes in the countries in question; variations in the level of social <Col N="96" /> provision, and thus in the need for such remittances; and differences in the profile of emigrants, particularly as regards responsibility for a non-emigrating dependent family.</P>

    <P>There is likely to be a recurring tax liability in respect of these new sources of revenue.  However, in the absence of more precise data than those available, it is extremely difficult to estimate with any degree of reliability the likely size of this liability in any future year.  Notwithstanding this, it would be reasonable to expect that any additional tax revenue which will arise each year from the new sources is likely to be somewhat less than the amount of the accumulated liabilities shown above.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the main result of the amnesty was the earlier and more effective collection of known arrears of tax.  The success of the amnesty is allowing the Revenue Commissioners to devote increased resources to the pursuit of remaining tax defaulters.</P>

      <P>Export sales relief (ESR) will cease to be available after 5 April 1990, and while there will be an increase in the tax yield as a result, it is not yet known when precisely this will begin to accrue.</P>
      <P>The yield to the Exchequer from the replacement of the relief by a corporation tax rate of 10 per cent will depend upon a number of factors such as the extent to which ESR companies will continue to operate in Ireland after that relief has been terminated, and the extent to which ESR companies had accumulated unused capital allowances by 5 April 1990 which can be set off against their taxable profits. Because of these factors it is not possible to say now what the yield to the Exchequer will be under the new arrangement. However, it is unlikely that there will be any appreciable yield in 1990 because of the normal seven month time lag between the dates on which company accounting periods end and the corresponding dates for tax payment.</P>

On this basis the amount of investments on which the figures given for year ended 5 April 1989 are based is close on £26 million but there are clear <Col N="101" /> indications that the total of investments actually made in that year was substantially higher.  This will give rise to an Exchequer cost in the current tax year according as these amounts are notified to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>I have from the beginning of my term of office been very concerned about the quota difficulties of small scale producers and consequently the changes I have made in the operation of the quota system have been designed to direct any available quota towards such producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial arrangements for the distribution of our national quota in 1984 were not, unfortunately, adequate to deal with the difficulties faced by these <Col N="107" /> producers.  For that reason I secured agreement from the Council of Ministers in 1987 to introduce a restructuring scheme giving special priority for the purchase of quota, without land, to small scale producers.  I laid down that the scheme would, in fact, be restricted to producers with quotas under 50,000 gallons and of these the first priority category is confined to producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>I have also sought to help these producers by giving them priority under the scheme for temporary leasing of quotas introduced in 1988-89 and also in that year I further amended the guidelines on flexi-milk in their favour.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I introduced in December 1987 a clawback system under which a percentage of quota transferring with a lease of land will be retained in a national reserve, if the lessee's total quota exceeds 50,000 gallons.  This is designed partly to add quota to the national reserve for distribution to small scale and young farmers and, more importantly in the way the scheme works, to give such producers priority access to quotas becoming available for leasing with land.</P>
    <P>More recently, in response to a request which I made at last year's EC price fixing negotiations the Commission has introduced a proposal to provide for an additional one per cent of quota to be made available to member states for allocation to priority category producers, e.g. small scale producers and new entrants.  These proposals are before the Council of Ministers at present and I am hopeful that a decision will be taken by the Council at an early date.</P>

      <P>However, I understand that a study carried out by Teagasc in 1986 shows that the number of herds producing over 80,000 gallons each per year was 1,034, those producing between 40,000 and 80,000 each was 5,130, those producing between 20,000 and 40,000 each was 10,804 and those producing less than 20,000 each was 38,319.</P>

      <P>In the context of the reform of the beef support arrangements earlier <Col N="109" /> this year, I obtained the formal recognition of the EC Commission and the Council of Ministers of the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy. I have continuously and successfully insisted that this recognition should be given practical effect in the way in which the various support measures are operated. In March of this year we got agreement to the introduction of carcase intervention and in September an aids to private storage scheme was introduced. In addition to these specific measures we have succeeded throughout the peak supply period in getting agreement at the beef management committee to the purchase of substantial quantities of beef into intervention in Ireland under the tendering system.  These support measures have helped to maintain cattle prices at all stages of the production cycle.  As a result, while prices have been somewhat below last year's record levels they have been above the levels which obtained in any other of the last five years.  Furthermore, I am happy to say that there has been some improvement in prices in recent weeks.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any manner or at any particular premium.</P>
      <P>I understand that in order to maintain their viability some motor insurance companies are tending to be more selective in the type of risk for which they are prepared to quote.  This more selective approach tends to apply to new business rather than to existing policyholders.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, my information is that a number of companies, not just New PMPA, are continuing to offer insurance cover to persons under 25 years of age and that companies in general are not refusing renewal of cover to persons under 25 years of age.</P>
      <P>In any event cases of inability to get motor insurance cover can be dealt with under the declined cases agreement.  This is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Declined Cases Committee, established under the agreement, examines cases referred to it by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available, to consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
      <P>In the last two years significant resources have been allocated to improve the position of persons at the lower end of the income distribution.  The full year costs of the social welfare improvements in the 1988 and 1989 budgets were £101 million and £157 million respectively.  In recent years social welfare payments generally have kept pace with inflation and payments to the long-term unemployed have increased by almost 17 per cent in real terms.  In addition, payments for children of social welfare recipients have been increased significantly, giving rise to substantial improvements for larger families.  The higher rate of child benefit formerly paid in respect of the sixth and subsequent children is now paid in respect of the fifth child as well, and this is a benefit to all larger families.</P>
      <P>Recognising the position of men who are rearing children alone, the Government introduced a new assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with children last month along the lines of the existing scheme for widows and deserted wives.</P>
      <P>Improvements in the family income supplement scheme together with the special tax exemption scheme for low paid workers with children means that the problems of families on low incomes at work are also being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increased Christmas bonus will be paid to pensioners and the long-term unemployed this year.  As a result an old age pension couple will receive a bonus of £70.  A couple with 5 children on long-term unemployment assistance will get a <Col N="124" /> bonus of £88.90 bringing their payment that week to £215.90.</P>
    <P>The above examples of the action taken by the Government indicate that it is aware of the changing needs and problems of society and is responding to alleviate these.  The Government intends in future budgets to build on the progress it has made to date.</P>
    <P>Proposals for improvements in social welfare payments in 1990 are being prepared at present in connection with forthcoming discussions on the 1990 budget. In this context the Government's commitment to improving the position of persons on social welfare payments as far as the available resources permit will be fully maintained.</P>

      <P>Officers, on entering the service, undergo extensive training covering all aspects of the work of a social welfare officer.  The training includes direction and guidance on how to deal courteously, tactfully and efficiently with members of the public and calls for a considerate and sympathetic approach in each case.</P>
      <P>The need for courtesy, consideration and efficiency in bringing cases to a satisfactory and expeditious conclusion is important and the training of social welfare officers is geared towards that end. It is the duty of officers to report fully and fairly on cases referred to them for investigation and part of that duty is to assist and facilitate claimants in obtaining their entitlements.  It is also their responsibility to ensure that claimants do not receive payments to which they are not entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the experience of my Department that officers can be subjected to <Col N="125" /> unfounded allegations and unfair criticism particularly in cases where clients are reluctant to co-operate in determining their entitlements and in specific cases where abuse of the schemes is being investigated.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that officers carry out their duties impartially and often in very difficult circumstances.  If, however, the Deputy has any specific complaints against any of my officials I will gladly have them investigated when the facts are given to me.</P>

This represents an increase of £18 per week in the overall level of income maintenance paid to the household.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason he has excluded persons who re-entered insurance at the modified rate on 1 April 1974 from entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> old <Col N="127" /> age contributory pension; and the justification for refusing a pension to those whose contributions are equal or significantly greater than those awarded pensions in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to April 1974 people could come into and go out of insurance due to the operation of the insurable limit.  From April 1974, however, all employees, regardless of earnings, became compulsorily insurable, either at the full rate covered for all benefits and pensions, or at a modified rate covered for a limited range of benefits.</P>
      <P>Many persons who came back into compulsory insurance at the full rate were able to build up an entitlement to old age pension after a relatively short period of years.  Other persons, however, although they had similar insurance records after April 1974, were unable to qualify for pension because the operation of the insurable limit had created gaps in their insurance records which prevented them from meeting the minimum average contribution requirement of 20.  To rectify this anomaly provision was made for <i>pro rata</i> pensions in these cases for averages of less than 20.</P>
      <P>Persons who came back into insurance at a modified rate in April 1974 were not compulsorily insured for old age pension after that date and were not covered by the 1988 provisions.  The situation of mixed insurance where people move from full to modified insurance during their working lifetime is an ongoing feature of the social insurance system.  The question of pension coverage for persons in this situation is being examined by the National Pensions Board as part of its review of pension provisions generally.</P>

The code also includes provision for waiver by me of the abatement of pension provisions in specified circumstances. The relevant provisions of the code are article 60 of the Local Government (Superannuation Revision) (Consolidation) Scheme, 1986, and article 56 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 (Consolidation) Scheme, 1987.

A grant of £20,000 under the amenity grants scheme financed from national lottery surplus funds was paid to the local community association in respect of works to a community hall. These works were, I understand, carried out on foot of an agreement between the community association and the developers of the shopping centre.</P>
      <P>Payments under the amenity grants scheme are made on foot of a certificate from the local authority that the appropriate expenditure has been properly incurred in accordance with the conditions of the scheme.  This certificate was given in the present instance.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 85/3/EEC of 19/12/1984 lays down a gross vehicle weight limit of 40t for five and six axle combined vehicles &mdash; articulated trucks and road trains &mdash; circulating internationally. The corresponding Irish national limit is 38t.  Under a special EC derogation, Ireland and the UK have until 31 December 1998 to introduce the 40t limit.  The derogation period is designed to allow roads infrastructure &mdash; notably bridges &mdash; to be strengthened to carry heavier lorries.  Ireland and the UK are committed to use their best endeavours to introduce the 40t limit in advance of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an interim measure, I propose to make regulations, in the first half of 1990, <Col N="142" /> increasing the maximum gross vehicle weight of five and six axle combined vehicles from 38t to 40t &mdash; with the exception of five axle articulated trucks with three axle semi-trailers incorporating steel suspension.  The latter category of lorry is particularly damaging to bridges. The Government's policy in relation to the implementation of EC lorry weight limits is set out in paragraph 3.24 of the Operational Programme <i>Ireland &mdash; Road Development 1989-1993</i> (PL 6482) submitted to the EC Commission, in March 1989, in connection with Ireland's application for assistance from EC Structural Funds.  A copy of the Operational Programme is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>Additional funds were made available in the 1989 budget as follows: <Col N="144" /> (a) An extra £10 million for public water supply and sewerage facilities over and above the figure in the Estimates published in October 1988; (b) A £2 million provision for a special scheme of grants for environmental works in urban designated areas; (c) £500,000 to provide special grants for amenity and environmental improvement works at selected beaches; and (d) £250,000 for measures to promote re-cycling of glass, cans, paper and plastics.</P>
      <P>The rates support grant allocations for 1990 show an increase of 3.5 per cent overall which will assist local authorities in meeting the costs of administration and overheads generally including environmental protection.  In addition, the capital allocation for public water supply and sewerage services has been increased to £67.5 million, £5 million more than the 1989 provision.  The question of further resources is a matter for consideration in the context of the 1990 budget.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Government,</i> provision is made for the establishment of an independent environmental monitoring agency.  It is envisaged that the agency will be in a position to provide support, back-up and advisory services for local authorities, including monitoring and laboratory facilities and other specialised services. The agency, which will become operational in 1990, will therefore represent a major boost to the resources of local authorities for environmental protection purposes.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 166 of 15 November 1988 for details of rate support grant paid for the years 1980 to 1987 and to Question No. 253 of 19 October 1988 for details in respect of 1988.  The rate support grant allocated for 1989, following adjustment in respect of ESB rates, is set out in the following tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The rate support grant has been adjusted on a number of occasions in recent years in respect of the elimination of local authority financial responsibility for contributions towards supplementary welfare allowances, maintenance of arterial drainage schemes, county committees of agriculture, loan charges written off under the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987 and in respect of rates payable by the ESB to local authorities. These adjustments therefore, make comparison in real terms of the grant in 1989 with the grants paid in previous years unreliable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Cavan Council has been notified that it will receive a rate support grant allocation of £3,678,000 in 1990; to the fact that if the grant was to be based on the actual valuation and the rate in the pound provided for in the Estimates, the total income due to Cavan County Council would be £3,859,864 greater that the actual allocation; the action he will take to make up the shortfall having regard to the serious and unacceptable condition of 1,500 miles of county roads; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that school bus transport and other services have been withdrawn from many of these roads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The 1989 discretionary road grant allocations notified to Cavan County Council for regional and county roads amount to £1.528 million which represents an increase of £319,000, or 26 per cent on the grant payments under equivalent headings in 1988 and is almost 2½ times the level of comparable grant payments in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated a rate support grant of £3.678 million to Cavan County Council for 1990 and this was notified to the council recently.  The rate support grant for Cavan County Council has been adjusted on a number of occasions in recent years in respect of the elimination of local authority financial responsibility for contributions towards supplementary welfare allowances, county committees of agriculture, loan charges written off under the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987 and in respect of rates payable by the ESB to the council.  Having regard <Col N="148" /> to these adjustments, the comparison attempted by the Deputy, of the actual grant allocation with the amount got by applying the rate in the £ to rateable valuations (including land) now exempt from rates would lack validity, even if it could be assumed that the proposed rate in the £ would remain unaffected by the major changes in the liability of property to local rates under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 and subsequently.</P>

      <P>National waste policy is firmly directed to ensuring that all hazardous waste is disposed of without risk to public health or to the environment and measures are being taken to achieve maximum national self-sufficiency in this area. Legislative controls to ensure safe disposal of these wastes are contained in the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations 1982 and the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1988.  These regulations provide for a mandatory consignment note system which is designed to trace waste movements from source to final disposal.</P>

    <P>The major phase of the development of <Col N="155" /> St. James's Hospital has been completed and is in the process of being commissioned.</P>
    <P>The planning of the new hospital in Tallaght is proceeding rapidly and construction work is due to commence in late 1990 or early 1991.  The services provided by the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospital will provide the nucleus of the new hospital.</P>
    <P>The services at present provided at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital will transfer to other hospitals in the near future as part of the reorganisation of specialist services in the Dublin area.  Discussions with the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and those hospitals taking on the services are now at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin south-east area it has been decided that general hospital services will be provided by three hospitals, i.e. St. Vincent's, Elm Park; St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown and St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire.  Discussions on the provision of the services on an integrated basis are continuing with these hospitals.</P>
    <P>In relation to psychiatric services, the Eastern Health Boards are continuing the implementation of the report, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;.  Community psychiatric services are being developed in the Dublin south city area.  In the past number of years the board have acquired facilities in Milltown, Tallaght, Crumlin, Harolds Cross, and Clondalkin, for use as mental health centres, housing sector teams, day hospitals/day centres.  This is in addition to a network of hostels and workshops.</P>
    <P>With regard to community services there are proposals to build a number of health centres in the south city area and to improve existing facilities.  These proposals include the provision of major centres at Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of mental handicap services, a survey has been produced by the Eastern Health Board in conjunction with the major services providing agencies in the region which quantifies the needs for further residential and <Col N="156" /> day activity provision for people with a mental handicap.  This survey is being used as the basis for establishing an action plan for the development of services.</P>
    <P>With regard to Baggot Street Hospital the position is that the Eastern Health Board took over responsibility for the provision of services at this hospital in January 1988.  Accordingly, the level of funding to be allocated to Baggot Street is a matter for decision by the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical card holders are, in general, entitled to free public ward accommodation, but exceptions to this can arise in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>Firstly, persons in receipt of in-patient services for more than 30 days within a 12-month period may be liable for charges under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976 (S.I. No. 180 of 1976), as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 300 of 1987). While these charges do not apply to persons with full eligibility, a person categorised as such while living at home may be regarded as outside that category while maintained in a hospital.  The determination of a person's eligibility category is, under section 17 (4) of the Health Act, 1970, a function of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's circumstances.  Allowance is made for any outgoings, and a reasonable amount of the person's income is left for personal needs.  Where a person has dependants, the charges do not apply.</P>
      <P>Secondly, road traffic accident victims who are entitled to receive compensation for their injuries are also liable for charges, regardless of their category of eligibility, under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986.  These charges, which are based on the cost of providing the service, are only payable if and when compensation is received.</P>

      <P>The issue of the timing of the certification was considered by the courts and the interpretation of the courts is that the certification process may take place within a reasonable time after the probationary period has expired.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the board of the hospital to carry out the certification process and the court has ruled that this process must be conducted in accordance with constitutional and natural justice and the stipulations set down by the court in a recent case.  I am satisfied that the decisions of the courts in this matter are reasonable and I have no proposals at present to modify the procedure.</P>
      <P>In my view these procedures will not give rise to any undue delay or other problems where the appointee's work and conduct have been satisfactory.

The question of ensuring that the duties assigned are fulfilled is one for the management authorities of the school. The main criteria for the appointment of eligible teachers to posts of responsibility are suitability and capability.  Seniority is also an important factor.</P>
    <P>The number of holders of posts of responsibility allowances in each category in secondary, community and comprehensive schools, as available to my Department from the most recent statistical data (January 1989) is given in the table below:</P>

The funds will be used for a series of measures in key areas where serious deficiencies in equipment and accommodation have been identified in universities, regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.

This is in accordance with the agreement reached between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the case of Harold Boy's NS, there were 85 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus two assistants for the 1989-90 school year.</P>

      <P>The scheme of grants for persons attending ESF-aided technician training courses in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology is governed by certain conditions.  These conditions provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that the lower rate of grant applies in the case of every trainee whose normal family residence is within 15 miles of the college in which they are pursuing a training course and in the case of those who travel, or could reasonably be expected to travel, daily between their homes and the college.</P>
      <P>The higher rate of grant may be paid only to those, not covered by the above conditions, who are obliged to stay overnight in a college town.</P>

This is a matter to be addressed by the board of management in the context of the rules <Col N="185" /> and guidelines on school discipline.  Following protracted negotiations with all the relevant educational interests on the recommendations of the report of the Committee on School Discipline my Department issued Circular 7/88 in March 1988 which set out a revised rule and guidelines on school discipline.  Some 95 extra teachers have been allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas which are generally the schools experiencing discipline problems.  The school in question has such an extra teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the specific strategies her Department have developed to eliminate sexism in education particularly in the area of subject choice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the ongoing policy of the Department of Education to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in the education sector.  There is a working group which monitors and co-ordinates activities within the Department relating to equality of educational opportunity for girls and boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to avoid sexism and sex-stereotyping in schools continues to be stressed at in-service courses for teachers <Col N="190" /> and school principals organised by the Department &mdash; a module on &ldquo;Sexism and Sex-Stereotyping in Primary Education&rdquo; was included in all in-service courses for primary teachers organised by inspectors in summer 1989.  The matter is also generally raised at discussions with the principal and staff prior to submission by the inspector of a school report.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to gender equity particularly in the area of subject choice continue to be covered generally on in-service courses for post-primary teachers as well as specific seminars and courses being organised in this area.</P>
    <P>Principals, guidance teachers and teachers generally are encouraged by the inspectorate to offer all optional subjects to both boys and girls and, in particular, to offer and encourage girls to take up such subjects as physics, chemistry and technical subjects.  Schools which do not have the full facilities for science or the specialist teachers required are encouraged to share facilities locally especially amongst small neighbouring schools.  The Code of Good Practice produced by the EC was reproduced by the Department of Education and issued to all second level schools.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for publishers on the need to avoid sexism and sex-stereotyping in school textbooks are issued by the Department and must be followed in order for a publisher to have a text book sanctioned for inclusion in the list of approved text books for use in primary schools.</P>
    <P>A working group on the elimination of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials were established in 1988 at primary level representative of the Department of Education, school management, the INTO and the National Parents' Council.  Their terms of reference are to examine the level of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials, to make recommendations for its elimination on a phased basis taking due account of the need for restraint in public expenditure and to monitor progress in the area.  The working group have carried out an examination of guidelines for publishers in this <Col N="191" /> area, have made a study of the course in conversational Irish and are also examining the research available on the topic of sexism in teaching materials.  A proposal will be submitted to the equality committee in the Department of Education shortly.</P>
    <P>A pilot project at the curriculum development centre in Shannon developed and piloted a four week course called &ldquo;Familiarisation Course for Girls in relation to traditionally non-female occupations&rdquo; which is aimed at 13-15 year old girls in single sex and mixed schools. The aim of the course was to get girls to re-examine their vocational ambitions and to look closely at their subject choices. A package suitable for use in schools was produced at the end of this project.</P>
    <P>The vocational preparation and training programme introduced in 1984 aims to &ldquo;expose all participants to the same range of occupational possibilities and training opportunities&rdquo;.  It is felt that this requirement would contribute to the broadening of the occupational aspirations of girls by exposing them to a range of occupational experiences beyond those traditionally offered on existing secretarial courses.  A video highlighting gender issues is currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>Special measures have been taken to ensure that women are appointed to the selection boards for teachers and that the Code of Practice of the Employment Equality Agency in regard to interview procedures is put into effect.  In so far as second level school appointments are concerned, the Department of Education have drawn the attention of school management to the code and indicated the Minister's support for it.  Following proposals by a working party representative of the principal patrons of national schools, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Department of Education, revised procedures for the selection and appointment of national teachers have been drawn up.  In addition, in order to promote equality of opportunity for men and women candidates, guidelines laying down in detail how advertisements should be composed, <Col N="192" /> how applications should be assessed and how interviews should be conducted have been prepared.</P>
    <P>These procedures: (a) make it mandatory that selection boards include at least one woman and at least one man; (b) require selection boards to have regard to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Employment Equality Agency Code of Practice, 1983; and (c) provide that no question should be asked nor information sought in any form from a candidate which might be construed as being discriminatory on grounds of sex or marital status.</P>
    <P>Both the Curriculum Review Body on the Primary Curriculum and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as part of their remit are required to ensure that sexism and stereotyping be eliminated from curricula and that they work towards the implementation of gender equality in schools.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that although more girls attend secondary schools than boys fewer of them take higher level mathematics and science subjects, with the exception of biology, and hence find it difficult to enter high skill level technical occupations.  Encouragement is given to schools to provide and students to participate more in these subjects at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>A brochure &ldquo;OPTIONS&rdquo; was produced and sent to all second level schools in the country.  This brochure provides statistics on the take up by girls of honours mathematics/science subjects at both intermediate and leaving certificate levels, as well as information on the take up of non-traditional courses at third level.  It provides information on trends in the labour market and encourages girls to choose their subject/training/career options very carefully in the light of current trends and to consider a wider range of options both at second and third level.</P>
    <P>With a view to increasing the numbers of girls studying physics and chemistry a scheme of intervention projects was devised by the Department in 1985.  The first of these projects was initiated in Naas, County Kildare in the school year 1985-86.  In September 1986, the scheme <Col N="193" /> was extended to include two further physics projects, in Longford and Dundalk, respectively, and a chemistry project in Dublin.  Two further physics projects, one in Enniscorthy and one in Cork, were initiated in September 1987.  In September 1988 the scheme was further expanded, with the inclusion of physics projects in Mayo, Galway and Kerry, respectively, and another chemistry project in Dublin.  Six new projects have been established in September 1989.</P>
    <P>The mechanism of the scheme has developed considerably with experience and it is now implemented as follows.  An experienced teacher is selected by the Department and appointed to introduce physics or chemistry to a selected school in a particular region.  The brief of this teacher, termed a visiting teacher is not only to introduce physics or chemistry as a subject in the project school but also to establish a tradition of the subject within the school and to foster an appreciation of the subject as an integral part of a modern curriculum.</P>
    <P>In addition to expanding the curriculum of the project schools the visiting teachers provide a service to other girls' and co-educational schools in the region of their project school.  In some cases teachers from these schools, known as associated schools, come to the project school and attend the visiting teacher's classes.  In other instances the visiting teacher travels to the associated schools so that teachers are able to discuss their problems in relation to techniques in experimental work and new developments in their subject.  This is a form of in-service training which the teachers involved are finding very valuable.</P>
    <P>An action research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies was introduced in 1986-87.  This project is still in operation.  Four schools are involved representing the main kinds of second level schools.  This project has been evaluated externally and the final report of the evaluator will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> It is intended to disseminate this programme in 1989-90.  A video of the programme has been produced.  It is intended to produce materials based on those used in this project and to make them available to all teachers.</P>
    <P>A special scheme of grants for mature women students is operated annually. Grants of £1,000 each are awarded to mature women students who have already completed at least one year of a higher level course and who are either unemployed or in poor financial circumstances &mdash; 15 such grants will be awarded for the academic year 1989-90.</P>
    <P>Funding was provided in 1987 by the EC for a European Community poster competition.  This was a new initiative of the European Community Action Programme to promote equal opportunities for girls and boys in Education and had, as its theme, &ldquo;Equal Opportunities for girls and boys in Education&rdquo;.  Travel prizes, consisting of a week's stay in Brussels, were awarded by the Commission to the four winning entrants from Ireland. They travelled to Brussels in September 1987 where they had an opportunity to meet prizewinners from Spain, Portugal and Greece.  The EC has produced a brochure of the winning entries from the four countries.  It is intended to circulate this to all schools.</P>
    <P>In 1988-89 the EC undertook to cofinance with the Department of Education an action research project in the pre-and in-service training of teachers.  The agencies co-operating with the Department of Education in the implementation of these projects are: (a) St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra, Dublin, (b) Thomond College of Education, (c) Department of Education, University College, Dublin and (d) Teachers' Union of Ireland.  Reports on the project have been made available both by the coordinator and by the external evaluator. This action research is continuing for the year 1989-90.  An additional project has been added.  The Institute of Guidance Counsellors will implement a project with guidance counsellors, as part of the action research.</P>
    <P>A research project to examine aspects <Col N="195" /> of gender equality in primary and post-primary education was commenced on 1 September 1989 by the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, at the request of the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>The two year and three year full-time courses leading to the international montessori diploma, available at the Montessori College, Blackrock, were approved by my Department for higher education grant purposes in 1988. Approval was granted on the basis that <Col N="201" /> these were courses of third-level education of which the duration, entry requirements and academic qualification standard were comparable with many other third-level courses approved for the purposes of the higher education grants and VEC scholarships schemes.</P>
      <P>The recognition of these courses for higher education grants purposes does not imply any extension of the recognition currently applicable to graduates of this college with respect of teaching in schools funded by the State, i.e. graduates of the three year diploma course may be recognised to teach in special schools for mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed or multiple handicapped children or children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The recognition does not apply to any other type of national school.</P>
      <P>The diploma has not been recognised as a suitable qualification for teachers employed in ordinary national schools. This decision was based on educational grounds taking into account the course followed for the montessori teacher's diploma, the curriculum of the primary schools, the educational philosophy on which this curriculum is based and the pedogogical requirements for its implementation.</P>

    <P>The above percentages are derived from estimates of school leavers contained in the annual school leavers' survey conducted by the Department of Labour.  The results of the survey are based on a national sample of a proportion of the total number of school leavers.  For the purposes of the above table, it is taken that the number of school leavers returned in the school leavers' survey as having no qualification refers to those pupils who left post-primary school without sitting the group or intermediate certificate examinations.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the suggestion referred to which was made in a report prepared for UNESCO in the fifties.

    <P>In the Irish school system there are at present 25 educational psychologists employed by the Department of Education, and a small number employed in the vocational education sector, catering <Col N="204" /> mainly for the 300,000 post-primary pupils in our schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, there are two separate schemes operated by my Department to help schools serving disadvantaged areas, the first of which provides special financial aid for schools and the second of which gives additional teaching assistance in the form of concessionary teaching posts.</P>
      <P>Since 1984 a total of £2.75 million has been allocated as special aid to schools serving disadvantaged areas and a further £.5 million is being provided this year. The funds have been allocated mainly to the following areas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) special grants for the purchase of books and equipment; (2) the sponsorship of home-school community liaison programmes in co-operation with school management authorities; (3) the alleviation of primary school debts; (4) special inservice training for <Col N="212" /> teachers; (5) grants for equipping pre-schools for travellers' children; (6) printing of specially developed curricular materials; (7) provision of educational assessment materials; (8) purchase of a limited number of computers.</P>
    <P>The scheme for providing additional teaching assistance in schools serving areas of disadvantage was introduced in the 1982-83 school year.  A total of 95 concessionary posts are allocated under the scheme at present in 78 schools; a breakdown of the number of schools and posts by county is as follows:</P>

    <P Just="Center">The selection of schools to benefit from the special measures is done in consulation with the Department's inspectors who are familiar with the particular circumstances of the schools in question. The inspectors submit recommendations to the Department based on the difficulties affecting the schools in question and taking account of the many educational, social and environmental factors relevant to each case.  These would include factors such as:</P>
    <P>(1) high levels of truancy and behaviour disorders; (2) discipline problems; (3) evidence of poor application, impaired reading, maths, etc.; (4) problems of teacher morale and motivation; (5) home factors such as parental problems, poverty of home life, lack of interest; (6) high unemployment and <Col N="213" /> material poverty; (7) crime, vandalism, etc.; (8) lack of community support; (9) poor standard of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Generally the special interventions are directed at groups whose educational disadvantage is manifest and which would be mostly comprised of families which have been disaffected and alienated from the educational system.  The measures are intended to assist such groups which for a variety of reasons are inhibited from participating fully and from gaining the maximum benefit from the educational system.</P>
    <P>The eligibility of schools for participation in the schemes is continuously monitored in conjunction with the local inspectors.  The review of this subject referred to by the Deputy which has been undertaken with the involvement of the relevant educational interests has not been completed yet.</P>
    <P>In the case of post-primary schools, following discussions under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government decided to allocate additional teaching posts for the 1988-89 school session to post-primary schools where the greatest need was perceived following consideration of the effects of the introduction of the 20:1 pupil teacher ratio.  A total of 175 such posts were allocated.</P>
    <P>The posts were allocated among the various post-primary sectors as follows: Vocational sector 134; Secondary sector 25; Community and Comprehensive sector 16.</P>
    <P>A number of concessionary posts (30.5) were also allocated for the 1988-89 session of VECs in respect of the needs of smaller vocational schools which were the only post-primary schools in their catchment areas.  Those posts were allocated by my Department on the basis of appeals from the VECs and with particular reference to school size.  All of the above posts were continued for the current session.</P>
    <P>The majority of posts in the above categories were allocated to the VEC <Col N="214" /> sector where my Department make teacher allocations on a committee-wide basis and not in respect of individual schools.</P>
    <P>The following tabular statement shows the breakdown of the posts on a county basis.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the general arrangements for the monitoring and control of public expenditure, my Department forwards detailed reports to the Department of Finance each month showing, in respect of the various subheads of the votes for which I am responsible, the allocation, the expenditure to date and the forecast of requirements each month to the end of the financial year.  As the allocations are estimates which by their nature are imprecise, these reports frequently show projected outturns for individual subheads which are different from the allocation.  Where necessary and appropriate, proposals for supplementary estimates are submitted to the Minister for Finance for introduction in the Dáil. Otherwise, the formal approval of the Minister for Finance is obtained under the <i>virement</i> arrangements.  This formal approval is obtained after the end of the year when the Appropriation Accounts are being finalised.  The Appropriation Accounts show for each subhead the amount of the Oireachtas grant, the actual expenditure and the difference. Where the difference exceeds 5 per cent, an explanatory note is appended to the account.</P>
      <P>It is now intended to obtain sanction to transfer certain moneys between subheads of the 1989 Estimates of my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
      <P>The qualification required for appointment to permanent whole-time teaching posts under a Vocational Education Committee as set out in Memorandum V.7 are</P>
      <P>`the degree of a recognised degree-awarding authority or an equivalent qualification acceptable to the Minister and the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge or an equivalent qualification in Irish'.</P>
      <P>Normally, my Department requires the same qualifications for appointment to temporary whole-time teaching posts.</P>
      <P>A proposal for the appointment of a temporary whole-time teaching post under a VEC of a person who lacks an acceptable qualification in Irish but who otherwise possesses an acceptable basic qualification may occasionally, as an exceptional matter, be sanctioned by my Department subject to the strict understanding that no fully qualified candidate is available.</P>
      <P>In the case of the particular person to whom the Deputy refers, my Department is not in a position to carry out an assessment of the person's basic qualification as specific information which I have requested on several occasions has not been supplied to my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of the payment of remuneration to vocational teachers is a matter solely for the appropriate Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <P>Approval was given in March of this year for Iarnród Éireann's proposal for upgrading the commuter service on the Dublin/Maynooth line.  This would involve an expenditure of about £0.7 million for the opening of new stations at Confey, Coolmine, Castleknock and Broomebridge.  The company were unable to proceed with the work this year because of the limited resources available to them and other priorities.</P>
      <P>The funding of Iarnród Éireann's capital programmes is a matter for the company as capital grants are not given to the CIE group.  The proposal has been included for assistance in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> and it is hoped that EC aid for the project will be forthcoming.  Iarnród Éireann will be reviewing the proposal in the light of the outcome of the application for EC assistance and the CIE non-voted capital programme for 1990, which is determined in connection with the Estimates.</P>
