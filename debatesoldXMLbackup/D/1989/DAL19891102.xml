      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  With your permission, Sir, may I ask the Taoisach if it is true, as has been reported today, that the Government have set up a new consultation mechanism with the farm organisations. If that is true does this represent a departure from the structure set up under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and, if so, why?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Department of Justice have decided to postpone the introduction of the Solicitors Act amendments which are necessary to deal with a range of matters, including legal education, on the grounds that they are awaiting a report of the Fair Trade Commission and the outcome of a Supreme Court case?  Would he not agree that any of those matters should be dealt with by way of amendment?  Would he direct the Minister for Justice to introduce this legislation speedily and not use yet another excuse to delay long-awaited legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position. The legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  The Department and the Minister are considering whether it will be necessary to await the outcome of two different matters, one is the report of the Fair Trade Commission and the other is a case which is before the courts.</P>

Are you aware that this House was grossly insulted by Mr. Gay Byrne at approximately 9.25 a.m. in the course of his radio programme when he gave out some very misleading information about the performance of this House?  I would request that the Taoiseach get a transcript of the broadcast and take necessary action on the issue.

No doubt he has a lot to consider these days but so have the rest of us and, I think the Ceann Comhairle will agree, we do need to get on with our own business. We have effectively seven working weeks left this year.

    <Title>Trustee Savings Banks Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for a comprehensive revision of the legislation governing the status and operations of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The basic legislation dates back to the year 1863 and, while there have been a number of amending provisions down through the years, the essential requirements have remained largely unchanged.  This legislation served its purposes well when the Trustee Savings Banks were simply savings institutions. In modern conditions, and particularly with the advances in banking in more recent times, the legislation is no longer adequate and severely restricts the ability of the Trustee Savings Banks to realise their proper potential and to compete as effectively as they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many years, the Trustee Savings Banks have provided a most useful service for the community.  The trustee movement was founded in the early years of the last century to provide safe repositories for small savings.  It developed a banking service which became identified with the smaller depositor and the smaller borrower and which had a special local character.  The pressures of the financial <Col N="1270" /> world have necessitated amalgamation in more recent times.  Local units could not survive and prosper independently and now they are grouped into two banks, the Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank, Dublin.  Between them these two banks have a total of 64 branches serving many local communities throughout the country and further extensions of the branch network are planned.</P>

      <P>At the end of the last financial year the total of balances due to depositors was in excess of £760 million and the number of employees was 800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks, therefore, are a substantial retail banking operation. There is undoubtedly room for considerable expansion but it is necessary in the first instance to remove existing restrictions on their activities and to give them the scope to provide a full retail banking service.  While they now provide many of the services of a commercial bank, including current accounts, loans and foreign exchange, a full service cannot be provided under the existing legislation.  The range of their activities is legally confined at present to deposit taking, making of secured loans and such activities as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, contribute to thrift.  As matters stand the Trustee Savings Banks are confined to taking deposits from and making loans to individuals only and not companies and, in the modern world, this is a very severe handicap as it does not allow them to respond adequately to business opportunities.  In addition to the restrictions relating to deposits and loans they cannot invest in new areas of financial activity, such as fund management and corporate finance.  The scale of activities is also influenced by the proportion of depositors' funds which the Minister for Finance allows the Trustee Savings <Col N="1271" /> Banks to retain.  Under present arrangements it is required that after allowing for working balances some 80 per cent of deposit funds must be lodged with the Exchequer.  The Trustee Savings Banks are paid a margin over the cost to them of these funds to meet their overheads. The balance of 20 per cent is available for lending to individuals.  At the end of the last financial year the total amount on deposit with the Exchequer was in excess of £600 million.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the Trustee Savings Banks in providing a competitive banking service in equal competition with other banking institutions.  While they are not big in banking terms, they have developed a wide retail network over the years and they have a track record of reliability and good service which should enable them to grow significantly once they are given the freedom to do so.  This Bill will allow for an extension of their activities and will allow them to respond more flexibly to the requirements of the market.  The orderly and prudent development of their business will require an agreed and gradual reduction in the proportion of their funds invested with the Exchequer.  The provision in this Bill transferring the supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank, the appropriate supervisory authority for a banking operation, will facilitate those changes.</P>
    <P>The basic trends seen in the development of savings banks in other EC member states are reflected in the current Bill.  The types of structural changes that the savings banks have been undergoing in the member states relate to amalgamation, technical innovation and changing to company status.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation process in the savings bank sector has been most strongly in evidence in France and Denmark. The savings banks in France now have a completely new structure and during 1985 and 1986 their number dropped by 70 to 395 institutions as a result of mergers.  Savings banks are significantly up-to-date with regard to the <Col N="1272" /> level of new technology they are utilising in their day-to-day banking and have, in fact, pioneered innovative areas such as card technology and data banks.  German savings banks have been particularly active in the technical field with increased computerisation and automation to increase co-operation throughout the savings bank organisation.</P>
    <P>Another direction in which European savings banks are heading is towards changing their system of organisation to that of company status.  Denmark has legislation underway which would allow individual savings banks to become joint stock companies.  In the Netherlands two of the large savings banks are about to set up a limited holding company thus enabling them to raise funds on the capital market directly.  In Britain the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1985 enacted the framework for restructuring the Trustee Savings Banks and transferring them into private ownership.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with individual sections of the Bill, there is one issue in particular which I would like to clarify and this is the question of ownership.  The Trustee Savings Banks have been founded and run under trusteeships and, because of the voluntary role of the trustees and the community service aspect of the banks' activities, ownership has never been an issue.  The broad assumption has been that they are voluntary bodies providing a community service.  The question of ownership must be considered however, if the Trustee Savings Banks are to provide a much wider banking service and if there is a likelihood that they may be reconstituted as companies.  The legal advice to me is that the Oireachtas has the power to dispose of the assets of the Trustee Savings Banks or to alter their status as it sees fit.  This power is of course subject to the condition that the rights of depositors are fully protected in relation to their deposits and interest thereon under amending legislation, in accordance with accepted practice.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the sections of the Bill item by item as much of it is self-explanatory and is simply consolidating and updating the existing legislation.  I <Col N="1273" /> propose therefore to focus on the more significant items which will affect the status of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill, which brings us up to section 8, deals with standard procedures including the laying of regulations before the Oireachtas.  I would like to make special mention of sections 5 and 6 at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with regulations to remove difficulties.  I know that a similar provision in the recent building societies legislation gave rise to some adverse reaction in its passage through the House. For that reason I would like Deputies to be quite clear on the purpose and intention of this section.</P>
    <P>The section provides that if any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into effect then the Minister is empowered to remove that difficulty by way of regulations which may also modify the legislation to such an extent as may be necessary to facilitate its enforcement. The existing Trustee Savings Bank legislation is both antiquated and labyrinthine and the present Bill is the first root and branch reform of that legislation in this State.  There is a strong possibility of unforeseen technical difficulties arising in giving effect to the provisions of the present Bill and this provision is to enable the Minister to deal with them.  This power can effectively be exercised only within the context and intentions of the present Bill.  There is no possibility of the provision being used to subvent the intention of the legislation and there are precedents for it.  I would draw the attention of the House to the time limit of three years on this section, and to the fact that, as provided in section 4 of this Bill, any regulation made under this section would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas who would have the power to annul the regulation within 21 days if they so wished.</P>
    <P>Section 6 empowers the Minister to modify provisions of this Bill by regulation to take account of relevant changes in company, banking and building society legislation.  This provision is necessary because many of the provisions contained in this Bill have originated in company, <Col N="1274" /> banking or building society legislation and Trustee Savings Bank legislation will almost inevitably require amendment in order to keep up with any changes in these areas.  Instead of having to return to the House to amend the present legislation, this provision allows the Minister to make such amendments by regulation. This in no way undermines the authority of the Oireachtas as it will only apply to legislation which has already been adopted by both Houses.  It will not involve making any new legislation. These regulations will also be subject to section 4 where they will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas which have the power to annul any regulation within 21 days after it has been placed before them.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the establishment and licensing of Trustee Savings Banks. While the establishment of new Trustee Savings Banks is highly unlikely, in view of recent trends in the financial sector, we cannot rule out this possibility in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The requirements for establishment are specified in section 9.  The fundamental condition here is the supervisory role of the trustees.  This section also removes the anachronistic limits on the activities of the Trustee Savings Banks.  In effect, they will now be empowered to carry on, in addition to their existing activities, any other financial service which the Central Bank considers prudent.  This should open the way for the Trustee Savings Banks to provide a truly modern banking service and encourage them to exploit other market opportunities.  The safeguard here for the Trustee Savings Banks, and the banking and financial sector generally, is the requirement for Central Bank approval.</P>
    <P>Another key change in regard to the Trustee Savings Banks is contained in section 10.  Up to now they have been supervised by the Department of Finance. This is unsatisfactory because the appropriate supervisory authority for a banking operation is, as I have already said, the Central Bank.  Accordingly, the supervisory function is now being transferred to the bank.  This will be a much <Col N="1275" /> more satisfactory situation where a range of financial institutions, including banks and building societies, will come under the one supervisory authority.  It will facilitate a consistent approach to supervision and is vital at a time when competition in this sector is increasing.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the trustees themselves.  The most significant point here is in sections 17 and 18 which both limit the numbers of trustees and impose an age limit.  A maximum of ten trustees and an age limit of 70 years are proposed.  These provisions are considered desirable to enable the Trustee Savings Banks to function as effectively as possible in the current dynamic marketplace. I would like to avail of this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by trustees over so many years in promoting the Trustee Savings Banks as a community service.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with supervision. Most of the sections in this part are based on the Central Bank Acts of 1971 and 1989. Perhaps the most significant provision under this heading is the power of the Central Bank to intervene and protect the depositors where it has reason to conclude that a Trustee Savings Bank will not fulfil its obligations.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the management and administration of the Trustee Savings Banks and draws heavily on the current building societies and Central Bank Acts.  It provides for the keeping of proper accounts and for the development of superannuation schemes subject to the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill is concerned with the amalgamation of the Trustee Savings Banks and the procedures to be followed. In earlier years the local Trustee Savings Banks were generally independent units but mergers became inevitable as greater efficiency of operation and greater economies of scale were required.  The new provisions relax the existing requirements for amalgamation.  Previously amalgamation took place by special resolution passed by three-fourths of the trustees.  This has now been changed to <Col N="1276" /> three-fifths, i.e. 60 per cent of trustees as opposed to 75 per cent originally.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there are now just two banks.  While they co-operate and indeed share some common facilities, there are no proposals for amalgamation at this time.  The pressures for amalgamation into one unit should continue to grow as competition intensifies and there are some obvious advantages in a pooling of resources in this manner. Amalgamation will require the prior approval of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Indeed, the passage of this Bill should itself prompt the two remaining Trustee Savings Banks to look afresh at the question of amalgamation. I would certainly not stand in the way of amalgamation if both banks were satisfied that this was in their best interests.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature of Part VII of the Bill is section 58 which provides for the re-organisation of the Trustee Savings Banks into companies.  There are no plans at present for any such reorganisation and the intention is to continue with the trusteeship arrangement.  As the Trustee Savings Banks extend their activities, however, it may be necessary to introduce a company structure to allow them greater flexibility in trading and in raising capital and to open the way for more direct links with other financial organisations.  While the trading and investment advantages would be welcome they would have to be weighed against possible disadvantages in the areas of taxation and the remuneration of the new capital.  However, in an increasingly competitive environment, we must recognise the possibility that the Trustee Savings Banks may find it necessary to become associated with larger financial groupings and some level of joint venture or even close relationship may be desirable in due course.  In this kind of situation it would in all probability be necessary in the first instance to change the trustee status.</P>
    <P>Section 58 empowers the Minister for Finance to do this by ministerial order. However, this order will have to be approved by the Oireachtas before it can take effect.  In the event, therefore, of <Col N="1277" /> proposals for a fundamental change in the structure of the Trustee Savings Banks at a future date, the Oireachtas will have the opportunity in advance to debate this change and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that much of this Bill is based on the legislation now applying to banks and other financial institutions.  In fact, much of this other legislation was in the course of updating while the present Trustee Savings Bank Bill was being drafted.  As a result of this, and of comments received and of further consideration of aspects of the Bill, I will be introducing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  In general these amendments will involve further alignment of Trustee Savings Bank legislation with current arrangements for the banks, companies and building societies.</P>
    <P>The present legislation served its purposes well as long as the Trustee Savings Banks simply fulfilled the role of savings institutions.  This is no longer an adequate role for survival and development in the modern financial system.  By comparison with the major banking institutions operating in this country the Trustee Savings Banks are small.  As the internal market of the European Community evolves and free movement of capital becomes the norm, there will be increasing competition for market space and the Trustee Savings Banks cannot afford to be handicapped by restrictive legislation.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have a great tradition.  Even with the limiting conditions imposed on them, they have made great strides in modernising their activities and extending their range of services to the community.  The present legislation opens up new frontiers for them and gives them the facility to compete on equal terms for the future.  It is now time for them to move into the mainstream of banking in an orderly and prudent manner while maintaining their distinctive characteristic of special service for the smaller depositor.  They will now be in a position to provide a full range of banking services and to expand their facilities in the confidence that they can be fully competitive.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to recognise the part played by the Trustee Savings Banks in the banking system in this country.  They have given an admirable service to, by and large, the small depositors who use their facilities. In recent years as they expanded their activities into the area of house loans for example they have provided a very effective and efficient service.  I admire their trustees and staff, who do a very good job indeed.  I make those remarks by way of introduction because I do not want anything I say now to be taken as a criticism either of the Trustee Savings Banks as institutions or the excellent people who give their time as trustees or the excellent people who staff those banks.</P>
      <P>This is the most disgraceful legislation that has ever been put before this House.  It is an attempt by the Minister to take functions which are proper to this House and to transfer to the Central Bank functions that are also proper to this House.  This Bill, while purporting to extend certain banking facilities to the Trustee Savings Banks fails to address the principal issues which the Bill should address and allows the Minister to proceed by way of regulation to deal with primary statutory issues which are the function of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know what the scope of this Bill will be because the Minister in one of the early sections, section 5, seeks to change the scope and range of the Bill at any time in any direction he likes over the next three years.  None of the fundamental issues are being addressed here.  It is a disgrace that any Department or any Minister should bring such ill-prepared legislation before the House. For quite a long time, probably for nine years, legislation to update the Acts which govern the activities of the Trustee Savings Banks has been considered.  The legislation was held up for quite a long time because it was impossible for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to reach agreement on fundamental issues.  The outstanding issues when I was in Government, were: (1) the accountability of the trustees of the Trustee <Col N="1279" /> Savings Banks to the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance; (2) the determination of interest rates paid and charged by the Trustee Savings Banks to customers; (3) interest rates and management expenses on funds placed by them with the Minister and, (4) the related question of investment of the Trustee Savings Banks' funds.  Only the first of these issues has been addressed in the Bill.  Everything else is left to be decided by the Central Bank on its own, the Minister on his own, or by consultation between the Minister and the Central Bank.  Any House of Parliament that would accept this Bill as presented, regardless of the merits of the Trustee Savings Banks as a banking system is not doing its job.  I will refer to section 4 and use the Explanatory Memorandum to illustrate my point.  Section 4 deals with the making of regulations to give full effect to the Act, the laying of such regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the giving of directions by the Central Bank to the Trustee Savings Banks.  That is a normal provision which we can accept in any Bill.  However, section 5 provides that the Minister may, if any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Bill into force, modify by regulation the relevant provision to such extent as may be necessary to bring the provision into effect.  This power will lapse after three years.  If we turn to the Bill we see that the provisions of the section are even more dramatic than one would expect from a cursory reading of the Explanatory Memorandum.  Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be <Col N="1280" /> necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid but no regulations shall be made under this section in relation to any provision of this Act after the expiration of three years commencing on the day on which the relevant provision of this Act came into operation.</P>
    <P>It also provides that no regulation can be made after three years.  Would any House of Parliament in the western world accept that provision?  If the Minister is not sure of the effect of what he is putting before us then he should pass what he is sure of and bring amending legislation back into the House if he needs to amend the Bill.  The provision whereby the Minister can change anything and everything in this Bill for a period of three years by way of regulation is a ludicrous way in which to treat the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister knows this and he tried to draw some of the teeth of the attack which he expected from the Opposition by referring to the fact that the regulations would be put before the House and the House could annul them within 21 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is all right if it is a net issue but we all know that ministerial regulations are quite detailed and the kind of set piece debate where one gets up and says &ldquo;As a matter of principle I have to vote against all these regulations&rdquo; is not the way to deal with matters of detail.  The kind of debate necessary to examine regulations is a Committee Stage type of debate.  They cannot be dealt with by simply saying &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;.  I have never seen such an outrageous provision in any Bill presented to the House by this Minister. In seeking to take the power which properly rests in these Houses, aggregating it to himself, exercising it as he sees fit and making any change which he thinks is necessary in the provisions of the Bill which is now before us                                                                                                                                 <Col N="1281" /> three years, the Minister is trying to take away from Parliament the powers which are rightly vested in Parliament.</P>
      <P>Section 6, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, &ldquo;allows the application by regulation of relevant changes in company and banking and building society law to the Trustee Savings Banks as many of the provisions of this Bill have drawn on existing and proposed legislation in these areas&rdquo;.  If something goes through in the Central Bank Bill or in the Companies Bill, which is still working its way through the House, the Minister may, with not so much as by your leave, by regulation, load the particular train which is leaving the station today with any provision he likes provided it comes from legislation which is associated with this area.  It is quite clear what has happened here.  This Bill was not ready for publication.  It was rushed out before the last election and the issues which should have been dealt with within the Department of Finance and between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank were not dealt with because there was difficulty in getting agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 12 which deals with the supervisory role of the Central Bank.  As the Minister said, at present the Department of Finance exercise a supervisory role over the Trustee Savings Banks but this is being transferred to the Central Bank, and rightly so, in the light of the Central Bank legislation. The conditions which attach to licences issued by the Central Bank are not provided for in the Bill.  The Central Bank are to be empowered to license Trustee Savings Banks.  It may be unlikely that new banks will be founded but we do not know under what conditions these licences will be issued; they are not stated in the Bill.  The Central Bank, under the power vested in them in this section, will be able to attach conditions to licences and this Parliament will not be in a position to examine them. If this Bill goes through the House and any of us put down a question to the Minister for Finance which asks him about the conditions the Central Bank are applying to a licence, we will get a <Col N="1282" /> polite letter from the Ceann Comhairle saying that the Minister cannot answer the question because the Central Bank are independent in their legislative function. It is rather like the present position where if I put a question down to the Minister about interest rates he will tell me that it is out of order because interest rates are a matter for the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>This will be the difficulty if we buy a pig in a poke here and transmit powers to the Central Bank which are not spelt out in the Bill.  We do not know what we are empowering the Central Bank to do and in future these Houses will not be able to examine what the Central Bank do because they will be independent and will not be subject to the Minister for Finance.  Consequently, the Minister for Finance cannot be held accountable for anything the Central Bank may do under section 15.  Section 16 deals with a further provision in this regard, the rules of a Trustee Savings Bank.  The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Provision is made for drawing up and altering the rules subject to the approval of the Central Bank.  As a minimum the rules must deal with the matters set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill...</P>
    <P>At least this section is not as wide as the previous sections I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Section 31 gives authority to the Central Bank to determine the ratio which shall be maintained between assets and liabilities.  That is a power proper to the Central Bank but there should be an indication in the Bill of what the ratio will be.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides &ldquo;that the trustees shall pay into a special account in the name of the Minister for Finance or invest in the purchase of Government securities such proportion of their deposits as may be determined by the Central Bank after consulting with the Minister&rdquo;.  It is worth looking at the existing arrangements to see what I find objectionable in this regard.  As I understand it, at present the Trustee Savings Banks are required to invest their depositors' funds with the Minister, who puts them <Col N="1283" /> towards financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Under the 1965 and 1969 Acts the Minister has permitted the banks to undertake the business of loans under personal bridging and mortgages and has allowed them to retain 20 per cent of their depositors' funds for this purpose.  The criteria governing the loans portfolio require that all loans must be fully secured.  I know that the Trustee Savings Banks would like this restraint to be removed, and I do not object to changes in arrangements being made, but the changes in the arrangements should be written into the Bill and we should have an opportunity to examine them in this House.  It is a further example in the Bill where the intention of the Minister is unclear and the House is being asked to allow the Minister and the Central Bank to change the arrangements about the use of depositors' funds in the Trustee Savings Banks and we do not know what the end result will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister is shaking his head and smiling in an amused fashion.  That would be great if we were in Panama and dealing with Noriega who could rule by directive. However, we happen to be in a parliamentary democracy where we do not rule by directive and fundamental changes in the law have to be dealt with in this House.  It may be inconvenient for Ministers but that is the way things are done.  By taking regulatory powers for himself and giving regulatory powers to the Central Bank the Minister is putting a package before us, the full effect of which we do not know.  Furthermore we will have very limited opportunities in this House, once the Bill goes through, to examine the regulations made by the Minister and we will have no power at all to examine the conditions laid down by the Central Bank because they will be independent in the exercise of their function.</P>
    <P>As I said section 32 provides that the trustees shall pay into a special account in the name of the Minister for Finance or invest in the purchase of Government securities such proportion of their deposits as may be determined between <Col N="1284" /> the Central Bank and the Minister.  It is very clear at the moment what the arrangement will be &mdash; 80 per cent is to be given to the Minister and 20 per cent can be used by the bank.  I am not saying that that percentage should not be 60/40, 50/50, 40/60 the other way or even 20/80 the other way.  I am happy with any reasonable arrangement which stands up and can be examined, but I am not happy where the Minister is saying we are moving away from the existing arrangement of 80/20 and the Minister and the Central Bank will make an arrangement about what the new situation will be.  We are being asked to hand over the power to the Minister and the Central Bank to do that.  I do not believe that is the way to legislate.</P>
    <P>I move to section 58.  The Minister says that at some future time it may be appropriate to set up the Trustee Savings Banks as companies and to arrange for the transfer of all assets and liabilities to the new companies.  The Minister, in the section, seeks the power to do this by putting a draft order before the House. Now he says that the movement towards companies would be in line with what is happening internationally, and he refers to Denmark which has legislation under way which would allow individual savings banks to become joint stock companies. In the Netherlands, two of the large savings banks are about to set up a limited holding company thus enabling them to raise funds on the capital market directly. In Britain, the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1985, enacted a framework for restructuring the Trustee Savings Banks and transferring them into private ownership. That is fair enough.  We know they were out of line with international practice; but in the three examples given by the Minister, it was the Parliaments of those countries that made the arrangements by primary legislation.  The Minister is not coming into this House and providing us with a framework to enable the Trustee Savings Banks to set up as companies.  He is asking that he would be allowed, by draft order, to change the legal status of the Trustee Savings Banks to enable them to incorporate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> I repeat it lest anybody has any doubt about the matter, I have only admiration for the Trustee Savings Banks, but they deserve a better Bill which could be examined fully and in detail by the Houses of the Oireachtas in a manner which would enable everybody to know what exactly we are doing.  In most of the key areas of this Bill we do not know what we are doing.  We are being asked to give power to the Minister to make fundamental changes and we do not know the detail of those changes.  In other sections we are being asked to give power to the Central Bank to make fundamental changes and we do not know the nature of those changes.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would, at the end of Second Stage, refer in particular to section 59.  According to the Explanatory Memorandum this requires that the Trustee Savings Banks may not be designated or described in any manner which implies that the Government or the Central Bank are liable to depositors for money placed with the banks.  I was under the impression that one of the attractions of the Trustee Savings Banks at the moment was that everything on deposit by the smallest saver was under-written by the Government.  I remember a particular incident when the rumour factory which can be so damaging caused a situation where there were large scale withdrawals one morning from the Trustee Savings Bank.  The Minister's predecessor, the present leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Alan Dukes, as Minister for Finance, went on the 1.30 p.m. news on radio and said that depositors need have no fear because the Trustee Savings Banks are fully under-written by the Government and if there was any problem with the Trustee Savings Banks the Government were fully under-writing, down to the last penny, any money that was on deposit.  Now the Minister is writing into a Bill, without explanation either here or in his speech, that in future the Trustee Savings Banks may not be designated or described in any manner which implies that the Government or the Central Bank are liable to depositors for <Col N="1286" /> money placed with the banks.  If the Minister was presenting a corpus of legislation which spelled out in detail what the new arrangements would be, if we were clear what the conditions of the licence were, if we were clear on the scope of the Bill, if we knew how interest rates would be arrived at, if we knew how depositors' investments would be invested, if we knew all that we could truly say that there would be very little risk to the deposits of any investor in the Trustee Savings Banks because they would be following the same rules as the Associated Banks which have a marvellous record with only two cases in the history of the State where there has been any default.</P>
    <P>Sticking like a rock out of smooth water, we have section 59 where the Minister is saying in future the Trustee Savings Banks cannot describe themselves in any fashion which would suggest that depositors' savings are under-written by the Central Bank or by the Government. In the context of this poorly framed legislation, that is an outrage because it leaves depositors without the plank they had under them, with the safety net removed, and it is going to be a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, by regulation, to put another plank in place, and the people who are entrusted to make these arrangements in this House are not being given the information necessary to ascertain whether this is in the depositors' interests.</P>
    <P>I would like now to move to the question of how interest rates will be arrived at.  As I understand it, the Trustee Savings Banks are at present authorised to operate ordinary and investment deposit accounts.  They pay a single rate of interest on both accounts.  This was the position when I was in Government.  If things have changed since then, perhaps the Minister would inform me.  This rate is linked to the rates payable by the Minister to the banks for moneys invested with him under each account.  In addition, the Minister pays 1.65 per cent of moneys deposited with him in order to cover the Trustee Savings Banks' management expenses.  That was clear.  Everybody, the <Col N="1287" /> trustees, the depositors, the management and the Minister, knew where they stood. The arrangement was transparent.  That is now to go; but what is to be the new situation?  The Central Bank will decide at some future date what mechanism will be put in place to decide interest rates. The Bill does not say that this will be the same mechanism as the Central Bank applies to the Associated Banks at the moment.  If that were the case then we would say the Minister is merely bringing us into line with every other bank.  The Minister is not saying that; he is saying that the Central Bank will be empowered, at some future date, to make arrangements for the striking of interest rates, he is also saying that the present arrangements will no longer exist.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  I do not believe fundamental changes should be made in matters like this without the House being informed what those arrangements are.  This Bill is far too vague in all the areas I have referred to.  I know it has been difficult to get agreement between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  I know there was fundamental disagreement on the whole area of supervision &mdash; to a large extent, the section which deals with supervision has been worked out and at least 80 per cent of what is agreed is on the face of the Bill &mdash; but there are other areas where the disagreements between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank are still outstanding.  Rather than sitting down and working out these disagreements the Minister has decided to put sections into the Bill which have the effect of allowing him and the Central Bank to work out the difficulties which are still unresolved subsequent to the passing of this Bill.  That is not the way to legislate.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Minister has done this.  He has announced on a number of occasions that he wants to get through the House a corpus of legislation dealing with the financial institutions.  He wants the Bills running if not in tandem at least in parallel.  The Central Bank Bill has gone through as has the Companies Bill <Col N="1288" /> and now we have the Trustees Saving Banks Bill.  I agree with the Minister's intent but in rushing to fulfil a commitment when the ground work has not been completed, the Minister has done a disservice to himself and to the House.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to the Trustee Savings Banks being put on the same level playing field as the Associated Banks and the building societies or to allowing the Trustee Savings Banks to trade and engage in those activities which are proper to banks.  That would allow them be competitive, to act in the best interests of their depositors, to act in the best interests of their customers and to allow them, to act, ultimately, in the best interest of the country.  I have the utmost admiration for the Trustee Savings Banks but the Bill does them a singular disservice. It is a disgrace to the Department which produced it, to the Minister who put it before the Government and to the Government that waved it through.  It would be a disgrace to the House if we passed it as drafted.  My party will be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential problem with the Bill, as the Labour Party see it and as highlighted by the Minister in his speech, is that it raises the crucial question regarding the ownership of the Trustee Savings Banks.  That question is raised in the Bill and it was raised by the Minister in his speech but we did not get an answer.  The important factor of the ownership of the Trustee Savings Bank was shied away from, ignored and pushed to one side.  There may be a sinister reason that was done and I will refer to it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Trustee Savings Banks, as I understand it, is that for practical purposes there are no beneficial owners.  It is called a trusteeship, and the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; appear frequently in the Bill.  What is a trustee? A trustee is a person who holds property on behalf of a person or a number of people.  For whom do the trustees of the Trustees Savings Banks hold the assets of the banks?  The Minister raised that question in the course of his speech when <Col N="1289" /> he said that the question of ownership must be considered.  I agree with that comment but the Minister did not say anything further about that matter.  The Minister went on to say that the legal advice given to him was that the Oireachtas has power to dispose of the assets of the Trustees Savings Banks or to alter their status as it sees fit.  I should like to say, with all humility, that I totally agree with the legal advice given to the Minister on this issue.  I agree that the Oireachtas has full power to dispose of the assets of the Trustees Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party say that now is the time, when we are processing this Bill, to deal with the question of ownership.  I will tell the House, succinctly, what we say should be done about the ownership of the Trustees Savings Banks.  The ownership of the Trustees Savings Banks should be taken into the public domain on a permanent basis and the Minister should use the Bill to do that.  The Trustees Savings Banks should be owned by the people who in a vague, theoretical way, own them, if one is to accept the legal advice given to the Minister.  That advice is that the assets are at the disposal of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Trustees Savings Banks ought to be taken right away into formal 100 per cent public ownership, given full powers to deal with all financial matters that banks and their subsidiaries deal with, given power to compete at least on equal terms with the cartel banks, given power to have building society type subsidiaries, given power to have merchant bank type subsidiaries, given power to have insurance association, stockbroking subsidiaries and to engage in other financial activities conducted by the cartel banks. That would be a wonderful advancement for financial services here.  It would be wonderful to have a State bank, owned by the people, in a position to compete on a level pitch with the cartel, the members of which do not compete with one another.  They have the financial setup closely carved out for themselves without any real competition.  What wonderful opportunities would be presented to the people of Ireland if they had their <Col N="1290" /> own State bank that could compete here and abroad after 1992.  It would be wonderful if we had a State owned bank that had the full support of the State and could operate in Britain and in Europe after 1992.  This is a golden opportunity but it has not been taken up by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend doing in regard to ownership?  It is all very strange and there is a sinister element about his intentions.  In the Bill the Minister gives himself power to authorise the formation of the Trustees Savings Banks into a company of which either the Minister can be the sole owner, as I suggest he should be, or, alternatively, he can offer it to the private sector.  It appears that the Minister has left both options open to himself.  That is the nub of what the Government, and the Minister, are about on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said it was difficult to know what was being done about the Bill but I can enlighten him, I can give him the information he seeks.  In my opinion we are laying the groundwork for the privatisation of the Trustees Savings Banks.  The Minister is gearing himself up and preparing the powers for himself to do a Thatcher operation on the Trustees Savings Banks.  He has looked across the Irish Sea with some approval as have his Coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats.  In fact, they would, if possible, give greater approval for such a move.  The intention in the medium term is to privatise this national asset and sell off this magnificent potential for the Irish people to their friends, their backers and supporters in the private sector.  That is what this is all about.  I see no commitment to the contrary from the Minister in his opening speech on this Bill.  I await with interest, when he replies to the debate, a commitment to this House that in no way will the Trustees Savings Banks be privatised, that the Minister recognises they are a valuable public asset with immense potential for the people and that he intends to preserve that for the people in the interests of the people. I look forward to an assurance that not 5 per cent, not 10 per cent, nor even 1 per cent of these banks will be allowed fall <Col N="1291" /> into the hands of the private sector creditors who, with the usual greed the private sector has, have their eye on any worthwhile public institution in any field that has tremendous potential, in this case in the financial sector.  That is where this House has to be watchful and mindful of the intent here and of what the clear pointers and indicators are.  Otherwise, why this vagary?  Why not meet the challenge of the Trustees Savings Banks? Why say in a speech that the question of ownership has to be considered, then signally fail to consider it?  That is why Deputy Noonan is puzzled and wonders what we are about on this Bill.  There is good reason for his puzzlement and that is why the veil of uncertainty has been thrown over the powers the Minister is arrogating to himself as far as the Trustees Savings Banks are concerned.</P>
    <P>The message of the Labour Party to the Minister on this issue can be given loud and clear here and now and will be repeated on many occasions.  So far as the private sector, the Minister's and the Government's and the PDs' friends in the private sector and their banking creditors are concerned, I say, hands off the Trustee Savings Banks.  They are public property and must remain in the public domain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised questions, and I support him, about some details in the Bill dealing with the powers the Minister is taking and the question of regulations. Everything he said is true.  It is outrageous that one should be presented with a Bill which purports to give any Minister power to modify an Act of the Oireachtas.  When one stops and thinks about that for a moment the enormity of the concept proposed there is quite frightening, that the Minister by regulation takes upon himself the power to modify an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is not the purpose of ministerial regulations, I say with respect.  Ministerial regulations indeed have a very important role in our constitutional system.  It is quite in order for a Bill and an Act to say the Minister may have power through <Col N="1292" /> regulation to put into effect certain matters of detail that are needed on a particular subject.  There is nothing wrong with that, but it is breaking new and highly dangerous ground to say the Minister has power to modify an Act of this Parliament.  As I remember reading many years ago when I was studying constitutional law, that kind of concept was known as the Henry VIII clause.  It is dictatorial.  Why bother bringing in a Bill with 46 pages at all?  Why not just bring in a three line Bill saying the Minister may have power by regulation to do whatever he wants to do so far as the Trustee Savings Banks are concerned and let him do the whole thing by regulation?</P>

      <P>It is quite outrageous.  I hope sincerely that the House will not buy that and I appeal to the Minister to think about it again.</P>
      <P>The statement the Minister makes, that there are protective purposes involved with the 21 days, the resolution of the House and so on, is a pretty poor apology for this pair of sections.  The Fine Gael Party at least have an opportunity to put down a motion to revoke regulations and so on.  The Labour Party to a very small extent only have the opportunity to do that, The Workers' Party to an even smaller extent and other Members of the House not at all.  Certainly the smaller parties in the House have no opportunity to put down motions to revoke regulations the Minister is there proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the Trustee Savings Banks have done a fine job under the structures they have had up to now when they have been subject to the supervision of the Minister for Finance.  I was a little surprised at the reference in the Minister's speech to the effect that until now they have been authorised to deal only with private individuals and not with companies.  Probably they have been ignoring that, perhaps to some appreciable extent, because I am personally aware of one case where quite substantial loans were made to a building and <Col N="1293" /> development company who got themselves into difficulties.  The Trustee Savings Bank may have some difficulty in getting their money back in that case. If it was done in one case probably it was done in hundreds if not thousands of others.  It raises the question of the degree and type of supervision the Minister has been in effect imposing on the Trustee Savings Banks if they are breaking the rules so frequently in that regard.  One wonders what kind of supervision it is. However, I am perfectly happy&mdash;indeed delighted &mdash; to see the Trustee Savings Banks will be given a free hand in the financial business they can do.</P>
    <P>On the question of the supervision of these banks, and indeed other banks and other financial institutions, whether it be the Minister who supervises them or whether it be the Central Bank that supervises them, it is a fair proposition that when an institution such as the Central Bank has or is given the power and responsibility to supervise an institution &mdash; they should have that power &mdash; they should be obliged to do that job properly and effectively.  If they do not and if any member of the public or a depositor loses as a result of the failure of the Central Bank or the Minister to do their supervision job in a proper manner, they ought to be responsible and legally liable to compensate such a person.  Everybody else in society is responsible if he fails to carry out his duties in a proper manner. Why then should the Minister write into the Bill powers for the Central Bank to supervise and yet allow an evasion of their responsibility if anything goes wrong and they have not done their job in a proper manner?</P>
    <P>Likewise in so far as the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks are concerned, the Minister is giving them an out in respect of responsibility.  If the Minister is purporting to upgrade their status, to provide that they be paid salaries now &mdash; which I understand they were not paid before &mdash; they should be responsible and liable to carry out their task in a proper manner and be personally responsible if they fail to do so.  I do not think that unreasonable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Talking about the trustees brings me back to the ownership question.  The Minister is going to soldier on, it would appear, with this system of having the banks run by these trustees.  Was ever a more undemocratic institution conceived of with the degree of power these trustees have?  No mention has been made here this morning yet as to how these trustees are appointed.  Where do they come from?  Who are these people, these trustees of the savings banks?  How do they get there?  Who put them there and under what circumstances?  How do new ones get appointed?  As I understand it they are self-perpetuating bodies.  When a vacancy occurs in the number of trustees as a result of the death or retirement of a member, the bank themselves bring in the new person, some friend, buddy or whatever.  Who knows what experience they have?  Who knows whether they are suitable people?  Where is the democratic answerability to anybody in the community?  Where is the democratic control to be exercised over this body of trustees?  I am sure they are a fine body of men and women.  I do not know who they are, I do not know any of them, but when one is controlling £750 million worth of deposits &mdash; as appears to be the situation here &mdash; there must be democratic accountability to someone and the Minister makes no provision for that anywhere in the Bill.  He is soldiering on with the same totally unacceptable, unsatisfactory system.  Certainly he is providing that the amount of the emoluments and salaries that will now be payable to the trustees have to be put up on their accounts and put on show in the bank's premises thanks very much, I am sure that is a tremendous help &mdash; but it might conceivably be a help if we had somebody monitoring that situation. There is nobody to do that because the Minister is providing no proper forum of ownership.  He has evaded the whole ownership position and that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In one sense I am complaining about the wideness of the power the Minister is taking upon himself in sections 5 and 6 to be able to amend the Bill, but in another <Col N="1295" /> sense I am complaining that he is not taking sufficient power to himself to cope with ownership in a direct and positive manner.  I am puzzled about one aspect of section 58 &mdash; the key section &mdash; which deals with the power to change the Trustee Savings Banks into companies.  It seems to me &mdash; and I will be interested to hear the Minister's comment &mdash; that there is a discrepancy or a variation, unusually, between the text of the Bill and the format of the Explanatory Memorandum. I do not know whether one was changed at a later stage or what the reason for it is, but it seems that the wording of section 58 gives power to the Minister to authorise the reorganisation of one or more of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The implication there is that the reorganisation would have to originate from the Trustee Savings Bank itself and if it did, then the Minister could authorise it whereas the thrust of the Explanatory Memorandum would suggest that the Minister is being given power, as stated on page 5, to reorganise the Trustee Savings Bank into companies and so on. There is a very important difference there: whether the Minister may take the lead to carry out the reorganisation or only authorise it when it comes from the Trustee Savings Bank.  I would prefer the wording in the Explanatory Memorandum to that in the Bill and I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is part of the general banking sector and references have been made to other legislation that will go through, the control and role of the Central Bank and so on.  There are certain unsatisfactory situations in the banking system at present which ought to be dealt with in this Bill so far as the Trustee Savings Banks are concerned and, perhaps, in other legislation as well dealing with the other banking systems.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one point which causes me and many other people considerable difficulty.  It involves the Central Bank which has a key role to play in the Trustee Savings Banks.  It concerns the activities and roles of many of the <Col N="1296" /> merchant banks that operate in Ireland at present.  For some reason that escapes me, any bank that is registered as a bank with the Central Bank is exempt from complying with the provisions of the Moneylenders Acts.  That is entirely wrong particularly where the merchant banks are concerned.  The merchant banks, hire purchase companies and so on, are registered as banks with the Central Bank and consequently are exempt from tbe provisions, requirements and protective measures to consumers that are given under the Moneylenders Acts.  One aspect of that, in particular, concerns me and that is the requirement that lending institutions be it a Trustee Savings Bank, one of the cartel banks or a merchant bank are obligated to make clear on their loan agreements the true rate of interest.  I would like to see measures introduced in this Bill to cover that issue so far as the Trustee Savings Banks and the other lending institutions are concerned.  Moneylenders under the Moneylenders Act are obligated to do that and any loan agreement that does not comply is void.  Merchant banks in their present loan agreements and hire purchase type transactions are not doing that.  They are putting down the interest at 2.3 per cent a month and many unfortunate people get trapped into thinking that that is a low rate of interest whereas, in fact, it is something like 33, 34 or 35 per cent.  It comes as a pretty rude shock when they find that out.  That is a disgrace and an outrage and if that is the kind of activity that the Central Bank allows to continue here, then I am fearful for the role being given to them to control the activites of the Trustee Savings Banks.  That is something the Minister ought to look into very carefully.  I will be looking into possible amendments on that issue along those lines.</P>
    <P>However, to conclude on my principal initial point, the Labour Party will be tabling very substantial amendments to this Bill if it passes Second Stage.  The thrust of our amendments will be to ensure that the Trustee Savings Banks will be taken in a proper, final and formal <Col N="1297" /> manner into public ownership, that they will be given full power to compete with the cartel banks, that they will remain in public ownership for the benefit of the people, that they will be empowered to expand their activities here and outside this country and that the profits and benefits which they will achieve &mdash; freed from the restrictions which they have experienced &mdash; will be, to a major extent, for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party have very serious reservations about this Bill.  It is being presented as a simple measure to provide for an extension of the Trustee Savings Banks range of activities but actually appears to be a back door device to facilitate the privatisation or, at least, the partial privatisation of these banks.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is a particularly ominous inclusion given that it seeks to give the Minister power to alter the legislation in order to facilitate whatever the purpose &mdash; either transparent or hidden &mdash; in this Bill.  It seeks to give him the power to do anything&mdash;</P>
      <P>...which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing the provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is odd about this regulation and the Minister was serious about not giving this House the right to refuse him particular powers to change the Bill &mdash; is that he could have, at least, introduced a provision under the regulations where positive regulations would have to be made. In other words, a regulation would have to be placed before the House and approved, before it would be implemented.  Instead the Minister is seeking to have this power and the usual negative regulation where unless it is rescinded by the House within 21 days of having been made, it then becomes law. <Col N="1298" /> I have argued on many occasions in this House against that type of regulation.  It is all right in relation to a number of minor matters of detail, but in a situation like this where the Minister is seeking to change the legislation, not simply to implement it, it is not appropriate that that should be done.  It is not appropriate in any event that it should be done by way of the 21 day negative type regulation.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House in 1982 no such annulling motion has ever been taken by this House despite the fact that I have tried to move a number of them on social welfare matters.  The reality is that unless an Opposition party put down a motion in Private Members' time, then such a motion cannot be taken.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan has already pointed out, even that procedure is inadequate because it is a set piece debate which does not permit the kind of teasing out of regulations which would be possible if there was a committee type debate on the regulations.  Indeed, if the Minister wants to change any legislation he should be obliged to come back to this House with a new Bill to have such changes debated and teased out as we will this Bill over the next few weeks. The whole intention of the Bill is suspect because section 5 will effectively give a free hand to the Minister to do what he chooses in regard to how this Bill will be implemented and how it may be altered during the course of its implementation over at least the first three years of its life.  We will be vigorously opposing that section if the Bill passes Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Any legislative measure affecting a bank requires the most careful possible consideration by the Oireachtas.  Banks play a crucial role in the economy and decisions made by them have a direct impact &mdash; not just on their own customers but also often on hundreds of thousands of workers in firms whose lives and employment prospects can be directly affected by decisions made on interest rates and credit policy.  Real control of an economy requires effective public control of banks, and that is true whether we are <Col N="1299" /> talking of the Irish economy or the wider European economy.  Indeed, it will be a matter of debate in the not too distant future in relation to how monetary union will be implemented, what control the Central Bank will have and how they will be made answerable to national governments or the European Community generally.</P>
    <P>In this country there is little public control of the banks with the result that there is only limited public control over the economy.  The most striking example of this is the way in which Government Ministers can disclaim all responsibility for interest and mortgage rates, although these matters can directly impact on the living standards of hundreds of thousands of householders and the job security and employment prospects of many workers. What we want to see is more public control of the banks, but the purpose of this Bill seems designed to reduce public control over the one limited area where there is at present some element of accountability.</P>
    <P>We should not make the mistake of thinking that in this Bill we are dealing with some minor or insignificant part of the banking system.  The Trustee Savings Banks are big business.  If the two existing Trustee Savings Banks were merged they would form the fourth biggest bank in the State.  Between them they have 63 branches around the country with total assets of some £800 million, employing more than 700 staff.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Trustee Savings Banks have successfully expanded and developed their business.  There is much public goodwill towards the Trustee Savings Banks.  Many people, who need the services of a bank but who do not wish to contribute even further to the obscene profits of the commercial banks, place their accounts with the Trustee Savings Banks because of their non-profit taking status.  The Trustee Savings Banks have been imaginative and innovative. They were, I believe, the first banks to be computerised.  Unlike the other banks they open at hours which seem to be designed to suit the customer rather than <Col N="1300" /> the banks.  A recent Consumers' Association of Ireland survey showed that on a whole range of charges for bank services the Trustee Savings Banks compared very favourably with the other banks.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it must also be said that there is an extraordinary aura of secrecy surrounding the operation of the Trustee Savings Banks.  Their legislative origins go back to the 1860s.  Very little information is available about the ownership and control of the Trustee Savings Banks and the whole question of the role of the trustees &mdash; how they operate and how they are appointed &mdash; seems shrouded in mystery.  No information of this nature is given to account holders and their annual reports are similarly unhelpful, giving only a list of the names of the trustees but no details of their background or role.  There is virtually no information in the reports of the Central Bank on the role of the Trustee Savings Banks, and up to yesterday there was not even a copy of an annual report of either of the Trustee Savings Banks available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The question of the present ownership of the Trustee Savings Banks is crucial. Who owns them?  Is it the depositors, the trustees or the Government?  When legislation similar to this was going through the House of Commons a few years back in relation to the British Trustee Savings Banks, the same issue arose. Who owned them?  There the question eventually went to the Law Lords who ruled that the Government owned them, much to the annoyance and embarrassment of the Thatcher Government, which then promptly privatised them.</P>
    <P>It would seem that we are heading in the same direction here.  That is the only reasonable interpretation that can be put on section 58 of this Bill.  Let me quote from the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 58 gives authority to the Minister for Finance to reorganise the Trustee Savings Banks into companies and to arrange for transfer of all assets and liabilities to the new companies. The Minister may make a draft order                                                                                                                              <Col N="1301" /> to give effect to any such reorganisation and the order shall not have effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The new companies may be under the control of the Minister or some other person.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this section if it is not to facilitate privatisation?</P>
    <P>There are other serious implications of the Bill also.  Under section 30 of the Finance Act, 1940, a major portion of the money deposited with the Trustee Savings Banks, amounting I understand to about 80 per cent of the total, is lodged to a special account in the name of the Minister for Finance.  Put simply, the money is &ldquo;on-lent&rdquo; to the Exchequer, and at a very favourable rate of interest. Indeed, just this week the Minister for Finance made an order specifying the rate of interest to be charged on this account at a very attractive 6.9 per cent. Having this money available has saved the Government having to borrow it at normal interest rates.  In the case of the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank the money &ldquo;on-lent&rdquo; in this way in 1988 amounted to more than £300 million.</P>
    <P>However, under section 32 of this Bill the amount to be deposited in the Minister's account, or invested in Government securities, is to be determined by the Central Bank, after consultation with the Minister.  This would appear to suggest that the portion of the Trustee Savings Bank deposits which will be made available to the Exchequer will drop below the current level.  If this is so, then the Exchequer will have to seek that cash elsewhere, paying normal rates of interest.  Despite the statement in the Explanatory Memorandum that there will be no additional cost to the Exchequer arising from this Bill, this move could result in a significant additional cost or loss to the public purse.</P>
    <P>Another area on which we have grave reservations is the question of transferring responsibility for supervising the Trustee Savings Banks from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank.  In <Col N="1302" /> theory giving the Central Bank supervisory powers over all the banks as well as the building societies should be a good idea, but in practice it has not been effective at all.  The Central Bank have failed totally to exercise any real control over the commercial banks.  They have failed to live up to the obligations placed on them by the 1942 Central Bank Act to ensure that in matters of credit policy, the interests of the community as a whole should predominate.  Given the predominance on the board of the Central Bank of representatives of private profit in general, and the commercial banks in particular, it has not been clear if the Central Bank are controlling the commercial banks or the commercial banks controlling the Central Bank.  The claim made by the American economist, Milton Friedman, that regulatory bodies are generally captured by those they seek to regulate has certainly been true of the relationship between the commercial banks and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Last year responsibility for supervising the building societies was transferred to the Central Bank, but they failed at the very first test only this week, when they shamelessly failed to take any action to prevent the building societies from increasing their mortgage rates in excess of the 1 per cent general increase in interest rates for which the bank had signalled their approval.  Handing responsibility over to the Central Bank also removes any element of accountability to the people through the Dáil. Ministers are able to disclaim any responsibility for decisions which can have a major bearing on economic policy and Dáil questions on matters of legitimate public interest ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the mystery surrounding the manner of appointment of the trustees at present.  This Bill is not much more forthcoming in this regard. Section 17 tells us that there is to be not more than ten and not fewer than five trustees for each Trustee Savings Bank. Section 18 tells us that they cannot be aged over 70, and section 19 tells us that bankrupts and convicted crooks are ruled out.  But nowhere is there any guidance <Col N="1303" /> given as to what qualifications, background, or experience the trustees should have.  Neither are there any details in the Bill as to the manner of their selection. This is to be provided for in the rules of the Trustee Savings Banks, which will have to be approved by the Central Bank. One significant change is that while the payment of fees to trustees has, up to this, been prohibited, they will now be paid what are delicately referred to as &ldquo;honoraria&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor in making a point in relation to the trustees referred to the men and women of the Trustee Savings Banks doing a good job.  I have no doubt that the trustees in general do a good job, but looking through the 1988 annual report of the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank I note that there are 23 trustees who are all men.  There are two vice chairpersons who are men, one chairperson who is a man and a chief executive and a general manager, both men.  I do not know the proportions in relation to the rest of staff but certainly there are no women among those running the Trustee Savings Bank in Dublin.  Perhaps that is something to which we should address ourselves when dealing with this Bill to ensure that fair and equal treatment is given to all sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I am sure, as Deputy Mervyn Taylor said, that the people who have been acting as trustees up to this have been fine people, acting in the best interests of their customers and the public in general. What I am concerned about is that in the absence of specific provisions in the legislation regarding the manner of their selection, together with the changes in the status of the Trustee Savings Banks and the introduction of fees for trustees, we will have the development of a self-perpetuating, controlling clique, similar to those who run the building societies, drawing huge fees and expenses, and who will not be responsible nor answerable to anyone.</P>
    <P>Among those who will be most directly affected by this Bill are the Trustee Savings Bank employees.  What consultation has there been with them?  Who <Col N="1304" /> speaks for the Trustee Savings Bank workers, most of whom I understand are not even in a trade union?  Have they no rights in regard to those proposed changes?  I would ask the Minister, when replying to this debate, to say what consultation, if any, there has been with Trustee Savings Bank workers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to repeat that The Workers' Party are not hostile to the Trustee Savings Banks.  On the contrary, we admire the work they have done in trying to give the public a banking service without extracting obscene profits from their customers, and want to see them expanded and developed.  But why can this not be done without changing their non-profit taking status and opening up the way for their eventual privatisation?</P>
    <P>We will oppose this Bill on Second Stage.  If it gets through as I am sure it will, with the support of the Progressive Democrats, we will introduce some major significant amendments on Committee Stage to try to ensure that the Trustee Savings Banks do not change their nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as it proposes to unfetter the Trustee Savings Banks and allow them to trade freely in the banking business and provide a fully comprehensive service but the welcome is conditional because the Minister also proposes to retain certain arbitrary powers which go beyond what he should expect this House to give him in terms of regulations he can make in order to virtually change the operation of the Bill entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have given a tremendous, fairly competitive service over the years.  It is important that they provided a banking system which was accessible during working hours and afterwards and which provided an alternative so that small investors could readily invest.  Small investors and first time house purchasers could do business on a one to one basis with somebody who was prepared to give them full consideration whereas other institutions of a similar nature were not prepared to deal in that way.  We should welcome any <Col N="1305" /> proposal to improve the scope of the services the bank are providing now or are likely to provide in future.</P>
    <P>The approach of 1992 with computerisation, competition and so on means that financial services will continue to be affected and the Trustee Savings Banks will not be untouched.  We must expect changes in legislation.  An essential role already established by the Trustee Savings Banks is that they were able to compete and provide an alternative service not entirely under the umbrella of the other larger financial institutions.  They had to work within certain guidelines and were strongly controlled by the Minister for Finance in relation to the amount of depositors' funds they could retain and so on but nevertheless they appeared to the small investor to be independent and in some way more accessible and more prepared to listen to problems.  With the necessary change in legislation due to the approach of 1992 I hope we do not see a demise of that kind of competition and of that sort of attitude.  That would be very undesirable from the point of view of the country, our economy and the people, particularly small investors, the sort of people who for instance are purchasing a house for the first time.  In recent times it has not been at all unusual for people to go to four, five or six financial institutions without success but if they were lucky enough to have a Trustee Savings Bank branch in their area where they were making regular deposits, they could have their problems solved by them.  The competitive element and the independent air should remain.  This legislation should not result in the Trustee Savings Banks being rolled into the huge amorphous mass that is the financial services in Europe.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell too much on the track record of the Trustee Savings Banks but it needs to be stated in order to consider what our attitude to the proposed changes should be in the future.  Deputy De Rossa referred to privatisation.  I would have no difficulty with privatisation provided competition remained.  That is the kernel from the <Col N="1306" /> point of view of the investor or the customer. It is only when competition disappears that problems arise.  For that reason it is immaterial whether an institution is controlled by the State through the Central Bank or directly by the Minister or by private trustees as long as the customer at the end of the day gets a fair service and the Trustee Savings Banks are not rolled into a mass where a huge impersonal organisation can emit whatever they wish at whatever time.  That would be totally unacceptable but unfortunately it is a characteristic of financial services at the present time and it will obviously become more so in future.</P>
    <P>In comparison with other track records the Trustee Savings Banks have not been as avaricious as have other banking institutions with regard to service charges. That is a facet of their operations I should like to see maintained so that people could go to a particular banking institution expecting a somewhat better deal when making a small investment or whatever.  The public are entitled to that facility.  Indeed I would contend that to some extent the growth of the Trustees Savings Banks over the past 20 years has been consequent on the maintenance of that type of service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the matter of the various interest rates applicable at present, referring to various quotations from financial institutions appearing to offer very attractive lending rates.  One discovers, at the end of the day, that the actual rate charged very often is vastly different from that projected in the various glossy brochures emanating from these financial institutions.  With interest rates rising at present this aspect comes into focus.  As has often been said in this House before, in difficult times when high interest rates obtain, any banking customer, whether a private individual or one owning a company, running a business or whatever, who gets into any difficulty and moves on the wrong side of the banking institutions, when tripped for a number of repayments or whatever, will then find himself with a serious problem on hand.  This means the prevailing interest rates overtake him, he <Col N="1307" /> finds himself on the downhill and cannot extricate himself.  It is as if a mechanism were tripped which begins with the inevitable ticking of a clock.  In turn this means one can set a time limit on the demise of a company from the date they are unable to meet three or four repayments at a crucial stage of their operations, when interest rates take over and pre-determine the outcome.  I make that comment as an aside from the general provisions of this Bill.  Nonetheless it is no harm to remember that possibly unfair advertising legislation is being transgressed on account of the fact that very attractive interest rates appear to be offered by financial institutions with regard to loans.  One discovers that, probing somewhat deeper, reading the small print &mdash; particularly by those people well used to dealing with these institutions &mdash; leads to a quick determination that those interest rates are not at all as indicated but rather lead to gross repayments over a number of years that are vastly in excess of those indicated in glossy brochures.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the amalgamation and rationalisation of banking institutions, referred to in the course of the Minister's remarks.  I suppose this process is inevitable.  It affects the Trustee Savings Banks and, already, there have been indications of amalgamations in that area both here and throughout Europe.  I suppose we cannot reverse that process.  Here I must revert to my original fear with regard to elimination of competition. If all of the similar services throughout Europe are amalgamated one then has to deal with the one institution only whereas, previously, one might have had redress to five, six or even more. Approximately 20 or 30 years ago there were here approximately six to eight independent banking institutions.  This meant that if a customer was not satisfied with one he or she could go to another. It was not true that a customer always played one off against another and always won.  All of us in this House and outside it are well aware that very seldom does the customer win in such circumstances. <Col N="1308" /> Nonetheless there was then a variety of services available to the customer.  After amalgamation and rationalisation we ended up with three banking groups. More recently there was a slight fragmentation when another banking group appeared on the horizon and appear to be nudging somewhat into the competitive area, an attractive and necessary prospect.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the whole question of amalgamation and rationalisation in banking terms, resulting from this much needed development of allowing the Trustee Savings Banks additional scope, I hope we would not see them overtaken by another set of rules, principles or machinery, rolled into the system, so that they became distanced from their present clientele.  While the provisions of the Bill are necessary and desirable we need to be careful in that one area.  The provisions of the Bill allow greater scope to the Trustee Savings Banks.  I hope that will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>I come now to the anomalous sections, sections 5 and 6, but particularly section 6 to which the Minister referred at some length in the course of his introductory remarks.  If the Bill is as important as we are led to believe and is worthy of discussion in this House them major changes likely to take place at a later stage equally should be worthy of similar discussion or mandate from this House. I do not accept the Minister's contention that time will be of the essence, that it would be unnecessary and undesirable to have to come back to the House to change regulations in order to meet circumstances as they arise.  That applies to all legislation and particularly to the provisions of this Bill.  I see no reason the Minister should not be expected to revert to this House, seeking an additional mandate if he proposes to travel down that road.  The powers of regulation always have been contentious.  They may be acceptable in some instances in which no major debate may arise from a ministerial decision at any given time.  In other words, if the degree of change the Minister wishes to impose is not such as to put an entirely different complexion on <Col N="1309" /> any given operation &mdash; whether it be within the financial services are or any other &mdash; then for administrative reasons it is useful that the Minister can make a change.  But these circumstances are totally different.  There could be wideranging implications for businesses, industry and others in the banking field if a Minister took onto himself the role proposed under the provisions of section 6.  In that case I would have strong objection to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to computerisation and the general introduction of technology in banking services I remember some years ago &mdash; though I am sure our friends in the banking service will deny this &mdash; when one received one's statement at the end of a month or whenever, if one had lodged, say, £1,000 in a current account and simultaneously had written cheques for approximately the same amount, generally speaking one's overdraft was reduced by the £1,000 when lodged.  That is not the case nowadays.  The banking system is so highly computerised that the various clocks tick over, emitting a signal showing debits and credits, when all one is left with is the balance.  That may appear to be a small matter to many people.  Nonetheless very often small businesses, operating on a tight margin, find that practice very annoying.  It may well evolve that, at the end of the banking year, their bank manager may well say to them, &ldquo;You were in overdraft for the entire year; that is not a good operation&rdquo;, whereas, by putting a totally different interpretation on the way the figures were computed over the entire year, equally the bank manager could say that the customer had almost been in credit for the entire year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting what modern technology has managed to do.  While giving answers up front that much more quickly the bad news is also given that much more quickly.  I have often promised myself to spend some time looking at the system but I have a sneaking suspicion that at this stage the customer does not have the advantage of the luxury of a couple of days' credit.  His or her overdraft is somewhat less ominous than would appear to be the case under the new system.  That <Col N="1310" /> is by way of general criticism of developments in the technological area and how they affect the consumer.</P>
    <P>The consumer's needs are all important. It is on the basis of the needs and demands of the consumer that all services rest and are developed.  If there was no consumer in the first place then there would be no need for these services.  It should not be forgotten that, regardless of what changes are taking place, what amalgamation is required or what needs have to be met in the financial world, the needs of the ordinary, humble, domestic consumer are of paramount importance.  While in every other business it is automatically assumed that the customer is always right, the customer does not always feel that he or she is right when dealing with financial services.  For that reason the Minister, in respect of sections 5 and 6, should have regard to the views expressed by Members of this House already this morning.  He should, when and if necessary, come back to the House with amending legislation in order that this House would stand over the changes being made as opposed to the present system whereby the House appears to give a free hand to the Minister to change the regulations at any given time to such an extent as to make the Bill before us almost totally irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to congratulate the Trustee Savings Banks for their performance to date.  I wish them every success in the future and hope they will continue to give that service.  I hope the competitive angle they present in banking terms remains and is sharpened, that that leading edge comes more to the fore and that the benefits accrue to the customer. I know a number of other speakers wish to contribute and I do not want to delay the proceedings of the House other than to say that there are pros and cons in this legislation in particular and it is most important that the Minister recognises this.  If he wishes to amend, by regulation, the legislation he should come back to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a very brief contribution to this legislation. <Col N="1311" /> Although it is a technical Bill and there is not a great deal of interest in the House in it, it is nonetheless a very important one.  I would like to have been able to welcome the Bill because it is long overdue &mdash; it has been in incubation for about ten years.  I know the people in the Trustee Savings Banks throughout the country have been watching for its appearance.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's speech he said the existing Trustee Savings Bank legislation is both antiquated and labyrinthine and that the present Bill is the first root and branch reform of that legislation in the State.  Why, then, did the Minister approach the legislation in the manner in which he did?  We have seen some extraordinary approaches to legislation by Fianna Fáil in this House in recent days.  Yesterday in the debate on the Child Care Bill the Minister in question was unable to give any indication of commencement dates.  In this Bill the Minister for Finance approaches the matter in an unprecedented way.  If he wanted to ensure that the Bill would go through smoothly and quickly, and that should be our objective, I question why he used the kind of approaches he has used in sections 5 and 6.</P>
      <P>To quote again from the Minister's speech, he said that section 6 empowers the Minister to modify provisions of this Bill by regulation to take account of relevant changes in company banking and building society legislation.  This is totally unacceptable and my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, has made a very good case as to the reason.  First, it is unacceptable that a Minister should take that power onto himself.  If he does so, the only redress this House has is to put down a motion to be debated which would nullify or negative that regulation but this never works.  It is a most frustrating aspect of parliamentary procedure, as Deputy De Rossa pointed out, and it is unacceptable.  I can understand why it has raised such hackles on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that time would be of the essence and that is why he was using this procedure when it <Col N="1312" /> came to changes and developments in the operation of the Trustee Savings Banks. I would ask the Minister why, since it took ten years to prepare this Bill, there is such a rush now to change procedures. I would suggest that the views expressed on this side of the House are aimed at ensuring that this Bill will stand the test of time, that it will ensure accountability and security and above all that it will protect the rights of the consumer.  I hope that, given the apparent disagreement between your side of the House and our side on this Bill, there can be a consensus, that we can discuss the issues on which we differ and that the Bill will come through as one with which we can all agree and one that serves the need.</P>
    <P>I would like to use my time in this debate to do what other speakers have done, that is to express appreciation for the work of the Trustee Savings Banks down through the years.  They are old established banks and have given a comprehensive service to customers.  There are about 64 branches throughout the country with a workforce of 800 and combined assets totalling £700 million.  They give a full personal banking service.  They are non-profit making organisations and surpluses are put back into the business for development.</P>
    <P>As somebody who banks with the Trustee Savings Bank and has a great deal of admiration for them, I would like to comment on their role.  They have a sound, no nonsense approach to banking. Many other banking groups could take a lesson from them.  They recognise and accept the real needs of their customers by staying open at lunch time, which is invaluable to workers, and have a late night opening the same night as the main shops are open.  Generally they provide the public with a service comparable to public needs, and this highlights the inadequacies and shortcomings of many of the other banks.  Too many of them are still living in the past when banking was a service used by the wealthy or at least by the better off, the kind of people who are free to do their business when all other people are at work.</P>
    <P>Today banking is not a luxury but an <Col N="1313" /> essential service.  It is and has to be used by people on a day-to-day basis.  Most workers now have their salaries paid by way of bank transfers.  This is a good idea, for security reasons, but it puts great pressure and places great demands on banks to meet the needs of those who go to work each day.  However, they are not doing so.  Anyone who looks at the long queues which form at the wall dispensers at banks, particularly on a Thursday, will know that the banks are not meeting their needs.  The long suffering public deserve better treatment and a better service, at least as good as that which has been provided during the years by branches of the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>As I said, we need an essential service in the general banks.  The associated banks have enormous resources and adopt aggressive marketing policies to garner in more and more customers. Unfortunately, they place a very low priority on customer needs.  I feel very strongly about the role the Trustee Savings Banks play.  They have been too modest in their advertising and marketing policies.  If they undertook a real campaign and made a real effort they could wipe the eye of many of the other banks because of the genuine community service they provide.  The debate on the services provided by banks is perhaps for another day.  We have to get the agreement of the House for the Bill before us and make sure that it meets the needs of the public and the real fears which have been expressed on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join other speakers in acknowledging the contribution this financial group have made to the well being of so many people and the facilities they have provided to smaller communities throughout the country.  At a time when financial institutions &mdash; I am thinking in particular of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the building societies and even the banks &mdash; are rapidly expanding into other sectors of the financial services market, such as insurance and conveyancing, it is only natural that this legislation should allow the Trustee Savings Banks to compete on <Col N="1314" /> a equal footing with all other financial institutions in the financial services market.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, there is now enormous competition in the banking sector.  In my opinion there are two tiers of competition.  On the one hand, the Trustee Savings Banks, An Post and credit unions compete in the personal loan market and try to attract small depositors and on the other hand there has been a rapid expansion in the home loan market, particularly in the endowment mortgage sector.  Many financial institutions have now entered into that market and the recent spate of advertising and the rates which they offer are an indication of the profit which financial institutions believe can be made in that sector of the market in the coming years. I expect that the Trustee Savings Banks will seek to ehance their role in that sector of the market and an expansion into the insurance sector will allow them to develop further that endowment mortgage side of their activities, unless of course the Minister for Finance in future budgets sees to it that the taking out of endownment mortgages will be less attractive by reducing tax relief on such mortgages.  That remains to be seen but I am sure that the provision of home loans will continue to form a large part of the activity of financial institutions in coming years.</P>
      <P>The over-dependence of the Trustee Savings Banks on the personal loan market has placed them in a vulnerable position.  There is a great danger in this. If losses accrue and there are high interest rates, this will place pressure on individual borrowers who are trying to meet repayments on their loans.  For that reason it is only natural that every financial institution should seek to expand over as wide an area as possible.  By allowing the Trustee Savings Banks to offer loans to companies this Bill is seeking to protect the institutions themselves and for that reason it is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech that there are too many banks in the country today and envisages <Col N="1315" /> amalgamations, rationalisation and takeovers in the financial services sector. Indeed, in Part VI of the Bill, the Minister encourages more efficiency and acknowledges that there are too many small institutions and a need for rationalisation and amalgamations.  In the context of 1992 and the need for greater efficiency in the marketplace, so that institutions will be able to compete effectively in the European Community, I have no doubt that we will see rationalisation and takeovers in the financial services sector.  In a recent development the Irish Nationwide Building Society agreed to a takeover bid with the Irish Mutual Building Society.  I have no doubt that financial institutions outside of Ireland will seek to take over financial institutions, in particular building societies, in the years ahead.  I would also suggest that if the Trustee Savings Banks do not improve their efficiency to the level that will be demanded of them from 1992 onwards they will be ripe for a takeover bid by either an Irish institution or an institution in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the provisions contained in Part V of the Bill or with the level of accountability of financial institutions.  Some years ago the Minister of the day in building society legislation sought extra powers over the building societies.  However, that legislation did not meet the requirement to get as much information as possible as a cosy club atmosphere has developed very rapidly in the financial services sector in recent years.  We should seek to address this appalling problem and not allow the problems which arose with regard to the building society legislation to arise with regard to this legislation.  I hope the Minister will make the necessary amendments to Part V of the Bill on Committee Stage to allay the fears of the financial institutions and seek to obtain as much information as possible for the Oireachtas, the general public and in particular, for the account holders of financial institutions so that they will feel much happier about the financial institutions <Col N="1316" /> with which they have invested their money.</P>
    <P>In this legislation, the Minister is probably seeking to put the Trustee Savings Banks on an equal footing with all other financial institutions to ease their way, in the event of a takover, an amalgamation or a merger.  Our experience of allowing banks to diversify into other sectors of the financial market is not good and we should seek in this legislation to ensure that past mistakes are not repeated.  I am referring in particular to what happened when the Bank of Ireland diversified into the life assurance market.  During the course of the debate on the Insurance Bill in another House I brought to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Minister for Finance, the difficulties that were arising for the consumer. I regret to say the matter was not taken too seriously at the time but subsequently the Department of Industry and Commerce received numerous representations from the general public on the exploitation that was taking place <i>vis-à-vis</i> life assurance and Bank of Ireland account holders.  I am glad to see that some improvement has taken place since then.  I hope the consumer will be protected from exploitation and that what happened in the past will not be allowed to happen under this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is an impression abroad that if a Minister had sufficient powers of regulation that he could do many things under the Bill.  In fact, the Minister for the Environment sought to take certain powers of regulation to himself under the building society legislation.  However, we see how that has failed over the years to ensure that the consumers are protected and not exploited by repayments or inbuilt management charges which are extraordinarily high.  The financial institutions have failed to justify to the ordinary policy holder the amount of money that is being paid in management charges to various people.  The Minister for the Environment has the power to call in the building societies to discuss an interest rate increase, but in the recent increase in the mortgage rate, which is above the <Col N="1317" /> Central Bank interest rate, it appeared he had little or no option but to allow them to continue on their own merry way and increase the interest rate at will.  This is a development in the financial sector which requires redress.  The Government have failed miserably to ensure that there is fair play for the mortgage holder.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister seeking more powers of regulation when experience suggests he would not be prepared to use those powers effectively for the benefit of the consumer?  In recent times, particularly over the past 18 months, there has been a large increase in interest rates which is a very worrying trend for those who have taken out personal or other loans.  I am particularly concerned as the Trustee Savings Banks are heavily dependent on the personal loan market and this may have an adverse effect on the viability of the banks.  For that reason the improvements suggested in broadening their portfolio should help them.  We should note that what can happen when there is a high interest rate and a liberal money supply is that the price of property can escalate enormously.</P>
    <P>The rise in business activity in the Dublin area and throughout the country, together with the general relaxation and greater access by consumers to loan facilities &mdash; largely on account of competition &mdash; is responsible for the boom in the property market in Dublin in particular. There is such competition for a share in the property finance market that the financial institutions are prepared to be more flexible in lending money than they were a few years ago.  We had a similar situation in 1978-79 when the price of agricultural land went through the roof. This was because the banks generally decided on a relaxation of the rules and a more flexible approach to loan facilities. We saw what happened then.  With the escalation of interest rates, people were in difficulties and the Oireachtas had to devise a financial package to rescue those who had found themselves in the impossible position of not being able to pay the interest on the interest that had accrued <Col N="1318" /> from those loans.  The financial institutions and the Central Bank must learn from past experience and ensure that the associated banks do not develop a liberal policy to the extent of mismanagement of the loan facilities.</P>
    <P>Under Part VII, the Minister is seeking power to organise the Trustee Savings Banks into companies.  Has he any plans to do this?  How will the matter be dealt with?  I would like the Minister to expand on that point.</P>
    <P>Generally, I welcome the legislation.  I hope that the fears that have been expressed and the comments I have made will be taken into consideration.  There is a general welcome for the Bill in broadening the activities of a financial institution which will allow them to compete in a very competitive financial market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is not one minute before time; in fact, it is long overdue.  I have reservations about certain parts of the Bill, which have been spelled out by our spokesman on Finance.  I hope the Minister has taken cognisance of the facts he has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks have given a very valuable service since their inception. The basic legislation under which they operate is completely outdated.  It goes back to 1863.  It is now high time that proper legislation was enacted in this House to ensure that the Trustee Savings Banks will continue unhindered to provide services to the general public.  It is also of paramount importance that they be given every opportunity and that there should be no inhibitions on their progress in the financial world.  I have no doubt that the Trustee Savings Banks incorporating the Cork and Limerick Savings Banks have given outstanding service to the general community.  They have shown to the public that they are a caring financial institution.  They will listen to what is being said by the general public whom they treat as equal citizens.  They are not like the huge commercial banks which may close down a branch in an outlying area and leave their customers <Col N="1319" /> with a service once a month only.  If the Minister is not going to copperfasten provisions in this Bill that will safeguard the general public, the Bill will not be a success.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the aim of the Trustee Savings Banks is to continue the service which they are giving their customers at present.  They have proved to the general public that they can be trusted.  They have the longest opening hours of any banking concern.  The Trustee Savings Banks are open to the general public for approximately 32 hours per week while the other major banking concerns are open to the public for approximately 21 hours per week.  Surely this is nonsensical in this day and age.  It is unwarranted and unfair that any financial group who have a monopoly, such as the banking world have, should treat the general public in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks' loan rates are the lowest available.  They have shown their concern for their customers by deferring the present increase in house mortgages until 1 January 1990.  That shows they are a caring financial concern. They have given their customers who have taken out loans an opportunity to enjoy the festive season and have not imposed on them the severe hardship which has been imposed by other financial institutions on their customers as late as yesterday and the day before.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks must be congratulated for the manner in which they handle the financial affairs of their customers.  I do not have enough words with which to praise the Cork Savings Bank, the Limerick Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank in Dublin, praise which they very much deserve.  This goes to show that if there is no opposition in any walk of life there will be a complete walk over.  It is for this reason we must welcome this legislation, provided it copperfastens the anomalies which were spelt out by our leader and spokesman on Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Inhibitions of any description should not be placed on the Trustee Savings Banks.  They are a very imaginative and competitive outfit and I have no doubt they have the interests of their customers at heart.</P>
      <P>While the major commercial banks are inclined to forget about their customers who live in the outlying areas of the country I believe those are the people who should be looked after.  We cannot all live inside the Pale or on the outskirts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  If there is to be a future for this country our population in the under developed areas must be maintained. What do tourists do when they visit areas where the major banks operate a service only once a month?  Surely everybody knows that people who are on holidays need to have access to a bank every day of the week.  They need a proper service and not one which is run on a skeleton basis.  Those very concerns boast of the countless millions of pounds they make in profits every year.  Yet they are pruning the services which are so badly needed in rural Ireland today.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is going to take any steps to stop the major banking concerns from pruning their branches throughout the country, closing them down and giving no service of any description.  How can we attract industry and tourism to this country and maintain a proper agricultural community in rural Ireland if we do not have a proper banking system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for this reason I stand in this Chamber today to praise the activities of the Cork and Limerick Trustee Savings Banks and the Trustee Savings Banks generally.  If it were not for them I shudder to think what our banking policy                                                                                                                                 <Col N="1321" /> would be.  The Minister should remember that all citizens deserve equal rights.  I hate to see the people who live in rural Ireland being treated as second class citizens. We must ensure that the Trustee Savings Banks will be given the opportunity to expand where they want to expand.  If the legislation is properly introduced I believe it will be of paramount importance to each and every individual who is living in rural Ireland today.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that this legislation was not being introduced one day too soon and I hope the Minister in his reply will give an assurance to the people who have spoken on this Bill that proper treatment will be given to the Trustee Savings Banks, that no further commitments, other than those placed on the other banking systems, will be placed on them and that they will be given an equal share of the cake so far as the Central Bank is concerned.  If the Minister proceeds along those lines the banking fraternity should have a very bright future in the years ahead.  We want to see the Trustee Savings Banks going from strength to strength.  The Cork Savings Bank have branches in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen and let us hope that in the not too distant future they will have branches in other towns in south-west Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  I concur with them in paying compliments to the Trustee Savings Banks for the fine customer service they have given throughout their many long years in operation, and especially for the service they have given in rural Ireland, as Deputy Sheehan said.  I cannot say whether they have any intentions of opening a branch in Schull but I have no <Col N="1322" /> doubt that if there is enough business there they will.</P>
      <P>While the Trustee Savings Banks are small in terms of the overall financial industry, they provide a very important service for the small depositor in particular. They are hampered by archaic regulations which have no place in today's financial environment so changes are long overdue.  In fact, this Bill has been about nine years in gestation.  A number of Ministers for Finance have passed through during that period.  It was time to bring the Bill to the Floor of the House.  It was time for them to be brought on to the level playing field and given the opportunity to provide a wider range of financial services.  In future they will be under the authority of the Central Bank which is the proper supervisory authority for banking services.  With the removal of outdated restrictions, the Trustee Savings Banks will be better equipped to grow and cope with intense competition. There are already plans in train for new branch offices.  For the first time they will be able to do business with companies as well as individuals, and they will have much greater flexibility in terms of use of depositors' funds.</P>
      <P>The updating of rules and structures which is being provided for in this Bill is in line with the changes already in operation or now being put into place in respect of savings banks' operations in other European countries.  The whole financial sector has been going through a period of dramatic change in recent years.  New financial instruments, the increased use of technology and the implementation of European Community Directives are having a very big impact and traditional lines of demarcation between the various finance houses are fading away.  Earlier this year the Oireachtas enacted legislation on the Central Bank and on building societies to provide for these new realities.  The present Bill is doing likewise for the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was highly critical of the provision in section 5 about the making of regulations.  First let me point out that there are many precedents for <Col N="1323" /> this.  In the most recent Building Societies Act there is a clear precedent.  There are several other precedents and the Deputy has been making a song and dance about a matter of really little importance.  That is not to say that I do not agree with him in many areas.  This House should always hold on to the powers it has and never delegate them; but in this case the Deputy will appreciate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Building Societies Act has gone through.  The Companies Bill is only half way through.</P>
      <P>As I stated in opening, the provision is merely intended to allow the Minister to deal with any unforeseen technical difficulties and nothing more.  The Deputy also implied that there is some disagreement between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank on the question of supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks.  I want to say categorically here and now that there is absolutely no basis whatsoever for such an assertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the <Col N="1324" /> intention to provide that the Trustee Savings Banks should be constituted as companies at a future stage.  The Bill provides that the change to company status will be effected by ministerial order.  The important point to note here, however, is that the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to debate such an order and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is critical of section 59 which requires that the Trustee Savings Banks may not imply that the Government of the day or the Central Bank are liable to depositors for money placed with the banks.  There is nothing new in this. It is simply a restatement of the legal position as it has been up to now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was incensed because the legislation does not spell out what conditions the Central Bank will impose on granting licences to the Trustee Savings Banks.  I think it is quite unrealistic to propose that we should include in legislation the details of any Central Bank licence.  The logic of this is that all Central Bank licences should be subject to the same conditions.  The whole thrust of the legislation is that Trustee Savings Banks are to be treated on the same footing as all other banks.  The Central Bank has authority under the law to regulate the operations of banking institutions and they will exercise this function in relation to the Trustee Savings Banks in the same way as they exercise it in respect of the other banks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan queried the intention with regard to the determination of interest rates.  The Bill states that Trustee Savings Bank interest rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers will be fixed in a manner to be determined by the Central Bank.  The rate the Minister pays on funds with him will be determined by the Minister after consulting with the Central Bank.  It is the intention that the existing system where the Minister pays the cost of funds plus a margin for management expenses will broadly continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor spoke at some length about the question of ownership. His preference was that the Trustee Savings Banks should be taken into <Col N="1325" /> public ownership.  The first priority for all of us here is to ensure the survival of the Trustee Savings Banks in today's highly competitive market place.  The question of ownership really only arises when there is a proposal to change the trustee status.  There is no such proposal at this time.  The immediate priority is to encourage and enable the Trustee Savings Banks to provide a wider range of services to a wider public.  I cannot say what directions the Trustee Savings Banks may take in the longer term.  My concern is that they should grow and prosper.  The Bill provides that whatever directions may be taken the Minister for Finance of the day will have the power to protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question of consultation with the Trustee Savings Banks in the course of the preparation of <Col N="1326" /> this Bill.  I can confirm that there has been full consultation in all aspects of the legislation and the Trustee Savings Banks are very satisfied with developments.  In relation to comments raised by others about areas to be teased out on Committee Stage, I will be only too happy to discuss them and if there are reasoned amendments we will certainly take a good look at them and have decent consultation about them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other questions raised by other Deputies about interest rates and building society mortgage rates, as we know from the Bills which were passed through the House, supervision of building societies has now gone to the Central Bank who are to be the central supervisory authority, and they have the legislative authority and power to oversee and regulate the interest rates.</P>

    <Title>Bord Glas Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish An Bord Glas as an independent statutory body.  The Government believe that the much needed development of our horticultural industry can be achieved only if responsibility for the development is put in the hands of a body with specific overall responsibility to carry out the task.  It is clear, however, that An Bord Glas on their own cannot achieve the necessary developments.  They must work with other Government agencies such as Teagasc who have responsibility for advice, research and education, Córas Tráchtála in regard to export development, the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta as regards aid for industrial development within horticulture.  An Bord Glas must also, of course, maintain close contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food and with developments within the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to those bodies there are, moreover, the producers who are a most important element in the development process and the wholesale and retail merchants who have a very important part to <Col N="1329" /> play, both in their contacts, direct or indirect, with producers and in the considerable influence which they have on public reaction and perceptions.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are what in the past might have been called the Irish housewives &mdash; I am a little hesitant in using that term today &mdash; but what I have in mind are the people who daily or weekly buy their requirements in fruit and vegetables. As regards these latter, whatever name we call them, I am quite confident that Irish purchasers are more than willing to support Irish horticultural produce provided they are offered products which are of good quality and well presented and represent value for money.  It will, therefore, be a key function of An Bord Glas to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>I am by no means putting myself forward as an expert on diet but there is general agreement that our people would be all the better for eating substantially increased quantities of fruit and vegetables.  We hear a lot about the damage which people may do to their health from an unbalanced diet or quite simply eating the wrong foods.  No doubt there is often an element of propaganda involved when particular foods are either being castigated or praised but fruit and vegetables would come into any recommended list of healthy eating.</P>
    <P>I was recently looking at figures published by the World Health Organisation on the extent to which people in various countries die prematurely from coronary heart disease.  Ireland, along with some of our nearest neighbours, is very high on the list.  However, France &mdash; a country noted for its dedicated gastronomes &mdash; is very low on the list.  I wonder why.  I have heard it suggested that it is perhaps because the French consume more wine than we do.  That I think is hardly the answer.  Whatever the explanation, I think it is noteworthy that the French, as well as being good eaters, are also high consumers of fruit and vegetables, and I have no doubt that this does them a lot of good.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any great argument as regards the need for future <Col N="1330" /> development of our horticultural industry. That industry has shown some improvement in recent years but to enable it to develop better and faster has long been the concern of successive Governments even before our accession to the European Community but obviously with increasing concern since accession.  We need An Bord Glas as a co-ordinator and focal point to bring together all the various elements which make up Irish horticulture so that the necessary development can be more quickly brought about.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, An Bord Glas were set up on an interim, non-statutory basis in April 1987.  The chief task which the board set themselves was to carry out a detailed study of the various sectors of the Irish horticultural industry so as to find out where the weaknesses were and to decide on the best means of improvement. The board set up seven different teams for the various horticultural commodities. Each team was made up of experts in the business of producing or marketing horticultural products, people with scientific and other specialised knowledge and also people from the State and semi-State sectors.  As a result of the deliberations of these experts, the board were presented with a very large volume of diagnoses of the weaknesses of the industry and prescriptions for remedying those weaknesses.  Last November the board, having gone into all the various findings and recommendations, produced a five-year development plan for horticulture. This is a most important document because it sets out what can be achieved if the right methods are followed and if everybody concerned plays their part.</P>
    <P>The Bord Glas development plan foresees that, over a five-year period, we could increase very substantially the quantities we produce of our total requirements of fruit and vegetables. The board estimate that the value of that increased production for home requirements could be as high as £31 million.  I would like to give just a few other statistics.  We supply on average <Col N="1331" /> about 45 per cent of our home requirements. An Bord Glas see that figure being increased to 60 per cent.  That increase is the maximum achieveable because considerable quantities of what we need are products which cannot be produced in the Irish climate.  There is also the problem of seasonality, that is, at certain times of the year growing conditions are not suitable for certain products, particularly field vegetables.  As well as the £31 million which could be gained by increasing home production, the board also see that there are possibilities for increasing exports over the five-year development period to reach a total yearly value of £27 million.  All this has the potential to create 1,750 full time new jobs and 1,500 part time new jobs.  At this point I should say that these figures exclude the seed-potato sector which the board examined separately and which will be the subject of a separate development programme to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The main problem which An Bord Glas in their inquiries found with Irish horticulture nowadays is that marketing is weak.  What is meant by marketing? The first essential is that the producer should embark on a plan for the production of a particular crop only after he has clearly established where, how and when he will sell it.  At the present time about 60 per cent of the total sales of fruit and vegetables in this country are carried out through supermarket groups. Already, the supermarkets have good contacts with selected growers.  This system could be extended and, in local areas, producers could for example look at independent retail outlets who would be prepared to do business provided certain essentials such as certainty of delivery, quality and presentation are met.  It is, of course, difficult for an individual producer to give guarantees as regards supply.  For that reason producers must join producer groups.  There are a few such groups already in operation in the country, but they need more members. There is very substantial aid available through a European Community scheme to enable producer groups to establish <Col N="1332" /> themselves.  One of the main tasks of An Bord Glas will be to encourage growers to join producer groups.  I would like to repeat what I have frequently said to producers &mdash; that anybody who is thinking of developing a worthwhile business as a horticultural producer must think very seriously about joining a producer group.</P>
    <P>I would now like to talk for a little while about specific crops.  I will begin with the mushroom sector which has been remarkably successful and is going through a period of continuing expansion. The mushroom industry is significant, not only because of its continuing successful growth, but also very much because the great bulk of its output is sold on the export market.  The present yearly output of the industry is valued at some £24 million and the expectation is that in 1992 this figure will be of the order of £50 million worth.  The industry is a striking example of very close co-ordination between production, preparation for market and marketing. Very significant investment has been made by private enterprise aided by the State and with very considerable help from the agricultural research and advisory services.  The industry is, however, working in a very competitive market. There has to be constant attention to top quality and everything else that goes with good marketing.  Because of these factors and the very high investment needed at all levels from production right through to marketing, very careful thought has to be given to how the industry expands. This is an area which An Bord Glas has been very conscious of and has been continuously monitoring in close consultation with all the other interests involved.  The board will continue to be closely involved in this area and Deputies will note that the board are being given power of consultation in regard to State investment under section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another sector which I would like to talk about is what is known as hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture. This sector embraces the business of producing small trees, shrubs, and plants for use by private people in their gardens and <Col N="1333" /> by private authorities for the improvement of the appearance of public places, parks, gardens and the area surrounding buildings.  Of growing importance also is the business of planting trees and shrubs along motorways.  One point which, I am sure, the House is well aware of is that this country, compared with other countries in Western Europe, has a remarkable climatic advantage in regard to the growing of trees and shrubs.  The hardy nursery stock sector is making progress here and has, for some time now, been endeavouring to establish itself in a strong position on the British market where there is great scope for this business. Again, as in the case of fruit and vegetables, marketing is extremely important as is close co-ordination between producers.  Supplies needed by public authorities or large private garden centres can be very substantial and the products of more than one producer could be called upon to meet an order quickly and to specifications.  There is great scope for the hardy nursery stock sector and I am glad to be able to tell the House that An Bord Glas, together with Córas Tráchtála, IDA and a number of people in that sector, have already made the first necessary steps towards a more co-ordinated and developed approach to export markets.  For the moment, concentration is mainly on the British market, but of course the sector will be looking beyond the English Channel even perhaps, I hope, before 1992.  Indeed, at the risk of being accused of being too ambitious &mdash; and I do not think in connection with horticulture that over-ambition is a fault once it is guided by planning and attention to all the aspects of good marketing &mdash; I would look beyond the shores of Europe.  I say this because of the very significant part which Ireland will be playing in the Garden Festival in Tokyo.  This festival is to be opened in April 1990 and there is, of course, an Irish garden already being prepared.  The benefits of that particular activity will, I hope, extend far beyond the horticultural sector but I think that it is appropriate that I should mention it here.</P>
    <P>Having talked about the great success <Col N="1334" /> of mushrooms and the hope for developments of hardy nursery stock and amenity horticulture, I now come to the product about which, I regret to say, I cannot speak of such great success.  I am talking about the ware-potato sector.  While we have had undoubtedly some improvements in this area in recent years we still have a long way to go.  Potatoes can be a risky crop.  From year to year there can be very significant fluctuations in price, and producers can suffer.  We saw examples of this in 1988 when there were prices which at times did not cover the producers' production costs.  This year the situation has improved for producers. There is no reason why we in this country should not be able to supply almost completely and fully all our needs of good quality potatoes.  Unfortunately, in the past there have been very high imports of potatoes, although again this situation has improved recently.  The potato sector is the most disorganised of all the sectors I have to deal with and I place it as the top priority of An Bord Glas in regard to trying to make improvements.  Improvements can be made.  Again it is a question of good marketing and co-ordination between producers.  Potato producers, of course, realise that no longer can there be let or hindrance &mdash; except on disease grounds &mdash; to imports of potatoes from other parts of the European Community and, as we all know, under the Community agreement with Cyprus, that country supplies at certain times of the year considerable quantities of potatoes to the market.  But there is no reason we should not be able to produce almost all our requirements of potatoes with reasonable returns to producers and reasonable prices to consumers.  Quality and presentation are all important.  I think that most Irish people shopping for their weekly supplies will be more critical of the potatoes presented to them than of any other vegetables or fruit on display. All I have already said about marketing applies with as much force to potatoes &mdash; indeed more so &mdash; as to any other product.  What I said about producer groups certainly applies.</P>
    <P>In the past year, indeed, the European <Col N="1335" /> Commission has at our request extended the producer group regulation to Ireland for potatoes.  Accordingly, similar financial advantages as for producer groups for other vegetables now apply to potatoes. Already, An Bord Glas have been very actively in contact with the IFA about what is to be done about this product. The IFA are more than willing to play their part and arrangements are being made between An Bord Glas and the Irish Farmers' Association to appoint a potato marketing co-ordinator.  It has to be said that there are a number of excellent producers in the potato business, but there is great room for improvement. It would be a pity if that improvement were not made.  An Bord Glas will be striving earnestly to ensure that it will be made.</P>
    <P>I am also very much concerned about the development of our seed potato industry which unfortunately has had, for some years now, a continuously declining performance in the export sector.  As I said earlier, An Bord Glas examined this sector separately to see what is the best way to restore the industry to its performance of some years back and I look forward to receiving this report shortly. It is important, not only for the export business, that we continue to have a growing output of seed potatoes &mdash; but that we should also have of course a continuing supply of high quality seed for home requirements.</P>
    <P>I would like, before completing my comments on individual product sectors, to deal with the effect on the glasshouse sector of our entry to the European Community. The effect has been greatly increased competition for that sector, especially in regard to tomatoes.  The difficulties of this sector were of course compounded by the energy crises of the seventies.  In recent years there has been an improvement but the great part of the industry in those years had found itself with glasshouses which were very old, in poor condition and no longer suitable for modern competitive production conditions.</P>
    <P>A decade ago a yield of 200 tonnes per <Col N="1336" /> hectare from an early heated tomato crop was acceptable and profitable.  To survive nowadays and looking forward into the nineties a yield in excess of 350 tonnes per hectare is needed.  These yields are being obtained by some growers. They have been brought about by growers examining the latest technology within the European Community, modifying with the help of Teagasc and then making the necessary investments in their holdings.  However, it was urgently necessary to stimulate substantial additional investment.  Accordingly, on the basis of a recommendation in the Bord Glas five year development plan, I was glad to be able to announce in July last that I had got approval from the Government and from the EC Commission for a special new scheme of capital grants and a substantial improvement in existing grants under the farm improvement programme to modernise and upgrade existing glasshouses and build additional glasshouses.  Considerable investment is needed.  I am talking about a figure of about £11 million, with State grants of £3 million over five years.  As a result there will be extra production of 6,500 tonnes of tomatoes.  To meet the competition of other Community suppliers, these new and modernised glasshouses together with &mdash; and I make no apologies for repeating it &mdash; good marketing are needed.  Indeed, in the glasshouse scheme which I introduced in July, grants will be given only where the grower can show that he already has a properly developed marketing system or that he will implement one.</P>
    <P>I will not deal further with individual products, but An Bord Glas, in addition to doing the very important job of producing their development programme, have also been involved in a wide range of day to day and seasonal activities in a large number of horticultural sectors.  As examples of this involvement I mention very briefly the soft fruit sector &mdash; where there are prospects for further development &mdash; the apples sector &mdash; where I would like to see an increase in production and where some very welcome new investment has already been made <Col N="1337" />&mdash; and the onion sector &mdash; where there are prospects for development.  In both apples and onions, we are far too dependent on imports and I believe that there are possibilities for a great improvement.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the provisions of the Bill I would like to refer to what the position will be in regard to the very important matter of controls for plant health purposes in the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>On the plant health side, the future trend will be towards freer and more standardised controls between member states, with the major responsibility being placed on the exporting member state to ensure freedom from pests and diseases, and a diminishing right for the receiving member state to make check inspections at import.  As you know, Ireland, because of its island location and strict plant health controls over many years, has succeeded in remaining free from many serious pests and diseases which occur in parts of continental Europe.  Examples are the Colorado beetle, potato ring rot disease and various viral and other diseases and pests of horticultural crops.  In the negotiations on the new régime which is intended to be in place by 1992, it will be our policy to preserve safeguards against the more serious organisms and to uphold the traditional high health status of our crops. We are fully committed to the completion of the internal market but not on the basis of disseminating disease.  However, it is clear that a greater degree of responsibility will also fall on producers and growers, particularly when buying in planting material from abroad, to ensure that they are dealing with reputable firms which can guarantee the quality and disease free status of the plants.  Protecting our high health status is not simply the responsibility of the Government or the Department.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the new system will be the elimination of phytosanitary certificates in trade between EC countries and their replacement by a system of plant passports.  The principle of the system is that all plant material being produced for sale in any member state <Col N="1338" /> will be examined by the plant health authority of the country of production and, if it meets the standard, it will be issued with a plant passport.  This will enable the plants to be sold on the home or export markets without further formality at the time of export.</P>
    <P>The details of this system have not yet been finalised in Brussels &mdash; there is much negotiation yet to be done &mdash; but it is clear that growers, advisers and the Department will have to work closely together to ensure that all material produced is up to standard.  It will probably mean the registration of growers, particularly in the nursery stock section of horticulture, so that controls and growing season inspections can be carried out as required with a view to controlling the plant passport system.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that close co-operation is essential because, not alone are we trying to ensure against the introduction of diseases and pests of which we are at present free, but we are equally responsible for maintaining the traditional high standard health and quality of Irish exports which are the cornerstone of successful development and expansion.  As soon as the various aspects of the new system are agreed in Brussels there will be full consultation between the Department and the various commercial interests so that the new arrangements can be introduced smoothly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I will now come to the provisions of the Bill before the House.  I would like to refer to a few of the main sections. Before doing so I should also tell Deputies that, at one stage in the past year after the Bord Glas Development Plan had been published, the Government gave consideration to having An Bord Glas not as the now proposed independent statutory body but rather as a subsidiary company of Teagasc.  There were very cogent arguments in favour of having An Bord Glas as part of Teagasc but, unfortunately, they tended to militate against one clearly identified, over-riding need of Irish horticulture, that is, the need to set up a separate body which would act as a single and distinct focus for the development of the industry.  Moreover, <Col N="1339" /> while Teagasc will concentrate primarily on research, training and advice in relation to agriculture as a whole, the work of An Bord Glas will be directed towards a range of activities which are set out in sections 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At the same time An Bord Glas will have to operate very closely with Teagasc.  In this connection I would like to refer in particular to section 8 of the Bill, which provides for a particular form of co-ordination and collaboration between the board and Teagasc.  This is a very important provision.  Indeed, it is already in operation because, over the past year, the chairman of the board, the chief executive of the board and I have been in very close contact with the chairman and director of Teagasc.  The current interim board have the director of Teagasc as one of their members.  In practice, the present board are in very close and constant communication with Teagasc at various levels.  These day to day practical and sensible arrangements will continue in the future and will, of course, be essential for the effective operation of section 8.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to section 9 of the Bill which gives An Bord Glas a specific responsibility in regard to both State investment in horticulture and the curricula for higher education in horticulture. This is a very significant provision because it gives An Bord Glas a necessary say in what money the State will, through its agencies, invest so as to ensure that such investment is in accord with the board's functions.  Secondly, the board will have an opportunity of influencing higher education in horticulture and through this the formation of future leaders in the education, research, advisory and other sectors of the industry including, of course, the production sector.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for a levy by the board on the sale of horticultural produce.  When that levy will be brought into operation, I cannot say.  Neither would it be sensible to try to make any <Col N="1340" /> forecast as to what the rate of levy will be.  Those are matters in the first instance for An Bord Glas to discuss and propose. It will be noted that the section provides that different rates of levy may be prescribed in respect of different classes of persons liable to pay levy.  It is also important to note that the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of approving of the necessary regulations under section 12 (7).</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill sets out the various provisions and I therefore propose to confine my concluding comments to the more important remaining provisions. The primary purpose of the Bill is set out in section 3, that is, the establishment of An Bord Glas as a statutory body.  Sections 4 and 5 set out the functions of the board.  The keynote in these provisions is flexibility.  The board are given powers to engage in a broad range of activities designed to secure comprehensive development of the horticultural sector.  Section 6 entitles the Minister to attach new functions to the board so as to enable a change of course or corrective action in response to changing needs.</P>
    <P>Section 19 authorises the Minister to make advances from the Exchequer to the board in order to enable them to perform their functions.  In this context it is important to bear in mind that the board will not be totally dependent on the Exchequer for funds.  Section 11 empowers them to charge for services and, as already mentioned, section 12 provides for the imposition of a levy.  The staffing of the board and related matters are covered in sections 15 and 16.  The remaining sections of the Bill are, generally speaking, fairly standard legislative provisions for a body of the nature proposed. In particular a number of the provisions are similar to those contained in the Act establishing Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The Members of An Bord Glas will consist of a chairman and ten members appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Both chairman and members will hold office for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I consider it most important to emphasise that the Bill is                                                                                                                                   <Col N="1341" /> not protectionist.  While we realise that Irish horticulture has had enormous problems since our accession to the European Communities, we must also recognise that we are members of the European Communities and we must face up to the fact that the horticultural produce of other member states and third countries which have agreements with the EC enjoy access to our markets.  Our task, therefore, is not to fear imports but to confront, with resolve and optimism, the challenge they present in the excellence of their quality, presentation and uniformity.  The bald truth is that we have a lot to learn from the horticultural sectors in other member states.  They are, for example, stronger on organisation and marketing than we are.  However I am convinced we can meet the challenge and that An Bord Glas will have a pivotal, catalytic role in ensuring that we do.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate the Minister and his two Ministers of State on their reappointment in the wake of the recent general election.  I cannot express the wish that their terms in office will be long and happy but I hope that they will be fruitful terms.</P>
      <P>This Bill falls within the area of responsibility of Deputy Kirk.  As the Deputy represents a neighbouring constituency I am kept fully briefed of his work and his level of activity in the constituency. As the Fine Gael spokesperson on horticulture I assure the Minister that I will keep an eagle eye on his work in the industry nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has dubious origins.  It has not been demanded by the industry nor by the general public.  We have had a horticultural industry in this country since the Stone Age and suddenly for no apparent reason in 1989 the industry is to be brought under the control of the State. This idea first saw the light of day, it appears, in a Fianna Fáil manifesto.  It was the brainchild of some back-room public relations genius and like some public relations electoral gimmick it has an initial appeal, a superficial glossy <Col N="1342" /> attractiveness.  However, when one studies the Bill in depth it becomes clear that it has major flaws and failings.  Like all sorts of election gimmicks it should have had a shelf life only of the duration of the election campaign and it should then have been quietly abandoned.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have no hesitation in opposing the Bill tooth and nail.  I earnestly urge Deputies from the right, left and centre to do the same on several major grounds of general principle.  My first general objection to the Bill is that neither it nor An Bord Glas are necessary. It is only now being foisted upon us because of ill-thought out pre-election gimmicks.  The Bill as drafted is a hotchpotch of 28 sections and an appendix which seems to have been culled from other Bills establishing other semi-State bodies in the past.  This has been dragged together in a willy-nilly, jigsaw fashion. The sum of the parts does not add up to an acceptable coherent whole.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will say that the Bill has been more or less welcomed by the industry.  I am well aware of the hard-and-soft sell that the Minister has been giving his proposals within the industry. I also took soundings throughout the industry so I am aware that the various sections within the industry are only now beginning to come to terms with the small print of the Bill and that they do not like what they are reading.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister did not refer to it in his speech I believe that only in the past 24 hours he received some correspondence from the industry saying they cannot take a position on the Bill until certain matters are clarified by the Minister.  Over a period of weeks representatives of the industry have been requesting meetings with the Minister to discuss important matters relating to the industry.  They have urged immediate contact between the Minister, his Department and the various sections of the industry involved.  Large numbers of people in the industry have not been contacted by the Minister or An Bord Glas about the proposals in this Bill.  It is <Col N="1343" /> incredible that we are today making proposals to set up a board though the industry have not been contacted nor have they had any say as to the make up of the board.</P>
    <P>My second major objection to the Bill is that it introduces another layer of bureaucracy into the horticultural industry. The State is now seeking to involve itself in an area of Irish life in which it has not previously been active, at a time when it cannot meet its traditional commitments in other areas in which it has been active and from which it is now disengaging at considerable cost to the Exchequer and the general public.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the Minister can engage in the recruitment required to staff and run this new empire at a time when other public servants elsewhere in the public service are being made redundant at enormous cost.  There have been two and a half years of asking and paying people to leave the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to create a ten-person board to run the industry.  It is a typical Fianna Fáil response when they want to give an impression of doing something &mdash; to establish a review body, committee, commission, board or some other State or semi-State agency and then leave it to rot.  We have seen this approach <i>ad nauseam</i> in Health and other Departments. I do not have to remind the Minister of those other Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the bona fides of the present Minister with responsibility for horticulture or of the interim Bord Glas currently in existence.  However, I am well aware that the real Bord Glas may bear no relationship whatsoever to the interim board, that its future executive powers will bear no relationship to its current advisory powers and that future Ministers with responsibility for horticulture may bear no relationship to the present incumbent.  The board will have to acquire a new shiny headquarters, decked out in glass and brass, customary in the case of all new pyramids built as a result of decisions taken in this House, no doubt designer finished.  No doubt they will produce nice glossy reports <Col N="1344" /> which will gather dust, as hundreds of others are doing.  The Minister of the day will staff the board with his or her appointees.  Eventually the board will end up as a ministerial plaything.  We have seen a number of them over a period &mdash; a kind of expensive, executive toy, a ministerial vehicle designed to enhance the status of the Minister rather than the needs of the industry.  I do not think the Minister had those objectives in mind. Certainly the provisions of the Bill leave much to be desired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My third objection to the Bill is that it further fragments the overall agricultural industry already suffering from a severe, chronic dose of over-fragmentation. We must not forget that horticulture is an integral part of the agricultural industry.  The hiving off of individual sections into isolation cells will be detrimental in two ways.  First, it will allow other Government Departments, retailers and so on to engage in the tactic of divide and conquer.  Governments can forever favour one section over another, as circumstances permit, so that the various parts can never become a coherent whole, strong, unified voice to pressurise Government into getting worthwhile things done for any part of the industry. It is also a game that can be played indefinitely.  Ultimately, we can reach the farcical stage at which we may have a board for haymaking in a couple of years time, there being no other thought emanating from those smoke-filled rooms. There might even be a board for silage making.  We are all aware of the implications of these types of willy-nilly proposals emanating from backrooms at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second way in which such hiving off will be detrimental lies in the approach to the 1992 scenario with which we are faced &mdash; the big fruit co-operatives are not and will not be interested in single producers or single section purchasing. We must prepare for an era in which each truckload will deliver a multiplicity of <Col N="1345" /> products, meats, dairy products, fish and so on.  Our approach to growing and marketing must become more and more integral rather than increasingly fragmented.</P>
    <P>My fourth objection to the provisions of this Bill is that the functions of the proposed board will create an enormous amount of overlapping with existing agencies such as Teagasc, CTT, the Potato Marketing Board, just to mention those that spring to mind immediately.  It would be my fear that such overlapping would negative, if not subvert, the excellent work already being undertaken by those agencies.  There are at present no fewer than 16 different agencies involved in the business of promoting and selling Irish food and agricultural produce and it is quite incredible that this Government should wish to add a seventeenth.  I am sure there are other proposals afoot that will bring the number to 20 before the end of next year.</P>
    <P>The aims of the Bill can be met through such agencies as Teagasc and CTT.  My concern would be that at future food fairs abroad there will be a clutter of Irish sectoral stands to represent agencies such as CBF, Bord Bainne, Bord Glas and so on with resultant overlapping of functions and the waste associated with such overlapping and fragmentation.  I have information to the effect that in Cologne recently there were something in the region of 100 Irish representatives selling our products.  It is time we rationalised our effort, getting the same people to sell the truck loads of products I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>One of my most critical objections to the Bill lies in the fact that many provisions are excessive in several different ways.  For example, they are excessive and draconian in the range of powers proposed for the board to enable them discharge their role.  The provisions are also excessive in their range of statutory functions.  Indeed they constitute a far cry from the advisory role of the interim Bord Glas.  The provisions are excessive in that they afford the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> power to appoint and give undefined powers to certain unspecified officers whose role I suspect will be to <Col N="1346" /> conduct on-the-spot inspections of producers. Its provisions are excessive in that they impose levies on producers in order to fund the activities of the board controlled by the Minister.  In other words, the producer gets all the stick and the Minister keeps the carrot.  Its provisions are excessive also inasmuch as they introduce an undisclosed network of charges for services which will also go to the board.  Equally, they are excessive in allowing the board to sue clients through the courts in pursuit of such levies or charges and have those found guilty of non-payment of levies liable to a fine of anything up to £1,000.</P>
    <P>I have no coubt but that the Minister is creating a new class of criminal, the horticultural criminal, where none previously existed, with the spectacle of the law courts now being able to haunt anybody engaged in horticultural activity.  I do not think anybody would like to be on the record as having been the person who went after the poor fellow down the road who had been producing on the half to one acre, who happened to be selling the product and who found, lo and behold, he was not within the law in doing what he had done for years even before the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>My next objection lies in the confusion and chaos at present being created in the Department of Agriculture and Food with the introduction of this Bill.  At this point it is legitimate to ask: who is running the Department of Agriculture and Food?  Is it the Minister of State present or the Minister for Agriculture and Food himself, Deputy O'Kennedy?  It is ironic that the Minister of State has been given a new, expensive board at a time when his senior Minister is having boards under his control cut back to a point of paralysis. For example, Teagasc is being starved for cash.  There has been no head of horticulture appointed to the board of Teagasc since its formation.  If passed, this Bill will allow the senior Minister and his Department off the hook in terms of their overall responsibility, indeed answerability, for the industry as a whole.  Bord Glas is being advanced at present as a showpiece exercise in order <Col N="1347" /> to obtain more money from the EC for the board and the industry, money that should have been coming here anyway. This lobbying function, and all the others listed, should be retained by the Department.  Why do we want to duplicate that function having two people telephoning the same person in Brussels to ascertain the same information and results, which is what will be the function of this board?</P>
    <P>My next objection to the Bill stems from the fact that it also allows the Department of Agriculture and Food off the hook in terms of financing.  It appears that the senior Minister and his Government will renege on their duties and obligations to fund a significant portion of agricultural services, leaving them to be funded by general taxation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill seek to introduce a network of charges, levies and fines, all of which will be paid by the industry irrespective of whether one runs a 1,000 acre horticultural enterprise or works with a wheelbarrow in Moore Street.  If my reading of the provisions of the Bill is correct, they will render everybody liable to charges in some form or other.  Equally, the introduction of such charges will mean that existing charges and income will be transferred from Teagasc to An Bord Glas.  Furthermore, the Minister has given us no idea of the level of charges he will be creating, with the result that we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  This House is being asked to support proposals for the setting up of a new board which will be given wideranging powers to bring in charges and we are not going to be told what the charges are until such time as the board get their hands on the powers.  I do not think, in 1989, with the experience we have had in this House from introductions of other proposed charges and so on over the years, that this is the right way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The final irony is that producers are being asked to fund the board's activity whether they like it or not, thereby cutting off a large rod with which to beat <Col N="1348" /> themselves.  I cannot see any of the producers with whom I am in contact rushing out to buy a package whereby they will get all the pain while the Minister and the board get all the pleasure.  The Minister should think about that.</P>
    <P>Before I comment on the individual sections of the Bill, examine some paragraphs in order to seek further clarification, point out objectionable implications or suggest improvements in the crazy event of the Bill being passed, I would make an urgent plea to the Minister. I am convinced that the Bill's objectives to increase output, recover domestic market share, create jobs and maximise export potential are not going to be met through this proposed format.  There is grave danger of decreased output, a diminishing market share, fewer jobs and less exports as a result of the extra burdens, bureaucracy, charges, levies and penalties that the industry will have to carry as a direct result of this Bill.  I would urge the Minister to return to the drawing board, to take on board the objections that I and no doubt other Members of this House will put forward and to start afresh.  I would urge him to proceed along the following lines and if he does he will receive the total support of this party.</P>
    <P>We would accept an advisory board without executive functions and therefore without the need for charges and levies.  We favour the retention within the Department of Agriculture, on an in-house basis, of the board's proposed functions.  Towards that end, we would wish to see agencies such as Teagasc strengthened and the agricultural sector &mdash; for instance the industry in Kinsealy &mdash; reinforced.  That industry has been nearly closed.  If this is not your responsibility then it is your head man who has nearly closed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise that there are shortcomings within the industry due to the chronic past under-funding.  We accept that the industry must meet its obligations and put its own house in <Col N="1349" /> order.  Towards that end, we would support a statutory contribution from the industry on a section by section basis towards a horticultural board which would be controlled by the industry.  We would wish to see such moneys reinvested on a sectional basis on research, development and marketing along the same lines as the dairy levy which was originally administered by An Foras Talúntais.  It would be in the best interests of the industry for the Government to encourage, assist and facilitate such a development rather than impose a superstructure.</P>
      <P>There is a committee involved in spending the money that has been collected for a large number of years in one of our best industries which is recognised worldwide, the dairy industry.  The people who pay that levy have a say in where the money goes.  I cannot understand how we can propose a board with people appointed by the Minister without the industry who pays the piper having any say in the matter.  The industry can blame those people if they are not doing the job properly.  We are missing a golden opportunity in this regard.  The Minister present and the Minister for Agriculture and Food only have to look at events in the past to recognise the important way the different sections who are in control of their own destiny developed and improved over the years.</P>
      <P>I would like now to deal with some of the individual sections of the Bill which require comment, clarification, answer or amendment.  Section 1 deals with education including training.  Does this mean that the functions of education and training are being removed from Teagasc? Will An Bord Glas assume the functions of the advisory service and the Department of Agriculture and Food personnel who are involved at present in the area that the Minister is creating under this board?  Will the board assume the functions of the Potato Marketing Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the general functions of the board.  Would the Minister agree that these functions could be adequately provided by CTT, Teagasc, <Col N="1350" /> the Potato Marketing Board, the Irish Goods Council and other organisations which have been starved of funds by the Government in the recent past?  If these bodies had received sufficient funds over the period of years since the present Minister for Agriculture and Food came to office there would be no need to improve marketing because these bodies would have been well capable of doing the job.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 4 (2) would the Minister agree that the granting to the board of all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the purposes of its functions is the essence of totalitarianism? This is going back to the position where the big stick will be wielded at the industry and if they do not do certain things they will suffer the consequences in the courts.  Does the granting of such powers confer on the board the authority to close down other like-minded agencies which stand in their way?  In regard to section 5 (c) would the Minister agree that many of the board's activities under this subsection will be carried out in opposition to and in competition with other promotional agencies?  What, for instance, will be the future role of Dunsany Food Centre where Eolas and Teagasc are jointly researching new food products?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister telling me and this House that when this board is set up, with its executive powers, the chief executive will not be in a position to develop another agency to ensure that they can carry out all the work in research and development under their own auspices? There is nothing in this Bill to say that they must continue to use the present food centre which is only 25 months old. There is nothing to stop the board from developing a whole new structure in the area of food research and development. The chief executive can decide to carry out certain works and set up a new structure to look after all these areas.  Certainly, in so far as changes are concerned, that is one area that must be clarified and specific decisions made by this House in relation to the functions.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 5 (f), why is it necessary for the board to directly establish the journalistic empire required by <Col N="1351" /> this subsection?  Why is provision not made for work on commission or for contract work?  This is another example of where the board can decide &mdash; it is easy for the Minister to say they will not &mdash; to set up a whole journalist empire regarding their development and at an enormous cost.  We know at the end of the day, as stated in the latter part of the Minister's speech, who is going to pay the piper.  I believe there will be an overlapping of responsibilities given all the other agencies which do this work.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6, what properties does the Minister envisage being transferred to the board?  Are we talking about the transfer of the agricultural colleges owned by the Department of Agriculture and Food to the board?  What other properties is the Minister talking about?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that I have reviewed the issue of legislative protection for part-time workers in consultation with the social partners.  I share the concern expressed by Deputies that something must be done about the exclusion of a substantial number of regular part-time employees, generally those working fewer than 18 hours per week from the benefits of a range of labour laws.  My proposals for legislative reform are now at an advanced stage and I hope to have a Bill ready for introduction to the Oireachtas in the new year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the early part of the summer a number of conferences and discussions on this topic took place to bring the diverging views of both the Federated Union of Employers, as they were then, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions together. I do not think it is possible to get an equal view in this area but those discussions were certainly useful.  Further discussions were held quite recently.  I have circulated my proposals through the normal system within Government Departments. Next year I will have proposals but at this stage I do not want to be more precise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that aspect.  I am aware that debates have been held in the past on it.  One of the things that has been highlighted in the debate is that it suits many people to work part-time.  If we do not give people who work part-time legislative benefits <Col N="1355" /> there will be an attraction, I hope only to some, to stay outside the system.  We should seek to ensure that there will not be two codes where, first, full-time workers are well covered under proper regulations of employment and, second, part-time workers are not covered by the system.  It is my view, as I have stated publicly on a number of occasions, including at the conference between the FUE and the ICTU, that the present system militates against people playing it straight.  That is one of the considerations which will have to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider putting in a clause in any proposed legislation to the effect that the number of part-time workers in any place of employment should be <i>pro rata</i> to the number of people employed on a permanent basis?  At present all the supermarket chains, without exception, are able to provide cheap food simply because they use cheap labour and are able to avoid paying proper benefits to their part-time employees.  Does he not think that there should be a ratio of one part-time worker per ten permanent employees in any situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the Deputy, but the last time I answered that question in the positive I had two delegations from the two largest supermarkets in the country saying that they would rather be left alone.  There should be a ratio, but in some employment &mdash; I think this point has to be taken into account &mdash; it is not always possible.  I am not referring specifically to the supermarket area.  The Deputy knows the problem extends beyond supermarkets, to fast foods and other areas.  In some seasonal jobs it is not practical to do that.  In most cases part-time jobs are in the minority.</P>

      <P>There is a deliberate policy by some companies to employ the majority of their staff on a part-time basis.  As a result we will never get a reduction in the number of people <Col N="1357" /> unemployed.  We will not make significant inroads in the unemployment figures unless we tackle this problem and the Minister is prepared to tackle it head on regardless of how many deputations he has.  The whole area of part-time work is being abused.  The fast food sector is notorious.  In addition people are being paid on a flat rate when they work past midnight.

In a situation where women are being forced into the workforce by unemployment, it is disgraceful that their husbands suffer a reduction in their unemployment benefit or assistance by virtue of this ceiling of £50 on their wife's earnings.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the practice of many employers of setting upper age limits for job applications at a relatively low level; to the fact that this practice discriminates against many women who are trying to return to <Col N="1358" /> the workplace; and if he intends to take any steps to control such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many employers do set low upper age limits for recruitment to employment and that this causes difficulties for some older workers, including women, who wish to return to the labour market.</P>
      <P>While the employment equality legislation does not cover discrimination on grounds of age it has been established from cases taken under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, that age limits in relation to employment may, in certain circumstances, constitute indirect discrimination on the grounds of marital status.</P>
      <P>In some circumstances valid considerations such as job requirements and pension rights may be involved.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for specific legislation on this matter as I am not convinced that legislation is appropriate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Civil Service the Minister for Finance has promised to have the question of the application of upper age limits for recruitment examined in the context of an ongoing review of Civil Service recruitment policy which is being carried out by his Department.</P>
      <P>Finally, FAS, in its training and work experience programmes, pays special attention to the problems of older workers and includes specific measures to assist older women in their return to the labout market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dismayed and disappointed by the Minister's response. The Minister suggests that there are no plans to amend the legislation, but would he agree that the basic problem, particularly in the public sector is that grounding Act of 1949, which makes it obligatory to impose arbitrary low upper age limits on recruitment; in some instances the limit is 27 years.  Does that not require to be addressed by amending legislation if nothing else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of issues in this question.  There are two major reasons why employers and <Col N="1359" /> employees would rather that things stay as they are: first in relation to pension rights, there are major difficulties if people have not got their full years' service pension contributions in assessing what they should receive at retirement; second, in relation to promotional outlets, if one recruits at any age &mdash; and you can argue about what age you should stop recruiting &mdash; it militates against people who come in at a young age.  For example in the Civil Service, the local authorities or any area of the public service if people come in at age 20 and others come in at age 30 or 35, it takes up the promotional positions that would have been available.  This argument has gone on for years and quite frankly I can see both sides of the argument. I can see that people who were in a job would be at a grave disadvantage if people come in at a later stage.  On the other hand, while we do not have any proposals for legislative action, FÁS operate an extensive programme to try to get people into the workplace.  The &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; course and other courses which bring women, in particular, back into the work place have been very succesful.  We have been pursuing those courses with great success in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to FÁS, which the Minister has referred to on two occasions, would he not agree that there is a huge contradiction in the FÁS programmes of getting people back to work, in particular women who for family or other reasons have come out of the work force and who now find that they are militated against particularly in the public sector because of a statutory requirement. Is the Minister aware of a particular incident, which may have been drawn to his attention on my behalf through the Minister for Social Welfare, where a woman aged 36 who had worked for the local authority for the past 18 months now finds when the position is advertised that she is automatically excluded from applying for that job and must go back on the dole.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to the question, the Minister for Finance has said that he will look at the position and see what he can do in the Civil Service, but I think the two questions I raised have to be taken into account, that is pensions and the career structure.  FÁS pay particular attention to the needs of older unemployed women by providing courses for women on re-entry to the labour force.  The training in that area is aimed specifically at adult women who have had periods of interruption in their career.  I know that Deputy Barnes has spoken at length on this subject on other occasions.  The courses fall within the alternate programme category and women accounted for 67 per cent of participants in this category last year.  In all about 2,000 participated in the return to work course which was very successful.</P>
      <P>In some areas where they could seek work, people are debarred for the reasons I have stated earlier.  However it is not something that we can simply change because there are great objections from staff apart altogether from the employment and pension difficulties that arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in saying that pensions are a factor, but is he not aware that his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has promised over the past three years a pension scheme to deal with the inter-transferability of pensions, which is a great stifler of labour mobility.  This is causing not only women but men to be told that they are too old for employment at 35 years of age.  Would the Minister, first, undertake to press on his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, the urgency of a pensions Bill to deal with the inter-transferability of pension rights; second, would the Minister accept that another factor contributing to the problem raised                                                                                                                                 <Col N="1361" /> by Deputy McCartan is that people of 35 years tend to be married and have children?  Under the social welfare code they are paid for each of those children but they are not recognised for unemployment benefit purposes and there is no tax allowance for them.  Employers find it difficult to pay married people with children sufficient gross pay so that they will at least have the same net take-home pay as those on social welfare.  This point needs attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The national pensions plan has not been promised for just the past three years, I think there was a Green Paper on it in the mid-seventies. There is a need for this plan.  With regard to the question Deputy McCartan raised, the difficulty arises when a person's career is interrupted.  It is not transferability which is the problem; it is the fact that they do not have pension arrangements.  It is not simply a national pensions scheme which will resolve this problem.  However, in regard to labour market mobility I believe a national pensions scheme will help in due course.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the frustration of many women who have <Col N="1362" /> the benefit of the return to work course, which we all welcome, after the investment of FÁS and their own investment to build a continuing career because the exclusion Deputy McCartan referred to actively works against them?  Therefore, there seems to be waste on all levels.  Is the Minister also aware that the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights have recommended in their report entitled &ldquo;The Reintegration Of Women Into The Work Force&rdquo; that not alone should upper age limits be removed but that the Structural Funds should be used to ensure that women receive the benefit. There is a tremendous gap between what is happening at European level and here and surely we have to narrow this gap between now and 1992?</P>

      <P>Not from the labour market but from certain jobs.  I do not want to have to repeat this point again. There may be anomalies but the number of anomalies created in the promotional structures within the public sector &mdash; if we were to allow anyone of any age in &mdash; would be far greater, and I am discounting it and we will see what we can do.  Breaking up the structure in any part of the public service and having no upper age limit on people being recruited would create massive difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the question raised by Deputy Barnes.  With regard to the Employment Equality Act, while the age bar has not been in existence successful cases have been taken on the basis of marital status.  This is perhaps <Col N="1363" /> moving in line with some of the developments in Europe.  A successful case was taken in one of the health boards not too long ago.  To remove the bar altogether is not something we can do by legislative means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to change the regulations which limit a person's participation on the social employment scheme to 12 months.  To do so would result in fewer long-term unemployed getting a chance to participate in the scheme.  Also, it is not desirable that a scheme which was set up to provide one year's temporary placement should <Col N="1364" /> become a means of providing funding for permanent or quasi-permanent posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not concede that we have every right to feel disappointed with his reply in view of the fact that the initial break involved was one week, shortly afterwards it was extended to one month and now there is a required break in employment for a period of a year before a person can be re-employed?  In view of the fact that many people have enjoyed the dignity of work and been reinvigorated by it, are anxious to go back to work and there is so much work to be done and so many people to do it surely the Minister can bring in this minor accommodation to ensure that people can get back into useful employment within a relatively short period of time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that the break was always for a year.  You had to be unemployed for a year before you could go on to this scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, under the aegis of Deputy Enda Kenny the break was for one week, it was then extended to one month and it has been gradually extended to one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to contradict the Deputy but I understood it was always a year, and the reason for this was the very point made by the Deputy.  The social employment scheme, which is the main scheme for the long-term unemployed, was to invigorate people and motivate them to get back to work.  There are a great number of people in the long-term unemployed category&mdash; unfortunately there are over 100,000 &mdash; and all of those would be entitled, if they so wished, to participate in the social employment scheme.  There are around 10,600 places on the social employment scheme.  If people were allowed to have extensions all of the time it would change the nature of fairly low paid employment &mdash; it is only for two and a half days &mdash; and make it permanent.  It would add to the low paid work and we do not wish to <Col N="1365" /> do that.  There was a good agreement with the Congress of Trade Unions that people would go into that scheme and go out again.  However, there are some exceptions in areas where one cannot get suitable people.  The only area where we have allowed this is on the islands where they cannot get other people.  Other than that there are always additional people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not acknowledge that the margin of income between somebody on social welfare and somebody on a social employment scheme is so minimal that it would make good sense to employ somebody at a marginally higher income than on the previous level of social welfare and that therefore, a remodification or amendment should be looked at in this context? Would the Minister not also acknowledge that the placement offices with the National Manpower Service, that is FÁS, are inundated with people who are only too anxious to get back onto a scheme whereby they can be employed again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins raised that point with me before.  We have got approval from the Department of Finance where people coming off the social employment scheme may now qualify for the employment incentive scheme without having to return to the live register.  This does help.  If an employer wishes to recruit a person he can employ him straight from the social employment scheme.  Under the old system those people would have had to revert to the register and then onto the social employment scheme.  This is an improvement.</P>

      <P>With the cutbacks in local authorities this has been a fairly successful scheme.  However, there is an anomoly.

      <P>I will look at that point for the Deputy.  Normally if there is a big divergence it is looked at because the new people being taken on will have to have 52 weeks employment.  That is the reason for the difficulty.  Any individual coming off the register who goes on a social employment scheme must be guaranteed 52 weeks employment.  Our experience is that many people who get back into the work ethic obtain jobs.  I will look at that aspect.</P>

      <P>The discussion document which I published in November 1987 dealt, among other matters, with the options for change in relation to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  Following receipt of the observations of the FIE and the ICTU and other interests on the issues raised, a review of the legislation has taken place in my Department.  Arising from the review, I hope to put proposals for legislative action before the Government shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread practice in industry and in the services of circumventing the terms of the Act by terminating employment in advance of the one year required by the Act, by setting specific short-term contracts and generally avoiding the legislation provisions by the repetition of these short-term contracts and dismissing people at will?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time I have received representations in regard to some firms who do that, but I am not <Col N="1367" /> aware of any large number of employers circumventing the provisions of the Act in this way.  The Deputy referred to the one year period.  That is the length of time employers feel they need to judge an employee.  I know the Congress of Trade Unions and others would like that to be a far shorter period, whereas employers' organisations argue that it should be double that.  I consider that a year is not unreasonable.  Six months to a year were always probationary periods in employment.</P>
      <P>On the second point raised by the Deputy, I have noticed an increase in the setting of short-term contracts and that is a matter that we are keeping an eye on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>In addition, does the Minister not agree that people working less than 18 hours a week are the most vulnerable to dismissal, the most unprotected, in many cases not in membership of trade unions?  The fact that the Act does not cover people who work less than 18 hours per week is a major defect in the Act.  Does the Minister intend to address that specifically when he brings forward the proposals he has mentioned?  Can the Minister give me a more specific idea of when we might expect such proposals?</P>

This is almost exactly the same question but does not ask for a county <Col N="1369" /> by county breakdown and therefore has been permitted on to the Order Paper.

      <P>In view of the fact that there is a saving to the Exchequer in the region of £20 million by reason of non-payment of social welfare entitlements to people who, if they did not emigrate, would be in receipt of such, would the Minister not give consideration to increasing the amount by £0.5 million, bearing in mind that what they are offering these young people is nothing more than fugitive status in another country? There is a need for better advice to people <Col N="1370" /> who emigrate.  Many of them are sleeping rough in London.  They are treated like fugitives in the US and Australia and are under constant threat of being deported. All we can do is offer £0.5 million which is totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>On the first question, my remit covers Great Britain; I am not responsible for the other areas which are under the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The DÍON grants go primarily to organisations employing professional workers operating frontline emergency services for emigrants arriving without accommodation and/or employment. They involve themselves in information projects, examining the needs of disadvantaged emigrants and ventures which link voluntary bodies with the local authorities to try to get money from the various statutory agencies in Britain. During my period in office the funds have gone up substantially but I keep in very close touch with DÍON and the money we receive is usefully employed by the various emigrant organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is one of the myths of modern Irish society that all of our young people forced to emigrate are well educated and that in fact a great many of them are ill-equipped to fend for themselves? Having regard to the scale of the problem which is worse than at any time since the low point of the mid-fifties, does the Minister agree that the provision of £500,000 is a pittance and completely inadequate in terms of the circumstances <Col N="1371" /> that these young people find themselves in as a result of our inability to provide them with work at home?</P>

      <P>The real solution is to try to provide work at home.  The DÍON grants are not aimed at resolving all the problems and difficulties but to give money to professional social workers to assist these people.  Since 1986 my predecessor and I have started programmes using the statutory agencies, including the education system, FÁS and others, to advise against ill-prepared emigration. There has been a decrease in the number of people calling to the centres.  There is no doubt that there are hardship cases but the number is not great.  I have been to the centres and to the agencies on many occasions and I accept that problems exist but the substantial increase in the financial assistance to them has been of great help.

      <P>The agreements on pay negotiated in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided that in October, 1988 discussions would take place at national level between the Government, the FIE, the CIF and the ICTU on a general framework to allow for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours over the three year period of the national programme in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions resulted in the successful conclusion of an agreement.  The agreement provides a framework within which employers and unions may negotiate a reduction of one hour per week. <Col N="1372" /> These negotiations are to be carried on at the level at which basic pay and conditions of employment are normally negotiated.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place in this context and agreement has already been reached in many cases.  Any further reduction in working hours would, of course, be primarily a matter for negotiation between the relevant interests.</P>

      <P>Yes, and that is why <Col N="1373" /> during the negotiations on the <i>Programme for National Revovery</i> we supported the efforts by the trade unions to have that clause included.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to urge both sides to come to an agreement on this issue.  However, I do not have any reason to be unhappy at this stage.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that we have one of the highest average working weeks in Europe, more than 42 hours, and that, according to the latest OECD report, Norway 15 down to 29 hours per week?  Will he agree that it is absurd to talk about reducing the working week to 39 hours?  We should be targeting a 32-hour week which would eliminate perhaps three-quarters of our unemployment.</P>

Will the Minister accept that it is time, as the negotiated working week tends to be in the region of 40 hours per week, to change the law? Will he accept that the 48-hour working week is out of date and that there is a need to update the law because of that?</P>

In the old days we issued regulations for all kinds of things and it does not suit both sides to remove them all.  As soon as I get a positive response I will set about removing about seven-eighths of what is in those old laws.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if it is the Government's policy that the proposed EC Social Charter to strengthen workers' rights should be binding on member states; if it is <Col N="1374" /> intended to take any steps to create an awareness among Irish workers of the proposals of the charter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The proposed Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights which the European Council will be asked to adopt at their meeting next month is not legally binding.  This was never the intention of the Commission.</P>
      <P>One must draw a distinction between the charter, which will be a solemn political declaration, and the Commission's proposed Action Programme which will be based on the Treaty.  That Action Programme will be available towards the end of November.  It is at that point that the areas on which legally binding rights are proposed, will become more clear.  In the meantime, I would like to inform this House that the Government support a charter incorporating political commitments subject to our obtaining satisfaction on certain details.</P>
      <P>In light of the general awareness particularly on the part of trade unions and employers' organisations, about the proposals, it will not be necesary for me to take any special steps but I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification of the Government's thinking on the Social Charter of Fundamental Social Rights.  Surely fundamental social rights have to be guaranteed in law; otherwise they are pointless.  All other international social charters that deal with rights are obligatory on countries when they sign the charters. Such countries are then obliged to enforce those rights through laws.  If we accept the Social Charter in whatever shape it emerges in December will we be obliged to implement the terms of that charter in law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should like to clarify once and for all what the position is.  The Social Charter has passed from <Col N="1375" /> the Social Affairs Council with the positive support of this country.  At all discussions since January I supported the Social Charter.  The Action Programme will be produced a short time before the Strasbourg Summit and I hope all member states will agree to the charter at that Summit.  That may not happen but it certainly will have the support of the Irish Government.  Before that Summit for consideration will be the Action Programme and following that the programme will be presented to the Social Affairs Council, presumably during the Irish Presidency.  As President of that Council I will not delay it.  The various sections of the charter will then come before us to be introduced by resolution, regulation, directive or common position.  We will be supporting that process. The intention of the Commission, as emerged during the course of discussions, is that the various sections of the charter should be agreed between now and 1992.  The Deputy is familiar with the charter and I am sure he will accept that the flesh of the sections has not been worked out.  However, that will follow in the resolutions and we will be supporting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is on record as stating that the Government do not support the concept of a mandatory minimum wage to be applied through the Social Charter.  He has argued that the collective bargaining process which has existed here has been satisfactory, a point with which I disagree because many people who are employed are living below the poverty line.  Apart from that aspect is it not the case that having agreed the Social Charter, countries will be free to pick and choose the bits and pieces they agree with for implementation while ignoring the sections they do not agree with?  If that is the case we will reach the stage where there will be no Community advance in social rights, no levelling of rights or conditions for people at work, the unemployed, pensioners and so on because member states will be able to opt <Col N="1376" /> out, depending on the position of their national legislatures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrary is the position.  The reason I put down some markers was because it has always been the practice here, particularly in regard to ILO regulations, that when we sign any agreement we implement its terms in law.  At the meetings last weekend there were four remaining points with which I was concerned.  One of these would involve a fundamental difficulty for the social partners and the Government and I will put that forward very strongly.  The others are not major sticking points but I want to see major clarification of what exactly we are committed to.  One is the point the Deputy mentioned but I think we can get clarification on these four points.  I am not too sure about the closed shop, which causes great difficulties for all our social partners.  We have not yet got any undertaking on that.  On the other points, which are not major issues, between now and Strasbourg we will get agreement.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that any right thinking, social democratic person would welcome the aspirations of the Social Charter?  On that basis it has been welcomed throughout the Community except perhaps in Britain.  Would he comment on the point made that the motivation for the Social Charter from the Central European countries has been not to enhance social rights but more to ensure that all Community countries have the same social costs so that any benefits that peripheral countries have in relation to creation of employment or the attraction of investment are vetoed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is correct to a point.  That is the reason that in the discussions I was arguing a point that I think is now in the charter, that in regard to what happens, what is implemented, and in regard to equalisation &mdash; we mentioned this in the debate on the NESC report last week &mdash; you have to take account of the strategic <Col N="1377" /> economic and social cohesion and the regional imbalances of the countries, otherwise everyone is asked to go to the top overnight.  They were the points of reservation I was arguing on Monday last, and we are more or less happy with them. As I said, there is still one outstanding point but I hope between now and 8 December we will be able to clear it up.  We will be positively supporting the charter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government at this time trying to weaken the charter in order to meet the needs as perceived by them of business and industry in Ireland as distinct from trying to improve the charter, in other words to upgrade the charter and the rights of the people to a relatively high level?  The statement that worries me most is that if we apply social rights across the board to Ireland in particular this will in some way make us unattractive for industry and investment here.  Is this not implying that workers' wages, rates, conditions of pay and conditions of work can and should be used as bargaining counters between countries to attract investment?  If so, it is a defeat before we start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention. There are concerns.  All member states have different aspects of charters. Perhaps one country last week just put in a reservation to the whole charter.  My proper function is to ensure that what we agree to we can implement and that we are not doing what the Deputy said at the outset, agreeing to something and then having no intention of implementing it. The Irish Government for years ahead will do all they can to implement the charter.  Sometimes people in other member states agree to very grandiose plans on safety and health and other regulations but then do not attempt to implement them.  We have taken a different view.  Wherever we have in principle or outline agreed on any proposals we have set about implementing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the historic significance of May Day, it is not intended at this stage to declare any additional public holidays.  In the current economic climate, the priorities of the Government in relation to employment are concentrated on implementing policies which will lead to the preservation of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs.  The declaration of an additional public holiday, which would directly increase employment costs, would not be compatible with that strategy.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.

The profitability of Irish industry is there to be seen in the export of capital back to the parent countries of the multinationals at an incredible rate.  I do not accept that we can ill-afford to celebrate Labour Day on 1 May.  Given that we are full members of the EC now and so many common policies are developing, we will be left out on a limb yet again if we do not at least recognise that the working class of Europe celebrate May Day.  To leave us out in the cold would isolate us yet again within Europe.  When one looks at the public holidays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have great sympathy and respect for all May Day, Labour Day, stands for.  However, the stark reality which faces me as Minister for Labour is that on approximated costs it would cost £50 million to industry to make that day a bank holiday.  That is the difficulty I have.  The sheer cost is the only difficulty. Perhaps in the not too distant future if the economy continues to grow and expand and unemployment comes down I may be able to do something on the lines suggested.  My first priority at this stage has to be to those who have no job.  I have nothing whatever against the principle of May Day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 25 together.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was agreed in November 1987 and is now two years into its three year life span.  With another year still to run it is too early at this stage to begin the process of negotiating a further agreement.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have asked for a meeting with the Government to discuss the operation of the programme and have also arranged a special delegate conference for early next year to consider the programme.</P>
      <P>In order to build on the progress made to date the Government consider the negotiation of a further programme to be essential.  A major strength of the current programme is that it has involved all the main social partners in a consensus approach to tackling the problems facing the economy.</P>
      <P>It should be recalled that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was negotiated at a time of economic crisis when confidence was at a very low level.  The programme has been directly responsible for the transformation which has taken place over the past two years and has led to the creation of stability and confidence in the economy.  In turn, this has created an economic climate conducive to growth and investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay agreements concluded in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have provided for stability in pay bargaining over the past two years and have made a major contribution to the present situation where the incidence of industrial disputes is at an all time low.  The pay agreements provided for pay increases of roughly 2.5 per cent in each of the years 1988, 1989 and 1990.  In addition, there was a Government commitment to introduce income tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of the programme, of £225 million, including an increase in the PAYE allowance costing £70 million. Within that context, the Government undertook to make significant progress <Col N="1383" /> towards having two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate by adjustment of the 35 per cent band.</P>
    <P>Income tax reductions costing £91 million in 1988 and £152 million in a full year were introduced in the 1988 budget.  The personal and PAYE allowances were increased, while the standard rate 35 per cent tax band and the 48 per cent rate tax band were both widened, and the general tax exemption limits were increased.  As a result of these measures, nearly 63 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the standard rate during the 1988-89 income tax year.</P>
    <P>The 1989 budget introduced further income tax reductions, costing £121.67 million in 1989 and £202.8 million in a full year.  The standard rate of tax was reduced to 32 per cent, while the top rate of tax was also reduced; both the standard rate and 48 per cent rate bands were widened.  In addition, the general and age exemption limits were increased and a child addition of £200 per child was introduced in conjunction with them.</P>
    <P>On a cumulative basis, the total value of income tax reliefs announced in the 1988 and 1989 budgets is over £700 million, more than three times the £225 million overall commitment contained in the programme.  Specifically, the increase of £100 in the PAYE allowance introduced in 1988 will cost significantly more than the £70 million undertaking in the programme.</P>
    <P>There was a significant moderation in the rate of inflation during 1988; the annual average figure of 2.1 per cent was the lowest increase in consumer prices recorded since 1960.  The annual average rate of inflation in 1989 is now expected to be around 4 per cent.  Thus, taking the two years, 1988 and 1989 together, inflation will have been broadly in line with expectations in the programme.</P>
    <P>Given the combined effects of the standard pay increases and the substantial reductions in income tax there have been marked improvements in real take home pay over the last two years.  This improvement in real take home pay cumulatively ranges from 1 per cent to over 5 per cent taking the two years together.  On the <Col N="1384" /> basis of average earnings in manufacturing industry, increases in real take home pay range from 3½ per cent to 7 per cent.  This clearly demonstrates that the living standards of workers have been more than protected to date.</P>
    <P>A central aim of the programme was to put the country back on a path to sustained long-term growth, especially in order to expand the numbers at work. The scale of job creation achieved so far has been considerable.  At a minimum, 29,000 new jobs were created in 1988 and a similar number are expected to be created this year.</P>
    <P>The preliminary results of the latest sample survey of the labour force, released last week by the Central Statistics Office, indicate that the total number at work in the economy in April last was 1,090,000.  This estimate, while somewhat below expectations and not significantly different from that for April 1988, confirms the considerable underlying improvement in employment trends over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Total employment in April last was 10,000 higher than in April 1987 when present economic policies began to be implemented; this upturn compares with a 76,000 drop over the preceding seven years.  The strength of non-farm private employment is very encouraging: it appears to have grown by well over 30,000 in the period April 1987 to April 1989 when one takes into account the 20,000 jobs shed in the public sector as a whole during that period and the fact that the numbers on FÁS employment schemes fell by almost 5,000 in the year to April, 1989.</P>
    <P>In interpreting the overall employment figures a number of factors must, therefore, be considered, notably the necessary reduction in numbers in the public sector, fluctuations in participation in special employment schemes and the falling trend in agriculture.  When these are taken into account, it is clear that the number of self-sustaining jobs has increased dramatically over the past two years by between 30,000 and 40,000.  This reflects growing economic confidence <Col N="1385" /> and demonstrates that the ongoing process of budgetary adjustment has been beneficial for long term growth in employment.</P>
    <P>A particularly striking feature is the upturn in growth in industrial employment. In the year to last April, there was an increase of 6,000 in the number at work in manufacturing, and figures published by the CSO for the June quarter this year show that the positive trend has continued since April.</P>
    <P>It is against this background of increased levels of job creation, improvements in living standards and a stable environment for investment and business expansion that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> must be evaluated.  It is most unlikely that the progress which has been achieved in all these areas would have been possible in the absence of a programme which enjoyed the involvement and support of all sectors of the economy.  To return to a point I made at the outset, I feel that if we are to reap the maximum benefit of the ground work which has been done to date and build on this sound foundation then the conclusion of a further programme based on the consensus approach is essential.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister why, in his reply, he did not refer to the fact that inflation has been rising again since the agreement was concluded, that since the agreement was reached we have had the highest yearly emigration figures in 30 years, and that he did not, except in passing, refer to the fact that there are fewer people in employment today than there was a year ago, notwithstanding all the smog the Minister is trying to create? Would the Minister now accept that the existing agreement with all its benefits &mdash; and there have been benefits &mdash; has signally failed to create jobs?  Would he now commit himself and the Government <Col N="1386" /> to seeing that any agreement that replaces it has the first and foremost objective of setting right our tragic emigration and unemployment statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did at length deal with the question of inflation.  Firstly, the figures taken over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> show that there have been very substantial increases in take home pay when the tax and pay elements are taken together as against what the consumer price index shows.  Secondly, it is a well known fact &mdash; and it has happened in every economy that has tried to get out of major difficulties &mdash; that there is a time lag between correcting the finances, and trying to stimulate growth into the economy and when the job creation improves. That has happened here.  There have been a number of reports from different sectors of industry recently, mainly the manufacturing and the construction industries, which show an increase in the number of jobs up to a certain level. Because we were trying to slim down our public service, and that involved a voluntary redundancy package, the figures between April 1988 and April 1989 were reflected in the labour force survey. I have said publicly on a number of occasions that I am still disappointed that the private sector, in particular, have not generated more employment.  The answer the private sector have given &mdash; and in fairness I must state what they say because I have discussed employment with them on numerous occasions as have other members of the Government, particularly those Ministers involved in Industry and Finance &mdash; is that there was slack, that they were carrying part of the workforce during the recession years. They have now absorbed that capacity and from now on they should be taking on additional workers.  I accept the figures of the CSO but I want to remind the House that initially there was a figure of 6,000 which later rose to 11,000.  I will be disappointed if there is not a substantial improvement in the figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That means the real unemployment figure is in excess of 300,000.  Will he, therefore, agree that the central purpose of the agreement to get growth in employment has failed and that any substitute for this in the agreement or its renegotiation should be directed at producing the jobs it forecast but which have not materialised?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The number of redundancies notified to my Department under the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts in the first nine months of 1989 was 10,637.  This represents decreases of 36.9 per cent and 41.1 per cent on the figures for the corresponding periods of 1987 and 1988 when the figures were 16,856 and 18,048 respectively.</P>
      <P>If the average monthly figure for 1989 to date is maintained for the remainder of the year, the 1989 total of notified redundancies should be in the region of 14,000 which would be the lowest annual total since 1979.  In fact, the annual total may be somewhat less, as even within the 1989 figures there has been an encouraging downward monthly trend.  The 1989 figure will certainly represent an enormous improvement on the totals of redundancies notified to my Department in the previous two years which amounted to 23,037 in 1988 and 24,090 in 1987.</P>

      <P>The Minister is trying to prove by his figures that there is a downward trend in the number of people being made redundant.  However, we have now pared our workforce to the bone which reflects no credit on the Government.  Many very profitable companies &mdash; for instance, the two major banking groups &mdash; are now replacing people who were in receipt of a good salary with workers who are paid less. Many of these companies are in the public sector and are grant-aided.  Although they are profitable they are still shedding staff and the time has come to update the legislation which came into effect in 1977. Under the Employment Protection Act the maximum fine which can be imposed for breaching its provisions is £500 under section 18&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to a recent report, published by the Employment Equality Agency, which showed that Irish women workers still earn well below the male average and that women were still predominantly in lower paid jobs; if he intends to take any action to improve this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report on women in the labour force to which the Deputy refers.  The report indicates that while the average earnings of women remain considerably below those of men, the slow but steady improvement of the index for women across all industries is being maintained.  The differences in the earnings shown between men and women result from a wide range of factors including wage rates, hours worked, overtime payments, shift or unsocial hours premia, payments by results, bonuses for output levels and payments for length of service. <Col N="1390" /> In addition, as the report points out, average earnings only are available, and as such, it is not possible to identify the extent to which the data conceal variation in earnings.</P>
      <P>The solution to the unacceptable differential in pay between men and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone but in improved access for women to a wider range of jobs.  Nevertheless, there are a number of changes which I propose to make to the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, in the context of the general review of the employment equality legislation.  These changes will simplify, and make more effective, the procedures for the pursuit of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
      <P>Legislation alone will not totally solve the women's employment problem and that has also proved to be the situation in other countries.  We must look towards improved training, positive action and ensure that our educational system does not discriminate on the basis of sex. Action is being taken in each of these areas.  FÁS have as a priority over the next few years to increase and broaden the range of job opportunities available to women in the labour market.</P>
      <P>On positive action, the Government have adopted and will be monitoring positive action policies in the Civil Service and State-sponsored bodies.  The Employment Equality Agency's recent video on the nature of employment in the electronics industry and the avenues leading to such employment is a good illustration of positive action.</P>
      <P>A code of practice on positive action has been published by the Employment Equality Agency and I would take this opportunity to draw the attention of employers to it.  It is in employers' own interest that they use the talents of all their employees and this is now even more important in the context of increased competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards education, it is the ongoing policy of the Department of Education to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in the educational field.  This is stressed at pre-service and in-service training courses for teachers.  The issue has been <Col N="1391" /> examined in the context of the review of the curriculum at first and second levels. The level of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials at primary level is being examined and a number of measures have been initiated to encourage the take up by girls of nontraditional subject choices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 700,000 women &mdash; according to this report &mdash; employed on home duties because there is no provision for child care facilities in industry or services.  Has the Minister any proposals to tackle this problem because it puts us at the bottom of the OECD table for participation by women in the workforce?  Does the Minister consider, as he seems to have suggested, that it is satisfactory progress for women to earn 67 per cent of the average male earnings whereas, three years ago, the figure was 66 per cent?  In those circumstances, to reject &mdash; as he seems to have done &mdash; the concept of a legal minimum wage is to ensure that many of these women will continue to live in the poverty trap at or below the poverty line because of the low wages paid to them compared to men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>All our agents are actively involved in trying to improve the position in this regard.  The main reason for the low level of pay is that too many women have not had the opportunity of getting into what was considered for too long to be male-dominated professions. There is only 17 per cent of women in the executive and higher administrative grades.  They are still involved in factory work in clothing and textiles in the unskilled areas.  The drive in our training schools and education schemes must be to give them the opportunities.  That is what the Department of Education policy is through the schools and what FÁS policy is through the training courses.  It is only by doing that progressively that we will change something that has been there for generations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I went through a number of sections and asked a number of questions about the Bill but there is another point I want clarified.  It relates to the question mark over the legality in EC terms of a statutorily imposed levy in order to encourage and assist in the production and marketing of horticultural products.  I wonder about the overall position with regard to EC law.  It is another aspect of the proposal that has not been thought out and which was not dealt with in the Minister's address to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister envisages the transfer of property to the board.  What property has he in mind?  Is it intended that the agricultural colleges owned by the Department of Agriculture and Food will be transferred to the board, or are other properties involved?  The House is entitled to know the proposals on this.</P>
      <P>I had grave reservations about the setting up of ACOT.  The ratepayers provided fine offices for the staff of ACOT and Teagasc and within a short space of time, with the introduction of a Bill here, all of those offices were taken over free gratis and for nothing by the new board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred already to my fear that <Col N="1439" /> the functions of this new board will overlap those of existing agencies such as CTT and Teagasc.  The functions of the new board are covered in some detail in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill.  Bearing in mind that we are talking about a party and Government who over the past two and a half years have been impressing on us the importance of rationalisation, thereby effecting savings, and the enormous amounts of money involved in redundancy and early retirement payments to public servants, I find it hard to believe that they are now setting up another puppet, another agency, whose functions will overlap or duplicate those already in existence.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether the provisions of section 8 (2) remove all responsibility from Teagasc for the horticultural industry.  In the course of talks and negotiations at one point the Minister inferred that Teagasc would be foremost in organising and developing the horticultural industry. Yet a decision was taken at Government level &mdash; whether by the Taoiseach or somebody else &mdash; to establish this new Bord Glas so that Teagasc will no longer be actively involved in this area.  I should like the Minister to state what is the exact position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 9 provide that the board may consult other persons but, of course, there is no obligation on such persons to pay any attention to the wishes of the board.  What other people has the Minister in mind with a view to such consultations?  What consultation will take place?  If there is no such consultation will the board go ahead and do their own thing since it would appear that is what will happen anyway?  I should like to ascertain the exact position in this regard also.  For example, will Bord Glas have any role to play in the disbursement of EC moneys?  Furthermore, is it intended that the board will be responsible for the interests of growers they represent with regard to their aspirations to <Col N="1440" /> develop and/or seek grants?  I predict that will lead to somebody in the Department of Agriculture and Food telephoning a counterpart in the EC daily&mdash;as happens now &mdash; with somebody else in Bord Glas performing the same task.  I have already referred to the soft sell.  Certainly Bord Glas personnel who have been operating in the field over the past year or so have been contending that there are extra grants, of 66.5 per cent or whatever, available to get growers' proposals up and running.  They have been contending that they will be in touch with growers in an endeavour to help them to the maximum extent.  It would appear that this is a soft sell to a small percentage of growers with whom Bord Glas have been in contact.  I have no doubt but that there will be abundant overlapping here.  I do hope the Minister will answer my queries when replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 11 would the Minister say what are the services for which charges are to be imposed, what will be the rates of such charges and on whom is it envisaged they will be levied? There was no reference in the course of the Minister's introductory remarks to the amounts of such charges.  Indeed he contended that it would be wrong to speculate on their amount.  Surely the industry should be informed of what charges will be imposed on them henceforth. We are all aware of many producers having gone out of business on account of having made little profits or whatever over the years.  I hope the House will be given some additional information in this respect.</P>
    <P>Neither is it clear from a reading of the provisions of section 7 whether it is proposed to give the new board power to impose charges for services on people who do not use those services.  If one relates this to another area in which there are charges for services rendered recently we find there was a court case when somebody in the Minister's own constituency brought a local authority to court.  The                                                                                                                                  <Col N="1441" /> particular appellant had not used the relevant service.  The court ruled that he did not have to pay for the service even though he had been compelled to do so for the same service over several years. Is it maintained, with regard to the provisions of this section, that somebody who does not use the services, such as, say, a producer, will have to pay?  This is such a grey area these matters will have to be thrashed out thoroughly.  The Minister has not given the House any idea of what will happen in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 12 (1) who will be empowered to collect the levies to be imposed?  Will those levies be compulsory on all sections of the industry, including those people who sell produce in, say, Moore Street, to whom I referred earlier? Is the Minister satisfied that the provisions of this and other sections are in accordance with the Treaty of Rome? Are we within our rights in that regard? Will there be similar levies imposed on imported goods?  Can anybody tell us? Will the importer have to pay?  Will there be a levy imposed on Irish goods for export?  If that were to be the case it would render us less competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our produce on foreign markets.  There is an enormous number of questions needing to be answered.  Therefore, we must ask if Members of this House, other than the relevant spokespersons, are aware of the seriousness of the proposals involved here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions of section 12 (2) one may well ask whether producers, importers and wholesalers will be liable equally for such levies.  Indeed will retailers be liable for levies?  Also will street or roadside traders or hawkers be liable for such payments?  Will levies be imposed at the point of entry?  If we are to have a coherent policy with regard to such levies, are we talking about every pound of every vegetable sold in this State being liable to the same type of levy?  Or indeed is it proposed that there will be levies imposed at the point of production?  For example, how does the <Col N="1442" /> Minister envisage that a second or subsequent seller will not be responsible for the type of levies incurred by the first seller?  Does the Minister agree that ultimately it is the consumer who bears the brunt of such levies?  At the end of the day we must remember that, no matter which area one talks about, whenever a levy is imposed on any produce or commodity, it leads to an increased price to be paid by the consumer.  It can have no other outcome than lead to increased inflation.  If we are realistic about the imposition of levies on products equally we realise that is the inevitable result.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 12 (4), we have not been informed of the rates involved. Will all the people I have mentioned who are involved in the horticultural industry be charged different rates?  If a particular levy is imposed will it refer only to Irish products or will it refer to all products? The large supermarket chains and shops selling a majority of imported products can increase their prices to the same level as those of the Irish products thereby making extra money out of this proposal. There are many grey areas in these proposals and I am sorry to say that none of them has been dealt with in the Minister's address today.  Will any person be exempt from the obligation of paying levies?  At present no one knows but within three, five or six months after the setting up of this board, we will all know.  There will probably be a 2 per cent increase in the rate of inflation because of these proposals.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the authorised officers.  What powers will they have? Will they be akin to the sheriff or the customs and excise personnel?  That is another very important aspect of the proposal that I believe Members should be aware of before we vote on this Bill.  The Minister did not refer in his speech to the actual position and I regret having to say that what we are proposing here will result in new types of criminals &mdash; horticultural criminals.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to the employment <Col N="1443" /> of a chief executive officer.  If this proposal is accepted I would like to think the chief executive officer would be employed on a contract basis outside the scope of public service pay regulations. If we are in earnest about developing a board to run, improve and develop the horticultural industry, is the Minister seriously suggesting that someone on a salary of £24,000 per annum should run such an important enterprise as the Government have proposed?  In the last two and a half years some of our best civil servants have been paid twice that amount to leave the system.  Are we in earnest when we propose somebody of this grade for such a worthwhile job, somebody who should be dynamic and should lead the field?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that these points are made on Second Stage because I hope the Minister will take time to discuss the matters with the industry before this Bill becomes law.  I want to make that point but I do not want to labour it.  I believe that the chief executive officer should be an <i>ex officio,</i> nonvoting member of the board.  The right person should be employed under contract for a specific period.  That is the only way we will be able to get rid of that person if he is not doing a good job. Under the proposal in the Bill, if the person employed does not carry out the job properly there will be a problem in getting rid of him as chief executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 16, would the Minister agree that the Bill is designed to remove personnel from the payroll of the Department of Agriculture and Food and other Departments and to transfer them to the jurisdiction of An Bord Glas where they will be paid by the horticultural <Col N="1444" /> industry?  The Minister did not mention the cost of running An Bord Glas.  All of us in this House should be informed of that on a year to year basis.  Every section that is added to that board will cost more money.  It is stated in the Bill that the board will be funded for the first year until they get up and running, impose charges and so on, but after that they are on their own.  The industry pays the piper following the first year's work.  We should be informed of the level of costs envisaged by the Minister to run the board.</P>
    <P>Section 21 requires that the accounts of the board are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  I wonder if this work could be given to an accountancy firm.  From my experience, I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General has so much work to do that there is a substantial backlog. It is important that the annual accounts be made available within three months of the end of the accounting period in order that those who fund the activities of this board will know what exactly is happening within the board.  We are all aware of the consequences of a delay in publishing accounts and the problems which could accrue as a result and which may not be addressed until it is too late.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Schedule, which contains a provision which would allow the Minister to appoint his five appointees, can the Minister tell us why it is also necessary for him to decide on the five appointees from the horticultural industry? Why is it not possible for the Minister to appoint five people nominated by the industry, the members of which will pay the levy?  Why does the Minister want to retain sole responsibility for appointing the ten members of this board?  I do not believe that the present proposal is acceptable to the organisations involved. The people who will pay the levies and charges to be introduced, will have no say in how that money is spent in the development of the horticultural industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal to change <Col N="1445" /> the board after three years does the Minister envisage there being continuity?  I am sure it would be the view of previous Ministers that it is important that there be continuity.  I hope amendments will be accepted on Committee Stage to meet some of the points which I have made on the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points which the Minister made to which I would like to refer.  In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In addition to those bodies there are, moreover, the producers who are a most important element in the development process and the wholesale and retail merchants who have a very important part to play....</P>
    <P>There would be no industry without the producer.  I honestly believe, on the basis of what the Minister has said here, that the producer is not getting fair play.  All that is happening here is that the producer &mdash; those who have survived &mdash; is being patted on the back for being the top man in his job but at the same time we are not prepared to give him any say in the running of this board as proposed. The Minister also referred to producer groups a few of which have been set up. I am delighted about this.  My predecessor in this portfolio was the man who went about setting up such producer groups.  We may not have as many as we would like but in relation to the potato producer groups to which the Minister referred I would hope that only small numbers will be involved.  The Minister spoke about a minimum number of ten but I believe that in rural areas it may not always be possible to have such a number.  If this number could be reduced to five I would see a far greater number of producers getting involved in producer groups.  I would like the Minister to refer to this matter when replying and to indicate if it is EC policy and if he would be willing to go back to try to get this number reduced.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister also referred <Col N="1446" /> to the hardy nursery stock sector.  He stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>The hardy nursery stock sector is making progress here and has, for some time now, been endeavouring to establish itself in a strong position on the British market where there is great scope for this business.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe we are talking about this sector in the context of exports.  On the home market, this sector has enormous potential, if there is proper planning of the sale of hardy nursery stock.  I ask the Minister to contact his counterpart or the Minister for the Environment who has responsibility for the road building programme.  The domestic market has reached saturation point.  The main local authority in the country have been given the responsibility of providing hardy nursery stock to public authorities for planting along new roads.  We now have discovered, lo and behold, that this local authority are buying most of the material abroad.  If we are serious about tackling the problems in all of these areas why did we not ask the question &ldquo;why are they buying most of this product abroad?&rdquo;  The answer is simple, they are not being told in time.  It is a difficult product to produce and contracts are put to tender in favour of the importer.  Not alone are the decisions made for local authorities on where roads are to be constructed but when approval is sanctioned local authorities find that the decision was in the pipeline for between two and three years.  Without having to introduce a Bord Glas Bill or another layer of bureaucracy this is one area where we can do something for the industry by giving those involved in the production of hardy nursery stock large orders, thus replacing imported stock, for the next five years when massive road development will take place.  I ask the Minister to get together with the Minister for the Environment, speak to the officials of the Dublin local authority and make immediate decisions to reverse the present position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> It is very sad that discussions did not take place with the people involved in the industry on the provisions contained in the Bill, on the levies and charges and the proposed development of the industry once the new board take up office.  I would like to see at the conclusion of this debate that immediate contact be made with the industry in connection with amending the proposals in this Bill.  We can put down amendments to do anything we want if the Minister and his Government are in agreement.  The irony is that if this Bill had come before the House three or four months ago everyone would have been in agreement to ensure its passage through the House.</P>
    <P>The industry are not very pleased with the proposals in this Bill.  The letter which the Minister received from the chairman of the horticultural committee on 1 November 1989 outlines exactly what I am saying.  There is goodwill to improve the industry and to make it what it should be but the proposals in the Bill do not go any way to deal with the actual problems in the industry over a long number of years.  If we are in earnest about tackling the problems of imports or if we are to tackle the problem of improving the Irish products that come on the market, I would like to think that we would at least have the goodwill of those involved in the industry.  In fairness, the majority of those involved in the industry would not be inclined to accept the proposed levy, but be it a levy or a contribution surely the least we might look for is that some of those people would be represented on this new board and they could have a say and could look after their investment to ensure that it is spent wisely.  We are talking about developing methods of production and marketing the produce.  We have one of the best climates to produce some of the produce we have been speaking about for the past few hours.  Taking into consideration the details in the Bill and the letters the Minister has received from the industry, I do not think enough <Col N="1448" /> thought has gone into ensuring that this board when it is up and running will be successful.</P>

      <P>May I reply to the Minister's remark that there have been ongoing discussions by quoting a letter from the IFA?  The letter states:</P>
      <P>I understand that the first reading of the Bord Glas Bill is scheduled for Thursday next.  It is a matter of grave concern that this Bill is being introduced without any consultation with the horticultural industry with regard to its detail or its implementation.</P>
      <P>I.F.A. cannot take a position on this Bill until certain matters are clarified with the Minister.  I would urge that there should be immediate contact between the Minister, his Department and the various sections of our industry so that the opinions of those directly involved can be taken on board and incorporated into this Bill.  Failure to do this could have very serious consequences for the implementation of any future policy and for the effectiveness of any future board.</P>

      <P>The industry requires a substantial amount of work to develop the important strategy on the replacement of foreign imports.

      <P>The Deputy's contribution was not worth interrupting and that is why there were no interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never cease to be amazed at how we organise our agricultural industry.  We have the crazy, scandalous situation where we produce mountains of beef and milk which nobody wants.  We store them at high cost at the taxpayers' expense &mdash; making what they consume more expensive &mdash; until they are no longer useful and then recycle them to make more beef and milk, thus continuing the huge drain on the taxpayers' and consumers' pocket.  At the same time as we have this gross overproduction in one area we are importing into an agricultural country £1,000 million worth of vegetables which we could produce.  I believe those figures are produced by the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1451" /> and Food.  It is a scandal that an agricultural country should import vegetables worth £1,000 million while we are, effectively, dumping beef and milk products.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about the production of vegetables since the Stone Age.  It appears to me that Stone Age methods are being used so far as the production of horticultural produce is concerned.  Indeed, the previous speaker would seem to advocate that we remain in that position as well.  Imported cauliflowers cost 90 pence and turnips 40 pence.  I have done a calculation about the number of turnips of average size at 40 pence each which would fit into a square metre of a field.  I grew and snagged turnips when I was young.  The value of a ten acre field of turnips, at 40 pence each, is £250,000.  A ten-acre field would produce £250,000 worth of produce.  At the price housewives are paying for turnips in Dublin city at present that is the value of a ten-acre field of turnips.  I think that illustrates the craziness of a horticultural/agricultural country importing vast amounts of vegetables.</P>
    <P>The horticultural sector has been one of the more under-developed sectors of Irish agriculture losing out on jobs and home market share, not to mention the export potential of the sector.  Imports now account for over one-third of the value of all fresh vegetables we could produce ourselves.  I think the Minister might even have given a higher figure than that.  Fifty per cent of all tomatoes, 82 per cent of onions and 86 per cent of apples are imported at present.  We import parsley, and we imported the Colorado beetle in parsley a few years ago.  If one threw parsley seed on the floor of this House it would grow, it is that easy to grow; yet we are importing parsley.  What is wrong with this crazy system where we are actually importing fresh herbs like parsley which are so easy to grow?</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that this situation has come about under the unhindered <Col N="1452" /> guidance and stewardship of the private sector.  The State effectively has not been involved in any meaningful way.  The private sector have run agriculture since the Stone Age and, as has been said by the previous speaker, are still effectively in the Stone Age in their operations, giving us the results we now have.  If a measure was ever needed to correct this situation one is needed now, and in this area.</P>
    <P>Exports amount to less than 25 per cent of the value of total imports whereas in the entire agricultural and food sector exports amount to more than two and half times the value of imports.  Not only is there a considerable balance of trade deficit in this sector but it is also clear there are considerable job losses from the failure to expand this sector.  The interim Bord Glas proposed a job target of 1,750 full time jobs with an additional 1,500 part time jobs.  The IDA's strategy for the future of the food industry proposes, in the mushroom sector alone, 300 jobs in processing with an additional 1,200 jobs in growing and picking.  I would submit that these job targets constitute only a medium to short term programme and do not in any way realise the full potential of jobs in the horticultural sector.  I believe the number of jobs can be much greater than the projections put forward.</P>
    <P>While the Government's Bill proposes the establishment of a statutory board to develop all aspects of horticulture with a view to increasing output, recovering domestic market share, creating jobs and maximising export potential, it is clear that the mere establishment of such a board will not necessarily realise these goals.  This is where I have a difficulty with the proposal.  It is imperative that the Government provide the organisational flexibility and financial resources to carry out a major programme of renovation and reorganisation in this sector.</P>
    <P>First, to assess whether Board Glas are likely to meet with success we must examine the problems this sector faces. <Col N="1453" /> It is widely recognised that the sector struggles under poor growing and harvesting techniques and from a lack of varieties.  The competitiveness of the European market puts a premium on skills and crop variety.  In the first instance, we need to break into the top quality produce market and lengthen the season of growing.  This can only be done through a concentrated programme of education and advice given the relatively low level of skills in large sections of the sector.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a lack of marketing strategy among growers.  The lack of producer groups in Ireland means that marketing discipline and co-operation will continue to inhibit levels of output and realisation of their value on home and export markets.  It is not clear that a passive strategy of encouragement, as opposed to a more interventionist role by the State in marketing, will ensure that growers participate in producer groups.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the weakness of the processing sector.  This is an historical development arising from the financial and legislative castration of Erin Foods and the Sugar Company and the failure of the State to increase public enterprise in this sector.  For example, nearly 7,000 acres for growing peas, French beans, carrots, celery, cabbage and parsnips were utilised by Erin Foods in 1976.  Ten years later this acreage was reduced to barely over 1,000 acres.  Examples of bad producer/processor relationships in our processing sector and in horticultural produce are numerous.  In one instance a foreign juice producing firm offered to locate in Ireland if they could be guaranteed at least 10,000 tonnes of apples per year.  However, this was far beyond the capacity of the processing apple output. This failure to maximise output and establish proper contractual relations between growers and processors meant a loss of jobs, agricultural income and value added to the economy.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the high capital cost of glasshouses and the high cost of energy limits <Col N="1454" /> our ability to produce all the year round. A concerted strategy of extending the glasshouse industry would yield enormous benefits to the economy in terms of export balance, increased jobs, increased output and full season supply for the processing industry.  However, there is little private capital available from growers for the scale of investments necessary.  In addition there is little co-ordination of energy supplies to help lower the cost of glasshouses and minimise our reliance on imported energy.  Co-ordination of natural gas supplies, surplus heat from the ESB, design of glasshouses and research into solar heating which can complement energy intake is necessary.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, there is a considerable lack of the necessary technology to facilitate growth in this sector, primarily in the areas of on-farm and distributor's storage and drying and composting facilities for such produce as onions, cabbages, strawberries and mushrooms.  Again, this will require considerable investment to ensure increased output and a more co-ordinated distribution.  There are other issues confronting this sector: the need for a major research programme in a number of areas; centralisation of distribution in Dublin leading to extra handling and transport costs; the lack of advice in investment into organic produce which is gaining an increasing market in European countries; concern over food quality among consumers; and the manipulation of dietary patterns by multi-national food processors which undermine the consumption of fresh agricultural products. The major issue we face here is whether the creation of a statutory horticultural board will enable us to confront these problems.  Of course, it would be a necessary component of any strategy to reorganise and modernise this sector to establish such a board, but this is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister therefore, what is the level of financial resources available to the board from direct State investment not only in the <Col N="1455" /> area of glasshouses but of on-farm and distribution technology?  Will the board become directly involved in the development of such items with the possibility of leasing or selling to producer groups and distributors?  What level of finance will be available for research programmes to be undertaken by the board?  Will extra resources be made available to Teagasc, or is it suggested that such a programme will be financed out of the present inadequate resources?  Will there be any role for them in the processing sector, and if so, will that role be extended to create public enterprises or joint ventures with private firms in key, export areas?  What will be the relationship between the Sugar Company, Erin Foods and the new board?</P>
    <P>In the absence of any land policy or regulatory agency over land use, how will the board ensure the most effective use of tillage land to expand the production of horticultural products?  Will the board be content to encourage producer groups and co-operatives, or will they be allowed to establish marketing boards in co-operation with growers, ensuring that not only are the structures established but that they meet with the best criteria possible for modern, international marketing needs?  What is the proposed level of capital grants for glasshouse construction and maintenance?  What is the relationship with the ESB and other energy companies to maximise energy savings to this sector?  What level of research in the construction of glasshouses and the utilisation of solar energy is proposed?</P>
    <P>What is necessary is a concerted programme of State intervention, in co-operation with growers, processors and workers to maximise the potential in this area, and the private sector have traditionally been in control of the area, and have failed.  The legislation clearly covers a number of points that I have raised but I am not satisfied that there is either the legislative licence, financial resources or the political will on the part of the <Col N="1456" /> Government to advance a radical restructuring of this sector.</P>
    <P>In regard to most of the functions in the Bill before us, the terms &ldquo;consultative&rdquo; and &ldquo;indicative&rdquo; are frequently used.  Section 9, for example, provides that the board shall have a consultative role in education.  Does this mean the board will be directly able to advise growers on the farm?  Does it mean that the board will be able not only to set criteria in horticultural education &mdash; but actually provide the education services in this area? Both the IDA and the interim Bord Glas reports highlight the lack of training and skills in growing and harvesting techniques. Will the board be empowered through legislation to take an active, interventionist approach in this sector?  I see nothing in the legislation to allow the board to play an interventionist role in processing.  Will the board be confined to an advisory role for existing industry and be reliant on the strategies of other State agencies, such as the IDA and SFADCo which confine industrial options to the private sector only?</P>
    <P>The final issue I will deal with is the financing of the board and the necessary functions they must carry out if we are to modernise this sector.  The interim board report presumes that the necessary additional State and industry funding will be provided.  It goes on to state that there will be no substantial changes in the other State resources at present available for the development of horticulture.  In the summary of the interim report, the £250,000 grant in the 1989 Estimates is referred to; this is intended to cover the promotional, developmental and marketing activities of the board.  It states that the board hope to raise funds from the industry and that further funds will be required for increased grant rates for the glasshouse sector.  It goes on to state that the remainder of the board's programme will be met from existing resources.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what these few phrases are really saying.  First, we should not <Col N="1457" /> expect any substantial level of funds to be devoted to the board, certainly nothing like the amount necessary to become directly involved in the modernising of this sector.  Second, I support the proposal that extra funds will be raised from the industry but it is a joke to suggest that the industry is at present capable of providing a high level of funds. One of the main contentions of the report is that the industry is woefully under developed and under financed.  Third, there is a statement in the report that there will be no additional funding in other additional State resources for the development of the industry; there will be no increases in educational and advisory services in Teagasc, agricultural education, State agencies catering for the processing sector and food research in Eolas, in other words, what we get from the board is all we will get.  Fourth, there is a statement in the report that recruitment will hopefully be done through redeployment.  That means that there will be no overall increase in the intellectual capital in this sector.  What the board get will detract from the work of other agencies in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The failure of the interim report to cost the programme they have produced is a massive insult to the industry and to this House.  It has produced analyses, recommendations, targets and objectives for a number of sectors.  It has proposed over 250 recommendations and yet it does not state how much this will cost.  Of course, this is done so as not to embarrass the Government in the event that the Government cannot, or will not, adequately fund the proposals.  In other words, the costing of their programme has been deleted for party political considerations.</P>
    <P>Proposals brought forward by the Government in their budgets and Estimates are always costed.  Every private and public sector company always insists on the costing of programmes and recommendations. The failure to cost this programme is uncommercial, unprofessional <Col N="1458" /> and sloppy.  It is the very thing that the report says is inhibiting the development of this sector.  I hope the Minister when replying will state the cost of all these recommendations and not just the amount the Government intend to allocate.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes on the shape of a cosmetic exercise.  Without the funding, the resources and the statutory powers, the board will be a glorified consultative shop, reduced to producing appropriate recommendations but without any real power to ensure their implementation. Maybe the Government will prove my fears unfounded, but I have found that this Government always live down to my expectations rather than otherwise.  I intend to pursue these issues on Committee Stage and the position the Labour Party will take on Second Stage will depend on the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>However, I would provide this hope. Fianna Fáil have in the past adopted interventionist measures in particular sectors.  Of course, now that they are in Coalition with what I would regard as a viciously right wing party, their room for manoeuvre is considerably reduced. However, if Fianna Fáil wish to break from the narrow-minded, selfish and antiexpansionist policies they have concocted with their Coalition partner, other options might be available.  The demands for investment, co-ordination and planning in the economy in potentially valuable sectors, such as horticulture, are too important to be subjected to arbitrary opposition and even more mindless policies of the type that this Government have opted to pursue in Coalition.</P>
    <P>Labour have no principled objection to the proposal.  It is the lack of content in the proposal that we have difficulty with.  We will not accept that this very prime sector, horticulture, should be dealt with by simple window dressing.  I look forward to the Minister's reply to the points I and others have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would <Col N="1459" /> like to wholeheartedly welcome this Bill which will give statutory effect to previous Government decisions to develop the horticultural industry here and put it on a proper and professional footing which has been lacking for far too long.</P>
      <P>We are all well aware of the changes that will come about in 1992 because of the Single European Market.  Industry in general is well prepared to meet that challenge.  Our industry and service sector is far better managed than it used to be and there is a far greater degree of co-operation between management and the work force which helps to bolster that situation.  At that stage, it will be the survival of the fittest; those who do not have their act together will not survive and they will not be able to blame anybody but themselves.</P>
      <P>I use the horticultural industry as an example because they will not be facing any new challenge in 1992 as they have been subjected to open market forces for quite some time now.  They have had to contend with more competition since the early seventies.  At that time many growers in the different areas of horticulture were unable to stand the test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to state that, with the permission of the Chair, I intend to give some of my time to Deputy Michael D. Higgins of the Labour Party.  I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue. <Col N="1460" /> Without meaning any disrespect to the Minister of State, I must express my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy Collins, is not present for the debate.  He was in the Chamber earlier and I hope he is not trying to avoid being present for a debate on what I consider to be an urgent matter.  I trust the Minister of State will convey to Deputy Collins our views on this matter and our call for a change in Ireland's position at the UN.</P>
      <P>Between 1975 and 1978 a red flag with three yellow towers flew in Phnom Penh, the capital of Kampuchea at that time, as a symbol of the Khmer Rouge régime who had taken power in Kampuchea in April 1975.  It is well recorded that during those three years more than one million people were slaughtered in the most brutal fashion by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Today, to the shame of our country and most of the world, that same flag flies at the UN building in New York.  One must question how such a brutal regime as the Khmer Rouge ever found their way to a seat at the UN.  From 1979 to 1982 they represented the State of Democratic Kampuchea at the UN.  It was not until 1982 that the full extent of the monstrous atrocities of that regime became known to the rest of the world.  The recognition by the UN of that regime at that time was a source of great embarrassment to that organisation.</P>
      <P>Lest they would lose their seat at the UN, China and Thailand put great pressure on Prince Sihanouk, the former leader, and Son Sann to form a coalition with the Khmer Rouge to give it an air of respectability and so that they could retain their UN seat.  That coalition has been represented at the UN since October 1982 and is fully recognised by the UN as the representatives of what is called the Democratic State of Kampuchea. The coalition is led by Thiounn Prasith, one of Pol Pot's former leaders. I do not think anybody can say that that is the soft side of the Khmer Rouge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the years when votes were                                                                                                                                   <Col N="1461" /> taken at the UN to confirm the position of that coalition, Ireland and representatives of most western countries abstained.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, during those years, in response to queries, stated that Ireland would not change her position so long as there was an invading force, the Vietnamese army, in Cambodia.  I find it extraordinary that Ireland, in common with other western countries, can continue to support, albeit by abstension on some occasions, the presence of the Khmer Rouge at the UN, a body founded on peace and humanitarian principles.  It is almost as if Hitler, if he were alive, was sent to the UN to represent the Jews.  I do not like using that analogy but it is a good one.</P>
    <P>On 15 November a draft motion, from the ASEAN countries, will be voted on at the UN.  One section of that draft motion causes me concern and it has prompted me to raise this issue this evening.  I do not think Ireland should vote for that motion although I understand it is our intention to do so.  The section of the motion which causes me concern is as follows:</P>
    <P>Noting the continued and effective struggle of the Kampuchean forces under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk to achieve the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea....</P>
    <P>Many of those who have taken an interest in that country over the years, particularly the non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam and Trocaire, contend that if Ireland votes for a motion that contains that section she will be voting for a civil war in Cambodia.  The argument that Sihanouk could take over in that country again is nonsense.  He is quoted as saying, &ldquo;my shirt is owned by the Chinese&rdquo;.  He is no more than a puppet for Pol Pot and the Chinese.</P>
    <P>As far as we can ascertain the Vietnamese Army have withdrawn from that country.  Indeed, Mary Banotti MEP, <Col N="1462" /> and two colleagues from the European Parliament, witnessed their withdrawal in September.  Hun Sen is trying to run that country under extraordinary difficulties. The country has been deprived of all long term development aid from the EC and many other countries.  Were it not for groups like Trocaire, Oxfam and other NGOs even humanitarian aid would not be getting to that country.  The people of Cambodia have been sent to Coventry by the rest of the World and are suffering greatly.  That is occurring at a time when Ireland continues to support the Khmer Rouge as a member of the UN.  Shame on us for doing so.  Behind all this is a major power struggle.  The US and China support the Khmer Rouge and the return of Pol Pot although they deny that vehemently.  Russia, and some eastern block countries, support the existing régime.  <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> are on the lips of so many people who should not allow this position to continue.</P>
    <P>Ireland should not vote on November 15 for any motion that calls for support for a Sihanouk-Khmer Rouge backed set of troops.  I watched a documentary on UTV recently which showed that the Khmer Rouge were marching towards Battambang in the north west of the country.  Once again the people there are feeling the terror of that regime.  I call on the Minister to refuse to vote for any motion that supports in even the most tenuous way a return of the Khmer Rouge to power in Cambodia.  Ireland should take the initiative and table a motion at the UN demanding the expulsion of the coalition that now purports to represent Cambodia.  That may mean that for some time the seat at the UN will be empty but at least we will not be asking the people of Cambodia to accept that a murderer should represent them at the UN.</P>

      <P>As spokesman on Foreign Affairs for the Labour Party I am grateful to Deputy Owen for giving me the opportunity to support her call in <Col N="1463" /> regard to this UN motion.  I recall that in the 25th Dáil Deputy Peter Barry and myself on a number of occasions drew attention to the position that prevailed in relation to Ireland's attitude at the UN on this question which is far from satisfactory. In supporting Deputy Owen I should like to say, lest the Minister of State responds by saying that Ireland's abstension procedure up to now was more progressive than that of those who supported the seating of the coalition at the UN, that the time has come for something more worthwhile.  There is a need for an Irish initiative, an Irish draft. There is a need for an abstension by Ireland in the face of the immoral misrepresentation of the Cambodian people at the UN.  What is required is more than a washing of the hands on the issue.</P>
      <P>It is unthinkable that we would wash our hands at the prospect of a civil war, of atrocities by the Khmer Rouge.  I am disappointed that we have not had a report either on Ireland's behaviour or on the behaviour of the Twelve in relation to the difficulties that this will place in the way of the Kampuchean people.  We have isolated the Government that is in place in terms of aid despite the fact that they have requested aid, medical and other facilities.  At the same time we have gone on looking at a murderous misrepresentation at the UN.  We have taken no practical initiatives, nor have the Twelve suggested them, in resolution of the border issues.  This is an opportunity in this vote for us to either initiate or support new diplomatic initiatives.  We are not doing it.  I say we would be thanked at the UN for it.  There is no greater tragedy, no greater disgrace of diplomacy than the question of Cambodia. The West has disgraced itself.  The UN cannot act with credibility in terms of aid, the border issue, representation in its own assembly.  The time has come for us to move beyond that extension and to take a positive initative.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins and Deputy Owen for their contributions.  As Deputy Owen said, the United Nations General Assembly is due to hold its annual debate on the question of Cambodia on 15 and 16 November.  At the end of that debate, the assembly will be asked to decide on a draft Resolution setting out the Assembly's view on the current situation regarding that country.  That draft resolution has not yet been submitted to the Assembly.</P>
      <P>The issue of the representation of Cambodia at the General Assembly is not due to be voted on on 15-16 November or at any other time during the current session of the General Assembly.  In the past, the issue has been raised in the form of a challenge to the credentials of the delegation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.  Such a challenge has not been made at the current session of the General Assembly.  As Deputy Owen suggested, whenever such a challenge has been made in the past, and that goes over the period of the last Coalition Government, Ireland has abstained on the vote on the grounds that neither the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea nor the Government headed by Mr. Hun Sen have received any form of endorsement by the people of Cambodia.</P>

      <Col N="1465" /> Along with our partners in the Twelve, we have welcomed the decision by Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Cambodia. We consider that this has provided an opportunity to move towards an overall political solution to the conflict.  We feel that if pursued with the necessary determination, we are confident that an approach based on political dialogue can lead to an overall settlement which guarantees the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia and offers the Cambodian people the right to self-determination through participation in free and internationally supervised elections.  Any resolution presented at the General Assembly which advances the prospects of such an overall political settlement will have Ireland's support.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Daly, to urgently reconsider his decision to reopen the shooting season for the Greenland white fronted goose in County Wexford.  The season opened yesterday and continues until January so it is not too late for him to act.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise he has an international responsibility under EC law to ensure the survival of this species? With over half the world's population of geese wintering in Ireland, the future of these geese is heavily dependent on this country.  It is indeed, gratifying that the population has increased significantly since shooting was prohibited on the breeding grounds in Greenland and in the wintering grounds in Scotland and Ireland.  The Minister's unilateral decision to reintroduce goose shooting in Ireland undermines the growing international co-operation on conservation of these migratory birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations from the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in this matter.  These are very reasonable people.  They are not head bangers or fanatics.  They represent ordinary people throughout Ireland and they include shooting interests as well.  The IWC are not anti-shooting so I think the Minister <Col N="1467" /> should take into consideration what they want.  They tell me they wrote to the Minister of State on 14 September last seeking a meeting, a very reasonable thing for them to do.  That was six weeks ago.  Up to yesterday, they informed me, they had not even the courtesy of a reply. This is scandalous behaviour but it is typical of the attitude of this Minister who proved himself to be totally incompetent and stubborn in his handling of the rod licence dispute.  Nevertheless I appeal to him, even at this late stage to act at once in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Garland for agreeing to share his time with me.  I appreciate that what we are seeking to do here, which is to remove the Greenland white-fronted goose from the open seasons order for 1989-90, effectively would involve a reversal of an earlier decision by the Minister.  I appreciate always the reluctance to reverse decisions that are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless a very reasoned and careful case has been made for this by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.  That case comes down to four points.  The first is that Ireland, as the major wintering ground for these geese, has a particular international responsibility for their conservation. This international responsibility is underlined in the EC birds directive 409 of 1979 which lists the Greenland white-fronted goose in Annex 1 and requires the Irish Government to take special conservation measures concerning their habitat in order to ensure their survival.  Internationally efforts are being made in this direction to protect the species.  The Greenland Government, for example, do not allow the hunting of the goose and in Scotland the species is protected from hunting in their wintering grounds.  Wexford is a particularly important wintering ground where 40 per cent of the species are to be found.  Therefore, by allowing the goose to be hunted and shot we are <Col N="1468" /> very much out of line with the international response to the protection of this species.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it has been argued that what is involved here is a limited cull of the bird.  However, it would be virtually impossible to control that limited cull. We are informed it is intended to limit the shooting of the birds to 450, but how can they be sure it can be limited to that? Who is going to control it, particularly outside the Wexford Slobs?  How can we be sure those controls will be applied? Thirdly, it has been argued that one of the reasons associated with this is that the birds may be a nuisance for certain agricultural activity.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there were other remedies open to him, for example, the granting of licences under the Wildlife Act for the controlled scaring of the birds from sensitive crops.  That was a remedy which was open to him rather than the remedy he has taken. Fourthly, there is an ultimate remedy which will have to be taken in this case and which relates to the provision of safe refuges for the birds.  The long term conservation of the population requires safeguarding of wetland and peatland habitats which are diminishing at an alarming rate and the creation of further reserve lands in Wexford.  The Irish Wildbird Conservancy have already invested heavily in conservation by buying land on the Wexford Slobs to safeguard the birds. The current plan to extend the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve by the purchase of extra land jointly by the Irish Wildlife Service and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy will be undermined by the reintroduction of shooting of the geese.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is regrettable that the Minister seems to be treating this particular species as a problem rather than regarding it as a resource which can be developed.  There is considerable potential in the area of tourism and education, apart altogether from the intrinsic value of the species to our Irish wildlife heritage, for development by protecting the <Col N="1469" /> species rather than by taking measures which ultimately will lead to a reduction in the population of the species.  This species is one of the smallest and most vulnerable populations of geese wintering in this country.  To allow the geese to be shot will have very serious consequences for the protection of the species and although it is very much at the thirteenth hour I join Deputy Garland in appealing to the Minister to reverse the earlier decision he has made and to respond positively to the very reasonable case which has been put to him by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for his very reasonable contribution. I will certainly take the points he has raised into account.  In relation to Deputy Garland, I would like, at the outset, to clear up some misunderstanding that may have arisen between himself and those who communicated with me regarding my meeting with the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.  I indicated, through my office, to a responsible member of the council who was in touch with us to set up that meeting that I was willing to arrange a suitable date for the meeting.  At the request of the conservancy that meeting was delayed because it was not suitable.  The postponement of the meeting, which would have taken place before now, was not at my request but at the request of a responsible member of the conservancy who has been in touch with my office in relation to that meeting.  I would like if Deputy Garland would withdraw the serious allegation he has made here this afternoon about this particular issue which is totally without foundation.  It is the second time today he has done that.  I would expect that in the meantime he would have taken the trouble to check the facts and at least have the courtesy to withdraw an allegation which for my part is totally unjustified and unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wexford Wildfowl Reserve which <Col N="1470" /> is a statutory nature reserve under the Wildlife Act is jointly owned by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, which holds 75 per cent of the land, and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy which owns the remainder.  The populations of Greenland white-fronted geese consist of small flocks located in Donegal and along the west coast of the Shannon in my own constituency of Clare.  The main feeding grounds for the Greenland white-fronted geese are in the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve and the Wexford Harbour area generally.</P>
    <P>In 1982, as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, I was extremely concerned at the decline in the number of geese throughout Ireland mainly due to pressure from shooting and I decided to introduce a three-year moratorium on the shooting of the species.  Subsequently in 1985-86 limited shooting was reopened for one season on a trial basis in County Wexford.  However the shooting ban was reintroduced in 1986-87 and was maintained during 1987-88 and 1988-89.</P>
    <P>Population counts of Greenland Whitefronts are carried out annually by the Wildlife Service personnel.  These counts show that populations in Wexford have steadily increased from approximately 6,000 in 1982 to over 10,000 in 1989 which is regarded as satisfactory from the conservation aspect.  This increase is due mainly to good grass management in the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve and lack of disturbance from shooting pressure for several seasons.  On the basis of the steady increase in populations and comprehensive research by the Wildlife Service, it was clearly evident that goose populations could sustain a limited shoot in the 1989-90 season only in the Wexford area and with no extension of shooting in any other areas of the country.  I would like to state that I am fully aware of the national and international conservation requirements and responsibilities which I have in this area.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the recent population level in Wexford is, according to <Col N="1471" /> my best scientific advice and professional advisers, reaching the limit which the Wildfowl Reserve can adequately accommodate for feeding purposes.  In recent years the increasing populations have spread out to adjoining farmland causing complaints from local farmers of damage to agricultural crops despite the excellent grassland management programmes on the areas covered by the reserve. Developments are taking place which I hope can alleviate this problem in the future.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Service has almost completed the purchase of a further 207 acres of land to add to the existing Wexford Wildlife Reserve of 272 acres.  The new area will therefore total 479 acres.  This purchase is being funded on a 50 per cent basis by the European Commission.  As in the case of the existing reserve the Irish Wildbird Conservancy is joining with the Wildlife Service again on a 25 per cent share in the purchase of the new land.  It is hoped to take possession of the extra land within the coming five or six weeks.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind all factors involved, including the fact that the population in Wexford can at this stage sustain legitimate rational exploitation, I am satisfied that a limited controlled shoot can continue during the 1989-90 season.  This shoot is permitted for a period of 10 weeks from 1 November 1989 to 1 January 1990 subject to an overall limit of 450 geese.  Shooting will cease if that limit is reached before 1 January 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> Strict conditions concerning the distribution and regulation of shooting are being applied by Wildlife Service personnel with the co-operation of the gun clubs in the Wexford area.  The shooting is limited principally to the Wexford Slob and to the harbour areas.  I should add at this stage that I am meeting with the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.  I am fully aware of their views in this matter and I will discuss it further with them.  I will be prepared to listen to any reasonable arguments such as we have had from Deputy Gilmore this afternoon.  I want to assure the Deputy that the evidence from the past indicates that we have had the fullest co-operation of the gun clubs and the wild fowlers who have frequented that area down through the years.  When there was a previous limited shoot it was fully complied with and adhered to.  We have had very responsible wildfowlers in that area.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to say that my decision in this matter was made on the basis of the professional, technical and scientific advice which I got from my staff in the Department.  My decision was not as a result of any pressure from gun clubs or from anybody else.  It was based purely on the best possible scientific and professional advice I have available to me.  I am satisfied that this decision was the correct one to make and that decision remains.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 November 1989.</P>

      <P>CERT, at my request, examined the suitability of the St. Patrick's Hospital Castlerea facilities for hotel and catering training.  CERT have found that it would not be a feasible proposition to convert the hospital building into a training centre for this purpose because of the likely considerable capital cost that would be involved in such a conversion and in addition CERT would not be in a position to use more than 10 per cent of the building.  In coming to this decision, CERT took account of the use it already makes of the regional technical colleges in Athlone, Sligo and Galway to have students trained for the hotel, catering and tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Registered unemployment in Ireland has fallen on a year-on-year basis for the last 22 months.  Over the period, the general trend in unemployment has been downwards. As a result, the unemployment rate is now at its lowest level since November 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are basic differences between the United Kingdom and Irish economies and labour markets.  The industrial structures of the two countries are very different. There are major differences in the balance of payment, exchange rate, <Col N="1398" /> inflation and interest rates positions in the two countries.  In so far as the labour market is concerned our dependency rate is significantly higher and we experience high inflows into the workforce with this trend expected to continue.  In the United Kingdom expectations are for a drop in the number of new entrants to the workforce.</P>
    <P>The differences between the Irish and the United Kingdom economies and labour markets necessitate some differential between national policies.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's position is, of course, to create a sound economy which will result in worthwhile and lasting jobs and continued economic growth.  Nevertheless, I keep in touch with developments in Britain through regular meetings with the UK Ministers (including those arising from our European Community commitments); the Labour Attache in London; and through the usual contacts between officials in my Department and the UK Department of Employment.  I also, of course, keep abreast of developments in other EC member states through the various Community institutions.  Finally, I should say that as unemployment is the top priority for the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers, I shall have many opportunities to discuss this issue with the British Ministers and all other EC Ministers for Labour.</P>

      <P>(a) As the Deputy is aware, questions relating to the defensive capacity of the country are more properly directed to my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Tánaiste and Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>However, I can say that the Government's defence policy is directed towards preserving the sovereignty and security of the State from a neutral position, outside military alliances and towards supporting the Government's commitment to the pursuit of world peace.  I can also say that the Defence Forces are currently maintained and equipped to meet the demands made on them.</P>
      <P>(b) I take it the Deputy is referring to the Hague Convention concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land.  This sets out the rights and obligations of neutral states in the event of war.  In pursuance of its policy of military neutrality, Ireland will be guided by the provisions of this Convention should the eventualities foreseen in the Convention arise.</P>
      <P>(c)  The European Community does not have a policy for the development of a common defence industry as such. Ireland's approach to the issue posed by the Deputy of civilian industries where some part of the product might be used by some countries in defence, is determined by the normal considerations relevant to general industrial policy.  These are of course a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <P>**These estimates are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P>*These reliefs are calculated by reference to the 50 per cent rate; otherwise the profits would have been chargeable after 1980 at the 10 per cent rate. .fe</P>
    <P>Statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the information requested to be provided in relation to other relevant reliefs and incentives, for example:</P>
    <P>&mdash;expenditure incurred in mining operations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;expenditure incurred on acquiring industrial know-how;</P>
    <P>&mdash;payments to an Irish university or other qualifying educational establishment to enable it to undertake research in, or engage in the teaching of, industrial relations, marketing or any other approved subject;</P>
    <P>&mdash;expenditure incurred by a trader on scientific research;</P>
    <P>&mdash;certain expenditure incurred on recruiting and training of local staff;</P>
    <P>&mdash;expenditure incurred on the acquisition of patent rights and the tax exemption accorded to income arising from the devising of certain patents;</P>
    <P>&mdash;investment in film making. </P>
    <P>Such information either could not be obtained or could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>In regard to the estimates above relating to the cost to the Exchequer of Export Sales Relief, &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief and the reduced rate of tax for manufacturing profits, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises might not have set up here.  To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of each cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
    <P>The cost estimates relating to export sales relief and Shannon relief are based on the assumption that the profits involved would have been charged at the standard rate of corporation tax (which was 50 per cent for most of the years in question) were it not for the reliefs.  When these reliefs end at 5 April 1990, these profits will become chargeable at the 10 per cent rate where they qualify under the appropriate provisions.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes on Table</P>
    <P>(1)  <i>Export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief</i></P>
    <P>The figures for each year include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in that year and to earlier accounting periods in so far as such relief was allowed in that year.</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>Manufacturing profits</i></P>
    <P>These figures represent the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at normal rates.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Stock relief</i></P>
    <P>Stock relief was not renewed in 1986 for any sector other than farming.</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>Reduced rate of corporation tax for small companies</i></P>
    <P>The reduced rate of tax was terminated as respects profits and interest arising after 1 April, 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> (5)  <i>&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</i></P>
    <P>These figures include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £14.4 million in 1987 and £18.5 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>(6)  <i>Capital allowances</i></P>
    <P>The cost figure included for each year is estimated by reference to accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question (e.g. year ended 5 April 1979 relates to the column headed 1979-80).</P>
    <P>(7)  <i>Investment in corporate trades</i></P>
    <P>The relief for investment in corporate trades (Business Expansion Scheme) is an income tax relief available to individuals on investments in qualifying companies. </P>

      <P>I regret that records of costs are not kept in a manner which would enable the question to be answered in the format requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, an important element of <Col N="1413" /> the costs of these competitions, staffing costs, cannot be quantified retrospectively as staff engaged on such competitions are also engaged simultaneously on a variety of other work.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that competitions for appointments as clerical officer and executive officer, which competitions also involve appointments to a variety of other grades, are not necessarily held on an annual basis.  Work on such competitions can frequently extend over more than one calendar year and panels created following these competitions may last for some years. Accordingly, an average cost per recruit for each calendar year could be quite misleading.  In any event, as stated above, the manner in which records are kept does not permit a breakdown in the manner sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax-payer's liability to income tax for years to 1987-88 amounts to £6,556.30 excluding interest charges.  This liability is based on rental income figures agreed with the taxpayer.  The taxpayer may be entitled to mortgage interest relief in respect of the years to 1987-88 but the inspector cannot allow such relief as she has not submitted certificates of interest paid in support of her claim.</P>
      <P>A further £562.45 is due in respect of 1988-89 in accordance with a return of income submitted by the taxpayer.  A notice of preliminary tax for £600 has been issued for the current year, 1989-90. The taxpayer should submit a return of income, so that her true liability for the current year can be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the payment made by the taxpayer under the amnesty covered the liabilities for the years 1982-83 to 1987-88 and an amount of £38.82 which was set against the liability for 1988/89.  The amounts were paid in respect of liabilities which were due and payable and the question of a refund does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The assessments for two of the years covered by the amnesty payment, 1986-87 and 1987-88 were disputed by the taxpayer's agents.  However, the amounts assessed for these years were confirmed by the Appeal Commissioners in December, 1987.  As an appeal against the Appeal Commissioners' decision was not lodged within the statutory time limit the tax as charged in the assessments is legally due.  The Inspector of Taxes has no reason to believe that these amounts are excessive.</P>

There are 64 nature reserves and 56 wildfowl sanctuaries and it is intended to increase these as resources permit.  I am attaching a list of the reserves and sanctuaries for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the <Col N="1425" /> Industrial Development Authority that some 220 chemical/pharmaceutical companies are currently operating in the State, the majority of which have been grant-aided.  Total employment is estimated at over 12,000 persons.</P>
      <P>The range of products manufactured by the industry is very wide but includes, for example, basic organic and inorganic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, industrial and agricultural chemicals, paints, varnishes, printing inks, household and office chemicals, soaps, detergents and toilet preparations.</P>
      <P>The nature of the waste resultant from chemical/pharmaceutical plants and the way in which it is disposed of is a matter for the local authorities in whose areas they operate.  When established, the environmental protection agency will also have a substantial role in this regard.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance is confined to certain categories of old age pensioners and persons who are permanently incapacitated. In order to qualify for an allowance a claimant must be either living alone, or only with children under 15 years of age, or with people who are so incapacitated that they could not get help in an emergency.  Where two pensioners are living together, the allowance is not payable unless one of them is so incapacitated that he or she could not get help for the other in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the free telephone rental allowance to cover additional categories of households would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of works on non-national roads, including Ballycullen, Knocklyon and Firhouse Roads, normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads.  In 1989, Dublin County Council have been allocated a discretionary grant of £1 million for the improvement of non-national roads.  The selection of works to be undertaken with this grant is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notification sent to the local authority, in 1987, that the Department had no objection on engineering grounds to their proposals for the improvement of Ballycullen Road and Knocklyon Road was stated to be without prejudice to any statutory procedures that might arise and without commitment to provide road grant assistance.  The Department understand that the proposed works on these roads are consequential on the proposals now being developed by the local authority for the proposed southern cross route.  Because of my position in relation to the statutory procedures involved, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the timing and financing of such works.  Special grants are occasionally made available to local authorities for improvement projects on non-national roads.  In the case of the Firhouse Road, special grants totalling about £1.6 million, including £260,000 in the current <Col N="1428" /> year, have been provided by the Department to meet expenditure on phases 1 and 2 of the project.  Detailed proposals for phase 3 of the project have not been received in the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the information available to me that groundwater in Ireland is generally of a high quality and that we do not have any extensive problems arising from high nitrates levels. Approximately 25 per cent of drinking water supplies are obtained from groundwater sources.  The report, &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland&rdquo;, published by An Foras Forbartha in 1987, noted that, while fertiliser usage may have raised the background level of nitrates in groundwaters, there is no significant contamination of the aquifers.  The Geological Survey of Ireland has found, from a survey of the major springs in Ireland in 1985-86, that nitrates levels were normally low, with 85 per cent less than 5.0 mg/l as N and only 1 per cent in excess of the statutory quality standard for drinking water (11.3 mg/l as N).  While there are small polluted pockets beneath septic tanks and waste storage areas on farms, which could be eliminated by greater awareness of the importance of groundwater and greater care in the location of wells and waste storage/disposal units, I am not aware of any basis for the assumption that &ldquo;a high proportion&rdquo; of farm household wells are polluted by nitrates.</P>

      <P>The latest year for which the information requested by the Deputy is available, is 1985.  Local authorities have been asked to forward details of the position for the year ended December 1988 but it will be some further time before final comprehensive figures for that year are available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The estimated total volume of waste coming within the EC definition of toxic and dangerous waste which was produced in this country in 1985 was 52,000 tonnes. Of this total, 66 per cent was disposed of by the producers at their own sites or treatment facilities, a further 6 per cent was disposed of by landfill and the remainder was exported for disposal overseas.  Most hazardous waste exports go to the United Kingdom but small quantities are shipped to France and Finland.</P>
      <P>The legislative controls to ensure the safe disposal of toxic and dangerous waste are set out in the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous) Waste Regulations, 1982.  The transfrontier movements of hazardous wastes are subject to control under the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1988.</P>
