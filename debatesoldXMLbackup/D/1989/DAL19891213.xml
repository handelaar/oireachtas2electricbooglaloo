      <P>I sought some clarification from the Taoiseach yesterday morning in relation to the office of the Ombudsman. I wonder if he has had an opportunity to check it?  Am I correct in thinking that a resolution of this House is needed before the end of this year to give effect to the Ombudsman remaining in office?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to be in a very flippant mood when answering questions these days.  The reality is that the order has to be made by both Houses before the end of this year, otherwise there will not be an Ombudsman on 1 January.  There has been no communication between the Whips.  May I ask the Taoiseach to indicate if something will be done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I understood the Taoiseach to say he is reporting to the House this evening on last week's meeting in Strasbourg, but did he also say he was making a statement on the EC Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports from Strasbourg and meetings like that are normally just statements by the leaders of parties. If the Taoiseach is now going to expand that to a discussion on what role the Irish will be playing for the next six months in the EC I would think the more correct way to do that would be by a full debate in the House rather than by statements from a limited number of people.  Would the Taoiseach agree with that and would he agree to expand the discussion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I mentioned the abuse of privilege by the Minister for the Environment in his failure to reply to Dáil Questions.  I wrote to you in the meantime outlining the fact that on 1 November I had two questions tabled for reply by the Minister for the Environment.  He did not give a reply to either, he promised to furnish information subsequently but I have not had any further communication from him.  I regard Dáil Questions as part of the legitimate procedure under our democratic system to elicit information and it is an abuse of procedure for a Minister to fail to publish such information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not make a speech at this stage.  I have had his communication and I wish to inform him that there is a long established precedent that the Chair has no power to compel a Minister to answer questions and no control over the reply given by a Minister.  However, if a Deputy is dissatisfied with a Minister's reply &mdash; or failure to reply &mdash; he or she has a remedy and I would be glad to assist the Deputy in securing that remedy.  Indeed, he may do so by tabling a further question, for instance, or raising the matter on the Adjournment.  I cannot be of more help to the Deputy.</P>

That would bring the moral authority of the Chair to bear on the Minister to ensure that he complies with the procedures.  I referred you in particular to a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He indicated that it would be here this week, but when the Government Chief Whip sought to arrange the Order of Business for this week there was no mention of the Bill. We on this side of the House sought to have it included in this week's business. We were told by the Government that it would be included in today's business if the Fine Gael Party and other Opposition Parties were willing to take all stages between 10.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. without the Government having circulated the amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 26 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`construction' includes the execution of works in connection with buildings and any act or operation necessary for or related to the construction, extension, alteration, repair or renewal of a building and `constructed' shall be construed accordingly;</P>
      <P>`design' includes the preparation of plans, particulars, drawings, specifications, calculations and other expressions of purpose according to which the construction, extension, alteration, repair or renewal concerned is to be executed and `designed' shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this is a first but I note my amendment is supported by Deputies Quinn and Shatter.  If it is a first, I welcome the precedent being established and thank the Deputies for their support.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to provide for separate definitions of the words &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo;.  Deputies will note that the Bill, as initiated, provides for a composite definition of these terms.  When the Bill was debated on Committee Stage in the last Dáil, Opposition speakers sought a commitment that I introduce an amendment of the kind now tabled.  After consideration of the points made I agreed to do so and I am now honouring that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that in meeting the points made previously in relation to the distinction between the definitions of the words &ldquo;design&rdquo; on the one hand and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; on the other, the amendment does not materially affect the sense of subsequent sections where one or both of those words is used.  I happily recommend <Col N="1214" /> the amendment to the House and thank the Deputies for their co-operation in the matter.</P>

      <P>The fact that names of Members from different sides of the House are tabled to this amendment demonstrates that we have reached consensus. I should like to put on the record again the reason the amendment has been put forward by all sides.  I thank the Minister for recognising the force of the argument presented on Committee Stage and on having brought forward this amendment which separates very distinctly the definitions of the words &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo;.  The intent of making that distinction explicit in the interpretations section will be of little or no benefit unless it is carried right through to the drafting of the regulations that will give effect to the type of building control exercised by those people who design and construct buildings.  While frequently there is interconnection between both sides, quite frequently there is no connection whatsoever.  It is for that reason that the split in the definition was sought.  I hope that in recognising the validity of the argument, which the Minister has done by coming forward with this amendment, there will be a similar recognition of the total division between design and construction to give effect under section 6 and under the regulations that will be brought forward.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the fact that we are making this important amendment to the Bill.  I do not want to delay the House by repeating what Deputy Quinn has said, other than to say that what we are doing must be reflected in the regulations that are made.  These amendments improve the Bill.  What we attempted to do on Committee Stage and hopefully what we may do during the course of the morning is designed to improve the effectiveness of a measure that we all wish to see put in place.  In the light of last night's somewhat extraordinary presentation by the Minister of <Col N="1215" /> State at the Department of the Environment, it is no harm to note that whatever Bill comes before this House always ends up having some amendments made to it.  Not only do the Opposition side seek them but the Government side acknowledge that they are necessary.  I hope we will have a constructive process this morning and that not only this amendment but some of the other amendments tabled will be looked on favourably by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is drafting amendment.  It simply proposes to insert the conjuction &ldquo;and&rdquo; between the words &ldquo;safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;. The amendment arises from a Committee Stage discussion which took place on amendments put down by Deputy Quinn and the former Deputy Keating.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 22 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Subject to subsection (11) and to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any dispensation or relaxation granted under section 4 or 5, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any appeal under section 7 which has been allowed,</P>
      <P>every building to which building regulations apply shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of such regulations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment which simply brings this subsection into line in a drafting context with similar references to relaxations and dispensations in subsequent sections, notably section 6 and section 8.  The point at issue is that it is not an actual dispensation or relaxation that is granted under section 7 but rather an appeal against the decision by a building control authority which is allowed and my amendment provides accordingly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment was debated in Committee almost a year ago to the day.  Deputy Quinn's amendment seeks to achieve the same objective, that is to qualify the degree to which compliance with building regulations is to be achieved.  I cannot accept the introduction of an element of uncertainty or indeed a dilution of the concept of compliance with the building regulations but I can well appreciate the reasons the amendments are being put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the science of construction is inexact by its very nature and that in many instances there is a range of tolerance inside which a building is considered to be adequately built.  It would be appropriate to take account of these concerns in the certificates to be <Col N="1217" /> prescribed under section 6 of the Bill, using some formula of words as, &ldquo;subject to the procedures and tolerances of the building practices.&rdquo;  My assurance on this point was accepted during the Committee Stage debate and I would ask Deputies to similarly accept what I am saying here now.  Lest there be any apprehension on this point, I ought to make it clear that I am not restricted in the type of certificate that I can prescribe.  Section (6) (2) (b) simply refers to the form and content of the various certificates but it does not specify what the certificates should contain. I hope that, as a result of the earlier discussion and my explanation now, particularly in so far as the certificate and their content are concerned, Deputies will see that it is reasonable to accept the amendment of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4 reads:</P>
      <P>In the second last line, after &ldquo;contructed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;materially&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be pernickety or nit picking about this but there is a particular concern in the context, for example, of the purchase of a premises.  If lawyers say they want a certificate to confirm that a building is designed in accordance with the provisions of the regulations and they get one which says it is constructed materially in accordance with the provisions or within a limited degree of allowances, as the Minister put it, it could be arguable that the criteria applying under regulations as required by the legislation have not been complied with.  I have no axe to grind as regards whether it is the amendment tabled by himself or the one tabled by Deputy Quinn which is accepted &mdash; I do not think that matters greatly &mdash; but we are all concerned that these regulations are fully complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be talking later about control and the problems in that area.  It is important that it is recognised that we are talking about what, on the fringes, can be an inexact procedure of assessment.  It seems that the Minister's explanation for not accepting the amendments is more an argument in favour of accepting <Col N="1218" /> them because he is saying that, in the context of the regulations and the wordings of certificates, the possibility that led to the tabling of these amendments will become a reality.  If that is the case I would invite the Minister to again consider taking on board either Deputy Quinn's amendment or my amendment. There is little point in saying one thing in the legislation but in practice applying it a little differently, with a little more flexibility.  That is what has become known as Irish solutions to Irish problems. If we mean something let us say it in the legislation the way we mean it to apply and not say one thing in the legislation and introduce something a little differently in regulations or certificates and as a result leave an area of doubt as to what the actual position is.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to take on board either my amendment or Deputy Quinn's amendment or, if the Minister feels he needs further time to look at this matter, it is obviously open to him to table an amendment to deal with it in the Seanad.  That of course would mean that the legislation would have to come back here but I suspect that if one or two of today's amendments that are tabled from the Opposition side are not accepted, the Minister may have to reconsider them before the matter goes to the Seanad and it may be inevitable that the Bill will come back here.  Everything the Minister has said has confirmed that the amendments that have been tabled are right in the context of what is going to happen in practice.  I find it very difficult to understand why, if that is the case, the legislation should not reflect what is going to be the reality ultimately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that this is Report Stage and that we have debated this Bill rather exhaustively.  I do not want to engage in repetition but let me make one or two material points &mdash; no pun intended.  First, the experience of the Department of the Environment in relation to arriving at a satisfactory form of certificate in respect of the administration of the building controls or the Local Government (Multi-Storey <Col N="1219" /> Buildings) Act is something we should all have regard to and should all learn from.</P>
      <P>All of us need to continuously learn. Both amendments are essentially the same.  Whether one accepts Deputy Shatter's neater and tidier amendment or the rephrasing of the clause in perhaps a more harmonious way, as in my amendment, does not matter.  The effect is essentially the same.  It will provide within the framework of the legislation enacted in this House and signed by An tUachtarán that material compliance is what the House meant when we debated and enacted this legislation and it would be improper and perhaps not legally acceptable to introduce a subsidiary form of legislation, that is, regulations which did not have the benefit of debate in the House.  This could introduce a degree of doubt or, as I think the Minister said, vagueness when the primary legislation under which the regulations are drafted clearly said that material compliance and ambiguity are not acceptable.  My real worry &mdash; I say this in as constructive a manner as possible &mdash; is that when the regulations are being drafted and the Minister's officials are being as co-operative as they possibly can, legal advisers on behalf of the certifiers who will have to carry the can, not necessarily in statute law but perhaps in common law &mdash; I accept the Minister is not attempting to confer a statutory liability on certifiers &mdash; will have a different interpretation. There is a case to be made &mdash; and the lawyers in this House would be better able to argue it than me &mdash; that notwithstanding anything in statute law in relation to the liability of a certifier common law may very well say that you have signed a certificate stating that there is compliance with the regulations and the inspection clearly shows that the building is not in compliance with the regulations because, as the Minister pointed out, its construction cannot be an exact science.  That is the essence of my point and I am not going to labour it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is either in a position to accept the amendment or he is not.  If he cannot see his way to accept it now, <Col N="1220" /> perhaps he should have second thoughts about it when the Bill is introduced in the Seanad.  I do not want to be a Cassandra but I see great difficulties down the road in the administration of this legislation and in drafting the regulations.  That is the advice I have received.  I know the Minister gets his own professional and legal advice.  The net point of what I am saying is that if, having debated this issue on the floor of this House and perhaps on the floor of the Seanad, the words &ldquo;material compliance&rdquo; or any alternative variations are debated and rejected, we could create difficulties down the road in the drafting of the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered this aspect of the legislation very carefully.  We are all agreed that we want compliance with the regulations and a means which will be secure.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;material&rdquo; in secondary legislation, that is, the regulations, is different and more appropriate than putting it into the primary legislation.  In fact, we came to that conclusion because of the difficulties Deputy Quinn referred to with the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act.  That Act specified that the whole thing had to be included in a certificate and this has given rise to some difficulties which have not yet been resolved.  I hope we are on the brink of a resolution to the problem now.  I am sure Deputy Quinn is aware that there have been some further meetings and we hope to reach a final solution.</P>
      <P>This Bill simply says that the Minister shall prescribe the form and content of the certificate.  That is a significant difference to the provision in the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act which caused the difficulty. We are trying to learn from the inconvenience which has arisen between the professions and the Department and this is the way to get around it.  If it is, it will be an improvement and will lead to resolution of the very problem the Deputy wants to avoid.  This should be sufficient reassurance to the House.</P>

      <P>I outlined my reason for opposing the amendment on Committee Stage.  I have considered the matter further and my previous objections still stand.  The Minister of the day will use the power very sparingly.  Taking account of the flexible nature of the Bill this provision to exclude certain buildings, persons or bodies from the provisions of building control regulations ought to be retained.</P>
      <P>As Deputies have pointed out, this provision could be used to exclude housing from the control system, but equally it could be used to exclude small extensions or out-buildings if it were considered appropriate.  I want to remind the House of my previous assurance that any building regulations &mdash; these regulations should not be confused with the building control regulations &mdash; which are made under my hand will set out a range of requirements in relation to domestic buildings as well as other buildings.  I want to reiterate that assurance here this morning.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the building regulations will apply to domestic houses in the context of fire regulations, but no controls will?  If so, it seems that in the absence of controls the regulations will be meaningless because there will be no means of ensuring they are being complied with.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position in the context of domestic dwellings.  I raised a number of concerns in the context of materials being used in domestic dwellings which can result in a fire catching hold far quicker than it should which may result in deaths.  I also raised the recent very tragic case of a person who died in a fire in a three storey local authority house in Summerhill.  If a fire starts on the second floor and a person is trapped on the third floor there is no means of escape.  I urged the Minister at that time to ask local authorities to look at their three storey dwellings to ensure that if there was a fire people caught on a third floor would have a means of exit.  Is the Minister saying there will be no controls in place in this area and that this matter will not be followed up either in the context of the existing buildings or ensuring that new buildings do not create these problems? If the Minister is saying there will be controls, will he outline to the House what those controls will be?</P>

I support the thrust of Deputy Shatter's amendment not because I want to deny any future Minister for the Environment the <Col N="1224" /> flexibility which from time to time may be needed but because I fear this flexibility at this time would be abused.  If the Minister can give an assurance to the House that this provision will be availed of very sparingly &mdash; perhaps he could give an indication of the circumstances in which it might be availed of &mdash; then the real concerns that the Labour Party and other Members have in respect of it will be allayed.  Will the Minister give examples of what would qualify for such exemptions?  If he can we will have an idea of the thinking behind the provision. We do not wish to deny flexibility but, at the same time, we are fearful of the consequences of such a provision.</P>

      <P>I concur with the views of Deputies Shatter and Quinn on the amendment.  I listened to the Committee Stage debate very carefully, and to the Minister's contribution this morning, but I have not heard a satisfactory explanation why there should be exclusions from the provisions.  The Minister mentioned the possibility of excluding extensions, outbuildings and so on, but I thought the whole purpose of the Bill was to provide regulations and a control system which would ensure that buildings were properly erected.  I do not see how a case can be made for the exclusion, for example, of extensions to domestic dwellings or outbuildings.  Such extensions and out-buildings will have to stand the test of time.  I do not think a case can be made for excluding certain types of buildings. If the subsection is allowed to remain in the Bill pressures will be brought on Ministers to exclude buildings of a particular type at certain times.</P>

At face value that appears to be reasonable but no hard and fast decision has been made in regard to this.  In response to Deputy Shatter I should like to point out that section 11 (3) should relieve some of his anxiety in so far as the inspection of buildings at any stage of the construction is concerned. That, coupled with the flexibility in the Bill, should relieve his anxiety.  I only see the exemption being applied in exceptional circumstances, if at all.</P>

      <P>The amendment deals with subsection (3) of section 6 which states:</P>
      <P>(3)  Building control regulations may make different provisions in relation to different buildings, or classes of buildings, in relation to buildings or classes of buildings situated in different areas, or in relation to different provisions of building regulations.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to delete that subsection.  If that is not acceptable to the Minister I have, with Deputy Gilmore, tabled amendment No. 8 which states:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 2, after &ldquo;regulations.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Notwithstanding the generality of this subsection, the building control regulations shall provide for domestic dwellings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> There is a major concern as to the extent to which building control regulations will apply to domestic dwellings, an issue I will deal with when we are debating other amendments.  There is a great worry that it is the Minister's intention to, in effect, exclude all domestic dwellings that are built in the future from application of the control regulations.  That has given rise to a great deal of public concern.  There is little point in having building regulations if they are not to be effectively enforced.  There is little point in having regulations that do not apply to domestic dwellings.  I do not wish to labour the point but I want the Minister to respond to the two amendments, having considered the points made on Committee Stage when they were withdrawn to give him an opportunity to consider the position.</P>
    <P>In the last two weeks the Minister may have become aware of the great public concern about the implications of this. The legislation is complex and the implications that arise from the manner in which it may impact on domestic houses were not fully understood.  It is because many of these issues have been debated that public attention is focusing on this area.  Will the Minister indicate his thinking on our amendments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Shatter said on amendment No. 8. A lot of the concern expressed about the Bill has to do with the controls proposed.  There is general agreement that the provisions for the making of building regulations are welcome but there is considerable concern inside and outside the House that while the regulations may be made the control system provided for will be inadequate.  There is concern about the distinct possibility that domestic dwellings may be excluded from the control system.  If that is the case the protection that the vast majority of purchasers of houses have will be removed.  To exclude domestic dwellings from the control system would be a grave omission.  There is little point in having good building regulations if we do not have a good control system to enforce <Col N="1227" /> them and to ensure that the buildings and houses being erected for the general public comply with the regulations.  This matter was debated on Committee Stage and there is little point repeating the views expressed then.  There is no good reason domestic dwellings should not be included in the Bill so as to ensure that the control regulations apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Without being repetitive, I rise to reinforce the points which have been made already and to indicate that I am concerned, as are the many people who have taken an extraordinarily deep interest in this debate, that following the enactment of this legislation people living in the seven local authority areas where building by-laws for all buildings are operated, including extensions of any size &mdash; the exemption only relates to planning permission, not to building construction standards and they represent we are told approximately 40 per cent of all building activity &mdash; will find because of the difficulties and constraints being imposed on local authorities that an exemption will be made in respect of domestic buildings with regard to ensuring that the building regulations are complied with.  We will await the Minister's response to amendment No. 13 but it is clear to me that there is a distinct possibility, once the law has been enacted and passed, that the building regulations will become statutory, that they will be the regulations which will have to be administered by the seven local authorities who currently operate seven different types of building by-laws, even though in some cases they are virtually the same.  If the Minister was to leave the legislation stand or allow the negotiations on the form of the certificate to proceed at a slow pace the building regulations would be applied in all those areas where the local authorities operate building by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are worried about is that the possibility to take the burden off the other local authorities will be availed of because of the exigencies of the various pressures.  While we are in favour of <Col N="1228" /> giving the Minister much flexibility &mdash; heaven knows this Bill is about as flexible an instrument as one could give to any Minister for the Environment &mdash; we are very fearful of the implications if flexibility is availed of in this instance.  The Minister would show goodwill if he accepted either of the amendments which have been proposed.  The wording of amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputy Shatter and Deputy Gilmore is better than the wording of the straightforward proposal to delete, as it provides a degree of flexibility while clearly stating the category of building we do not wish to have excluded.  It is for that reason that I urge the Minister to take on board what has been proposed.  It is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>If the Minister announces in the House that he is not going to avail of this flexibility and that domestic buildings will be covered by some form of control mechanism, which has yet to be decided, he will reassure the entire country but if, however, he is not in a position to say that, alarm bells will ring right across the country and every householder contemplating making a purchase will know that there is no mechanism of control other than the very limited national house guarantee scheme which only applies to structures and lasts for ten years.  The lending agencies who govern at least one third of mortgages will not be happy if this provision is availed of.  While most of the lending from building societies and banks takes place in urban areas the vast number of self-financed or other financed housing is outside of the urban areas where building by-law mechanisms are operated at present.</P>
    <P>There could be fearful implications if the Minister were to signal that the construction of domestic buildings, that is homes, would be exempt from any kind of control mechanisms as all sorts of alternative certification would be required by the holders of mortgages.  The average mortgage is now running between £30,000 and £40,000 while the average price of a house is of the order of £35,000 to £40,000.  This represents the biggest life investment which any of us, any individual or family makes.  Notwithstanding <Col N="1229" /> anything which this House might do, the lending institutions are going to have to safeguard their depositors' resources and funds.  The Minister should say quite categorically here now that domestic buildings will be included and on that basis ask the House to give him flexibility. I would be inclined, reluctantly, to accede to that request if that clarification was forthcoming.  If on the other hand the Minister is unable to give that clarification or assurance to the House I would have no alternative but reluctantly to ensure that this amendment is pressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete subsection (3) of section 6 from the Bill.  I am a little surprised that Deputy Shatter has persisted with this amendment because it seems obvious to me that while one type of control system would be appropriate in the case of a complex building to which, for example, members of the public would have access, a less onerous type of control might well be appropriate in the case of a simpler, less sensitive building.  To put it another way, there is little similarity between a place of entertainment and an outhouse in terms of potential risk to those who have access to them.  This subsection is necessary to ensure that building control regulations can deal with each type of building in a manner appropriate to the particular construction criteria arising.  I am convinced, therefore, that the subsection must stand.  The same issue arises in amendment No. 8.  There is not much more I can add except to say that there is no valid reason why domestic dwellings should be singled out for special treatment in the Bill which, after all, is enabling legislation of a much more flexible nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment, building extensions, no matter how small or insignificant they may be and at whatever location, would have to be subject to the full rigours of control.  This may not be necessary.  As Deputy Quinn will appreciate, as it is he who mentioned the seven authorities who have this mechanism in place, it does not exist outside of those areas and no one is <Col N="1230" /> suggesting that a lesser standard applies anywhere else.  I hope not, anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A higher standard is applied in the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may not necessarily be so.  Such has never been indicated or substantiated.  In fact I would say to Deputy Quinn that as high, if not higher, a standard exists outside the seven areas controlled by the local authorities who operate building controls at this time. That said, the regulations will be applied evenly and they will apply to houses.  We are all agreed on that.  Section 11, if I may refer to it again, allows building control authorities to enter into buildings and inspect the plans for buildings.  Section 8 empowers a building authority to serve an enforcement notice in certain cases where a building does not comply with the regulations.  All those matters are catered for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>If we were to go further and ask how we put this into effect, I would point out that sections 16 and 17 deal with the offences and penalties.  All of those provisions in sections 8 and 11 and everything else in the legislation would be independent of any control system contemplated under section 6.  That being the case, this is very efficient legislation. Granted it gives flexibility and I concur with everything Deputy Quinn has said on that matter.  It was intended to be so and I ask that the principle of flexibility enshrined in the legislation be conceded by all concerned.  That being the case, along with all the other things contained in the various sections, we have an efficient way of dealing with the matters raised by the Deputies.  I have to be cross with Deputy Gilmore for seeking to introduce this element of confusion over the weekend, through the media.  I understand why the Deputy did it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's response to the amendment to include expressly, provisions stating that domestic dwellings will be included in the regulations in the context of control, the Minister was careful to keep talking about the building regulations as opposed to the building control regulations.  The semantical exactitude of the Minister's references was not lost on Members on this side of the House.  The key here is <Col N="1232" /> control.  The key is the building control regulations, making different provisions to the building regulations, for different classes of houses.  The Minister kept saying that the building regulations will deal with domestic houses, but it is the control regulations that are the problem. Without labouring the point, all of us on this side of the House have already said this morning that regulations are meaningless without controls being in place. That was made very clear in the recent reports that were published in relation to the Raglan House explosion.  The report of the Government task force on multi-storey buildings dealt with the concept of building control.  It recognised that the implementation of building regulations is of little value unless they can be effectively enforced.  It did not even consider a situation where some buildings would be exempt.  The report made the point that the effectiveness of the system is dependent on a high level of technical competence and professional responsibility among those certifying and that there would need to be a high degree of policing to support certifiers in carrying out their duties diligently.  The recommendation of the task force was that the Building Control Bill should be enacted as soon as possible so that building regulations and an effective building control system can be put on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Our concern is that an effective building control system will not exist with regard to domestic dwellings and that is what this amendment is about.  If the Minister tells us that he might exempt the odd shed that may be built in someone's garden, from building control regulations, we would not argue with that, because the control regulations would effectively lay down specific provisions for a domestic dwelling and they could then go on and say that the garden shed or the green house of a particular dimension is excluded.  What we want to do is to ensure that the domestic dwelling falls within the control regulations.  The Minister accuses Deputies of confusing the issue with the media but none of the Deputies have done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stories that have emerged in the <Col N="1233" /> papers in the last few days derive from members of the public and the professional bodies involved who know what they are talking about, homing in on this concern with regard to the legislation and with regard to what we believe can be a very dangerous gap in the controls that may or may not be put in place.  If the Minister wonders about what would fuel people's worries and suspicions, he does not have to go any further than the latest edition of <i>Housing News,</i> The official newsletter of the Irish Homebuilders Association, December, 1989, Volume 4, No. 5 which has a very pleasant picture of the Minister, the Secretary of the Irish Homebuilders Association and the Chairman and the Director with whom we are all familiar.  There we have a very interesting headline.  &ldquo;By-law exemptions before Christmas&rdquo; thunders this very important publication, with a question mark.</P>
    <P>Housing should be exempted from by-law approval in the New Year which would alleviate the costs and delays suffered by members at the moment.</P>
    <P>Of course the members we are talking about here are not the ordinary general public who might buy a house but the members of the Irish Homebuilders Association who no doubt regard it as a welcome innovation that we might have building regulations in place but that nobody will be inspecting what is going on to find out if anyone is complying with them.  That obviously is a cause of pre-Christmas celebration on the part of this body, fuelled no less by a meeting they had with the Minister.  The newsletter went on to say:</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, the IHBA expressed the annoyance of members with the delays in the whole planning process.</P>
    <P>Of course we have had the Minister telling us on another occasion that there were no delays in the planning process. The article continued:</P>
    <P>In response, the Minister promised <Col N="1234" /> to have the new Building Control Bill passed by the Oireachtas by Christmas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We may pass it here today.  I do not know what the Minister's plans are for getting it through the Seanad before Christmas.  As reported further, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This would exempt members from inspections and by-law charges.</P>
      <P>Instead homebuilders will be allowed self-certification in conformity with new regulations.</P>
      <P>I will not cry crocodile tears over replacing by-laws with provisions arising effectively from the building control legislation, but apparently the great cause for celebration is that this will exempt members from inspections.</P>
      <P>The only thing missing from this piece of lyrical and literary celebration is the couple of laughs and guffaws that must have followed when the Minister said, &ldquo;by the way, lads, self-certification will be sufficient.&rdquo;  All of a sudden the delays would be removed.  Of course, the delays are not delays in the planning process but they are delays that might occur on site when the local authority want to inspect what is happening or when they ask that a foundation be examined and something may have to be dug up, or where some work that has been undertaken has to be examined in some detail that may delay progress by half a day in relation to a particular domestic dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Homebuilders Association are celebrating because their members will not be subject to inspections to ensure that they comply with the basic requirements so that the house that the ordinary house purchaser buys is built in conformity with the fundamental specifications that are required as necessary in the interests of the public generally and of the house purchaser in particular.  That is not a cause for celebration for the overwhelming majority of people who are relying on this House to pass legislation that does not just put in place a set <Col N="1235" /> of tidy principles by way of legislation or regulations that we desire builders to comply with.  What they want to see is regulations that have teeth, that can be enforced, where there are real checks, where there are obligations on the local authority to make sure that those basic standards are being complied with.  If anybody has fuelled public alarm that the position after the message of this legislation may be less secure than it was prior to its passage, with regard to domestic dwellings, it was the Minister in his meeting with the Irish Home Builders Association.  The association perhaps are a little too previous in celebrating what they think is something of a building coup in convincing the Department to put in place an approach that is not adopted in any other member state of the EC and which was even rejected by the British Government where apparently the involvement of the state in checking everything has now become something of a reserved sin.  In the building control area in the context of domestic dwellings even the British Prime Minister did not run with the type of approach the Irish Home Builders Association want to see put in place.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister, having had time to consider the worries expressed by Deputies on this side of the House following Committee Stage, does not see fit to accept amendment No. 8.  I have no doubt that this amendment will come back to the Minister in the Seanad.  I would not wish to be the Minister in maybe two or three years' time having to come into the Dáil and defend his position on this amendment in the event of domestic dwellings truly being excluded from inspection as the Irish Home Builders Association envisage.</P>

I am sure the Minister received a copy of this newsletter about ten days ago as I did, and that he has seen the contents of it.  From his happy smile on page 2 which contains this headline it seems that the Ministerial <i>imprimatur</i> has been given to this <i>cause célébre</i> of the building industry.

      <P>We will now deal with amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  Amendment No. 10 in the names of Deputies Gilmore, Quinn and Shatter is related so I am suggesting that we discuss amendments Nos. 9 and 10 together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) ensure that such inspections of certificates of compliance, inspection of plans or documents relating to buildings or works, inspections of buildings or works, either during the course of the works or when completed, which the building control authority may be required to carry out pursuant to subsection (2) (g) shall ensure compliance with this Act or of regulations or orders made under this Act, or with the requirements of the building regulations or buildings or works which are designed and constructed in the area of control of the said authority but not inspected as part of the said requirements.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was drafted to try to provide for a number of situations, and I hope the wording is acceptable to the Minister, notwithstanding anything in section 11, to which the Minister has had frequent recourse, where an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; can in effect exercise some degree of scrutiny during the construction of a building or following its completion. I am interpreting the provisions in section 11 as an emergency rather than a standard mechanism.  I do not think anybody is suggesting seriously that the provisions of section 11 are the main mechanisms of control.  We are all agreed that the powers given to the Minister in section 6 are the main mechanism for the exercise of control by whatever form, be it through a certification process, self-certification or by building approvals. Perhaps I am anticipating that the Minister, in reply to my amendment, will refer me to section 11 but I wish to say in advance that I do not accept that argument, because I do not think we are talking about the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendments we are trying to ensure that the Minister may require <Col N="1241" /> local authorities to inspect periodically the various certificates of compliance in relation to documents, including drawings, plans, etc., and that the fact that they would carry out such an exercise would not in any way make them responsible for the accuracy of the documentation. I am trying to get over the problem which the Minister and the Department may have envisaged with section 6 (4) where, in line 5 on page 10 I think the operative clause is &ldquo;shall not be under a duty&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in this instance has been interpreted by the Department as making it possible that a local authority in some way would be liable under civil law for ensuring that the contents of a package of documents were correct and that in the event of such documentation emerging in a civil court case as being incorrect, an aggrieved property owner could take an action in civil law against the local authority.  I understand that the inclusion of this clause in section 6 (4) is to avoid the possibility of local authorities being cojoined in a civil action for negligence or for damage to property.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Minister's concern that a local authority may be co-joined in a civil action, and ignoring whether that is valid, the amendment in my name, which has been drafted in part by professional practitioners, is an attempt to recognise that concern, while at the same time ensuring that periodic inspections of some certificates and the documents of complicance could be undertaken by a local authority.  In essence it is a random inspection of a small number of documents and will ensure that all the certifiers will be aware that their documents could in fact be subject to scrutiny and as a consequence they could be prosecuted for offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>Similarly, amendment No. 10, since we are discussing both amendments together, in the names of myself, Deputies Gilmore and Shatter is suggesting a slightly different approach to the same problem.  What we are saying in both cases, and I will be as brief as I possibly can due to the constraints of time, is <Col N="1242" /> that we are not trying to make the local authority responsible for the accuracy of what is set out in a set of certified documents and that therefore they cannot be liable in civil or common law.  We are not asking that every package of documentation, as is apparently the case under the approval system, be scrutinised and tested as to whether it complies with the building regulations.  That would not be a form of self-certification.  In both amendments we are trying to ensure that some certificates and packages of documentation are subject to detailed scrutiny by a competent authority nominated by the building authority or the Minister for the Environment.  If it were known that packages of documents were subject to detailed scrutiny and, if found to be fraudulently completed that the person who submitted them would be subject to prosecution, all documents lodged with the local authorities would be likely to be carefully completed by the practitioners and by the certifiers.</P>
    <P>That is the essence of our amendment. We are not trying to introduce a new philosophy or a new concept to Irish law, as it exists at present under the Revenue Commissioners' system of self assessment of tax liability.  We are not trying to introduce a procedure which is alien to current practice in our administration but we are simply recognising the human condition. While the vast majority of people operating in any sphere will comply with the legislation, human nature prevails and a minority will cut corners and perhaps will certify fraudulently that certain documents comply with the building regulations when perhaps they do not. They will be tempted to do this for commercial reasons if they feel there is nobody to check the records.  To give an example, it is a bit like taking a back road to cross the Border when you know there is never a Customs and Excise check.  If you think you are likely to be subject to a customs check at some stage, you are more careful.  In essence we are looking for policing within the control system.  It is my view and the view of other Deputies in this House, and certainly of a large <Col N="1243" /> number in the profession, that the existence of the building control regulations will be meaningless if there are not some forms of checks within the control system.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to impose a duty in common law or in civil law on the local authority to verify the accuracy of the documents lodged so that they could be liable if it emerged that the documents were not properly completed.  However, we are trying to ensure that the local authorities, or a body acting on their behalf, such as the building advisory council or somebody contracted from it, or the environmental protection agency or some other such contracted body, carry out random checks.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily have to be the hard pressed local authority.  The scheme could be self-financing if it was done on a fee basis.  The concerns, many of them legitimate, that a bureaucratic central administration might have about imposing additional duties on a local authority can be taken on board, recognised as valid and accommodated.  Our point is if there is not some form of effective policing which will result in penalties being imposed on people who fraudulently, negligently or criminally sign certificates that a design was completed in accordance with the building regulations, when it manifestly was not, or that a building was constructed in accordance with designs and specifications which comply with the building regulations, but manifestly was not those people may be tempted, by the belief that there are no control systems, to cut corners and make more money for themselves and as a consequence put the ordinary citizen at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were speaking earlier the Minister seemed somewhat concerned about reports in the media which appeared recently in connection with the debate on this Bill.  I am glad those reports have given him some cause for concern because it appears that the Minister has been addressing himself to <Col N="1244" /> two agendas; the introduction of regulations, with which we are all in agreement, but side by side with that he is also dismantling the system of control that already exists and he is making no provision for any effective control in the Bill we are now debating.</P>
      <P>Following a long Committee Stage debate about self-certification it was eventually agreed that that was essentially the system that will be used, that is, that professionals working for a particular builder would themselves certify that they are complying with the regulations that will be made following the passage of this Bill.  Amendment No. 10 seeks to put in place a system of spot checks of the certificates talked about that are submitted by the professionals in much the same way as the case highlighted by people crossing the Border. That is why we have customs posts; that is why customs officials carry out spot checks.  We do not allow people to travel in and out of the country certifying that they are complying with the customs and excise regulations.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture have a system of checking to ensure that their regulations are complied with and that infection control mechanisms are being carried out.  On Committee Stage it was mentioned that in the US where people certify themselves for income tax there is a system of spot checks.  That is what this amendment is seeking to achieve.</P>
      <P>In an earlier part of the debate the Minister seemed to suggest that we did not need to have a local authority or similar body carrying out such checks and &mdash; if I heard him correctly &mdash; he effectively said that there is no evidence to show that building is any worse in areas which are not currently covered by building by-law approval than in areas which are covered. That is not the case.  I have in front of me the statistics from the national house building guarantee scheme which give details of the claims made between 1978 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the Dublin area where there were 37,158 houses built between 1978 and 1987, and the total number of claims on the building guarantee scheme <Col N="1245" /> for that period was 45.  Approximately the same number of houses were built in the rest of the country, but the number of claims was 147, more than three times the number of claims in the Dublin area where there is building by-law approval. That does not suggest to me that the same standards are being applied in areas where there are inspections as opposed to areas where there are no inspections. The Government's own reports &mdash; the Cramer and Warner report and the task force on multi-storey buildings &mdash; said that the introduction of building regulations are of little value unless they can be effectively enforced.</P>
    <P>In this House last night the Minister of State speaking on the Environment Protection Agency Bill spoke in exactly the same terms.  She said very clearly that there is little point in having environmental legislation &mdash; she instanced the Air Pollution Act and the Water Pollution Act &mdash; unless there is a system of enforcement.  What we are getting in this Bill are the regulations but we are not getting the system of enforcement.  As Deputy Shatter stated earlier, the Minister has already conceded to the house building industry that the system of enforcement and inspection that is in existence is to be dismantled and that he is going to take the inspectors out of the area of inspecting buildings.</P>
    <P>What will happen if he does that?  Let us look at what is happening at present. The Minister made a remark earlier about how well informed I was about what happens with regard to the present building control system.  I am reasonably well informed and I am told that where there is already a building control system in force and people have to apply for building by-law approval, the building by-law officers find when they go out to inspect buildings that in roughly one out of every three there are problems with the foundations.  A typical example would be where a foundation is supposed to be two feet deep and it is found to be only one foot deep, or a foundation that is supposed to be built on solid ground is not built on solid ground.  This is the type of problem that arises where we have <Col N="1246" /> inspections at present.  Can you imagine what would happen if there were no inspections at all and the only system of control was that the professionals representing the particular builder would come in and certify that everything was all right?</P>
    <P>I am informed that in three out of every four cases there are problems with the drainage in dwellings, that the fall is not adequate on the pipes, that the manholes are not properly constructed etc.  I am informed that serious problems arise in the area of ventilation, for example, there are missing room vents and damp proof courses are not correctly applied. A typical example is that the damp proof course is not provided over windows. This is happening where there are inspections. Where there are no inspections, and under this Bill there is no provision for even a system of spot checking, the situation would be much worse and builders who wanted to but corners would do so.  They would cut on the materials they are using and the standard of building would suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>When I drew attention to problems like this on Committee Stage the Minister took me to task.  He said I was overly preoccupied with rogue builders.  I was hardly out of this House that day when I found a telephone message at home that a building was already under construction in my own area without planning permission. Within two days we had the example of a fine building in Blackrock, in my own constituency, Talbot Lodge, the home of former President de Valera, demolished by a developer in advance of a preservation order being put on that building.  I am not saying, and I would not suggest, that every builder falls into that category, but I state very clearly that some builders fall into that category, that some builders do cut corners and that some builders will run amok with these regulations.  I am informed that the regulations the Minister proposes to introduce are of a very general nature and are a copy of the current regulations in the United Kingdom.  It is stated, for example, that the structure shall be of an <Col N="1247" /> adequate standard.  The regulations are in very general terms of that nature.</P>
    <P>Where we have very general regulations and the system of control is to be by self-certification, the very least we need is a system of spot checking by the local authorities.  If we do not have that system of spot checking by the local authorities then, I believe, the regulations for which the Bill is providing will not be worth the paper they are written on.  As the task force report stated, the introduction of building regulations is of little value unless they can be effectively enforced.  The very least we need for effective enforcement is a system of spot checking.</P>

      <P>I can well understand that Deputy Quinn has some difficulty with the wording in the amendment he put down, that is the kindest thing I can say. I was a little surprised that he pursued it. He readily admits that it was produced some place else and that it does not stand up to very close drafting scrutiny.  Be that as it may, I am sympathetic to the motivation underlying amendment No. 10 but I have serious difficulties with the effects to which it could give rise.  I know from previous debates that some of us share different views on some aspects of this legislation, but I know also that we share a common conviction that the Bill should, as far as possible, provide a sound legislative base to enhance the safety and quality of the built environment.  The realisation of this common objective will, in the final analysis, owe more to those involved in the construction industry than any regulatory mechanism, legal or otherwise, which may be put in place. This is common to all industries and areas of human endeavour and is not just confined to the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves, in the light of what I have just said, what powers the public regulatory authority should have. In section 6, many options are available to the Minister and I will not go into them in detail yet again.  It is not right for some Members to be pursuing a line as if it was already predetermined what I would do <Col N="1248" /> in these matters.  Suffice to say that, in many respects, the meat of the Bill is found outside section 6 in the powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution which it confers on building control authorities.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that all sides of the House are firmly convinced that these powers should be conferred on building control authorities so that building regulations are observed.  What is at issue in a nutshell is whether these powers should be discretionary, as in the case of the Bill before us, or if there should be some statutory obligation on the authority exercising them.  It is not normal in the legislative code for which the Minister for the Environment is responsible to oblige local authorities to exercise powers of inspection or enforcement; this is something left to those authorities, as responsible public bodies, to exercise as circumstances require.  This is true of the functions of a fire authority under the Fire Services Act, 1981, and of a sanitary authority in exercising their functions under the Water Pollution Act.  There are many more examples, the list is not confined to local authorities.  The Garda enforce the Road Traffic Act on a similar basis and no one has suggested that the exercise of those powers should be mandatory rather than discretionary. There is no reason for building control law being any different.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned another list of checks of a similar nature but every one of them is discretionary and the same discretion exists in this legislation as in the type of legislation to which Deputy Gilmore referred.  What is the difference?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of liability. I am not hypersensitive to the exposure of local authorities to liability but I cannot see that this amendment would do other than contribute to just that outcome.  If a building is faulty it can be argued that an effective building control system was lacking and that not enough checks or inspections were carried out by the authority to ensure the effectiveness of the system.  In those circumstances, there must be every possibility that the <Col N="1249" /> aggrieved person would, with a realistic expectation of success, sue the building control authority in any action for damages. That is basically one of the reasons for not accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn said he did not intend or want that to be the case, that he did not want liability transferred to local authorities.  He made that quite clear in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The reference to paragraph 6 (2) (g) in amendment No. 9 tabled by Deputy Quinn is inappropriate.  I take it that the paragraph is inserted to require building control authorities to provide certain statistical data to the Minister and is wholly unrelated to the whole question of inspections.  If my understanding of the purpose of the amendment is correct&mdash; I will preface my remarks by saying that I am reluctant to go too far down the road in anticipating what the courts would do in any particular circumstances &mdash; I very much doubt if the insertion of an immunity provision would ultimately succeed in denying any legal right of redress which the courts may feel exist in accordance with natural justice.  If my argument is correct, any immunity provision, the objective of the amendment, would fail or would be liberal in its effect irrespective of the care with which it was drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore argued that the experience derived from the operation of a new house building guarantee scheme suggests that there are fewer incidents of blame in the existing areas where building by-laws are operated.  He went further by implying that a local authority approval type system based on building by-laws or building regulations is preferable to the self-certification system.  Of course, that was Deputy Gilmore's point from his very first contribution on this legislation. I have not seen the figures produced by the advocates of that proposition &mdash; there was some reference to them this morning <Col N="1250" />&mdash; but I have asked the guarantee company for data in relation to their experience with the claims in different counties.  The results are inconclusive, certain by-law areas have a relatively low incidence of claims when weighted against the number of houses registered under the scheme while other by-law areas seem higher.  I am not putting this forward on my own initiative as it was suggested to me by sources outside the Department that the incidence of claims may well owe more to the nature of soil conditions in a particular area than to any other factor.  I do not know if that is the case but I am offering it for consideration and it may very well be the cause for the variations in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Gilmore persists in his criticism of the construction industry.  I do not accept his criticisms regarding foundations.  He has also been critical of the workmen who build these houses but I do not share his attitude or his over-critical view of the workmen on the building sites with which &mdash; I presume &mdash; he is most familiar in Dublin.  I cannot understand why he persists in his criticisms because he promotes himself in other cases as being a defender of these people.  Building construction workers in this city and throughout the country do a very conscientious job and produce good buildings for the public.  He talked about control of certain matters that might have been applicable under the by-laws of various authorities but those authorities did most of their examinations over the desk. I am not aware of any major contribution of by-law inspectors on sites so far as these matters are concerned.  Deputy Gilmore's arguments are not consistent with the facts.</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand the idea that certain regulations are being framed by the Minister or the Department in a certain way. Deputy Gilmore has no information as to what is intended in regard to these matters.  I regard his remarks as chit-chat. It is unhelpful because it seeks, in a mild way, to undermine what is genuinely regarded as a decent effort by the Department and the Minister to put in place an effective mechanism to deal with these <Col N="1251" /> matters.  I will not go as far as saying that the Deputy was seeking to be mischievous &mdash; that is not the kind of language I use &mdash; but he should not allow chit-chat like that to colour his contribution in the House because the Bill is perceived by all sides of the House as a real effort &mdash; after five years &mdash; to finally do something in the area of regulations and control.  I never suggested that this legislation would not have warts, indeed I made it quite clear that there might very well be deficiencies, but I asked the House to tackle the Bill.  If it needs to be refined or amended following experience of practice, then so be it.  In the meantime I have gone quite as far as I can, perhaps somewhat further than had been suggested to me, to accommodate many of the items referred to on the other Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the principle of spot checks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say to the Deputy that I believe we have enshrined in the Bill the fact that these inspections can take place.  I really believe that the discretion there, the same as applies within other legislative frameworks within other Ministers' Departments, will be applied here also.  I regard this House and indeed Deputy Gilmore respectively as watchdogs of that.  Therefore, I see no reason to be over-anxious in that regard.  For that reason I might point out that section 6 (4) is not to be compared with the amendment now before us.  The subsection to which I have referred says simply:</P>
      <P>Where a certificate of compliance, ...is submitted to a building control authority</P>
      <P>&mdash; under a self-certification system &mdash;</P>
      <P>...the building control authority shall not be under a duty</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to establish that the certificate is correct or that the building to which it relates complies with building regulations. Deputy Quinn supports that point of view.  This is inherently reasonable and is <Col N="1252" /> a far more limited provision than the one Deputy Quinn is now attempting to insert.  I think he recognises himself that, whatever he might have intended in so doing, it is not well framed and would not achieve what he had intended.  That is my attitude to it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some interest to what the Minister had to say. I deliberately refrained from making a contribution on the amendment tabled in the names of myself, Deputies Gilmore and Quinn until we had heard the Minister's response.  The Minister's response, at best &mdash; to use a good old academic term &mdash; can be described as tautological. The Minister seems to be going round in circles.  I am not sure what is the reason for that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has just told us that he has enshrined in legislation that inspections can take place although he did not respond to the direct question posed by Deputy Quinn.  All this amendment provides in the context of buildings and building control, and I will quote it, is that:</P>
      <P>Building control authorities shall carry out such checks of certificates and documents lodged and work in progress and completed buildings as they consider necessary to satisfactorily monitor the effectiveness of the control system in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the amendment is about.  If the Minister is happy that inspections take place, by virtue of that local authorities will have to carry out spot-checks. If we are all in agreement on this I fail to understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment.  There has to be some unspoken reason &mdash; I will deal in a moment with subsection (4) and local authority liability because that is a red herring &mdash; and it is very difficult to figure what is the reason.  Perhaps the Minister wants to be in favour of spot-checks. I was talking yesterday evening of environmental rhetoric; perhaps we could talk about this as the built environment rhetoric.  Perhaps he wants to be in favour of it without anything actually <Col N="1253" /> happening.  Experience with the Multi-Storey Buildings Act has shown that, unless there is an obligation or a duty imposed on local authorities, there is no guarantee that hard-pressed local authorities will carry out any adequate or effective monitoring.</P>
    <P>What we on this side of the House want to see is that we have what the Minister referred to earlier &mdash; a sound legislative base to ensure the quality of the built environment.  What we are about at this moment is refining this Bill.  The Minister suggests that the refining should take place in perhaps four or five years' time after we have had experience of the operation of its provisions and have discovered or identified problems.  We are endeavouring to remove the warts before they grow.  We do not want to have to come in here to conduct a medical operation on the Act in some years' time when the ordinary consumer or house purchaser has discovered a major problem. Deputy Gilmore gave examples of the problems of house foundations not being laid at a correct level.  How many houses will have to fall down before we recognise that this Bill is full of warts and is in need of amendment?  Do we not have a duty to the house purchaser, to someone who acquires any building, or even a duty to the pedestrian who innocently walks past a building, to ensure it does not collapse about them, or does not fall on their head; is that not what we have a duty to do?  Is this not the fine-tuning mechanism?  Is this not the reason we have a Committee or Report Stage on legislation?  If this Stage does not result in the fine tuning we might as well forget it and just endorse whatever Bill a Government Department produce, have a bit of a flowery debate on it and that is the end of it?  This is what we are at.</P>
    <P>Sewage and drainage problems were referred to.  When inspections are not carried out and it is certified by a builder or surveyor that a house has been built in accordance with regulations, the controls are not in place and spot-checks have not been operational, will the Minister explain to some new house purchaser why strange and unedifying objects float up in <Col N="1254" /> their back garden delivered through the drainage system from half the estate in which they live?  Will the Minister wade through the front garden when sewage seeps out into the street and explain to a house purchaser: I am sorry, I thought the local authority would carry out checks to ensure the specifications were complied with; we are now going to go back and change the legislation?  It is as simple and basic as that.  We do not have to get involved in lengthy, academic treatises or analyses of the legislation.  What we want are building regulations, with proper controls, with local authorities being under a statutory duty to carry out spot-checks.</P>
    <P>The general public's understanding of the need for such legislation was one that would result in that type of legislative structure.  But apparently what is envisaged is a system under which we have building regulations, in some instances with some controls in place and, in others, no controls in place, and house builders, surveyors or architects engaging in a system of self-certification which, in the overwhelming majority of cases, would be the end of the matter; there would be no independent inspection carried out by a local authority to cover the wide areas to which the regulations will relate to ensure that basic requirements are being complied with.  The purchase of a house is the single greatest investment most ordinary people make during their lifetime.  They are entitled to know that local authorities are carrying out spot-checks to ensure that what they require meets specifications laid down by Government and this House to ensure their safety and that buildings are built to meet proper criteria.  I do not find anything the Minister has said to be in any way convincing.  He has raised the issue of liability.  I expressed the view the last day that if we have a meaningful certification system, if we want to provide a public guarantee as to the correctness of the construction of a building, the certication system will be meaningless unless a local authority both inspect and have a legal liability to ensure that that what they do is correct.</P>
    <P>The amendment I proposed to allow <Col N="1255" /> the general public recover damages from a local authority who in effect fall down on their public obligations was defeated, was opposed by the Minister and the House and is not incorporated in the Bill. Section 6 (4) stands.  That subsection contains complete exemption from any liability to civil action against local authorities who do not do their job properly on behalf of the consumer.  If a local authority is exempt from any liability, if they are short of staff, have no duty to inspect, are hard-pressed to have other local authority works carried out, what local authority in the country will arrange for spot-checks to be carried out unless there is a statutory duty imposed on them?  The answer is that none of them will.  The answer is that those people employed in the seven local authorities that currently have a by-law system in place will be given other duties.  They will not be involved in this area.  They will not carry out spot-checks.  The protections that we want to see in place will not be there.  The issue of liability is a red herring.  I greatly regret that the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore and I referred earlier to the report on multi-storey buildings, the Raglan House disaster and the report that was produced subsequent to that. All those reports conveyed one message: if you have regulations you must have proper controls and to have proper controls you must carry out inspections.  If the Minister truly wants inspections to be carried out, as opposed to presenting the facade that they may be carried out when in reality they will not be, he should accept this amendment.  There is something happening here that we in this House should be aware of.  Let us assume that we do not put in that statutory duty and that in three years' time some disaster takes place with regard to the building environment, a building does not comply with the regulations, no inspections have been carried out or certificates lodged and people are killed as a result of that disaster, I wonder what would happen.  If this Government are still in office &mdash; and I hope they are not <Col N="1256" />&mdash; this Minister or whoever succeeds him will come into this House and wash their hands of the affair.  They will say that in this legislation we gave local authorities powers to inspect and it is their fault that they did not carry out the inspection. They will wash their hands of any responsibility for any disaster that might result.</P>
    <P>It is my view that local authorities will not carry out spot-checks and will not monitor in the way that is necessary if this amendment is not accepted.  If, after the building control regulations are eventually made and this legislation comes into force, in some years time that type of disaster occurs, I want to put on the record of this House that this Government will be responsible due to their not being willing to accept this amendment.  It is as serious as that.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the celebration of the Irish Home Builders Association about the fact that they will no longer be subject to inspections.  That was inspired from somewhere.</P>

      <P>I have not talked to that association about this legislation but the Minister clearly has.  He is reported, in their December newsletter, as advising the Irish Home Builders Association that delays in the planning processes would come to an end and that soon their members would be exempt from inspections. The Minister did not advert to that in his response.  It is quite clear that, following the coming into force of this Bill, without this amendment being made local authorities will not carry out spot checks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that all the home builders or building companies who are currently involved in construction are doing a bad job.  That is not true.  There are many fine building companies who comply with statutory requirements and regulations, who get on with the job and build very fine buildings.  They are not <Col N="1257" /> the people who are the problem.  If all the building companies in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Make sure you get that on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;performed in that way we would not need this legislation. The legislation is not a problem to any of those people but it is a problem to the people who do not perform properly, to those who are willing to cut corners to make an extra few bob on the sale of a property.  It is a problem to the architect or surveyor who may not be as publicly minded, who may take the view that the approach to be taken is to advise the building company to get around regulations and to provide inferior materials without the local authority being made aware of what is happening.  There are a few of those people around but they are not in the majority.</P>
      <P>This legislation is not about the building companies or the architects or surveyors who do their job properly; it is about providing a protection to the general public against those who do not do their job properly.  I am sorry that the fact that inspections are no longer going to be part of the home building control mechanism appears to be a cause of celebration to the Home Builders Association. I would have hoped and expected that that association would welcome the fact that inspections continued to take place.  When builders do a good, job inspections are no great problem. They are only a problem to those who do not do the job properly.  I think we all have an interest in ensuring that those types of builders are not allowed a free rein.  My concern, if the Minister does not accept this amendment, is that they will have open season after the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  What the House would like to hear is not an extension of the discussion and the argument. I must correct the Minister in relation to one matter about which he seems to be very ill informed and that is the work carried out by building control officers in some of the larger local authorities in respect of on-site inspections. If the Minister has been informed that they carry out their work from secure and well-heated offices then he has been misinformed.  Frequent and regular inspections take place and indeed in many cases it is a condition of the by-laws that inspections take place at certain stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could remove a lot of uncertainty in relation to this amendment and the operation of section 6 of this legislation if he could indicate to the House that he is in favour of spot checks being carried out by a body, whatever body, to ensure that the control mechanism is operating effectively.  Section 6 (1) would enable him to require such spot checks to take place and I hope he will be prepared to do that in the regulations.  Alternatively he could accept the amendment in the names of the three Opposition Deputies&mdash;amendment 10&mdash;which basically says that that can be done.  That is the core of this debate.  If the Minister is not in a position to say that he is in favour of spot checks then alarm bells will start to ring very loudly and rapidly and without cessation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would like to put <Col N="1259" /> to the Minister is the fear that has been expressed cogently on this side of the House that in the absence of such spot checks the coming into operation of this legislation in advance of any form of self-certification being agreed by the industry and the Government authorities, the existing building approval system that covered the seven local authorities will be stood down in favour of some kind of vague form of self-certification or no certification whatsoever.  I know they are two separate questions but they are related.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to try to respond to whether or not he is in favour of the principle of spot checks and secondly to indicate to the House that prior to the arrival at an agreement about the form of self-certification, which we all agree will take some time, the existing building control authorities, instead of administering by certificates of approval the current building by-laws, will administer the building regulations that will simply replace the old by-laws.  The <i>status quo</i> in respect of the 40 per cent of the country where an approval system is in operation should remain in place until such time as a new system of certification is introduced and agreed upon.  There is a real fear in the minds of many people that there will be a hiatus in which no effective system of administration of any kind will exist in areas where there was previously a system of control.  They are the legitimate fears of this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply briefly on amendment No. 10 which I moved.  The Minister seems to think that I dreamt up some of the criticisms that I made about the building industry.  The day after we debated this Bill on Committee Stage the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Science and Technology, launched a quality material service for home builders in Galway.  It is quite clear that he was of the view that the prospective house buyer would have to have a broader assurance through quality checking of the major materials going into the House in <Col N="1260" /> addition to the structure itself.  If the materials have to be checked surely it follows that the construction should be checked.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have two objections to this amendment.  The first is that there is nothing to stop local authorities carrying out checks.  But who will do it? Most local authorities do not have building control sections and it has been made quite clear to the officers in the local authorities who have control sections that following the passage of this Bill they will be given other duties.  It has been made clear to them that the existing control sections of local authorities are going to be wound up.  This will mean there will be an even worse situation in those local authorities.</P>
      <P>The other element to this is that generally local authorities have loads of duties which they can carry out under a whole range of legislation.  However, given the way in which local authorities are structured and financed, if they do not have a statutory duty to perform a function it is most unlikely that it will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also seems to be worried about the liability on local authorities if this amendment is adopted.  It seems to me that subsection (4) absolves the local authority of liability for any claims being made against them on foot of their role under this Bill.  In any event because of the way in which this amendment is set out &mdash; it talks about such checks being carried out as the local authorities consider necessary &mdash; it does not place a burden on the local authority to examine every single certificate which is being submitted; it is clear that it is a system of spot-checking.  I cannot understand how that would impose any liability on local authorities in individual cases.  As long as it can be shown that local authorities are carrying out a system of spot-checking it does not necessarily follow that if a problem arises in regard to a file which has not been checked there is a liability on the local authority.  By not agreeing to this amendment the Minister is agreeing that there will be no policing.  He is taking <Col N="1261" /> the enforcement of the policing mechanism out of the control system.  Is it any wonder that many people in the building industry are so excited about the prospect that there will be no further inspections, that there will not be anyone from the local authorities coming to look at what is being done on the sites?</P>

      <P>The circumstances in which a person can speak twice on this Stage is that the person who has moved the amendment can close the debate.  I have allowed the Deputy to do that.  As some specific questions were put to the Minister I am prepared to allow him latitude to reply, if he so desires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not going to get into a discussion about rhetoric on this matter.  I am not at all concerned with rhetoric in so far as this important issue is concerned.  I am concerned with the reality and I had hoped the Deputy would be likewise.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee that local authorities will not act responsibly.  There seems to be some kind of implied suggestion that local authorities or building control authorities will somehow wash their hands politely and go away.  I do not accept that.  I have a much higher regard for local authorities and control authorities as they exist.  I believe they will be very conscious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying I have a high regard for the responsible way in which they treat legislation like this.  It is incorrect to say that I implied in something I said on a number of occasions that there are warts in the legislation.  I do not think there are but should there be this matter will have to be considered at a later date. It is not proper to seek to twist the position to convey an alternative view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the officers in the building by-law sections of the local authorities are concerned I have to say to Deputy Quinn that nothing I have said since the start of this discussion in any way implies <Col N="1262" /> that they were negligent or did not do a good job.  This is not in question at all. They did their duty as they saw it and as it was indicated to them and they performed well and admirably.  We should at least be at one on this.  What we need is a new system which is more appropriate to the modern situation and I believe that is agreed by us all.  To suggest that it is an implied reflection on those in the building by-law sections is misdirecting the attention from where it should be applied.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the unconnected pipes Deputy Shatter referred to are or whether his experience referred to an area under the control of officers where by-law systems are in place.  Nobody in this House or in the by-law sections of any of the seven authorities who have them support rogue builders or anybody who undertakes that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>Reference to the Raglan House task force report has been trotted out too often and it is as well for me to clear the line on this.  The only thing one can deduce from paragraph 8 of the task force report is that they want us to enact this legislation now.  They asked for this to be done some time ago and it has taken a fair bit of effort to get the legislation this far in spite of a few obstacles in the course.  I am directing this in a certain area as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say to the Deputy that nobody supports the rogue builder. The implication that the Irish House Building Association in any way support that kind of activity is unfair, unjustified, misdirected and blatantly incorrect.  They welcome both the concept of the legislation and the attitude I took in so far as delays in the appeals process were concerned.  I am working overtime on this issue at present to see if we can get back to the situation we thought existed at the end of 1988 so that there will be <Col N="1263" /> very few outstanding appeals after six months, or perhaps less.  Steps are being taken to provide extra finance and additional inspectors to deal with this problem. The Irish House Building Association welcomed this step.  When I met that association they were celebrating the upsurge in the construction industry where output will be in the region of 10 per cent this year.  There has been an increase in this output because of good Government activity in dealing with the economy.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) Persons or classes of persons submitting certificates of compliance shall submit to the building control authority evidence that they hold indemnity insurance appropriate to the building being certified.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have already heard the Minister say that he does not wish the local authorities to have any particular liability with regard to the certification process.  Indeed, there is a provision in the Bill which removes any liability.  If the certification process is to be in any way meaningful, it is important that the people who will have to rely on the regulations will have some form of redress against those who do not properly comply with the required specifications. In that context the provision of indemnity insurance, and the necessity for it, is designed to ensure that that redress is meaningful and that there would be funds available in the event of an individual having to pursue his rights through the courts due to a failure to comply with the regulations.  I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In the small number of EC member states where systems of self-certification are applied, they are underwritten by a requirement that certifiers hold insurance.  It is essential if the home buyer, the owners and users of buildings are to be given adequate protection that the certifiers have insurance.  As things stand at present, the local authorities could not be held liable.  The house building guarantee scheme is very limited in its scope and only applies for a limited number of years.</P>

      <P>This particular amendment was well aired on Committee Stage.  The Bill has one fundamental objective and that is to regulate buildings in the interests of the common good.  It is not nor was it ever intended to be a vehicle for the establishment of new consumer protection type rights in relation to post-construction liability.  It is carefully drafted to be neutral on this issue of civil liability.  This may be something for another day, but it certainly does not arise under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Let me make two final points.  Let me deal first with the question of liability. The common law does offer a measure of redress to an aggrieved person who has purchased a building which, for reasons of negligence, is seriously defective in some way.  These rights are additional to any rights arising from contractual obligations.  The other point is that I accept that Deputy Shatter and Deputy Gilmore are simply attempting to ensure that only fit and proper persons are designated as certifiers.  I fully share their view and would point out that under section 6 (2) (c) it is open to the Minister to decide what criteria should govern the designation of persons as approved certifiers. These criteria could include a whole range of considerations relative to the suitability of the person concerned. That is what I intend to do.</P>

      <P>The right to self-determination is a principle endorsed by the Charter of the United Nations.  Ireland supports the right of the peoples of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic to determine their own future by a free democratic process.  This is also the position of the Twelve as affirmed by the Heads of State or Government in Strasbourg last weekend.</P>
      <P>I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that from many of the mass meetings in the Germanies, both the Bundes-republic and the GDR, there have been indications of a very strong wish of many of the people for the type of nationalism that plunged Europe into two world wars, <Col N="1270" /> and consequently would the Taoiseach not consider that the warnings on this issue given by Mr. Gorbachev may have more relevance to the fears of people in Europe than to the Taoiseach's sentimentalities in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not accept anything of the sort.  The 12 heads of state at the recent summit meeting indicated their support for the unity of the German people in the two states.  It was indicated that that unity should be achieved in accordance with the principles of self-determination and with due regard to the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. Secondly, a general view among the people attending the summit in Strasbourg was that we were all very fortunate that so far all the dramatic changes that have been taking place in Eastern Europe have taken place in a peaceful atmosphere; in fact it was noted that the experience of all the observers, certainly in Eastern Germany and Western Germany, was that the atmosphere was calm, that it was a tremendous demonstration of people of Eastern Germany and the other eastern countries to secure democratic freedom for themselves and that the astonishing feature about it was that these mass demonstrations were relatively peaceful and calm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach may be right in that many of these demonstrations were peaceful, would he not agree that there were quite clear indications that many of the calls for the fatherland reunification were of the ultranationalist type that plunged Europe into war on previous occasions, and that there is a very substantial proportion of the German people both West and East, who oppose reunification because of the very fears of further turmoil perhaps in Europe and for fear of the size and might that a central Germany would have? Would the Taoiseach not further agree that it is totally inappropriate to attempt to draw any kind of comparison between Germany and Ireland having regard to the fact that this country has never been <Col N="1271" /> involved in plunging Europe into any kind of war?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the general thesis the Deputy is advancing. That view is not widespread in Europe, as far as my observations go.

      <P>I could not possibly attempt to draw a corollary between Germany and Ireland because the situation is completely different, but I adverted to the fact that as a divided country &mdash; I am not saying more than that &mdash; we would have an underlying sympathy with the efforts of any other people who wish to achieve their reunification.   I assure the Deputy that I have reiterated again and again and the same sentiments were expressed at the conclusion of the summit, that this is a matter for the German people in accordance with the principles of self-determination.</P>

How would the Taoiseach apply that principle to German peoples in the area which is now under the jurisdiction of Poland or the USSR or indeed the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia?</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach talks about the self-determination of peoples, is he confining his remarks to the German peoples within the boundaries to the east and south as laid down at Yalta, being the limits of self-determinaton, or is he saying that there is a general right to self-determination of all people either within or outside that boundary?</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 24 November 1989 accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour.</P>
      <P>We agreed at that meeting that the recommendations made by Congress in the area of tax reform and social welfare would be considered by the Government in the context of the 1990 Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept it is the thrust of the thirty point programme submitted to him by the ICTU entitled <i>Sharing the Benefits</i> that workers have not shared in the benefits <Col N="1273" /> that have accrued in the economy as a result of their wage restraint, and that at a time when profits are spiralling at a rate we have not seen previously, workers are not sharing in those profits? Let me ask him about his commitment to tax reform. We know about the commitment to the 25 per cent base rate ultimately, but I am referring to the specific demand of the ICTU.  Is he in sympathy with the demand of the ICTU to broaden the tax base to include companies, the self-employed, professionals, farmers and so on, so that the burden on PAYE workers can be reduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be meeting the ICTU again about these matters before the budget.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that statistics show clearly that, apart from the general benefits which flow to the economy and therefore enrich workers' participation, the take home pay of workers and employees generally increased during the period in which the national economic programme has been in operation by between 3 per cent and 7 per cent.  I cannot understand what the Deputy is talking about when he refers to tax reform which would extend taxation to companies, the self-employed and professional classes.  Very considerable extensions have been made in all these areas by this Government and their predecessors.  In particular I would remind the Deputy that we have extended an effective tax régime for the first time to the self-employed and the farming community.</P>

      <P>In view of the figures produced by the CSO recently about the total numbers at work, will the Taoiseach agree that, whatever about the merits of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> it has not led to an increase in the total numbers at work and that one of the principal causes is a series of official policies which are not related to each other? First, the cost of putting £1 in a worker's pocket is about three times that £1 and this is much greater than in any other country in Europe.  Therefore, will the Taoiseach agree that the thrust of the remaining phase of this programme must be to get all those official policies which are inhibiting jobs out of the way, bearing in mind that the increase in output that has taken place in the past three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is invading very interesting territory and I would not attempt to deal with all the issues he opens up in his question.  However, I say to him that all the present indications are that there is a considerable turn round in the employment situation, though I have said on a number of occasions, and I know the Deputy will agree with me, that our real problem now is to translate economic growth into jobs.  The Deputy may not have noticed that I indicated recently that we intend to invoke the expertise of the Commission in Brussels because they have offered it, and to study that aspect of the problem.  Apart from that, he will have seen forecasts which indicate that there will be a considerable increase this year in the number of people at work, and an even bigger increase next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying that the ESRI's recent report indicated there will be an increase of 11,000 jobs in 1989 and 19,000 in 1990.  I am not saying they are quantitatively satisfactory but I am saying they indicate a trend in the right direction.  Let me say before he intervenes that I accept also the Deputy's argument that it is important not just to try to create jobs in the sectors by specific measures but to try to eliminate the things that are preventing or inhibiting the creation of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will not be over complacent with the ESRI figures given the large redundancy figures being returned every year and the still high levels of emigration.  I take it from his initial reply that the subjects of tax reform and social welfare as discussed with the ICTU are to be looked at in the context of the budget.  I understand from the ICTU that job creation must be given <Col N="1276" /> priority.  Is this so?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will outline exactly what he is doing in terms of giving job creation priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to tackle the problem of job creation on all available fronts.  The Deputy will have seen, for instance, that I met the chief executives of the more relevant State bodies and discussed with them how they can help to create employment either within their own core business or in diversified projects.  Of course, we have the all out efforts of the three major employment creating agencies, the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, and in specific areas of the economy sectors which offer potential for employment.  We are by positive intervention endeavouring to bring forward employment in these areas such as tourism, the food industry and so on.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sure the Taoiseach will agree it is in everybody's interest that low nominal wages negotiated will lead to actual increases and rewards for everybody at work. Taking into account the high profitability of some companies, will the Taoiseach seek to bring to the negotiating table schemes where workers could acquire share options and share in the profits of highly profitable companies so that low nominal wages will lead to significant rewards for all workers?  Will the Taoiseach take that up with the employers and the union side as part of the renegotiation programme?</P>

    <P>The organisation of Garda Crime Task Forces within the Dublin Metropolitan Area is essentially a Garda operational <Col N="1279" /> matter, in relation to which I am satisfied to accept the professional police advice of the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to previous similar parliamentary questions, the Garda authorities decided, for reasons of operational effectiveness, to replace the centralised Crime Task force based at the Dublin Metropolitan Area headquarters at Harcourt Square with separate crime task forces to operate in each of the five Dublin divisions.

      <P>There was no question of the disbanding of the force.  It was a reorganisation, a decentralisation which is happening in many areas of the State services.  It is providing a better service in the divisions.  At the time of its decentralisation there were 46 members in the force, centrally based in Harcourt Square.  There are now 75 members based in different divisions throughout Dublin, including Harcourt Square.  I know from my own experience in one of the divisions that they are being extremely effective and particularly valuable.  It is easier for people to call on them because they are available throughout a division.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a very strong body of opinion within the Garda Síochána that the disbandment or the scattering has been a major mistake which has resulted in a considerable increase in <Col N="1280" /> crime of all kinds?  This force has proved its worth over the years and produced good results with very small numbers. The reorganisation involves almost twice the number of men, but results are much worse.  Would the Minister accept that it is time for a rethink?  Would his colleague, the Minister for Justice, agree to discuss the matter with the Garda authorities with a view to the possibility of reinstating the crime task force?  There is an old saying &ldquo;If it works, don't change it&rdquo;.  It did work but it has been changed. The position should be reversed.</P>

      <P>The change came about following a review carried out by the Garda authorities and it was a change for the better.  The numbers were greatly increased and the effectiveness of the task force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Area as a whole was increased. The Garda authorities say that the present arrangements are working well and of course they will keep them under review.  I know that it is a great benefit to a division to have the task force available.</P>

      <P>The Deputy points to the Supreme Court judgement of 1982.  The Supreme Court in that judgement referred to what it termed a constitutional obligation on the State to intervene to prevent radio and television broadcasts aimed at advocating or securing support for organisations which seek to overthrow the State by violence or which would, in any way, be likely to have the effect of promoting or inciting to crime or endangering the authority of the State. This is perhaps the matter to which the Deputy is referring.  Unless those who support the use of violence were prepared to set aside violence, the Minister would obviously feel some constraint.  The Minister would have to take into account not only the Supreme Court decision but all relevant matters.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have also assured me that in the weeks preceding Halloween, to the extent that was possible having regard to the many other demands on their services, they paid special attention to particular areas where fireworks were being sold.  This resulted in 12 seizures of quantities of illegal fireworks.  Twenty-two persons were arrested and prosecutions are being taken in a number of these cases.</P>

      <P>In any event I think they will take note of what the Deputy is saying here today.  There is no difficulty communicating the text of the questions to them.  The normal procedure in the <Col N="1288" /> annual programme of special and commemorative stamps is that the philately advisory committee recommend subjects to An Post who then examine the committee's report and submit a draft programme to the Minister for his consideration and following consultation with other Ministers, the Minister for Communications submits proposals to the Government.  There are various stages at which the Deputy's proposal can be taken on board.  It is important that we consider proposals such as the Deputy's. We have been doing fairly well in this area.</P>
      <P>I might mention that Ireland recently won a gold medal in the Olympics for stamps.  The International Olympic Committee awarded a gold medal for the Irish stamp which was produced in conjunction with the 1988 Olympics for an equestrian stamp.  The award which was presented in September 1989 will eventually be on display in the GPO when suitable security can be arranged.  It is one area in which we appear to have been fairly successful. I will certainly pass on the Deputy's views.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties is that the last increase was in March 1986. When there are no increases for a period the organisation concerned can have some difficulties unless it is possible to greatly improve efficiency.  The average increases are 7.5 per cent whereas the consumer price index increase over that period was 11.6 per cent.  The Deputy will realise that to maintain employment and the level of wages that would be required, An Post have to take some action in that area.  The Deputy has pointed to Ireland's position in Europe. It is unfair to point to Europe without recognising the fact that we provide a door to door postal delivery service.  We have an extensive network for such a small widespread population.  Many European countries do not have this service so one is not strictly comparing like with like.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain why we do not keep increases on a current basis and why there is such a time lag &mdash; four years or thereabouts &mdash; which obviously means that the impact is all the greater when the increases are made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort is made, as the Deputy will be aware, to keep cost increases to the minimum.  Consequently, every effort is made to improve efficiency.  There are, of course, various measures which are being taken within An Post to improve the efficiency of the service and these will help to keep prices down.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that our postal charges are already too high and that the formula laid out for the success of An Post was to increase the volume of postage which, unfortunately, has not happened, principally because of the poor quality of the postal service? Would the Minister state whether he is <Col N="1291" /> satisfied with that quality and if it is the poor quality of the service that has caused this increase?</P>

      <P>The quality of the service generally, on a comparative basis within Europe, is very high in terms of personal delivery to areas throughout the country. For instance, in many European countries rural residents must call for all their postal packets to a central post office whereas in Ireland we deliver throughout the country.  There are also mandatory roadside letter boxes.  There is a much higher population to be dealt with in Europe.  It is unfair to make a direct comparison without bringing in these elements which affect the service.  Having said that, I accept there is scope for improvement and that that improvement is obviously very important.</P>

      <P>As of 31 December 1989, An Post's borrowing approved by the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 27 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, stood at £10.5 million.  The fixed assets of the company at that date were £60.118 million, current assets were £41.358 million and total assets were £101.476 million, current liabilities &mdash; including the £10.5 million borrowing &mdash; were £54.141 million and net assets were £47.335 million. As of 31 March 1989, An Bord Telecom's borrowing was £1,149,849,000 approved by the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance in accordance with sections 27 and 28 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983.  The assets of the company at that date totalled £1,593,381,000, total assets less current liabilities were £1,313,353,000.  RTÉs <Col N="1293" /> annual report and accounts to 31 December 1988 are the latest published figures. The total borrowings at that date were: bank overdraft £342,000 and repayable Exchequer advances £16,225,000, making a total of £16,567,000.  All borrowings have been approved by the Minister, net assets to set against borrowings totalled £33.734 million and the state of the balance sheet is considered satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The question of when service becomes available is primarily a matter for the operators.

      <P>I am fully satisfied that MMDS is the only practicable way to extend real multi-channel television choice to the whole of the country and I remain fully committed to the establishment of the network.

      <P>The Minister said that the deflector system is not working and that it could not give adequate coverage in the multi-channel area.  Experience has proved to be slightly different because many of the people who now have the deflector system were provided with the service at a fraction of the cost of commercial services.  They want to hold on to the deflector system as for £25 per year one can get a choice of four channels in Cork whereas it costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that if one covers all the costs which accompany the normal setting up of a multi-channel system rather than getting the supply from illegals, there would be a difference in cost.  However, the system which the Minister for Communications has approved will provide 11 channels nationwide.  It will be a very comprehensive and high quality service and will provide a similar choice to that available in the best areas in the country. The other point in relation to that is that people who are currently rebeaming will not be taken off until the new service is up and running.  I know that in some areas people are concerned that there <Col N="1297" /> might be a loss of service but the Minister has given an assurance that this will not be the case.  The MMDS system has been very effective, it has been widely tested and will provide a very good service nationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the problem of assaults and vandalism on bus routes does not arise to any significant extent in the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway but occurs primarily in the Dublin area where it continues to receive special attention. The Garda and Dublin Bus officials have been co-operating closely in this matter for some time.  Since October of last year a number of measures have been taken to deal with the problem.  Most of these measures have been outlined to the House on a number of occasions previously. They include intensified patrolling of known trouble spots by uniformed gardaí, assigning gardaí to travel on buses, as appropriate and the provision of mobile patrols, including joint Garda/Dublin Bus patrols, to escort certain buses on selected routes.  More recently Dublin Bus have taken some further measures, including the fitting of buses with closed circuit television for the purposes of surveillance and detection of criminal activity.  I also understand that Dublin Bus are considering the introduction of a new ticketing system which should alleviate greatly the risks associated with cash handling.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the measures being taken are proving effective and there has been a pronounced decrease in incidents on buses involving assault &mdash; there were about 25 such incidents in the period of six months or so up to October 1989 as compared with about 100 in the immediately preceding corresponding period.  There were three such incidents in November this year as compared with eight in November 1988.</P>
      <P>Since October 1988 proceedings have been instituted against some 229 persons for offences relating to incidents on buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities will, of course, continue to monitor the situation, particularly in the weeks around Christmas and will continue to maintain close co-operation with Dublin Bus with a view to <Col N="1299" /> taking whatever action may be approrpriate to further alleviate the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to the extent that it shows a decrease in attacks on workers employed by Dublin Bus; nonetheless it has not brought the service back to normality in the Minister's own constituency. Would the Minister accept that a single bus operator having to contend with late night revellers, a double deck array of passengers and the collection of ticket money is a recipe that will always spell trouble for that operator?  Would the Minister agree that he would be well counselled to direct Dublin Bus to cease the practice of passengers paying for tickets aboard, rather all passengers being expected to carry pre-paid tickets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

Would he initiate discussions between the organisation responsible for the bus service in other cities?  I would support the concept put forward by Deputy McCartan &mdash; that after a certain hour in the evenings pre-paid tickets should be the only collection system used, especially in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  Would the Minister initiate <Col N="1300" /> discussions with Bus Éireann to have that system established?</P>

I will also bring the matter to the attention of Bus Éireann because of the Deputy's concern about Cork and other major cities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of urgency, would the Minister consult with Dublin Bus, because I must point out to him that the proposals of Dublin Bus are to improve on the money collection system on buses, that they are not investing their money in pre-paid systems?  Would the Minister examine that possibility?  Would he also agree that the handling of a double decker bus is particularly difficult for the single person operator, it being impossible for the driver to know or police what is going on upstairs, particularly late in the evening, which is something that must be examined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will consider introducing evening or night sittings of the District Court in both the Dublin Metropolitan area and throughout the country, to deal exclusively with summary offences under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1301" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of the kind referred to can be dealt with adequately during normal court sittings, I am not satisfied that the disruption and expenses of setting up evening or night sittings would be justified for that purpose only. However, I am examining the question of whether night courts in Dublin might be justified in a wider context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with that reply.  Does the Minister not accept that District Court lists throughout the country suffer from a saturation of applications under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, an increased number of licensing applications and, in many instances, when family law lists are taken at the start of business, the net result of this chaos being that members of the Garda Síochána sit and stand around courthouses for hours on end in order to deal with a simple speeding or no-tax offence?  Surely the Minister must accept a proposition that will allow these gardaí perform their functions on the streets, thereby releasing them from this obligation to engage in a time-wasting exercise? Furthermore, would the Minister not accept that the cases about which I speak &mdash; that is, summary offences under the Road Traffic Acts &mdash; are almost exclusively non-contentious in respect of which there is a very high guilty plea rate; that the elimination of delays in the administration of justice could be far more effective were there a night summary court once every second week to deal with offences of a summary nature allowing the courts to proceed with their ordinary business under normal court rules?  Surely the Minister must accept that the difficulties being experienced under the present régime need to be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason generally suggested for the initiation of night courts is an effort to deal with the criminal situation on the ground.  For that reason the Minister has said that, for the reasons advanced by the Deputy alone, he would not feel their establishment justified but he is examining the question of <Col N="1302" /> establishing night courts on a wider basis. The type of hearings the Minister is including would be remands on criminal charges and/or substantive hearing of criminal charges.  It is within that wider context the Deputy's proposals are being considered at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes a fair point &mdash; that there are many other ways one can approach the aspect of the problem raised by Deputy Flanagan.  That is the very reason the Minister considers that the question of remand on criminal charges would require urgent action, which, in turn, might necessitate a night court hearing.  Deputy Flanagan will see that his suggestions are being considered in that context if he reads the reply.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> The number of gardaí engaged in community policing schemes in Dublin north-east is nine.  The Garda authorities are continuing to monitor and review these schemes so as to realise their full potential in meeting the policing needs of the local communities they serve.</P>
    <P>An extension of community policing to further areas of the Dublin Metropolitan Area is at present under active consideration. The Minister for Justice will be making an announcement on the matter very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because the very successful community policing project in Dublin north-east has been in place for three years and upwards it is time we abandoned the project stage and established community policing throughout the city and country as a permanent part of policing services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The disposition of members of the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am sure the Deputy remembers that I was chairman of the committee of this House who first proposed the introduction of both the neighbourhood watch scheme and the community policing system.  The Deputy need have no fear about my interest in that form of policing. It has been very successful and I am very familiar with its operation on the ground. The Garda authorities have indicated that they are very happy with the system and they plan to expand it further.  The expansion of the system will have to await their further consideration.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, at the end of November, the Minister introduced a comprehensive package to fight crime which will have effect particularly at the beginning of next year. Two hundred and fifty civilians will be involved in this project which will free up gardaí so that they can come out on to the streets.  Another 250 members of the Garda who are due to retire compulsorily are being kept on so that more gardaí will be available and the plan to appoint another 1,000 gardaí is being stepped up. The Deputy will realise that in the context of these improvements &mdash; a package of £30 million was recently provided by the Government &mdash; the Garda Síochána will be in a position to greatly improve the policing service and to provide community policing.  The Garda will very shortly be in a position to introduce whatever measures they consider best.</P>

    <Title>European Council in Strasbourg: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council in Strasbourg on 8 and 9 December, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerard Collins.  Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, also attended.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for a copy of the Presidency Conclusions to be placed in the Library in the usual way.  As these record the outcome of the Council in some detail, I will confine myself here to commenting on what was discussed and to the programme for the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, however, I should like to pay tribute to the courtesy, efficiency and decisiveness with which the Council was run by President Mitterrand and the French Presidency generally, aided by the Council Secretariat and the Commission. The general arrangement of the Council's business and the services provided could hardly have been bettered. That the Summit was a spectacular success is universally acknowledged.  It represents a major move forward in the <Col N="1372" /> affairs of the Community.  The conclusions document is a record of substantial achievements.</P>
    <P>This is a time of historic change in the Community and in Europe as a whole.  It is a time of new hope for all Europeans, East and West.  Momentous events are taking place daily.  The ideological walls that kept people apart are crumbling as surely as the Berlin Wall.  Patterns which had been fixed for two generations since the Second World War are shifting and changing with almost unbelievable rapidity.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Strasbourg Summit took place, and in reporting on it I will deal also with the work of the Irish Presidency commencing in January when we will have the responsibility for carrying forward the work of the Community, both internally and externally, for the next six months.</P>
    <P>Essentially the work at Strasbourg was concentrated on three areas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;First, we discussed the internal affairs of the Community.  The main areas were the completion of the Internal Market, Economic and Monetary Union and the Social Charter.  Other aspects were economic growth, research, audio visual capacity and the improvement of the quality of life of the people of Europe, generally.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Second, the relationship of the Community with other European countries and in particular the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the European Free Trade Area and the Mediterranean States.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Third, external relations and the Community's international obligations and its relationship with countries and regions for which it accepts a special responsibility.</P>
    <P>The proceedings in Strasbourg opened with a statement by Mr. Baron, the President of the European Parliament, in which he set out the Parliament's position and priorities.</P>
    <P>The Council then went on in formal session to consider progress towards the <Col N="1373" /> completion of the internal market.  We noted the satisfactory pace of progress and that with the internal market beginning to assume final shape its positive effects are being felt throughout the Community.  Important decisions have been taken during the French Presidency in the regulation of financial services, and significant progress has been made on the control of company mergers, on road cabotage and air transport guidelines.</P>
    <P>The European Council also outlined where it would like to see decisive progress in the near future, such as the opening of public procurement in telecommunications and other essential services; the development and interconnection of trans-European transport, communications and energy networks; and measures to combat tax evasion following the liberalisation of capital movements, as well as a resolution of the problems connected with indirect tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>The Council discussed a number of associated policies aimed at ensuring that economic progress is shared throughout the Community through closer economic and social cohesion and through active policies on the environment.  We noted with satisfaction the unanimous agreement on the arrangements for the setting up of the European Environment Agency in 1990.  The General Affairs Council is to take an early decision on the location of the agency's headquarters.</P>
    <P>Other matters dealt with under this heading included research, audio visual, the free movement of persons, and a People's Europe.  Under this particular heading, we agreed on the progressive abolition of border formalities, noting the need at the same time for such measures as may be necessary to combat terrorism, crime, and the menace of traffic in drugs.</P>
    <P>The single market has already led to a significant increase in investment throughout the Community and to the creation of new jobs &mdash; which are projected at about five million for the period 1988 to 1990.</P>
    <P>A major advance at Strasbourg was the adoption of the &ldquo;Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers&rdquo;<Col N="1374" /> by 11 member states by way of political declaration.  Ireland has always fully supported the concept of the Social Charter, and the thinking behind it, which is that the Single Market must be accompanied by a positive social dimension.  At Strasbourg I gave Ireland's full support to the adoption of the Charter, which is an important declaration of fundamental rights and objectives.</P>
    <P>The preamble explicitly recognises that the completion of the internal market is the most effective means of creating employment.  The Charter is fully in line with what has been a cardinal principle of Government policy here since 1987, expressed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, that:</P>
    <P>The social consensus contributes to the strengthening of the competitiveness of undertakings of the economy as a whole and to the creation of employment [and that] it is an essential condition for ensuring sustained economic development.</P>
    <P>The Charter covers rights and objectives in relation to freedom of movement, freedom of association, equitable pay, working time, the conditions of employment of part time and temporary workers, the development of vocational training, social security and social protection, safety and health at work, protection of young workers and the protection of the elderly and the disabled.</P>
    <P>The Commission's Action Programme to implement the Charter will now be undertaken by governments, the Commission, employers and employees working together to guarantee the improvement of working conditions and, at the same time, maintaining efficient, competitive undertakings and a healthy economic environment for investment and growth, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter and Action Programme will not conflict with what is our prior social requirement, namely that of employment.  The principle of sub-sidiarity has been accepted.  Only those tasks that could be better achieved at <Col N="1375" /> Community level will be subject to Community action, with other aspects left to the member states for implementation through legislation and the procedures of free collective bargaining.  Some account had necessarily to be taken of the enormous diversity of practices in the employer &mdash; employee relationship across the Community.  The text which has emerged from the negotiations and which we have adopted represents a reasonable balance and a broad consensus.</P>
    <P>Progress towards Economic and Monetary Union is now under way.  The Council welcomed the agreements reached by the ECOFIN Council and the initiatives taken by the Central Bank Governors in order to strengthen the coordination of economic policies and to improve the co-operation between Central Banks.  These decisions prepare the Community for the first stage of EMU to start on 1 July 1990.  The Council decided by majority that an Intergovernmental Conference should be convened to prepare amendments of the Treaty for stages 2 and 3 of the programme.  This Conference will meet, under the auspices of the Italian Presidency, before the end of 1990.  It will draw up its own agenda and set the timetable for its proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Commission will submit before 1 April a composite paper on all aspects of EMU.  This paper will respond to the questions identified by the high level working group, established under the French Presidency.  The Commission paper will deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with the economic and social cohesion dimension, and with the issue of democratic accountability. The General Affairs and ECOFIN Councils will use the period before the opening of the Conference to ensure the best possible preparation, and the proceedings, as a whole, will be examined by the General Affairs Council in preparation for the Dublin European Council, next June.</P>
    <P>On the external relations of the Community, the Council indicated its hope that at the ministerial meeting on 19 December a decision will be taken to <Col N="1376" /> begin negotiations so that the Community and EFTA can, at the earliest opportunity, reach agreement on strengthening their co-operation in accordance with their multi-lateral commitments. The Council further indicated its hope that the negotiations to be opened in the first half of 1990 will produce arrangements for institutional co-operation which are fully in keeping with these principles.</P>
    <P>In relation to Central and Eastern Europe, we said that the Community has taken and will take the necessary decisions to strengthen co-operation with the people of those countries seeking freedom, democracy and progress.  The Strasbourg Council approved the creation of a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to promote productive and competitive investment in the States of Central and Eastern Europe so as to assist the transition towards a more market-orientated economy and to speed up the necessary structural adjustments.</P>
    <P>We also confirmed the Community's readiness to participate in the creation of a Stabilisation Fund for Poland with combined contributions from the Twelve of more than half the resources of the Fund, which is to receive £1,000 million. The Council referred to the need to grant Hungary, after agreement with the IMF, an adjustment loan of the same amount.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Political Co-operation, the Council discussed: The Middle East, Lebanon, The Euro-Arab Conference, Southern Africa, Ethiopia, Chile and Central America.  The Conclusions of the Council on these subjects are available to Deputies.  I will, therefore, confine myself here to the more important elements of the discussion, so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the substantial steps taken or proposed by the Community to help in the historic movement in Eastern Europe towards democracy, pluralism and the rule of law.  The Council acknowledged that &ldquo;such a profound and rapid development would not have been possible without the policy of <Col N="1377" /> openness and reform led by Mr. Gorbachev&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Council expressed its support for the German people to regain their unity through free self-determination, in conditions of peace and stability, in full respect of all relevant agreements and treaties, and respecting the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, and in a context of dialogue and East-West co-operation. It was emphasised that this &ldquo;has to be placed in the perspective of Community integration&rdquo;.  On the occasion of the opening of the Berlin Wall, I sent a message to Chancellor Kohl conveying our support and best wishes on an historic occasion for all Germans.</P>
    <P>With the prospects of progress on disarmament, and against the background of greater freedom of movement of persons and ideas, and respect for human rights, the whole climate in Europe is being transformed.  The European Council was conscious of the tremendous responsibility placed on the Community in these circumstances to assist the process of change and to give support to the countries which are embarked on the road to democracy.</P>
    <P>In relation to Central America, Ireland has demonstrated its full willingness to play its part in the peace process as a country which understands the immense political and socio-economic difficulties of the region, by contributing troops to the UN Force ONUCA.  We are making preparations for a meeting within the San Jose framework here in Dublin during our Presidency involving the Foreign Ministers of the Central American countries, the four Contadora States, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, and our EC partners.  The purpose of this meeting will be to help the Central American countries concerned to strengthen democracy and political stability, so that they can lessen the economic and social deprivation which forms the basis of most of their problems.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Strasbourg Council, I had a meeting lasting about half-an-hour with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  At the meeting I <Col N="1378" /> conveyed our concern over the case of the Birmingham Six, where, in my view, the arguments for reopening the case are unanswerable.  We also discussed bilateral issues and welcomed the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Group.  We considered the situation in relation to Northern Ireland and the prospects for political progress there.  As the communiqué issued after the meeting notes, we were agreed in our condemnation of violence and on the constant need to improve security co-operation. We emphasised, in particular, the possibilities that would open up if violence were to end.</P>
    <P>We discussed the current state of affairs in the Community and reviewed at some length many of the major issues the developments.</P>
    <P>It is already clear that the changes both within the Community and in Eastern Europe will have a profound effect not alone on the whole of Europe but throughout the world.  The Community's response to these developments will be of crucial importance.  New policies and structures are required to deal with them. The Irish Presidency will be called on to guide and shape the Community's response in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Great care and maturity are called for. If the events of the past months have shown us anything, it is that history will not fit neatly into the constructions of politicians, diplomats, and administrators. Who could have foreseen last summer the emergence of non-Communist governments in Poland or Hungary, or the radical changes that the power of the people have brought in East Germany and Czechoslovakia?  These events require new thinking, to use Gorbachev's phrase, by all European states, but in particular by the members of the Community.</P>
    <P>Some have seen the developments in Eastern Europe as presenting the Community with a dilemma; that it would have to choose between proceeding with its own policies or greater unity and integration or supporting the heroic efforts of the peoples of Eastern Europe.  But in reality no such choice is necessary.  On <Col N="1379" /> the contrary, both developments are interdependent and, I believe, reinforce one another in a powerful and dynamic way, and this was confirmed at Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>The Community of Twelve is built on solid principles of democracy, individual freedom, respect for human rights, the rule of law &mdash; values which we sometimes lose sight of in the minutiae of Community legislation and the complexity of negotiations.  But it is important to recall that the Twelve can pool their economic interests and can build common European institutions, precisely because we share these basic values.  For the past 30 years, the Community has given to Western Europe a period of peace, stability, and prosperity never before seen in modern European history.  The values on which the Community is constructed are values that the peoples of Eastern Europe are now demanding for themselves; and they look to the Community to help them achieve them and to rebuild their economies. It would be more than ironic, it would be a betrayal of the hopes of all Europeans if, at the very moment when the success of the Community is so manifest, the member states were to falter, or change course, and fail to move on steadily to a more coherent unity.</P>
    <P>The Community really has no alternative but to strengthen its own integration and at the same time reach out to the other countries of Europe with whom we share a common civilisation and help them to realise their hopes.</P>
    <P>These will be the key tasks of the Community under the Irish Presidency in coming months.</P>
    <P>I have already had extensive discussions with Community partners and with President Delors on these questions. Ministers have been fully involved with their opposite numbers in member states and in the Commission in developing their work programmes.  In early January, the Government will meet with the full Commission in Dublin to co-ordinate the Presidency's and the Commission's efforts and to focus on priorities for the next six months.  This meeting arises from <Col N="1380" /> our wish to work closely with our Commission colleagues in expediting progress in every sector.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult in these volatile times in European politics to predict what may happen in coming months, I feel I can outline where the primary focus of the Presidency activity is likely to fall.</P>
    <P>First, we must get on with completing the internal market.  The Community is now at the halfway point in the creation of the single market &mdash; a market of 320 million people without barriers or restrictions to trade and with a combined purchasing power of over £3,300 billion.  This great enterprise, which has the objective of removing all the frontiers between the 12 countries so that there will be complete freedom of competition in the supply of goods and services throughout the Community on equal terms, has breathed new life and vigour into a Community which for some years has lacked direction and purpose.  Already, European industry has responded to the challenge and the project has evoked widespread interest around the world.  It is imperative for the future of the Community, for the welfare of its citizens, and for the prosperity of its industry that the momentum of this work be maintained and target dates adhered to.</P>
    <P>This will be the basic work of the Irish Presidency.  Much has been achieved in the three years since the adoption of the Single European Act, but it was only natural that the more difficult issues would be left to the last.  Tax harmonisation, animal and plant health controls, the free movement of people, public purchasing, energy, and financial services are among the issues that the Irish Presidency must address.  On some of these, such as tax harmonisation, Ireland has very definite concerns which we wish to have resolved.</P>
    <P>Our objective is clear.  We wish to see borders come down within the Community, and we will work closely with our partners and the Commission to this end. We want to see substantial achievements over the coming months on the further liberalisation of air transport and of telecommunications services.  Transport and <Col N="1381" /> communications are at the heart of a modern economy, and we have seen already the benefits that flowed from the first phase of the air transport package in the form of cheaper fares, market access, and wider choices.  The Irish Presidency will give high priority to proposals in these areas and will make every effort to ensure their early adoption.</P>
    <P>Second, we will take up the preparations for economic and monetary union.  The logic of the internal market in which there will be a free flow of people, goods, capital and services requires the closest co-ordination of national economic and monetary policies.  Furthermore, the very success of the single market and of the European Monetary System established ten years ago has encouraged member states to opt decisively for further policies, which will create the conditions of stability and coherence in which satisfactory economic growth and increased employment opportunities can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully subscribes to this view.  At Madrid in June and again in Strasbourg last weekend, we supported the objective of progressive movement towards economic and monetary union.  The first phase is scheduled to come into operation on 1 July next year, and it will fall to the Irish Presidency to ensure that the necessary decisions and preparations have been made by that date.  The Commission will produce before 1 April next year a composite paper, which will cover all the different aspects of EMU and include a comprehensive analysis of the issues that will arise.  At that stage, there will be four principal documents on the table; the main Delors report, the report of the high level working party established by the French Presidency, the British document and the Commission paper.  On the basis of these four documents, the preparatory work from the IGC can proceed.</P>
    <P>It is no overstatement to say that economic and monetary union will involve the most fundamental changes in economic relationships between member states since the original Treaties.  No one underestimates the enormous importance and gravity of the task.  Member <Col N="1382" /> states will have many national interests to concern them and the implications for particular sectors of their economies to worry about.  The negotiations will be complex and will have to deal with issues of substance and with far-reaching implications.</P>
    <P>Despite suggestions to the contrary, it should be understood that Britain, in fact, accepts the overall objective of progress toward economic and monetary union.  Britain does not, however, believe that the process set out in the Delors report is the only way to achieve it.  Their main difficulty with the Delors report is that it does not envisage a proper system of democratic accountability for economic and fiscal policy in the integrated Community.  Britain, however, is fully committed to the single market and also to stage one of the Delors Programme.</P>
    <P>Third, we will concentrate on the environment and make a major effort to formulate a comprehensive coherent Community policy for the environment. As the threat of military confrontation recedes, the presistent pervasive danger to the natural environment of our planet emerges as the real common enemy.</P>
    <P>The warming of the earth's atmosphere, and its implications for the world's low-lying areas and for food production; the destruction of the tropical forests, and the spread of desertification through drought and soil erosion; the depletion of marine life and the effects of acid rain on lakes, rivers and forests, all contribute to the grave threat of an irreversible deterioration in the conditions necessary to sustain life on this planet.</P>
    <P>It is no longer simply a question of seeking cleaner air and water for the sake of the beneficial effects on public health and the quality of life important though these are.  The challenge is greater than that.  The very atmosphere of our planet is threatened by our activities.  Pollution knows no frontiers, recognises no walls, respects no particular political ideology. What is required is a new, enlightened approach to global management, which recognises the interdependence of all forms of life on this planet.  Much of the knowledge, the resources and the skills <Col N="1383" /> needed to meet the challenge are available, if effectively utilised in an informed and scientific manner.  This is an issue which demands effective international action and where the European Community is uniquely placed to act and to take initiatives.</P>
    <P>Within the Community we must press ahead with effective action on immediate issues like vehicle emissions, water standards, waste disposal, and the protection of wildlife.  At the international level, we can use the unrivalled expertise of the member states and the stature of the Community in international affairs to press for international action on global issues.  In this connection, we will work to have a strong Community position for the review next June of the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer, which in our view did not go far enough in limiting the production of chlorofluorocarbons.  The conservation of tropical forests is at the top of the international environmental agenda and must be a major item on the agenda of the Environment Council during the next six months.  We intend also to take up the linked question of climate change with a view to developing a common approach on key policy issues in international fora, and in particular at the World Climate Conference to be held in November next year.</P>
    <P>The Community must create a new framework of relations with our European neighbours.  This development is the subject of animated and continuing discussion these days throughout the Community. Everyone is aware of the enormous challenge which the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe present. There is also the need for a new relationship with EFTA and to develop the Community's relations with the Mediterranean countries.  Further afield there lies the difficult terrain of the Community's dialogue with the US and Japan. The GATT negotiations offer an opportunity to strengthen the world's multilateral trading system.  The Community's relations with its partners in Latin America, ASEAN, the Lomé countries and <Col N="1384" /> the Arab World all demand continuing attention.</P>
    <P>The Community calmly faces the dramatic changes taking place in Eastern Europe.  It accepts its historic responsibility to adopt forward looking policies and measures to support the peoples of Eastern Europe in their efforts to achieve democratic freedom.  The very existence of a successful Community of democratic countries freely co-operating with each other must surely have been a shining light to the oppressed peoples of Eastern Europe in recent decades.  We have clearly demonstrated our desire to help them change over to democratic political structures and sensible economic régimes.  The Community's role has been recognised by the other OECD countries, and the Commission acts as co-ordinator of aid to Poland and Hungary from all 24 OECD members.  The 24 are meeting in Brussels at ministerial level today to consider their overall approach, the adequacy of what has been done so far, and what further measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency has been requested by the European Council to ensure the commencement of negotiations in January 1990 on the setting up of a European Bank for reconstruction and development.  The States of Central and Eastern Europe will be able to participate in the capital and management of the bank, in which the member states, the Community and the European Investment Bank will have a majority holding.  Other countries, and in particular the other member countries of the OECD, will be invited to participate.  The Community will encourage and support economic reform in these countries.  It has concluded trade agreements and, for the most part, co-operation agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, and the agreement with the USSR should be signed by the end of the year.  Other measures under consideration, in this area, are approval in principle to the granting of observer status to the USSR in the GATT, and proposals to allow nationals of Central and Eastern Europe to take part in a <Col N="1385" /> number of educational and training programmes similar to Community programmes. Of particular importance also was the request to the Council to take the requisite decision at the beginning of 1990 for the establishment of a European training foundation, the purpose of which is to provide managerial and technical skills where these are needed.</P>
    <P>The Twelve's relations with the other democratic countries of Europe are of great importance at a time when the overall picture of Europe is changing from day to day.  The six EFTA countries are the nearest to the Twelve, geographically, politically, economically and as trading partners.  They are all fellow members of the Council of Europe, where the democratic European States which respect human rights meet together.  The Community has embarked on an effort to find new structures to deal with this important relationship.  A ministerial level meeting between the Community and EFTA takes place on 19 December and this will lay the groundwork for future relations between the Twelve and the Six.  The conclusions of the European Council include an expression of the hope</P>
    <P>that the negotiations to be opened in the first half of 1990 will produce appropriate pragmatic arrangements for institutional co-operation ...</P>
    <P>Mr. Gorbachev has at different times made proposals for a meeting of the Heads of Government of the 35 participating States in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe before the end of next year and for the scheduled 1992 Helsinki CSCE follow-up meeting to be brought forward.  Developments in Europe and in the CSCE as a whole will make it necessary to look very carefully at these and other proposals aimed at ensuring that the CSCE process continues to play its indispensable part in the affairs of Europe, with the full participation of the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>The changes we are seeing in Eastern Europe are all, fortunately, taking place peacefully.  It is, nevertheless, a time of <Col N="1386" /> turmoil that must be carefully managed. Both President Bush and President Gorbachev have shown their sensitivity to the requirements of the situation.  This was one of the notable outcomes of their meeting off Malta ten days ago.  I have already noted the central importance of the Community in these developments, both as an example of what is possible and an anchor of stability during the transition. A strong Community, in close co-operation with the other European democracies in EFTA, will play an essential role in ensuring the stable evolution of the new Europe which we all welcome. The decisions taken at Strasbourg are a good beginning.  We are determined to continue along this path during the next six months.</P>
    <P>The issues I have just outlined will constitute the major focus for action in the next six months, but they are not the only matters with which our Presidency will have to deal.  Other priorities on which Ministers will be actively engaged during the Presidency include the fixing of agriculture prices for 1990-91, a key issue for Ireland and for the Community; there will be new Commission proposals to promote rural development.  At our recent meeting in Brussels President Delors and I discussed the need to develop policies to emphasise the importance of the countryside and to offer country dwellers a viable alternative to rural exodus.  This is an important issue for our Presidency, and we intend to pursue these proposals vigorously in coming months; in the health area, we will promote Community programmes on cancer, AIDS, drugs and alcohol abuse. In this connection the Presidency will lay particular stress on actions in favour of young people; in relation to budgetary policy, it will be necessary to conduct an examination of the financial perspectives of the Community up to 1992, to ensure that the necessary resources are available to fund Community programmes in coming years; Ireland has a particular interest in policies to promote economic and social cohesion, and the recent decisions on the Structural funds are a major contribution in this area.  This is a <Col N="1387" /> central element of Community policy as set out in the Single Act.  Economic and social cohesion is essential to underpin the internal market and EMU integration; the internal market must be complemented by the development of the Community's social dimension. Europe will mean little, if it does not bring real and tangible benefits to our peoples and improvements in their living and working conditions.  Some of these will flow from the internal market itself and from structural, agricultural and other policies.  But we cannot leave it at that.  Positive measures are needed to ensure that all share in the benefits of European integration.  Following the adoption of the Charter by 11 member states, the follow-up action programme for its practical implementation will now be taken up by the Social Affairs Council and the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the next year will be one of great challenge for the Community and its member states.  The issues I have touched on are at the core of the Community's development and of European integration and they have a great relevance for broader international politics. In many respects the Community has now the economic and political attributes of a super power.  The policies that the Twelve have pursued through European Political Co-operation have ensured it international respect and leave it well placed to discharge its responsibilities in the uncertain period ahead.</P>
    <P>We can also see how, over the last five years, the European Community has become much more meaningful and significant to the Irish people.  It has become a reality which can be seen to affect their daily lives, not something distant and remote, of interest only to politicians.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing awareness of ourselves as Europeans, of belonging; a familiarity with the towns and cities, the languages and customs of the Community countries.  This outlook and these feelings will deepen as we move steadily towards European Union.  One of the conclusions of the Strasbourg Summit states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> All Community policies in the economic and social spheres contribute directly and indirectly to consolidating a common sense of belonging.  This movement must be broadened and accelerated by the adoption of concrete measures which will enable European citizens to recognise in their daily lives that they belong to a single entity.</P>
    <P>A practical objective that we must set about during the Irish Presidency is to achieve the greatest possible degree of progress in eliminating border restrictions on the free movement of the people of the Community throughout the 12 countries.</P>
    <P>We must work to bring the Community closer to the day when it will be possible to buy a ticket at a reasonable price at any Irish seaport or airport and travel freely to any part of the Community with no restrictions, formalities or bureaucratic interference of any kind.</P>
    <P>We take over the Presidency from France, a nation that has given much to European politics and civilisation and to the Community, as evidenced by the success of the past six months and the Strasbourg European Council.  We hope to build on that success so that, when we hand over to our Italian colleagues in July of next year, we will be able to record substantive progress towards a more united Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe too that it would be desirable during our Presidency to arrange an opportunity to look ahead to the future beyond the single market and the present process of integration.  We must find time at some stage to lift our eyes from the immediate and pressing concerns of the Community and seek to perceive, be it only in outline, the Europe that is likely to emerge during the remaining years of this century.</P>
    <P>Europe is clearly coming to a new sense of unity.  The unmistakable trend of events in Eastern Europe and the manifest desire of the six countries of the European Free Trade Area for closer links with the Community demand that we look again at the vision of Europe of the founding fathers of the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Swift said &ldquo;Vision is the ability to see that which is invisible&rdquo;.  The words of the Treaties of Paris and Rome can now be seen to have been prophetic.  The founding fathers resolved to &ldquo;create the basis for a broader and deeper community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts&rdquo;.  They were determined &ldquo;to lay the foundation of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe&rdquo; and were resolved &ldquo;to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe&rdquo;.  Thus were the banners of unity, progress and friendship unfurled for us by those who had the will to turn their dream of European unity and peace into practical achievements. Their vision brought economic and social progress which now unites 320 million Europeans.</P>
    <P>Those who proposed the original treaties had no limited vision of Europe.  Has the time come for us in the same spirit to look beyond a Europe of Twleve?  I hope, therefore, that during the Irish Presidency we will be able to devote some time to seeing how the Community of Twelve might, again in the words of the Treaty of Paris, &ldquo;lay the foundations for institutions which will give direction to a destiny henceforward shared&rdquo; among all the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council meeting of 8 and 9 December was not, in fact, the success it has been claimed to be.  On the two central issues before the European Council, an inter-governmental conference to plan the next stage of economic and monetary union and the Social Charter for the Community, 11 of the member states failed to bring the 12th with them.  While 11 to one is undoubtedly a resounding majority and while there is usually no longer a requirement for unanimity since the passing of the Single European Act, the fact that one member state has withheld its agreement on two issues of the highest importance means the Community faces serious difficulties in these two fields over the months and years ahead.  Instead of congratulating themselves on a cosmetic victory, the <Col N="1390" /> Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, should be giving very serious consideration to what they might do in the short term to get the 12th member state on board with the rest of them.</P>
      <P>Tension is set to continue in the European Council and the Taoiseach's attempts in his speech this afternoon to play this down by saying the UK really does agree with economic and monetary union and all the rest just will not wash. There are fundamental differences of approach between the UK and other member states.  They are going to cause great difficulties for all the member states and it behoves the Heads of State and Government to address those difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Council made no progress whatever on the vital issue of indirect tax harmonisation.  The Taoiseach referred to it briefly in the course of his remarks, but I think it is very clear for all to see that this Government will have to take a far more active approach on this issue than we have seen up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no progress on bringing sterling into the European monetary system, and this would be an essential and indispensible part of the construction of an economic and monetary union.  The first stage comes into operation in the middle of next year.  A conference is taking place in the autumn of next year to plan the second stage and further stages, yet one of the member states which is important in itself by its economic weight, as a major economic and financial centre and which has a currency of world importance, still is not in the system with the rest of the currencies of the Community.  That is going to create, and will continue to create, major problems for as long as that situation remains unresolved.  While the greatest part of the responsibility for this unsatisfactory state of affairs clearly rests with one recalcitrant Prime Minister, the other Heads of State and Government must bear their share of responsibility for their collective failure so far to live up to the opportunities envisaged and created by the SEA.  These problems, and indeed <Col N="1391" /> others, remain to be dealt with not only by the next Presidency but by the other Presidencies that will succeed it in the normal and long established rotation of this duty among member states.</P>
    <P>What of the next Presidency, the Irish Presidency in the first half of next year? In one of his recent and increasingly frequent flights of fancy the Taoiseach claimed that the Presidency will be &ldquo;historic&rdquo;. When I heard that I was reminded of a film that enjoyed some vogue recently.</P>

      <P>We are witnessing now an attempt to invent a new fable, an effort on the Taoiseach's part to create the illusion of a new legend.  To do that he is prepared to spend £0.5 million of Irish taxpayers' money on the employment of two journalists and a public relations expert to tell an unsuspecting and, he hopes, credulous public about the doings and sayings of the Council Presidency for the next six months.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the Council already has a well equipped spokesmen's unit?  Is he not aware that the Commission has a directorate-general for press and information?  Has he not noticed that the European Press corps is on the whole well versed in Euro-speak and skilled in the art of separating <Col N="1392" /> the wheat from the chaff in the immense volume of material that comes pouring out of the Council and the Commission day after day?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, it seems, intends to appoint a representative for the Irish Presidency in Strasbourg, presumably to sell the Presidency line to the members of the European Parliament.  I am shouting stop.  Does the Taoiseach not realise that the vast majority of MEPs have better contact in both the Council and the Commission than any temporary journeyman-spokesman can possibly hope to have? Has the Taoiseach forgotten that the Irish taxpayer is already funding a Civil Service machine here that is perfectly capable of communicating the Presidency's message in conjunction with the already well established channels available to the Community institutions?</P>
      <P>In the last few days the Taoiseach has been saying that the next Presidency will be a green Presidency.  He, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, are sending out the message that somebody somewhere is going to do something about the environment sometime soon.  Reading those oracular utterances with great attention I have come to the conclusion that the Government are saying they will do something about the environment in Ireland some time after the end of the Irish Presidency.  I was confirmed in that view by the Government's reaction last night to Fine Gael's Environment Protection Agency Bill.</P>
      <P>When faced with a constructive and well constructed Bill from the Opposition, the Government's reaction is to throw a fit of pique, to turn themselves inside out and refuse to recognise the value of what is before them.  The Fine Gael Bill deals with all the issues.  If the Government feel there are gaps in it or that improvements can be made in it, they should take the opportunity of remedying it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two parties in this Government have clearly learned nothing from the experience of the last Dáil.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues in his party are retreating even further into the kind of <Col N="1393" /> tribalism that left them open to a series of defeats in the last Dáil and which lost them seats in the last election.  The Progressive Democrats have adopted the very attitudes in government which they so sanctimoniously deplored when there were more than twice as many of them in the House as there are now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A Taoiseach who has consistently ignored the environment in Ireland for almost three years cannot credibly hope to achieve much for the European Community environment in six months.  During the course of his remarks the Taoiseach set out the objectives that European environmental policy should have in a very general way, but I did not see any recognition of the fact that the changes which are required in agricultural processes, industrial processes and even in trading patterns, if we are just to stop our environment from getting any worse, will create the need for a revolution in the way we go about organising our economic and trading activity. I wonder if the Taoiseach has thought that he might propose to the European Council that the headquarters of the European Environment Agency be located in this country.  We are given to understand that the Taoiseach, in his capacity as President of the Council, may be visiting Eastern Europe over the next six months or so.  What credibility will he have in encouraging the emergence of democracy in those countries?  He is the Leader of a parliamentary party who are programmed to stand up and applaud and sit down and stay quiet to suit his convenience.  The grass roots of his party stayed home in droves when he sent two Ministers and a Minister of State to Clare to discuss objections there to his handling of the party's affairs.  He recently had to send emissaries to Galway West to quell an outbreak of popular feeling there.  He faces a festering mutiny in Waterford, which shows itself in votes in this House. There are mutters of discontent all over the country.  The Taoiseach might do well to ponder on the lessons for himself and <Col N="1394" /> his party from what has been happening in Eastern Europe in recent months.</P>

      <P>It might be worth while to look at what was stated in the conclusions. Incidentally, large sections of the conclusions can be read in the Taoiseach's speech.  In connection with the transport sector it said that the European Council would like a coherent Community policy to be drawn up and an effective response found to the problem of the congestion of air space in order to guarantee maximum safety for passengers.  The need for a unified and coherent system is increasingly evident to the air traveller in the Community.  It is a rare enough occurrence to make an air journey anywhere in the Community without encountering air traffic control delays.</P>
      <P>In the moves towards a truly unified Community, it will be necessary to look at the positions of the various member states on the issue of immigration.  The Presidency conclusions point out that conventions on the right of asylum, the crossing of the Community's external frontiers and visas will need to be examined. This is an area which will require some difficult decisions, and we have seen a measure of that difficulty in the last few days in watching the British Government's scandalous treatment of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong.  That is part of the same problem to which the Presidency has referred in the conclusions.</P>
      <P>The same concern with unifying the Community requires that we give very careful thought to the means by which democratic control can be exercised over the activities of the Council and the Commission. The European Parliament already has work in hand on this issue, and it is one to which this House should give attention sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, the Community has reacted wisely and constructively to the tide of change sweeping across Eastern Europe. Trade and co-operation agreements have been concluded with Czechoslovakia, <Col N="1395" /> Hungary and Poland, and it is intended that negotiations begin on such an agreement with East Germany.  It has been agreed that special trade facilities will be granted to Poland and Hungary, and special measures have already been taken and will be repeated to supply food to Poland.</P>
    <P>All of these measures will be accompanied by the creation of a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  The Community will participate in the creation of a stablisation fund for Poland and in a special adjustment loan to Hungary.  This approach on the Community's part is constructive and helpful, and we all hope that its value will not be reduced or prejudiced by resort to cosmetic political gestures.</P>
    <P>I believe that every Member of this House will applaud the declaration by the Twelve that Namibia will be welcomed into the Lomé Convention as soon as it expresses a wish to join it.  This statement is a very practical expression of the Community's real support for democratisation.</P>
    <P>As far as Central America is concerned, the Twelve have made a very brief statement which concludes by calling on all parties in the region to strive for a resumption of the regional peace process based on the Esquipulas Agreements.  I am disappointed that the Council did not go further.  The European Community is, in practical terms, the external guarantor of the peace process in Central America. It should, in my view, play a much more active role in advancing it than emerges from the statement in the Presidency conclusions.</P>
    <P>There is a number of areas which need attention.  First, I believe that the Community should now reconsider very carefully the conditions it attaches to aid to Central American countries.  It should also reconsider the channels through which aid is made available.  Our concern is that aid should assist the peace process and the democratisation of these countries. I do not believe that any government in Central America is in a position effectively to refuse aid.  The donor <Col N="1396" /> countries are, therefore, in a strong position in relation to conditionality. Second, the structures of European political co-operation should be used to define a Community approach to dialogue with the United States on its role in the region.</P>
    <P>There are specific concerns that must be met.  An election will take place in Nicaragua on 25 February next.  The Tela Agreement on the demobilisation of the Contras must be implemented.  The Community should undertake a role in relation both to the funding and the monitoring of that election.  We ourselves in this House should consider how we might participate in the monitoring process.</P>
    <P>The reintegration of displaced persons in Nicaragua and, we must hope, in other countries in the region, will make massive demands on the public purse.  This is an area where the Community must be prepared to assist.</P>
    <P>Finally, the area of trading relationships between Central America and the Community and between Central America and the rest of the world must be addressed.</P>
    <P>A number of matters of very considerable domestic importance will fall to be settled at Community level during the first half of next year.  One of these will be the question of farm prices and the accompanying measures to cater for the needs of small family farms by direct income support.  We will be watching that very closely, since those very farms are now in grave danger.  One of my colleagues, who represents a great many very diligent and capable small farmers, tells me that this year, for the first time, some of his farming constituents will be looking to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help at Christmas.  Dairy farmers all around the country are now faced with the prospect of having no income from their dairy herd until next April.  The allocation of 11 million gallons of extra quota, no matter how it is done, would bring very little relief to any of those who share in it.  Community decisions will be more important than ever, since we are told that market prospects for the next year or more indicate that milk prices <Col N="1397" /> could come down by as much as 12 pence per gallon.  It is clear that one of the major influences will be the course of Community policy in the dairy sector during that period.</P>
    <P>Beef producers will be watching the Community very closely, as they hope almost against hope for measures to put some profit back into their business &mdash; something they have not seen in the past two years.  Cereal producers face a very bleak future and they see it getting bleaker unless action is taken to prevent the vast capacity for the expansion of production in the Paris Basin and in East Anglia from further depressing their already inadequate prices.  I would like to know if the Government have any intention, either in their Presidency of the EC or as the Government representing the people, of proposing national quota measures as a means of dealing with the Community's cereal production problems.</P>
    <P>The operational programmes to implement changes in the Structural Fund provisions have yet to be drawn up for this country.  The Government clearly have some ideas in mind, because they are reflected in the Estimates for 1990 but we are asking the Government to come before the House and explain and discuss these programmes in detail.  We are talking about a process that will lead us towards an even closer economic and monetary union in the Community.  It is very clear that the achievement of economic and monetary union, if it is to respond to the ambitions set out in the Single European Act in relation to economic and social cohesion, will require a further look at how the Community is financed and how the Community budget is disposed of.  In that context it is not enough to say, as the Taoiseach has done that we will review the financial perspectives up until 1992 between now and the conclusion of the Inter-Governmental Conference.  The Community will have to take a more fundamental look at its future financial perspectives because without it, the European Monetary Union will not measure up to the aims of <Col N="1398" /> economic and social cohesion that have been set out in the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Taoiseach set out the benefits realised by European political co-operation.  As I sat here and listened to the Taoiseach saying that &mdash; I agree with him that it is true &mdash; I looked at the present Taoiseach and the present Tánaiste while I cast my mind back to 1986 when we talked about the Single European Act in this Chamber.  For both Members, European political co-operation seemed to be something like a Trojan Horse.  It was going to put us in grave danger of losing, I do not know what but we could encompass it in the idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said recently that Anglo-Irish relations are &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.  I do not know how relations could be described as normal when for the second time in a matter of a few weeks the British Prime Minister came out of a meeting of the heads of State and Government and made an utterly ill-judged comment on the security situation <Col N="1399" /> on this island.  I am more convinced than ever that the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher should agree to sit down together to exchange views in a serious way on the range of issues arising from Anglo-Irish relations.  Unless and until that is done Anglo-Irish relations will be seriously impeded.  The understanding of different and even opposing points of view is an essential pre-condition to arriving at any agreement on joint or concerted action.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Taoiseach is probably a little reticent about speaking in detail about what goes on at these meetings.  However, I wonder, Sir if he would not rethink a little and be more realistic &mdash; I think that is the right word &mdash; in the way he deals with these issues. In the course of the Taoiseach's speech, there is a lengthy paragraph which begins by saying that at the conclusion of the Strasbourg Council, the Taoiseach had a meeting lasting about half an hour with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher. Mr. Haughey continues:</P>
      <P>I conveyed our concern over the case of the Birmingham Six, ... We also discussed bilateral issues and welcomed the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Group.  We considered the situation in relation to Northern Ireland and the prospects for political progress there ... we were agreed in our condemnation of violence and on the constant need to improve security co-operation.  We emphasised, in particular, the possibilities that would open up if violence were to end.</P>
      <P>We would all applaud that.  The Taoiseach continued:</P>
      <P>We discussed the current state of affairs in the Community and reviewed at some length many of the major issues and developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They must be a very powerful pair to do all that in half an hour.  I think the Taoiseach should give up this old convention of trying to dress up a half an hour's hurried discussion, which inevitably must have concentrated on one or <Col N="1400" /> two issues, as a meeting that could be described as a meeting between the two heads of Government.  The Taoiseach should finally come to the conclusion that the rest of this House has come to long ago, that it is time for the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the neighbouring country to sit down together and have a serious look at the issues that confront them, whether they are in agreement on them or not.  It will not be until they do that that we will get a situation where they can work constructively and properly together for the benefit of our people.</P>

      <P>I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well in their exercise of the Office of Presidency of the European Community.  I will not put it more strongly than that, because to do so would be to over-dramatise the whole affair in a totally unjustified manner.  Ireland has had the Presidency before.  The Community made significant progress in a number of areas during the first Irish Presidency in the first half of 1975.  My colleague and predecessor, Deputy Garret FitzGerald signed the first Lomè Agreement and played a very distinguished role on behalf of the Community in nurturing the growth of democracy in Portugal.  Ireland again had the Presidency in the second half of 1979. Looking back over it, I think it is fair to say that the most noteworthy event of that Presidency was the toppling of the then Taoiseach.  The Irish Presidency during the second half of 1984 saw some solid work being done in preparation for the Single European Act in instituting budgetary control in the Community as a prelude to the expansion of the Structural Fund and in giving the European Parliament a more meaningful and democratic role in relation to the European budget.  I should add, for the sake of some of the media commentators, that that was all done without dramatic soul searching on how to reconcile the duties <Col N="1401" /> of the Presidency with domestic ministerial duties.  The business is nothing like as tense or as fraught as some of the commentators would have us believe.  If the next Irish Presidency measures up to the performance of the last one, it will do very well indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making some remarks on the European Council meeting of 8 and 9 December. It is important that we have the opportunity of discussing them in this House in a calm, collected and responsible manner.  I believe it is very important that we recognise the fact that Europe is going through a crucial stage of its development at present.  It is of critical importance that maximum co-operation is forthcoming from all the member states to ensure that the objectives and targets of 1992, in particular, are achieved.  From the report of the meeting of the Prime Ministers and from the report made by the Taoiseach today, it is very obvious that there are still huge obstacles in the path of the completion of the single market.  Likewise, in the area of national frontiers, it appears that there is still a great deal of work to be done and also in relation to road and air transport and, indeed, shipping which is spelt out in the detailed report from the European Council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously from Ireland's point of view, the question of the implementation of flanking policies in relation to the Structural Funds must be a crucial factor and one in which we must take great care. While the Prime Ministers were meeting in Strasbourg last weekend, many people who were putting their faith in the Government &mdash; many investors and developers throughout the country &mdash; were depending on the drawing down on the Structural Funds for 1989.  It is unfortunate that Structural funding will not now be available to them in 1989 for expenditure which has already been incurred.  This will put a great number of investors and developers in the tourism and allied areas under enormous pressure. The Government must take the blame for the delays that have occurred <Col N="1402" /> during the year.  I believe that the whole question of Structural funding was badly handled by the Taoiseach and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Council attributes importance to environmental problems is to be commended but is, perhaps, long overdue.  The setting up of the European Environment Agency is to be welcomed and I hope that the non-EC countries will also participate.  There is a certain irony in the Taoiseach announcing his Pauline conversion to the environment and environmental issues on a European level.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach often says I did not interrupt you.  I was surprised to hear the Taoiseach announce his Pauline conversion to the environment on a European level, particularly while those of us who were here at home were in battle with very serious smog in the city of Dublin, with smog levels way above those permitted at European level. If the Taoiseach is serious about the programme which he announced at the weekend he should put his own house in order first.  He should stop the squabbling that takes place between the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State and let us get on with some practical steps to eliminate the smog in the city of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then I would say we will all back the Taoiseach.  If he makes progress at home, then I would say he will get support and he will be backed on his efforts to achieve environmental controls and improvements in the European context.  First, the Taoiseach must put his own house in order.  That has not been done.  As late as last night, the Government yet again took a very negative attitude in relation to the efforts of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the social dimension and job creation, the Community leaders have lost their way.  In relation to the Taoiseach's comment that already European industry has responded to the challenge and the project has evoked widespread interest around the world, ironically, it has aroused more interest around the world than it has among the European leaders.  I question what response European industry has made in relation to the serious unemployment problem that exists within the Community. Are we not becoming overdependent on the newly industrialised nations or, indeed, on Japanese and other foreign investment to solve the job creation problem in the European Community? I believe there is an opportunity for the Taoiseach to make job creation in the Community the over-riding concern of the EC during 1990 and, in particular, during the first six months of his Presidency.  He has an opportunity, as the incoming President of the Council, to put job creation on the agenda.  I would urge him to do that because, as matters stand at present and having read the reports at the weekend, I do not believe that the Prime Ministers of Europe share the concern in relation to job creation &mdash; giving people the dignity of work and <Col N="1404" /> getting people back to work.  The Taoiseach has an opportunity now and he should grasp it in the next six months.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter which was adopted at the weekend is now a very diluted document, as we forecast in this House. It is regrettable that the Irish, the British and the Portuguese are leading the attack in ensuring the document was diluted. Notwithstanding that, however, I hope that the Minister for Labour and his colleagues will expedite the action programme over the next six months.  It is an area where we will be able to monitor and keep a close watch on what action is taken by the Minister over the next six months.  It is regrettable that what set out to be an inspiring document with worthwhile targets has now ended up as a very diluted document.  We can only hope that whatever has remained in the document will be put into effect in the coming six to twelve months.</P>
    <P>Obviously the whole question of progress on monetary and economic union would seem to be moving along very slowly as has been admitted and accepted in the context of the meeting last week. It would also seem that there is little role to be played by the Irish Presidency in these matters now that the matter has been referred back to the end of 1990 and, therefore, to the Italian Presidency. However, in the meanwhile this would provide an opportunity for this Government and this House, in particular, to have a close look to try to get a better understanding of what monetary and economic union will mean and what effect it will have in relation to our independence, in relation to our sovereignty and in relation to monetary control of this country.  I hope that in the next six months, the opportunity will be taken to outline to this House how the control of the Irish economy, the control of monetary policy and the control of other economic factors will still remain, if at all, in the context of this House when monetary and economic union is completed.  This would seem to be a concern of other countries at present.  It is a matter on which we should seek more information from the Taoiseach and the Government <Col N="1405" /> in relation to the working arrangements which will take place if, and when, monetary and economic union takes place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the developing countries of central Europe, the Community has a major role to play.  I welcome the announcement from the Council of last week on the creation of the European bank for reconstruction and development which will provide productive and competitive investment in the States of central and eastern Europe so as to assist the transition towards a more market-oriented economy and to speed up the necessary structural adjustments.  As has been stated in recent weeks, developments are occurring at an incredible pace in central and eastern Europe.  The EC must ensure that these countries, which are rejecting communism and totalitarianism are allowed develop and prosper and over time to play an important role in mainstream politics.  To date, the issues have been handled well by the European Council.  I hope that the trade initiatives taken to date by the European Community will be continued because it is obviously of fundamental importance that the initiatives and the rush towards democracy, towards pluralism and towards open society which is taking place in central and eastern Europe be allowed to develop and prosper.  I believe it will be a very important part of world peace and the development of a civilised world in the next century.  In that respect the European Council of Ministers and the European Community generally have a major role to play in line with the United States in ensuring that what has now started &mdash; we have only seen the start, moving at an incredible pace &mdash; be allowed to be brought to fruition and that the people of central and eastern Europe are allowed to move into a new phase of democracy and of open politics.  It will not be easy because there are enormous problems facing the economies of central and eastern Europe.  In that respect, the initiatives taken over the last number of weeks by the Community will be of major importance and I hope that in the next six months some other initiatives will be taken to ensure that the assistance <Col N="1406" /> already given &mdash; small as it is &mdash; will continue to allow for the total democratisation and development of open economies in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In relation to Central America, the decision to host in Dublin the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora States, Colombia and Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, and the EC partners is a worthwhile step because there are still enormous political difficulties in Central America.  I wish the Foreign Minister and his colleagues every success in achieving and making progress in relation to Central America which seems, unfortunately, in recent months to have taken some backwards steps.  I should like to feel that our Department of Foreign Affairs will be progressive in their attitude to the elections in Nicaragua and the efforts by these countries to establish self-determination.  It is a worthwhile, small step to be taken during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Taoiseach mentioned that he had a discussion with President Delors on the importance of rural development.  I hope it is not too late as, in recent years, in rural Ireland people have thrown in the towel because of the serious cutbacks in essential services which are vital to people there.  I refer to transport when people need to go to hospital.  It is a small thing in terms of a big meeting taking place in Strasbourg, but it is very important to somebody living in a rural area.  The same applies to housing and educational facilities.  It is all very fine to talk to President Delors about the necessity for Community action, but it must be matched by initiatives on the domestic front.  A lot of damage has been caused in the last two and a half years and perhaps, with the assistance of President Delors and the Commission, some of it can be undone before it is too late and people will have left because of unemployment, serious cutbacks in essential services and the programmes pursued by the Government during that time.</P>
    <P>One aspect which the Taoiseach did not mention but which was contained in <Col N="1407" /> the full report circulated by the European Office is the question of starvation in Ethiopia.  There is a weakness and a lack of urgency in the Strasbourg statement in relation to Ethiopia and we are facing the prospect of millions of people dying in the coming months.  As we saw on our television screens last night, children are dying in their hundreds by the hour.  All we got was a weak, aspirational statement looking for co-operation.  The Labour Party and I feel that that is probably the weakest part of the statement circulated from the Council of Ministers and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>A major diplomatic initiative is required as a matter of urgency in relation to the starvation facing the people of Ethiopia.  Let me say to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if the blockade obstructing food reaching Eritrea and Tigre is being caused and abetted by the Soviet Union, the European Community should be putting pressure on them and no stone left unturned until some aid is brought to those areas to ensure that the world does not have to witness starvation and millions of people dying in 1990.  It is a matter of extreme urgency and it should be given priority.  I urge the Taoiseach, as incoming President of the European Council, to address the question of starvation, drought and other enormous problems as quickly as possible so that the existing political problems causing these difficulties can be removed on humanitarian grounds to give these people some comfort and assistance at what is obviously an extremely difficult time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by extending the good wishes of The Workers' Party to the Government and the Taoiseach in particular as Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency of the EC.  There is every indication that the period of the Irish Presidency will mark a highly important stage in the development of European integration as well as a clarification of the type of political structures which will emerge from the current momentous <Col N="1408" /> changes taking place in the Eastern part of the continent.</P>
      <P>In such a situation I believe that this country with its position as a neutral State outside both the two major military blocs can bring an added and positive aspect to the work of the Community during our term, in the way that the French Government were able to take initiatives in relation to Lebanon and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>I must add, however, that it will be necessary for the Government to adopt a more assertive role if we are to make such a meaningful or positive contribution during our period in the Presidency. The approach of the Irish Government during the recently completed negotiations on the Social Charter does not give much hope in this regard.  The charter, as adopted, has been shamefully watered down and reduced to the level of an aspirational document rather than having any binding character.  In short, the citizens of this country are being presented with more of a social charade than a Social Charter.</P>
      <P>I say &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; advisely, because in the rush to water down the terms of the charter the various proposals to provide fundamental social rights have been narrowed down to refer to &ldquo;workers&rdquo;.  Automatically excluded are hundreds of thousands of people in this country and millions throughout the EC, who rely on welfare, who are retired, who may be unpaid workers in the home, who may be disabled or otherwise outside the recognised workforce.  The process of economic integration and the single market will have very serious implications for people in these categories, yet it seems as though their rights will be ignored completely under the terms of the Social Charter just adopted.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act recognised the need for balance between the development of the economic and monetary aspects of integration and the social side.  Yet we find the whole thrust of discussion on the Social Charter is to emphasise its non-binding nature, in sharp contrast to the attitude on economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> This is expressed in the opening paragraphs of the report from the Presidency to the European Council where it is stated that the charter must express the &ldquo;member states' desire to harness together economic development and social progress in the Community, while complying with the principle of subsidiarity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why was this reference necessary and do the Government not concede that such a statement, as stated by the European Federation of Building and Wood-workers, would merely be a pretext for remaining idle?  It is revealing that no such principle was applied in the introduction of directives relating to such matters as the internal market, public procurement and competition policy.</P>
    <P>In so far as the rights of workers are covered by the charter, references to employment development and creation being given first priority, are indeed ominous in any document relating to the Social Charter and again emphasises that implementation of the Social Charter is doomed to become ineffectual when the dictates of employer organisations for low pay, flexible work practices and part time or contract work practices are cited as being vital to creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the vagueness more striking than in the reference to wage levels. It calls for an equitable wage and a decent standard of living and that non full time workers should be given an equitable reference wage.  Can the Taoiseach explain what these terms mean?  In fact they mean nothing as there is no attempt to define what an equitable or decent wage is.  Given the overall thrust of the Social Charter, it is obvious that it will be of no use to workers in their efforts to bring an end to low pay exploitation.</P>
    <P>Similarly on welfare levels, there is a reference to adequate levels deleting reference to years of service contributions made by workers.  There is no reference either to provision of any minimum levels of welfare payments, either in relation to average industrial wage levels or keeping people above the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Parallel to this there is a weakening of the rights to trade union membership and <Col N="1410" /> bargaining rights.  The clause which allows the internal legal order of member states to determine the extent of rights provided under Articles 11 and 13 be applied to the armed forces, police and the Civil Service, is particularly relevant, given the attitude expressed so recently to attempts by members of our Defence Forces to form an organisation to defend their working conditions and seek improved remuneration.</P>
    <P>Even despite these weak provisions, a further loophole is afforded Governments, by giving responsibility for implementation to the member states, in accordance with what is called national practice.  I can only conclude that the objections of the Thatcher Government in Britain to the adoption of any effective Social Charter won the day, and that the Government here capitulated to the extent of agreeing what is now a very weak document indeed.  Judging from the stance in the negotiations, attributed to the Minister for Labour last month &mdash; even if media reports are only partially correct &mdash; it would appear that the Government was a willing submissive partner in the entire watering down process of the charter.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the charter has now been adopted.  While it is very unsatisfactory indeed in major respects, the aim now must be to ensure that the aspirations are implemented despite the impediments placed in the way.  Implementation of the Social Charter will begin under the Irish Presidency.  It will be necessary for the Irish Government to ensure that an effective action programme is adopted.  If the Government believe that this Social Charter can indeed offer adequate protection to workers in the new Europe &mdash; and I would be interested to hear how they hope to have the interests of the unemployed, disabled, retired, young people and women outside of the workforce defended &mdash; then they have an excellent opportunity to work to produce positive examples during 1990.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is important to put on record that this Social Charter should be viewed as a starting point in terms of providing adequate social rights.  As I <Col N="1411" /> said, it excludes vast numbers of people who stand to suffer under the new economic conditions and ground rules.  The Government, therefore, should commit themselves to examining ways in which the Social Charter can be strengthened, as I believe that, despite official protestations that this charter is satisfactory, it will become evident that it is far from satisfactory and in need of prompt amendment.</P>
    <P>We need a review mechanism to ensure that the inherent weakness in the Social Charter can be assessed and tackled.  We also need provision for recourse to Community law to allow enforcement of articles of the Social Charter.  I would call on our Government to give these two areas priority during the forthcoming Presidency.</P>
    <P>On the wider aspects of the Summit and the forthcoming Irish Presidency, it is likely that the recent tumultuous developments in Central and Eastern Europe will continue in 1990.  But while the events of the past six months represented the beginning of changes which will create the opportunity to break down the barriers in Europe and work towards a &ldquo;common European Home&rdquo;, the next six months will require a more considered and balanced approach from the European Community in terms of assisting the further development of the democratic changes now being implemented throughout the eastern part of the Continent.</P>
    <P>In this regard I was very surprised indeed to hear the Taoiseach &mdash; even more so in view of the Irish Presidency &mdash; express such strong opinions in favour of German unity, by which, I presume he means unification of the GDR and the FRG.  Such a development may eventually take place but surely it is a matter for the people of the GDR and FRG to resolve without the interference of politicians in other countries, particularly those who are afforded an important European stage.  Indeed, given the various agreements on international borders in Europe agreed after the Second World War and reaffirmed under the Helsinki <Col N="1412" /> Agreement, any statements or action which could serve to destabilise these agreements or to rekindle old disputes on borders between countries must be studiously avoided.</P>
    <P>Instead the aim must be to work to break down those factors which lead to division and military confrontation in Europe.  Clearly the greatest source of military danger on our Continent is the continuing existence of two powerful military blocs, namely NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  I hope that during the time of the Irish Presidency, serious initiatives could be taken to move towards the dissolution of both these blocs and a further reduction in the armed forces and nuclear and conventional arms capabilities of all countries on this Continent.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to what has been described by Deputy Spring as the Pauline conversion of the Taoiseach to the cause of the environment, and to his ambition to have a major environmental aspect to his term as President of the EC.  I hope he has something different in mind from the approach adopted by his Government in relation to the smog crisis and water and river pollution.  There are many areas of Dublin and Cork cities where smog pollution is every bit as bad this winter as it has been for the entire period of the eighties.  The only response on the part of the Government has been to feed us with verbal pollution while those with asthma or other respiratory conditions have their health placed at risk and thousands of young people are subjected to conditions which may affect their health for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the shameful capitulation of the Government to the demands of the farming lobby on the recent Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill is indicative either of a total lack of commitment or of understanding &mdash; I do not know which is the worst &mdash; on the vital issues affecting our environment.  When the Government here show some sign of taking their domestic issues of pollution and the environment seriously, perhaps it will then be appropriate for us to lecture our fellow Europeans on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> If the Taoiseach does intend emphasising environmental issues, perhaps one desirable development would be to work for the establishment of a European environmental agency here.  The establishment of such an agency was agreed at the Madrid Summit earlier this year. Ireland is already the location of the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions at Loughlinstown. Perhaps that foundation could be expanded and given a new role.  As it is known that a number of other EC States are interested in this agency, the Government should quickly declare their interest and join all Irish MEPs in a campaign to convince the Council of Ministers and the Commission of the viability of Ireland as a location.</P>
    <P>It will be important, in the exalted position of our Presidency, to ensure that issues of vital concern to the running of our economy are not forgotten or neglected.  The recent NESC report on the effects of the single market on the Irish economy warrants urgent attention. If European integration will continue to mean &mdash; as the NESC report suggests &mdash; a high level of emigration and continuing difficulties with our economic development, then our term in the Presidency must be used as a means of pushing EC institutions towards providing much greater assistance for peripheral regions and economies to aid economic development.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations on the Single European Act our Government missed the opportunity to make our acceptance of the draft Act dependent on very specific guarantees with regard to Irish economic and fiscal interests.  While recently there has been some indication of Government panic on the implications of looming integration, in particular in relation to tax harmonisation, there is little indication &mdash; and the NESC report would appear to confirm this view &mdash; that Irish negotiations are producing the sort of guarantees and arrangements which will benefit job creation and living standards at home.</P>
    <P>As the NESC report pointed out, true integration involves much more than <Col N="1414" /> removing trade barriers.  It must involve positive measures such as common policies and agreements.  It also states that Structural Funds as currently constituted will not be sufficient to create convergence of income or levels of industrial income between Ireland and other more developed sections of the EC.  The NESC also call for a Common Agricultural Programme and note that the CAP has been used as a convenient excuse for the failure to develop separate and different national agricultural and food processing policies.  If we bear in mind that when we joined the EC our income was 61.8 per cent of the EC average and that today it is just a half per cent higher, we can see the vital necessity for the Government not to once again make a mess of the potential for utilising European funding and structures to benefit job creation and living standards here.</P>
    <P>The NESC report also calls for an active interventionist role by the State and its agencies in job creation, a proposal which The Workers' Party have long advocated and which now seems more pertinent than ever given recent statistics which show the private sector abjectly failing to deliver the jobs in sufficient numbers despite the so-called economic boom.  Lest someone protests that such an approach is in breach of EC regulations and policy, let me remind the House that the European Commission has said it will not object to such policies for regions where living standards are less than 75 per cent of the EC average. Thanks to the policies of Irish Governments since we joined the Common Market in the seventies, we are still well below that figure.</P>
    <P>Finally, The Workers' Party view the forthcoming Irish Presidency as of great importance in the potential it offers to highlight demands for jobs, peace and improved living standards throughout the EC and Europe generally.  If the Taoiseach, in his preparations for the Presidency is prepared to take on board some of the points raised he can be assured of my party's support for any negotiations and pressure which may be necessary to bring them to fulfilment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Stagg to withdraw those amendments in view of the fact that only recently we launched a further producer group grant scheme for the potato sector.  That will operate in conjunction with the producer group grant <Col N="1416" /> scheme which is in force for the vegetable and fruit growers.  If I might be permitted to circulate the information brochures we have on the two producer group schemes, it will go a long way to satisfy Deputies Sherlock and Stagg in regard to their misgivings on the marketing arrangements which are in place at present for the whole horticultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a very brief contribution on this section regarding other functions of the board. Would the Minister give consideration to the fact that the whole horticultural area is one which needs to be developed not just in the rural areas but also in city areas?  There is potential for development, for instance, within Dublin city boundaries.  It goes hand in glove with environmental protection and development, for instance, within Dublin city boundaries.  It goes hand in glove with environmental protection and development. It might be considered a worthy function of the board to develop an interest in the whole horticultural area at school level among students and teachers. There was a time in the not too distant past when many people cultivated plots in various parts of my constituency, for instance, in places like Crumlin.  Children are very eager to learn and this is a golden opportunity to instil in them the importance of horticulture.  Perhaps the Minister would consider on Report Stage that one of the functions of the board might be to educate school children on the worthiness and importance of horticulture and how it can be used as an environmentally good thing.  They could promote the development of horticulture, albeit at a small level, among students in schools.  I hope the Minister might consider that question and perhaps address it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Mitchell in relation to the development of this area.  This is by no means an exclusively rural industry.  One of the very significant growth areas has been that of garden centres in urban areas and this is a reflection of the demand for the produce that the garden centres have on sale.  In turn it <Col N="1417" /> reflects the growing interest which urban dwellers have in developing their own environment.  This will be considered under the umbrella of the amenity horticultural sector.  The Deputy can take it that An Bord Glas will see themselves as having a primary, up-front role in the promotion and development aspect of the urban environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments from The Workers' Party seem to be similar to the ones I have tabled.  What we sought to do, as I have said earlier, was to try to strengthen the Minister's hand.  I accept from what he has said that he is satisfied that, in regard to the areas on which I put forward amendments, his hand is strengthened sufficiently by the measures in the Bill and in view of that I will not be pressing my amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply although I do not question his sincerity in promoting what will be the objective of An Bord Glas when set up.  In the past we have had a lot of experience of failures, one of the biggest of our time being the failure to provide a proper marketing system for the products of Erin Foods but I will not refer to that again.  What I am proposing in the amendment is a system to promote the formation and effective functioning of horticultural co-operatives or associations in the areas of production, processing and marketing and to provide financial assistance in the form of loans and grant subsidies towards these objectives, again to be made available only in the context of an agreed development plan.  Unless some such powers are given in the Bill, it will not have the significant impact on horticulture that we had expected and we will be back here again going over the same ground.</P>
      <P>I know that a brochure has been issued in regard to potato producers.  Groups can be formed and so on but that is only one aspect of the whole horticultural scene.  A broader view must be taken of the matter.  As I have said, I am disappointed at the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> All the provisions in section 5 are very worthy but section 5 (f) provides that the board shall publish and distribute magazines, journals, reports and similar documents for the purpose of encouraging the production of horticultural produce.  The Minister cannot deny that every other day we receive documents in the post on the food industry.  I often wonder what impact they really have.  I am surprised that we could not take on board a proposal which would have the effect of promoting the processing and marketing of horticultural produce.  I am disappointed at this but I will not be pressing my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to specifically address the point which Deputy Sherlock made about grants and loans.  A number of grant schemes are in operation at present, for example, the aid available under the farm improvement programme and the new greenhouse grant scheme which was introduced last year.  The Department of Agriculture and Food will have responsibility for the administration of that scheme.  With regard to loans, the ACC, the banks and the ICC are involved in the business of providing loan finance to people so that they can develop their enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaflets I circulated on producer groups for fruit and vegetables and potatoes are not the only activity undertaken in regard to market co-ordination and development and developments in horticulture generally.  I want to give a very good example of one of the other activities.  A few weeks ago we had the opportunity to open the first mushroom village developed in this country.  This is a joint venture between north Connacht farmers and Carbury Mushrooms in Kildare.  It is reasonable to assume from that example that the co-operatives in existence at present are very interested in opportunities for the development of the horticulture industry. Deputy Sherlock in particular can rest assured that any encouragement or assistance which An Bord Glas can give to these co-operatives in their efforts to <Col N="1419" /> initiate developments will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the circulation of the brochures on the producer group schemes.  My former colleague and the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Paddy Hegarty, started the wheels in motion for this scheme.  Many people in the industry said we had a long road to go before we could get the producers to co-ordinate their efforts and bring their products to one centre where they could be packaged and presented properly.  I believe we all accept that if we want progress in this industry today's housewife must get the quality produce she requires.  It would be remiss of me not to compliment Mr. Paddy Hegarty and the Minister for the initiatives taken in trying to get these producer groups off the ground.  I still believe it is easy to set up a group in areas where perhaps five producers can get together to form a group but there is a number of growers who should act as the pivot for developing this type of producer group and ensuring that it works.  I and my colleagues on this side of the House will be glad to give any help they can in ensuring that such groups are set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the point made by the Minister concerning the mushroom growers group set up by the north Connacht farmers and Carbury Mushrooms in Kildare.  I have a special interest in both these groups because one is in my constituency and I am from Claremorris. I am very concerned that the Minister would regard this type of group as anything near the ideal.  The agricultural minimum wages rate adopted and enforced by the joint labour committee for agricultural workers does not hold in such circumstances because the workers are treated as contract workers. In Claremorris the picking rate per pound has gone down to something like 60 per cent of the rate when the unit opened, which was very recently.  It is a matter of serious concern to me and I am sure to the Minister also that workers can be abused or exploited in this way.  It is <Col N="1420" /> important that the people working in the industry are protected and we should not be giving grant aid to anybody who is not prepared to pay decent wages.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me that this should be a condition of any grants which are being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

I agree with his sentiments in relation to my predecessor, the former Minister of State, Mr. Paddy Hegarty, who did tremendous work during his period in office for the horticulture industry.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to Deputy Stagg's point on the rates of pay.  While the Bill does not address this issue at this point we have to remember that the casual and part-time nature of the employment in the mushroom sector is geared to the requirements of those who are working in it.  I would be sorry to hear of potential difficulties at the development in Claremorris. It is a very worthy and worthwhile development and I believe it will provide a very useful economic dynamic for the town of Claremorris which badly needs such a development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made is relevant to the Bill.  In cases where the Minister would be grant-aiding such projects, is there any possibility that he, under the powers which this Bill will give him, can insist that anybody who receives grant aid should be tied to paying proper rates of wages?</P>

My amendment is designed to facilitate the board in making recommendations to the Minister regarding all aspects of food and quality, including safety.  Given that the board will be involved in improving food quality they will be in a strong position to make expert recommendations as to the safety and quality of food.  At present the Ministers for Health and Agriculture and Food have power to set in motion standards for all classes of food under the Food Standards Act, 1974.  This would give the board an input into that process and on that basis I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>8a.  In page 6, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the establishment and enforcement of grading and quality standards for horticultural produce,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with the terms of Deputy Stagg's amendment and I am in agreement with the Minister's amendment. I should like to make a point in connection with quality and standards.  I do not believe there is any point in having quality and standards if we do not have sufficient staff to ensure that they are adhered to.  We are all aware of the problems that have been caused due to a lack of staff.  It is the person who is found with the product who is prosecuted for any offence.  I accept that the Minister has made a major step forward by insisting on licence numbers, names of producers and so on being put on bags of potatoes but we will never upgrade the standard if we do not have sufficient staff to carry out inspections.  It is important that we pursue producers who are not complying with the standards.  Producers should be prosecuted and not retailers.  We are all aware that when inferior products are sold on the market the retailer must cut the price and that is not fair to other retailers.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure that there are sufficient staff available to carry out spot checks on the farms before the products are sold to retailers.  The Minister will be aware that if an inspector discovers that the name of the producer is not on a bag of potatoes it is the retailer in whose premises the bag is found who is prosecuted.  It is not right that he should take the stick for that offence.  It is important that inspections take place to ensure that quality products are offered to houewives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Quality control and the enforcement of regulations will have to be given more attention.  I should like to tell the Deputy that at present we have <Col N="1424" /> 12 officials enforcing grading standards at retail and wholesale level.  The potato inspectors may enforce the standards at farm level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that 12 officials will be sufficient to do this work?  I am not aware of the number of producers we have but I do not think 12 officials would be sufficient to cover them all.  We are only playing around with this if we take a random sample of the products sold by producers.  I accept that it will be easy to enforce grading standards if we succeed in encouraging all potato producers to join the producer groups.  That is the ideal solution to the problem but I do not think it will happen in the immediate future.  The Minister should consider appointing more inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Stagg is withdrawing his amendment because I consider it an important one.  There is widespread concern in medical circles about the extensive use of enzymes which it is felt may cause allergies.  In many cases of this nature conclusive proof is not possible but I submit that we must err on the side of safety.  The health of the consumer must be paramount.  I am also disappointed that very little has been said in the debate about the need to stress the importance of organic vegetables.  There is a tremendous future here for the production of organic vegetables.  They are much healthier for the consumer and they would provide a premium price for producers. I should like the Minister to comment on that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Garland that it is not simply a question of withdrawing my amendment but of accepting the Minister's stronger and more perfect parliamentary wording of the proposal contained in my amendment. It is important that the House should understand that.  The Minister has put forward better wording and that is not surprising given that he has experts <Col N="1425" /> to draft his amendment.  I acknowledge their superior knowledge in such matters.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, as I am sure the Minister is, about the difficulty of setting and enforcing standards.  In this regard I am particularly concerned about the organic food industry, a growing sector, particularly in the horticulture area.  It is because there is a premium available from the public for such produce that there is a high risk of cowboy operators moving in and mislabelling goods that are not organically produced.  The toughest standards should be applied to safeguard our chunk of the market, which possibly may grow in the future.  I seek clarification from the Opposition benches rather than from the Minister, if this is allowable.  What Deputy Farrelly has been saying would seem to conflict very directly with what he had to say on the principle of the Bill.  He is now complaining that there are insufficient staff in a particular area whereas previously he argued that the Bill would establish another layer of useless bureaucracy. More staff leads to more bureaucracy so I am not sure what point the Deputy is trying to make.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. As I said previously, we cannot expect consumers either at home or abroad to do us any favours.  If progress is to be made very specific measures will have to be taken in an effort to improve the quality of our fruit and vegetables. There is nothing patriotic about buying Irish if what is on offer is shoddy and second rate.  We are all used to buying bruised fruit and bags of potatoes which contain half rotten potatoes and lumps of clay.</P>
      <P>I welcome this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>My officials assure me that the inspectors are very active and that there has been quite a number of prosecutions, but this is not to say that we are completely satisfied.  Obviously this is a matter which has to be kept under constant review.  I can assure the House that, if we find it is necessary to effect changes, <Col N="1426" /> I am sure An Bord Glas will make the necessary recommendations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland referred to organic production.  It is a fact of life that there is a growing demand for organically grown produce.  The economics of it of course are dictated and very much determined by the premium obtainable for this produce which a growing number of people is demanding.  The interim board have established a special subcommittee to examine this subject and I am sure they will bring forward any recommendations they deem necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that there may be insufficient staff. In relation to Deputy Stagg's remarks on my comments on this Bill and my suggestion that there is no need for another layer of bureaucracy, there is no need to get staff to do work which is already being done by such bodies as CTT and others.  The Deputy should recall what I did say when I spoke about the duplication of work.  People working in this area should not duplicate work being done in another area.  What they will be doing is preventing producers from abusing the market to the detriment of producers of top class products.  There is an enormous difference between what I said on Second Stage and the point he is trying to make.  I am trying to ensure that producers present the product in a proper way and that those who do not, are caught and prosecuted.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 8, after &ldquo;activities.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Such charges shall be payable only by individuals, groups or organisations seeking to avail of services provided by the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like us to reach the position where the individuals or groups who ask An Bord Glas to carry out a report or study or to undertake some work would actually pay the cost of this service.  I ask that this amendment be included in the Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment I wonder what reasons he will give.  Can he tell us if a charge is imposed on potato or mushroom growers on the completion of a report, will it be similar to the charge imposed by Teagasc, and if an individual does not pay this charge will he not receive his grants until he pays?  I ask the Minister to outline the position in this regard and to tell us for which services there will be a charge, what kind of rates we are talking about and who will pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly opposed to the amendment being proposed by the Fine Gael Party.  All producers will benefit <Col N="1428" /> if the proper conditions outlined in the board's interim report are achieved. Therefore, all producers should pay the levy, not just a selected group.  Imposing the levy only on those taking up the service would mean that producers who want to expand or modernise would necessarily be forced to pay more than their fair share while lazy or indifferent producers would reap the benefits without paying the cost.  Horticulture needs the highest maximisation of investment and financial assistance it can get.  This means that the State, the taxpayers and producers would all pay, but only to charge those who could be identified as benefiting would not be acceptable.  The programme of the board is much broader and all producers should be asked to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputies that charges can be applied only to individuals or groups who ask the board to provide a specific service.  The cost of the service will be known to those who are asking for it at the time they ask.  I will illustrate this by giving examples of what An Bord Glas might provide by way of service. For a seminar to discuss a particular problem or problems affecting the industry there will be a per head charge for attendance, known beforehand.  Individuals or organisations asking to be put on the circulation list for the market intelligence bulletin may be asked to pay a yearly charge.  A group asking for the promotion of a particular product to be arranged may have to agree beforehand to pay part or all of the cost to An Bord Glas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other examples of ways and means in which An Bord Glas may provide a service.  For instance, I could see the board taking on the job at the request of a particular group of producers of helping them to set up a producer group.  An important point to note is that under subsection (3) any debt arising may be recovered by the board as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  There cannot be a contract unless both sides. i.e. An Bord <Col N="1429" /> Glas and the people asking for the service, agree before hand to the cost.  As will be seen from section 11 (2) the amounts of the charges will be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of a charge being imposed on people who have not asked for a service and agreed to the cost thereof.  Any charge of a general nature imposed without the consent of the persons paying the charge can only come about as a result of the operation of the levy arrangements provided for in section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation of the charge as it was not outlined in the Bill.  I have no objection to a charge for services.  A charge agreed beforehand is the right way to go about it.  People will know where they stand before they start.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that Deputy Stagg was totally against the proposal.  The Deputy wants everybody charged, except people in his own constituency.  We know that from the way the Deputy has carried on on different issues.  The Deputy seemingly wants the farmers to pay more whether or not they are getting the service but he does not want other people who are receiving services to pay. However that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>People will be under no illusion.  If they want a job done, they will pay for it and the cost will be decided before it starts. That is a positive businesslike way to proceed.  On the basis of what the Minister has said, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>One of my main objections to the Bill was that the Minister of the day had been given power to introduce levies on products produced here.  I would like the Minister to answer a number of questions to clear the air.  Will the Minister say on whom it is envisaged levies will be imposed and who will collect them?  Will the levies be compulsory on all sections of the industry?  Is the Minister satisfied that this and other sections of the Bill are in accordance with the Treaty of Rome?  Will there be similar levies on imported products and will there be levies on goods going for export? We have spoken in the House on a number of occasions about our excellent export market for fresh mushrooms for instance.  Will levies be imposed on them? Will it lead to a lack of competitiveness in the foreign market?  What is the position there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty with Deputy Farrelly's amendment in so far as it seems to propose the impossible. The Deputy is proposing that all sections will be consulted before the Minister makes a decision.  We know that 20 per <Col N="1431" /> cent of all producers are organised into producer groups which possibly would be readily available for consultation and general groups might also be available, but how does the Deputy envisage all groups being consulted?  The Deputy's proposal would mean that probably every person who has sold a bag of spuds during the year would have to be consulted.  It would simply be a blocking mechanism that would make the operation impossible. Is this being proposed simply because Fine Gael are opposed to the whole Bill and are trying to block it in this way or is it that the spokesman did not realise what he was saying?  I am not sure how the Deputy proposes to operate the selective levies he is talking about.</P>
      <P>The Deputy certainly took my words on the last amendment out of context and distorted them.  I was talking about people who benefit from the services provided by the board.  If the board's proposals are implemented all producers not just present producers, but a considerable number of new producers also will be affected.  All these people should pay their fair share towards the cost of improving the industry and they are prepared to do so.  That is not at all at variance with my political positions on other issues.  There seems to be a selectivity about the proposal from the Fine Gael benches.  If the Deputy's amendment is accepted it would pose a problem for the Minister if all producers benefit, and they should if the proposals in the Bill are implemented.</P>
      <P>The mushroom industry has been mentioned a number of times today.  Should some mushroom producers who do not wish to avail directly of a service from the board be exempt from the general levy the board could impose arising from their activities to improve the industry? All producers should pay their fair share, and that is simply what I propose.  The type of global consultation proposed by Deputy Farrelly in his amendment is not workable and the Minister's alternative amendment is workable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Farrelly's <Col N="1432" /> amendment is a bit like the curate's egg, it is good in parts.  I support totally the part dealing with consultation.  It is very important that all sectors in the horticultural industry be consulted about the levy, but I would not accept the agreement part.  The words &ldquo;and with the agreement of&rdquo; imply that all sectors would have to be in total agreement.  I think the correct answer is that the board should consult with all sectors of the industry and should consider the representations made by all sections but it should not go as far as &ldquo;with the agreement of&rdquo;.  I disagree with Deputy Stagg in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>For some peculiar, unexplained reason during Second Stage of the Bill the levies proved to be a point of focus.  That surprised me because they are by no means an innovation.  The collection of levies is a mechanism that is there to garner resources for a board to operate and operate effectively.  There are many examples of the operation of a levy: CBF is one that comes to mind pretty readily.  Strangely enough in the horticulture sector there is a multiplicity of products involved and a multiplicity of producers.  It is difficult to see how it would be practicable to collect the levy at producer level.  I indicated on Second Stage that the regulations would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be teased out and discussed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly asked if it would be on domestic produce and imported produce and I replied on Second Stage, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. That question was posed at the end of the debate and I indicated at that stage that it would be collected at the point of sale on both domestic produce and imported produce.  We are envisaging no difficulty at all as far as the Treaty of Rome is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides for exemption. If a sector within the industry is unable to pay, the provision is there to exempt them from it even indefinitely or for a defined period.  I think there is adequate provision to cater for every circumstance which might arise within <Col N="1433" /> the industry in this area of the collection of the levies.  I think the House can have every confidence in whoever is Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time these are being introduced.  I said in reply on Second Stage that their introduction will come later.  It is not intended to introduce them immediately.  They will be introduced at some future date and we will have regard to the ability of particular sectors of the industry to pay and we are making very adequate provision in the amendment we have circulated for proper consultation with the industry before they are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How are we going to organise the street trader on the basis of levies or whatever?  Are they to be paid at the point of sale?  What about the importer?  Where will this end up being paid?  I am worried about the levies.  What is going to happen if we run to a rule of thumb on the basis of the introduction of other levies across the board?  The consumer will end up paying the levy at the end of the day.  It will affect the price. One of two things will happen.  As the Minister said, we are dealing with a very lucrative multiplicity of products and we could end up with the grower getting that little bit less because of the levy.  I hope I am not 100 per cent right.  If the grower still has to get his price and the levy has to go on top of it and it applies the whole way until we get to the consumer in the supermarket or whatever, will the consumer not end up paying the extra at the point of purchase in the supermarket?  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying.  It is a question of balancing the two considerations, that is, of balancing whatever addition there might be at the end of the day to the price of the product by the introduction of the levy, on the one hand, and the overall wellbeing of the industry, on the other.  Horticulture has been the subject of political comment and public controversy for many years.  People were wringing their hands in anguish at the statistics for the level of imports coming <Col N="1434" /> in; people were lamenting the number of jobs going lost because we were not producing the product required at home to supply the home market requirement. This Bill is all about providing the wherewithal for the industry to develop.  Import substitution, the development of exports and job creation are the principle thrust of the legislation we are providing in this Bill.  No board can function satisfactorily without having resources, and the provision we are making in the introduction of this levy is merely for the industry itself to contribute to what the Exchequer will pay to develop the horticulture industry next year and in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are again at the anniversary of not exactly similar legislation two years on.  I know this proposal will not meet with the same resistance as the rod licence legislation the second anniversary of which we are celebrating, but if the amendment I have here was not down the Minister would not have his amendment before us.  We have come maybe not all the way but perhaps 50 per cent of the way to ensure that at least some of the organisations, or committees, or commodity committees will be contacted, that there will be some consultation and when the Minister here or whoever else may hold that office over the years comes into this House to introduce a proposal, at least it will not be met with widespread objections from the industry.  Other Members of this House were not in favour and again I am not surprised because they cannot get enough.  Get in there and if it is £1 get £2.  However, as the Minister has said rightly, there has to be a reasonable balance to ensure that these producers or some of them are not put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sectors of the industry that have real volume are potatoes, mushrooms and a few other outlets, and they will pay the greater part of this levy.  I have no doubt that it will work.  We are introducing this levy.  It can have a knock-on effect which I fear may mean that the products on the shelves will be dearer.  If that happens the ordinary household weekly requirement will increase inflation by .5 per cent, 1 <Col N="1435" /> per cent or whatever.  At whatever rate those levies come in, say 1 per cent across the board, we could lose out in the long term on the basis of the consumer having to pay.  We should seek funds from Europe to develop this industry.</P>
    <P>Because the industry is so fragmented and so many different products are produced, we could possibly end up with the consumer paying a little more in the supermarket, as a result of which inflation would go up.  In that case it would not pay us to go to the bother of collecting the levy because at the end of the day the consumer would be paying it, not the producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept Deputy Farrelly's bona fides in this matter.  I think he accepts the principle of the levies and his amendment reflects his concerns about the impact.  It is understandable that he should have put down an amendment on an issue such as this and expressed the views on the industry.  I would suggest that the amendment we have circulated to the House refines Deputy Farrelly's amendment even further. I would respectfully ask Deputy Farrelly to withdraw his amendment No. 12 to allow us move the other amendment.</P>

Can the introduction of levies at this stage, regardless of what they are, have a knock-on effect on prices in the shops, which would increase inflation? We would be losing out because the consumer would end up paying.</P>

I would hope that it would not <Col N="1436" /> disadvantage our producers.  If a similar levy is imposed on imported produce the home producers would not be left at a disadvantage.  There is provision in this section for exemption from the levy if it is feared that it would leave our producers at a competitive disadvantage.  That provision covers all the eventualities.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's delayed reaction to the original amendment I put down.  Perhaps it is just as well we did not resume on Committee Stage last week because we would not then have been in a position to have this amendment before us.  The feed back from the industry is a help in these issues. Learning from experience as Members of this House makes us all better people.  Of course, we can always say that if we had been the people involved in a particular <Col N="1437" /> matter we might not have made the same mistakes.</P>
      <P>This amendment is most important. The main thrust of the Bill brings the industry into line and tries to ensure that it is promoted properly with adequate funding.  I have expressed my reservations already and I hope we will have the opportunity to consider the effect of the types of levies we have been discussing. I am sure the members of the board will contact excellent producers throughout the country prior to the introduction of particular levies.  That would be a very important step.  When I contacted a number of people involved in this sector, the meaning of the original Bill was not known to them.  It is not that we want to be alarmist but we want to introduce legislation which will have a serious impact in getting proposals implemented.  We need the goodwill of everybody involved in the industry to ensure that we reduce imports and that the industry develops in the right way, thereby creating a large number of jobs. The amendment does not go the full way but at least there is some movement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13.:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 25, after &ldquo;chief executive&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following open competition in all cases including the first and subsequent chief executives&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking in this amendment to ensure that appointments will be made following open competition in all cases, including that of the first and subsequent chief executive officers.  We want to ensure that open competition is the normal procedure, it being the normal procedure in corporate activities in filling <Col N="1438" /> posts, especially such a high ranking post as that of chief executive.  Open competition would mean that the appointment would be seen to be based on merit and qualification.  I believe that serious harm to the integrity of the board could arise if appointments were not seen in this light, regardless of the objective situation.  The amendment also ensures that the principle of open competition is an integral part of the operation of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Stagg for tabling this amendment, but I suggest it is in the wrong place.  Section 15 (1) merely deals with two things: there shall be a chief officer of the Board who shall be known as the chief executive.  It does not deal or purport to deal with the method of his appointment.  I suggest that the amendment would be better dealt with under section 15 (3) or by way of an additional subsection in the main section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions we are making in the Bill for the appointment of the chief executive are similar to the provisions that were made in the 1988 Act establishing Teagasc and the Labour Services Act, 1987.  I do not think anybody could disagree with appointments made as a result of those provisions.  Section 15 (5) states:</P>
      <P>The first chief executive shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time, by the Minister; each subsequent chief executive shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time, by the Board with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By definition, the position of chief executive is a very important position in any board and the difficulty I see is that the person or persons whom we would like to see having an interest in this position might not necessarily apply for it by way of open competition.  It may well be a question of giving sufficient freedom to allow the Minister of the day to identify the person whom he deems as the most suitable to progress the work of the board and then to appoint that person to it. <Col N="1439" /> There are adequate provisions in section 15 (5) for any difficulties that may arise in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it proposed to fill the position?  Is it to be left completely open?  Is the Minister telling the House that there will, in fact, be open competition and that he may in the first instance advertise in the public press, stating the qualifications?  Is that possible as the Bill stands at present?  If that is so, and I believe it is, why is it not written into the Bill?  I am suggesting my amendment as a safeguard so that there can be no allegation of cronyism against the Minister or against the board and that the system of appointment is seen to be objective.  I doubt if anybody interested in meeting the challenge the work entails and who has the qualifications to do the job would not apply simply because he was required to apply.  Even if there were to be open competition for the position of chief executive, the Minister could ask people to apply, it is quite a common practice to request people to apply.  It is a matter of keeping things above board so that they are seen to be above board. However, I am not suggesting for a moment that appointments the Minister referred to in Teagasc and elsewhere were other than proper and that those appointed were not suitable or qualified for the position.  However, I want it to be seen to be so and if the Minister accepts a wording similar to that in my amendment, he can do that.</P>

      <P>There is sufficient flexibility in the provisions for the appointment of a chief executive to accommodate the Deputy's point of view.  I appeal to the Deputy to leave that flexibility in the provisions of the section to ensure that we get the right person for the job.  It worries me more than a little that the person or persons whom we would like to see applying for the job would not apply for it if it is tied down too much. There are sufficient provisions in the section to allow us to get the right man <Col N="1440" /> for the job.  I appeal to the Deputy to withdraw the amendment on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that the best possible person is recruited for this job on account of the enormous amount of work to be done in a start-up situation.  If we apply the Civil Service Grade III pay scale we will not be at the races in recruiting the type of person we want.  It is very important to get the right person because everybody else in the industry will respond to the leadership of the person at the top.  I think we should headhunt for persons to apply for this position.  If a person were to be appointed under the present Civil Service pay scale the salary would be in the region of £24,000 and everybody knows that we would not get the type of person we want for that type of money.  There is no point in having all the pillars of the organisation right up to the chief executive and then fall down in the appointment to that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a great deal of experience of the job not being done properly.  If anything we should be wishing the Minister luck in going out to find the type of person that is required.  I will not start talking about salaries, because that is not our job, but I am sure the Minister and his officials know quite well that if the <Col N="1441" /> person is to lift the industry and encourage the people that we want to see involved to get involved in the promotion that he announced this week, this can only be done if the person is recruited from outside the system.  The Minister should be given the flexibility to ensure that the top layer is right, because if the chief executive is not right the rest of the organisation will not be right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 (3) adequately covers the points which Deputy Farrelly has made.  I want to reiterate what everybody in the House has been saying, that is, the importance of getting the right person for the job, a person who knows what needs to be done and who will provide the motivation for the organisation under his command.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 29 to 32, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The chief executive shall hold office on a contract basis for a specified period as may be determined by the Minister.  Such contract shall be renewable at the discretion of the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the chief executive should be appointed on a contract basis for a specific period.  It must be for a limited period because if he is appointed under the present Civil Service system, we could end up with somebody that we cannot get rid of if he is not doing his job.  If he is good enough there is no problem in the board recommending him to be reappointed and renewing his contract. I would like to see that amendment accepted because I do not believe it <Col N="1442" /> creates any real difference, it only ensures that when one gets the best person one can hold on to him.  If it so happens that he is not performing in the desired manner at the end of a specific period he will have to go.  Surely we have had enough experience of cases where it has cost a leg and an arm to get rid of somebody who is failing to do the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as drafted does not preclude a contract arrangement as provided for in Deputy Farrelly's amendment. There is sufficient flexibility in the provision to consider what the best arrangement will be at the end of the day. Tying somebody into a contract arrangement does not guarantee in any way that he or she will perform the duties as adequately as the people in the industry would like.  It is important that the person has a sense of job satisfaction, that he is happy in it, that he has an ability to work along with people, that he has an ability to motivate people, that he knows the objectives and that he has a personal commitment to see those objectives bearing fruit.  The particular arrangement for which Deputy Farrelly is arguing is not precluded under section 15.  If at the end of the day, we felt that it might be the best way, we would have no hesitation in adopting it, but having said that, if the conventional way of employing a chief executive would be found to be the best way having regard to the person, or personalities, available at the time for the job it would be desirable to leave that flexibility in the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have to disagree with the Minister.  He is in a position to give us the flexibility.  The Minister knows well that when it comes down to the reality, if there is a problem it will be pointed out that the provision is not written into the legislation.  I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment as it would not change the Bill enormously.  In relation to the person to be appointed, surely we are not going to appoint somebody who will not be happy in the job or who will be leaving in three month's time.  In the absence of a fixed <Col N="1443" /> contract one will not get the right person. A person who might take this post as a means of improving himself, as a stepping stone to something greater, would make it work so that he could go for something greater at the end of a three year period or have his contract renewed.  The insertion of that amendment is the only way we can ensure we get the best person.  He will have a sense of security, a two or a three year period to perform this job and turn the industry inside out.  This would strengthen the Minister's hand in ensuring that the work he has been doing since coming into office has been worth while. This is something that is moving so one does not have to be looking around all the time to ensure it is being taken along. That is why I want that amendment included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The essence of what Deputy Farrelly said in his contribution on Deputy Stagg's amendment was that the remuneration would have to be sufficiently attractive for the right persons to apply for the job.  I do not disagree with those sentiments.  Obviously, remuneration is important but there are also such factors as job satisfaction, the individual's ability to work well with people, particularly in an organisation dealing with an industry which is relatively small in the context of the overall agricultural industry, and the ability to motivate people.  Merely tying them into a contract arrangement for their employment in the particular job will not guarantee that they will perform under any of those headings.  Indeed, one could have the worst of both worlds.  You could have, for instance, somebody tied into a job by way of contract but who found after a period of 12 or 18 months that the job was unsatisfactory, that they had difficulty in working with people in the industry and so on.  Bearing in mind the variations one can meet in the personalities of people representing various organisations, I see it as essential that the person concerned have a sense of job satisfaction, the ability to work along with people and the ability to motivate people.  These are the <Col N="1444" /> three vitally important elements.  I would be concerned that a contract arrangement would tie down the issue too much. If a person, for one reason or another, found that they wanted to opt out but had to stay simply because they were tied to a contract arrangement, the industry, effectively, would be saddled with that person for the duration of the contract and the organisation and the industry could find themselves slipping into a state of stagnation as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister is opposing this amendment.  To accept it would be to set an extremely dangerous precedent.  Contracts by their nature have to start somewhere and there always has to be an end to them as well. In the case of a senior employee such as, in this case, a chief executive officer, a contract as proposed would lead to a lack of security for his position and a lack of a sense of continuity for the board and for the employee.  It is much better that an employee be employed under normal conditions where, if dissatisfied with his job, he would have an out clause like every other employee.  Likewise, the employer, if he was dissatisfied, would have an out clause, as every employer has, in respect of an employee.  I strongly support the Minister's rejection of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why the Minister will not accept this proposal.  He is telling us here that we could have somebody who is not suitable for the job in question who might not be happy in it or whatever.  For a job such as this, surely the successful applicant will know what type of responsibility they are taking on and what is expected of him in the following two or three years.  I believe that that is a sense of security for a person who is being employed.  He or she will also need security, it cannot be on just one side of the industry.  If we headhunt the right person and pay the right salary for the job, there should be a contract for two or three years.  I am sure there are many energetic young people who would be interested in getting involved <Col N="1445" /> in the industry and developing it in the way we would like.  I do not see why my proposal is not acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I said at the outset that the particular provision was very flexible and did not rule out what Deputy Farrelly has in mind.  We will consider his amendment in the context of what is best as far as the appointment is concerned.  I cannot say that we will adopt it, but we will certainly give due consideration to it.  If there is merit in the Deputy's argument it will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister did not accept my amendment because it is very important in so far as the industry and its further development is concerned.  We should consider giving a person security of tenure as we do not want the person appointed to be looking over his shoulder worrying that his services will be dispensed with.  Taking my views into consideration will have no real bearing on the appointment because, when the Bill is passed, the ball will be in the Minister's court.  I would have thought that we could have come to some sort of accommodation on this amendment to ensure that the type of person we required was employed on a contract basis and given time to develop the industry.  I will not withdraw my amendment on the basis of the Minister's remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is quite flexible in regard to the method of appointment. However, if a particular method of appointment is adopted and, for one reason or another, it does not work out, there is adequate provision in subsection (5) to deal with it.  I am sure that in that context, different ways and means of making appointments could be considered, and that, if the original method of appointment was not satisfactory, an alternative way could be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) states that the first chief executive shall be appointed, and, may be removed from office at any time, by the Minister.  The Minister said that my proposed amendment was tying him down too much but that subsection says that a person can be removed at very short notice.  Of course it would be necessary to do that if the person appointed was not up to standard, but the subsection will affect the response the Minister will get from people who want the job.  For instance, the board might object to the way their chief executive was working and he might no longer have their confidence.  In that case his contract would be terminated, but I am trying to ensure that the person the Minister appoints will have the confidence of the board for a period of time.  He should have the backing of the board to ensure that he can bring his proposals to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is to alleviate the worries which could surface as a result of subsection (5).  A person appointed does not like to think that he may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.  The fear will be there and the <Col N="1447" /> problem is that the board will end up with a middle of the road person who will be quite happy to have the job and to go along with any scheme proposed by the board.  I do not want someone of that calibre appointed to this organisation; I want someone leading from the front.  As I said, the person appointed should have some security and two or three years to do the job with the backing of the board and the Minister.</P>

      <P>In debating the Bill and the appointment of a chief executive for the board we have the advantage of being able to draw on previous experience in these matters.  When we reflect on various appointments of chief executives, directors, etc., of State organisations, we must acknowledge that we have been very fortunate in the calibre and the ability of people appointed by the conventional methods which proved to be quite satisfactory.  What worries me more than a little is that, with a contract arrangement, we could have a chief executive tied in effectively in a straitjacket, who may end up unhappy in the job or, for one reason or another, unable to work along with the industry &mdash; as I said earlier, a very diverse one.  That would be detrimental because his ability to motivate people will be basic and fundamental if he is to achieve the success needed.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was urging the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment to seize the opportunity to jump the legislative queue that undoubtedly obtains in relation to the <Col N="1448" /> preparation and formulation of legislation and to take on board a Second Reading of this Bill to establish an environmental protection agency.  My experience tells me that such a decision would not in any way compromise her views in relation to the priorities of such an agency while, at the same time, ensuring that in the course of our Presidency of the EC when, as the Taoiseach has said, it is hoped to make the environment a major issue of that Presidency, we would not then be faced with the ludicrously embarrassing position of not having the relevant legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's priorities <i>vis-á-vis</i> Ireland's Presidency, and specifically in relation to the question of the environment, as far as the Labour Party are concerned we welcome this conversion manifest within Fianna Fáil and, perhaps to a lesser extent, among the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>In the Labour Party policy discussion document published on 5 June 1989 we stated that the Labour Party's priorities should be, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Labour believes that the priorities of environmental policy for any socialist Party must have two aspects &mdash; domestic and international.  A clean environment at home is of little benefit in a world that is choking to death.  Similarly, there can be little point in our protesting about the threat from outside if we fail to keep our own house in order.  Labour's priorities, therefore, are set out under these headings.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party proposes that Ireland should adopt as a national policy, the support of a comprehensive set of responsible environment actions and commitments so as to establish Ireland as a place which is uniquely &ldquo;green&rdquo;.  Ireland is the least densely populated State within Europe and still remains substantially pollution free. While substantial dangers threaten our environment, these can be overcome with proper and effective management, combined with a national collective will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> The objective should be to create a comprehensive and complete commitment to the establishment of a &ldquo;green&rdquo; environment.  The benefits to all sectors of our society would not only result in an improved environment at home but a transformed reputation abroad.  Irish products &mdash; ranging from food and beverages to industrial products &mdash; would be recognised instantly as being environmentally sound, organically pure and intrinsically clean. In a world becoming increasingly concerned with problems of contamination and environmental pollution, the positive image of a green Ireland, in the real sense of the world, is an objective which must receive full support.</P>
    <P>That objective, which in part appears to have been taken on board by the Taoiseach &mdash; in a rhetorical sense if nothing else &mdash; and, broadly speaking, would have the support of most progressive Members of this House, will be placed seriously at risk on account of the political footsteps that must be taken within the next couple of weeks, never mind within the next six months by the Minister of State.  We cannot begin to appear credible <i>vis-á-vis</i> our present environmental record while we have, on the one hand, the abolition of An Foras Forbartha, with their attendant reputation and, on the other hand, promised legislation which clearly will not arrive in time to be enacted before the cessation of our term of Presidency in June next.</P>
    <P>One must ask what kind of national disgrace is the Minister endeavouring to bring on the entire country &mdash; indeed all the intimations of grandeur are beginning to surface in the demeanour of the Taoiseach in relation to our forthcoming Presidency &mdash; if we are to have a green, environmental declaration promulgated from Dublin Castle, with all its attendant pomp and ceremony while, at the same time we are in breach of the EC Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment &mdash; belatedly being taken on board after approximately two years &mdash; in addition to not having an environmental <Col N="1450" /> protection agency of any kind, whatever its composition?  The Minister of State would be well advised to consider jumping the political queue and take that proposal on board.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with everything in the Fine Gael Bill.  Indeed, the Fine Gael spokesperson does not expect everybody in this House to agree with all its contents, nor do the Fine Gael Party regard the Bill as being of unique quality and value so that not a single sentence or clause can or should be changed.  That is not the point at issue at this stage of our legislative debate.  The point is that we need some kind of environmental protection agency.  It is my belief that we need something more interventionist than the agency proposed by the Fine Gael Party, one that would have a certain degree of &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; involvement rather than the excessive influence placed on its policing aspect indicated in the Fine Gael Bill.  Whether they be the proposals of the Fine Gael Party or those set out in our policy discussion document, either would be better than what the Minister herself intimated last evening and at the substantial press conference at which details of the proposed agency were made available at a time when there were other environmental matters occupying the citizens of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>We believe that what we need is an environmental management agency.  It is not just a question of protecting the environment; it is a question of learning how to manage it as well.</P>
    <P>Again I shall quote from our policy discussion document as follows:</P>
    <P>Labour believes that it is absolutely essential for the future that the management of the environment be entrusted to an independent agency, with adequate resources and powers. The Environmental Management Agency we propose would be statutorily established.  It would have a representative council with an independent secretariat and executive staff.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Management <Col N="1451" /> Agency would be jointly representative of the State, producers, consumers and workers.  Its Council, representing the social partners in the broadest sense of the word, would operate upon the basis of a framework of legislation and draw up codes of practice for all activities which interact and impact upon the environment.</P>
    <P>The functions and responsibilities of that agency would be as follows:</P>
    <P>Agriculture, manufacturing, and services would be represented on the Council and would participate in drawing up codes of practice which, when agreed upon, would assume the force of law.</P>
    <P>They would in effect provide regulations and legal procedures for any breaches of the agreed codes of practice.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Management Agency will have the following functions:</P>
    <P>The development and implementation of a National Environmental Management Plan;</P>
    <P>The development and implementation of policy and action in relation to specific hazards, including the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, and other areas where we can make our own contribution;</P>
    <P>The overall responsibility for ensuring the involvement of local authorities in protecting the environment;</P>
    <P>Responsibility for research and information.  The abolition of An Foras Forbartha and the emasculation of the Environmental Research Unit within the Department of the Environment was a scandal. Labour will re-establish An Foras Forbartha as an integral part of the Environmental Management Agency;</P>
    <P>Responsibility for Radiological Protection.  The Environmental Management Agency will take over the role of the present Nuclear <Col N="1452" /> Energy Board in so far as it relates to radiological protection;</P>
    <P>Responsibility for functions presently carried out under the aegis of the Department of Health in the following areas &mdash; health inspection; food additives; other product chemical additives;</P>
    <P>Responsibility for ensuring that all exploration companies will be required to provide all details of environmental information derived from exploration within our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that, between Fine Gael, Labour and most other parties in this House, there is broad agreement on the need for the establishment of an environmental protection agency, its overall terms of remit, and its being clearly established as an independent body.</P>
    <P>In addition, I fully support the concept of an Oireachtas environmental committee. The convention &mdash; and I have been a party to it myself and feel all the more culpable as a result &mdash; of not accepting legislative initiatives from the other side, irrespective of their merits or demerits, is prevailing and I am sad to note that.  I would have hoped that in our maturity we might have got a little further down the road than that.  Secondly and more ominous is the apparent limited confinement of the proposed role of the agency that is contemplated by the present Coalition Government.  It will not go as far down the road as we would like.  I do not think it is going to be delivered in time.  I think that in June, when the Taoiseach is promoting and promulgating a declaration on the environment in Dublin Castle, the citizens outside the walls will still be without an effective operating agency.  I predict that there will be no environment protection agency in operation with statutory undertakings and backing and a proper budget for 1990 when that council takes place and we will be made the laughing stock of Europe.  The Minister, by accepting this Bill now, could avoid that embarrassment.</P>

A second extravagant abuse of time which I pointed out is the abuse of Question Time and in particular the abuse of written questions.  I pointed out that we also had the abuse in recent times of trivial votes being called, such as Fine Gael's effort to call a vote recently on the title of a Bill.

      <P>Deputy Shatter's clear intention in introducing this Bill is to jump on the band wagon.  Fine Gael, <Col N="1454" /> stuck as ever for an original idea, have in this Bill latched onto a commitment in the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993.</i> As the House and the whole nation know, the establishment of an environment protection agency is one of the commitments in that programme.</P>

      <P>Where is the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>One could understand and even forgive Deputy Shatter's impatience if there were any signs that the Government are dragging their heels on the issue but that is simply not the case.  Not only are the Minister and the Minister of State on the record as to their anxiety to bring forward legislation to establish the EPA but they have taken the unusual step of publishing a full brief as to what they intend the new agency to do and how they intend it to operate.  It is evident that Deputy Quinn has not really read that material.  If he had, he would not have made some of the comments he has just made.</P>
      <P>The new agency, as proposed by the Government, will, first of all, control and regulate any environment-threatening development of a specific type; secondly, monitor the general environmental quality; thirdly, provide support, back-up and advisory services and, finally, carry out environmental research.  Deputy Shatter's dismissal of the Government's proposals outlined to date seem, on the face of it, either to be based on the arrogance which has endeared him to so many people of all sides of the House or alternatively &mdash; I am being charitable to him &mdash; based on a flawed understanding of the Government's intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general framework which the Government intend following strikes me as one which should recommend itself to any serious legislator or environmentalist. Under the Government's proposals the Environment Protection Agency will have real teeth.  I note that tonight Deputy Quinn adverted to the fact that the agency proposed in the Private Members' Bill lacks these.  It is the Government's intention that the legislation will specifically identify classes of <Col N="1455" /> development on which attention will focus.  The classes of development which are to receive attention will not be cast in stone but will from time to time be subject to amendment.  Surely there is good sense in targeting areas which from time to time require particular attention. The task force type of operation which this denotes is a highly successful organisational format in business and one which can readily be translated into public policy and which from time to time in the past we have translated into public policy.</P>
    <P>The Government proposals will provide for a new environment agency which will be responsible for the issue and review of waste and air pollution, and waste permits for new developments in scheduled areas.  Outside the scheduled categories of development local authorities will continue to fulfil their planning role and will retain responsibility for licensing and monitoring non-scheduled developments.  Again this strikes me as a reasonable approach.  It lifts a burden from the shoulders of local authorities and dealt with an area which they clearly cannot handle without emasculating them.  Monitoring of all emissions from plants operating within the schedule will be handled by the new EPA.  Local authorities will retain responsibility for monitoring non-scheduled developments. Again this strikes me as a reasonable and rational approach which will focus attention on specific areas where we feel we have problems while allowing local authorities to continue monitoring areas where in general we do not have problems.</P>
    <P>The agency proposed by the Government will be responsible for monitoring or licensing the movement of hazardous waste and will be given specific new powers to control noise arising from any scheduled categories of development. This I welcome in particular, having urged the Minister some time back in this House to pay special attention to the increasing problem of noise pollution, not least in here.</P>
    <P>It seems that the general control and <Col N="1456" /> regulation powers which the Government intend giving to the EPA merits a welcome from all sides of this House rather than the back-handed dismissal which they received from Fine Gael.  I should have thought also that the proposals for general monitoring of environmental quality which are contained in the Government's plans for the EPA would have been welcomed.  I cannot understand their criticism of this.  In particular the EPA will be charged with responsibility for devising comprehensive programmes of air and water quality monitoring.  Having devised those programmes, they should be communicated to local authorities where monitoring should be ongoing in scheduled areas and the EPA should concentrate on these areas.</P>
    <P>In the area of water quality I would see the Environment Protection Agency, as proposed by the Government, as fulfilling a role which complements and extends the very valuable work being done by local authorities and in particular by the fisheries boards which is all too often ignored.  The fisheries boards themselves have been ignored.  They have expressed the fear in the last two years that they have been overshadowed by legislation. I welcomed in the pollution Bill last week the fact that that is not the case and I would hope that in putting forward proposals for the Environment Protection Agency, from this or any other side, we would be conscious of the merits of the work done by the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The Environment Protection Agency envisaged by the Government will also provide support and back-up services to other agencies, most notably to the local authorities and, as I have said, to the fisheries boards.  It is obvious that you cannot have the full laboratory back-up in local authorities.  This is an aspect which is dealt with in Deputy Shatter's Bill.  It is a good idea and one which commends itself to us all.  In addition, the Environment Protection Agency, as envisaged by the Government, will have a role in providing a general environmental advisory service which will be <Col N="1457" /> available not just to local authorities but to other bodies outside the public sector.</P>
    <P>A particularly welcome aspect of the Government's proposals is the expansion of the back-up laboratory and advisory service, possibly through a network of regional labs and offices, to local authorities. If this type of back-up service is to have any real impact it must be set up on a regional basis and be accessible to all local authorities.  The best way to ensure that this service is accessible to the local authorities is to decentralise it.  I do not think many Members of this House would disagree with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to concentrate all environmental research within the environmental protection agency, to give the new agency responsibility for co-ordinating such research by public and other bodies, including the universities, and to pinpoint the agency as the Irish contact point for the new European Environment Agency.  I do not understand why anybody would find that proposal objectionable.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the proposals which I do not think are objectionable, and I do not think any reasonable Member of this House would find them objectionable, but they have all been dismissed by Fine Gael.  These are all eminently sensible propositions, in particular the proposition to establish a central co-ordinating body on research.  I believe we all agree on this proposal.  This is a summary of the few major points in the Government's plans for this agency.  They certainly merit more consideration than they will evidently receive from the main Opposition parties.  I am not sure yet what The Workers' Party views on the proposals are but I hope they will be more constructive than some of those we have heard so far.</P>
    <P>A positive point in the Government's proposal for setting up an environmental protection agency relates to the board of the agency.  This is a welcome and new departure and should not be dismissed as it has been.  As the Government's press statement of 5 December outlined, and as the Minister of State made clear in her speech last night, a new form of full-time <Col N="1458" /> executive board for the Environment Protection Agency is under consideration by the Government.  They would operate in tandem with an advisory council representing various environmental, professional and other interests.  The Minister did not mention last night that local authority interests would be represented on a regional basis and I should like this aspect to be considered.</P>
    <P>On the whole I consider that this is a very admirable mix.  Clearly there is a limit to the amount of time any part-time board can give to their activities.  Indeed, it constantly amazes me that we entrust the stewardship of hundreds and even thousands of millions of pounds of State investment in the part-time boards of State-sponsored bodies.  It seems extraordinary to expect our State bodies to be governed and overseen in the first instance by part-time boards of directors. The new model outlined in the plans which have been released by the Minister and the Minister of State are worthy not just of commendation but of wider consideration as to how we structure the relationship between State bodies, this House and public administration generally.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last night Deputy Quinn asked why the Government must always be the ones to originate legislation and he referred to this point again tonight.  He asked why legislation brought forward by Members of the House other than the Government could not be looked on favourably.  I agree with him in principle because after all this is the Legislature for the State and it is wise that from time to time laws should be produced by Members of the House other than the Government.  However, before any legislation can be accepted by this House it must be good and well drafted. All too often in the past sloppily drafted legislation was brought forward which required amendment and collapsed on the first test of its constitutionality. Therefore, the first test of any legislation, whoever introduces it, is whether it is good and well drafted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill is not good and well drafted.  Moreover, to get wide <Col N="1459" /> acceptance the approach advocated in any Bill introduced into the House must be worthy of widescale acceptance. While the general aims of Deputy Shatter's Bill are endorsed by all sides of the House &mdash; they are certainly endorsed by this side of the House given that the Government included a specific proposal for the setting up of an Environment Protection Agency in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; the approach he has adopted is not commendable.  Rejection of this Bill is not, therefore, based on a reaction to the Bill but on the Bill's imperfections.  These are so numerous that the Bill is not capable of amendment and it lapses in totality.</P>
    <P>The first point I find unacceptable is that the Bill is drafted by a person or party who are clearly out of sympathy with the whole concept of local government. The contributions made by Deputy Shatter on behalf of Fine Gael and by Deputy Harney on behalf of the Government on this point provide an interesting and intriguing contrast in styles.  I would ask any party who have not yet committed themselves to this Bill to carefully review the styles of both contributions and to examine the attitudes of both the proposer of this Bill and the Government to local government.  Many worthy points are made about local government in this House and elsewhere and many people make proclamations about their support for local government but what really counts is how we support local government when it comes to a question of law.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Deputy shatter made a competent contribution but he was extraordinarily centralist.  This should not surprise anybody who pauses to think of the recent anti-local government ethos which was evident in pronouncements from Fine Gael.  It is odd that a spokesman on the environment should reflect so willingly on this anti-local government ethos.  I want to remind Members of the House that as far back as 1986 Fine Gael suggested that we should radically reduce vocational education committees.  In spite of the fact that VECs provide a local democratic input <Col N="1460" /> which is all too often missing elsewhere and that they have served this country well, Fine Gael proposed that they should be wiped away to meet a centralising whim of the then Minister for Education. The same approach is even more evident in the approach adopted by Deputy Yates to the health boards.  We all know that the health boards are not perfect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The type of State-sponsored body advocated by Yates is precisely what we do not need in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I think it is traditional when a Deputy is referring to another Deputy that he refers to him as &ldquo;Deputy Yates&rdquo; and not as &ldquo;Yates&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said Deputy Yates and I think everybody other than Deputy Shatter heard it, but there again the acoustics on that side of the House are notoriously bad.</P>
      <P>The same approach is evident in this Bill which is based on an authoritarian and centralist style which is unacceptable. The balance between local authorities and the new central agency which the Minister of State sought to establish for the Government side in her contribution and which is evident in the plans published by the Government for their EPA are conspicuously missing from Deputy Shatter's contribution and, more importantly, from the Bill he put before us.</P>
      <P>Another interesting institutional point which arises in Deputy Shatter's Bill is the suggestion in section 9 that the EPA and the commissioner shall be independent. I do not object to that proposal but I wonder what Deputy Shatter and Fine Gael mean by &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  Since we established our first State-sponsored bodies in the twenties, independence has meant independence of this House in so far as the day to day operations of a State body are concerned.  I wonder if Deputy Shatter and his party mean this.  If one examines the recent records of this House it is obvious that they do not.  At regular intervals in the recent past members of Deputy Shatter's party sought to ignore the concept of independence in the day to day operations of our State-sponsored bodies and to examine the details of those day to day operations in this House. Before Deputy Shatter or any other member of Fine Gael make proclamations of independence, they should be clear as to what precisely they mean by those proclamations.  We frequently toss the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo; around in the House.  When we incorporate it in an Act we should first make it clear what we mean by &ldquo;independence&rdquo; and we should then resolve to live by the decisions we have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter means to create an agency independent of the Minister for the Environment and, therefore, independent in its day to day operations of <Col N="1462" /> ministerial responsibility.  As a consequence it will be unfettered by the prospect of having its day to day operations reviewed in the House.  If that is what he means he should say so.  I suspect that the environment in general is such a pressing issue that Members would not willingly accept the creation of an agency which would put the day to day scrutiny of environmental matters or environmental protection outside the examination of the House.  Would, for example, Deputy Garland, who has been absent for the entirety of the debate on the Bill, or Deputy Quinn accept a situation where they could not debate in the House a day to day aspect of the environmental protection agency's operation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>Other criticisms of Deputy Shatter's Bill were dismissed as nit-picking, but I wonder if they are.  Careful balance between the Minister's responsibility for policy, the powers and role of the new agency and the continuing role of the local authorities, which are features of the Government's proposals, are <Col N="1463" /> conspicuously missing from the Fine Gael Bill.  The Bill, in addition to failing to establish this balance, failed to give the environmental protection agency any direct function in regard to licensing or control of individual plants.  That is what I mean by giving the agency teeth and that is what is proposed by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticisms which have been put forward are not nit-picking. They are issues of such fundamental importance that they render the Bill before us incapable of being saved by amendment.  The Minister of State is correct when she suggests that these imperfections are such that they strongly indicate that the drafter of the legislation has not fully thought through the proposals. Section 4 proposes the establishment of a joint committee on the environment and I think that is a good idea.  In fact, it is such a good idea that I wonder why it did not occur to Fine Gael when they were in Government. However, the Bill goes on to mar that good idea by suggesting, among other things, that the joint committee should have responsibility for the staffing of the environmental protection agency.  How could that work?</P>
      <P>The fact is that the environment is an issue which is of such critical importance that it should transcend political boundaries. Certainly, it should not be turned into a political football.  I regret that I have to deal with Deputy Shatter's proposals in such a negative way.  Sadly, the negative aspects of his proposals far outweigh their positive points.  I urge the Minister, and the Minister of State, to speed up the Government's proposals and to bring forward a Bill giving effect to the sensible suggestions made in their statement of 5 December.  It is important, as Deputy Quinn said, that those proposals be on the Statute Book at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the support of Deputy Shatter, and other Opposition Members, for the setting up of the environmental protection agency. However, it is difficult to understand the need for the publication of the Bill given that the Minister has outlined already particulars of the proposed agency.  The Government deserve great credit for the considerable efforts they have undertaken to raise public awareness about the affects of pollution.  The proposed agency is an indication of the Government's commitment and dedication to the protection of the environment.  All aspects of environmental pollution, air pollution, soil pollution and water pollution, are giving cause for great concern.</P>
      <P>There is now a well developed public consciousness that pollutants will have to be controlled and, eventually, eliminated. This problem must be tackled by education and legislation and we must have a proper monitoring system to ensure that adopted guidelines are adhered to.  The proposed agency &mdash; outlined by the Minister will have four main functions &mdash; control and regulation of development likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality; general monitoring of environmental quality; support and back-up advisory services and environmental research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed EC Directives will ensure that action is taken between neighbouring EC countries.  We must be vigilant to see that Ireland's special conditions are reflected in EC guidelines. Our soil types and rainfall must be taken into consideration.  For example, we apply a higher level of nitrogen and potassium, our moisture requirement is different from that of other Community regions and conditions in the Brussels area or the Paris basin differ from ours.  A dynamic environmental agency with the necessary expertise will ensure that proper guidelines are laid down.  It is because of the interaction between climate patterns and soil types that legislation guidelines must take account of our particular conditions. For example, we record a higher level of rainfall than other European countries. All those facts must be taken on board <Col N="1465" /> when the guidelines are being framed to comply with recent EC Directives.</P>
    <P>The late and great soil scientist, Dr. Tom Walshe, once said that there are many other purposes in fields outside agriculture for which basic soil information is a prerequisite.  That statement is of particular relevance today.  We are fortunate to have, as a result of Dr. Walshe's perception and foresight, an ongoing research programme at the Teagasc Research Institute in Johnstown Castle in County Wexford.  The centre offers a national survey programme, identifies and maps various soil types and provides a complete analytical service of major and minor elements that comprise the soil of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to call for close liaison between the Department of the Environment and the Johnstown Castle Research Centre in order to maximise the relevant expertise available.  In that way the new environmental monitoring agency will be an efficient, scientific and cost-effective organisation.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider locating the headquarters of that agency at Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Ireland's clean image abroad arises from a belief that our air, our soil and our waters are pollution free.  Those natural elements form the essential components of our agri-food industry which is so vital to our economic performance.  We must not leave anything undone to protect our envied status as a green and clean land. Our expanding tourist industry is also capitalising on our reputation as an environmentally friendly destination.  To maintain that image we must have an environmental policy that incorporates a monitoring system that will be effective, efficient and will enjoy the support and confidence of the general public.</P>
    <P>To date in developed and developing countries the safeguard of the environment has been entrusted to the population largely on a voluntary basis.  With increasing industrialisation, urbanisation and intensification of agriculture it is obvious that statutory control will have to be imposed by a proper environmental protection agency.  What is needed is a <Col N="1466" /> clear division of functions between the Department, the proposed agency and the local authorities.  Deputy Shatter's Bill fails to do that.  The Bill will lead to duplication and will give sweeping powers to an environment commissioner who could determine policy which should be the prerogative of the Minister of the day.  The Bill does not provide a mechanism to ensure that uniform high standards are consistently provided throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Shatter to await publication of the Government's Bill which will provide uniform application of standards.  The power to control major developments will be specified in legislation and not left to the agency to determine.  This Bill will create another layer of administration.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to join with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in congratulating Deputy Cullimore on making his maiden speech.</P>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I welcome the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter.  We are not entirely happy with some sections of the Bill and there are some omissions but these are problems which can be addressed on Committee Stage.  I am pleased that Deputy Shatter has shown a willingness to consider such amendments, assuming of course that this Bill gets beyond Second Stage.  The Workers' Party, therefore, will be supporting the proposal to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the negative position adopted by the Government on this Bill, as expressed by the Minister of State when she spoke in this House yesterday.  She said &ldquo;the important thing <Col N="1467" /> is to get the agency established as quickly as possible&rdquo;.  If this is so, why must we wait possibly for another 12 months and maybe longer before Government legislation is brought before this House to statutorily establish the agency?  Why not accept the Bill before us as a starting point, build on it and amend it but not throw it out?  Are we getting from the Minister of State, from the mould-breaking party, a classic example of old style adversarial politics?  This Bill has been moved by the Opposition so it must automatically be rejected, even if this means rejecting the clear wish of the general public to have the agency established.  I think the Minister of State will come to regret the position she has taken on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is now a consensus in the country, which is reflected in this House, that there should be an environment protection agency.  In addressing this Bill a number of questions must be asked.  Why do we need an environment protection agency?  What should it do?  How should it be structured and do its business?  To answer these questions we first need to understand what the environment is and where and from what it needs to be protected.</P>
    <P>Even though there has been a greatly increased public awareness of and concern for the environment in recent years it seems it has often been defined in a very narrow way.  Depending on the interest concerned, the environment may be regarded as the issue of polluation.  That in turn may relate to particular kinds of pollution, such as industrial or marine pollution.  In other cases the concern may be with the built environment.  Only rarely is public concern expressed about the social environment and the widening gap in the quality of the environment as experienced by rich and poor.  Indeed we are now beginning to see the commercial exploitation of environmental concern. The advertising people have discovered that &ldquo;green is good for you&rdquo; and that environment-friendly products open purses and wallets.  This of course in one way is a welcome measure of the success <Col N="1468" /> of the environment lobby but it can also lead to very unfriendly environment practices being dressed up in a green cloak. British Nuclear Fuels, for example, are now marketing nuclear power by emphasising their concern about the burning of fossil fuels and its consequences for the greenhouse effect.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that if the public have to rely on advertising agencies, public relations companies and on professional lobbyists for information on the environment we may get positions which may suit a particular commercial interest but which may not necessarily benefit the environment.  That is precisely why we need an independent environment protection agency, to provide information on which we can rely and which we know is not distorted by some vested interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter in his opening speech referred to the concept of sustainable development, defined in the Brundtland report, one I support and one which I feel needs to be teased out in the context of the Irish environment.  Unless we do so we risk the debate on the environment becoming dominated by environmental fundamentalists who reject economic growth and who, in some cases espouse a philosophy which is anti-human.</P>
    <P>Let us take the current debate on the chemical industry in Ireland.  Some people suggest that we should not have this industry at all.  What do they mean? Do they mean that pharmaceuticals should not be produced at all and, if so, what then is their position on the availability of modern medicines which relieve pain, prolong life and moderate suffering?  Are issues, such as infant mortality and life expectancy, of no concern to them or is it the argument that pharmaceuticals should be produced but not in Cork or anywhere else in Ireland &mdash; somewhere in the Third World perhaps? Where does that leave the one world concept and the challenge to think globally? Clearly, it will be necessary to continue to produce pharmaceutical products just as it will be necessary to continue to engage in more indigenous native industry which also generates waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> It will be necessary to continue to strike a balance between the need to provide employment and the need to protect the environment.  Indeed unemployment and now emigration are environment issues. We should look at any suburban housing estate in this city which has an unemployment rate of 50 per cent or more to see what that is doing to the social environment and to see how the lack of meaningful work undermines human dignity and how this in turn is reflected in social and environmental decay.  We should also look at what emigration is doing to rural villages.  No serious environmentalist can walk away from the issues of employment and emigration.</P>
    <P>We need, therefore, to have a comprehensive understanding of the environment and the kind of environment protection agency we establish should reflect this.  Unfortunately, the kind of agency being envisaged by the Government does no meet that criterion the Minister of State's statement emphasises the need for the agency to monitor and control industrial pollution and that its initial task will be to concentrate on new developments.  The Government's proposal for an environment protection agency amounts to no more than a public relations response to media reports on public concern about a small number of proposed industrial projects.  In the absence of an environment protection agency the public's concern about these projects is well justified, particularly when we see the record of some of the industry in the same area but it is taking too narrow a view of the environment to establish an agency solely in response to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's proposal to prioritise the functions of the agency and to talk about the assignment of additional functions for the agency on a phased basis is a disaster.  This will completely undermine the independence and authority of the agency and will make it no more than a kind of specialist wing of the Department of the Environment.  For the agency to be a success it must be able to take an overview of the environment and in that context to decide its own priorities, <Col N="1470" /> otherwise we could have the unsatisfactory position where the agency might be established but could not address a particular environmental issue because it had not yet been assigned that function. Public confidence in such a body would not last long.</P>
    <P>It seems that Deputy Shatter's Bill comes much closer to the kind of independent agency we need, one which will consider environmental issues in their total context and in which the public can have confidence.  For there to be well informed and serious public debate about the relationship between any form of economic activity and the environment we need independent information and, in that regard we need agencies of this kind. For local authorities or fishery boards to enforce the legislation we need the back up of the agency.  I agree with the approach in Deputy Shatter's Bill that the primary responsibility for enforcement and control should rest with the local authorities and that the agency should act as a back up and as a means of policing the local authorities.</P>
    <P>From whom, and from what, does the environment need to be protected?  We have a tendency to externalise the problems. In the past this House was often told that the British and Partition were the cause of our economic woes.  Today we have the green equivalent of that. Today the Taoiseach told us that Ireland's Presidency of the European Community would concentrate on the environment and make a major effort to formulate a comprehensive, coherent Community policy for the environment. All of the issues the Taoiseach identified are crucial and he should have the full support of the House in his efforts, but all of the issues are expressed in terms that suggest that the problems with the environment are out there somewhere &mdash; the hole over the Antartic, the deserts of Africa and the rain forests of South America.  Nowhere in the Taoiseach's speech does he reconcile his proposed environmental crusade in Europe with his neglect of the environment here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach welcomed the setting up of the European Environment Agency <Col N="1471" /> in 1990 while the Government are opposing the Bill currently before the House setting up an environmental protection agency here.  Over the next six months the Taoiseach will bring European leaders to a capital city which is choked on smog, to interest them in the warming of the earth's atmosphere and its implications for the world's low lying areas and for food production, as if we did not burn fossil fuels here at all.  The Taoiseach will press them to take effective action on immediate issues such as vehicle emissions, water standards, waste disposal and protection of wildlife, in a country where most people use leaded petrol and transport policy is based on the private car, where his Government have compromised on the Water Pollution Bill, where there is no national waste management plan and the incineration of toxic wastes is being given over to the private sector, where some local authorities are abandoning their responsibility to collect domestic refuse and as for the protection of wildlife, this is the country where our Government have allowed the shooting of the Greenland White Fronted Goose, for which we have an international responsibility, and only recently we were told that it will no longer be necessary to apply for a licence for the gassing of badgers.  A country which has not given legislative effect to the EC Directives on Environmental Impact Assessments will lead a Community crusade on the environment.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to issue press statements condemning Sellafield than for the Government to take the British Government to the European Court as promised, or to tackle the problem of low level radiological waste in this country.  Are we not great, talking about the destruction of tropical forests, while the fine for illegally felling a tree is still only a miserly £5.  I do not suggest that this country should not be concerned about global environment issues but I am arguing that we should not substitute rhetoric on those issues for action on the immediate threats to our environment.  As the Minister of State said last night, we need better <Col N="1472" /> arrangements for administering and enforcing codes and a more effective environmental control system.  That means taking on vested interests.</P>
    <P>I spent two days in Cork recently talking to residents' groups and industrialists. The biggest environmental concern here is with some of the existing industries from which smells are coming.  The main problem with new industry is that the people have no confidence in the system of monitoring.  The environment protection agency will be worthless if it does not tackle the problem caused by some of our existing industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency will have to challenge vested interests such as the coal industry which has frustrated the 1987 Air Pollution Act.  It will have to take on the IFA over agricultural pollution. Here, do I detect yet another Fine Gael surrender to the IFA lobby?  I would ask Deputy Shatter to explain what section 14 (2) of the Bill is about.  As I read it section 14 enables the environment commissioner to issue control orders in respect of contaminents, but section 14 (2) says that the provision does not apply to animal wastes disposed of in accordance with normal farming practices.  We know that a unit of milk is 400 times as polluting as a unit of untreated human sewage, that a unit of silage is 200 times as polluting and that a unit of slurry is 80 times as polluting.  How does one justify the exclusion of animal wastes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw Fine Gael's extraordinary performance last week on the Water Pollution Bill, I expressed the worry that Fine Gael's concern for the environment <Col N="1473" /> stopped at the farm gate.  Does this clause in this Bill confirm my fears?  It seems as if it is normal now for environment legislation going through this House to make concessions to vested interests.  The Air Pollution Act conceded to the coal industry and that is why we have the smog problem.  The Water Pollution Bill is conceding to the IFA and that is why we will continue to have fish kills.  The Building Control Bill this morning conceded to the building industry.  It would be a pity if Deputy Shatter's otherwise fine Bill were to be afflicted with the same handicap.</P>
    <P>If the environment protection agency and its work is going to be constrained by expedients and the need to make concessions to particular economic lobbies, it will never get public confidence and do the job needed.  Will it address the problems of the building environment? The destruction of Dublin was not caused by multi-national chemical companies but by home grown speculators charging around this city in their drive for profits. Bungalow blight and ribbon development is the product of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael section 4 motions on planning permissions. The appalling living conditions of many people in private rented accommodation come courtesy of our native landlords.  Will the environment protection agency address these environmental problems right here on our door step?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter already quoted the Brundtland report.  That report did not view the environment in isolation.  It placed it in a very clear social environment context.  It said that poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems and that it is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader prospective than encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.  That is just as valid in our national context.  We have to be clear that the environment protection agency, when established, does not surrender to vested interests, that where there is a conflict between the consumer, <Col N="1474" /> the public good and a particular commercial interest, it is not the vested interest that wins out.</P>
    <P>The Bill that has been proposed by Deputy Shatter has taken on board the precautionary principle.  That is something I welcome but there is another principle in environment protection that is not quite as clearly reflected in the Bill, and that is, that the polluter pays.  That principle cannot be exercised simply by catching polluters and fining them.  That principle has to take a view of the environment acknowledging that it is a publicly owned resource, that the water, the air and the soil are all resources that belong to the people and that any industry that propose to use any of those resources should pay for them.  That issue was addressed recently in the Pearse report in the UK.  That is an aspect of the Bill on which I intend to introduce some amendments if this Bill gets beyond Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Bill is not entirely clear relates to access to information. It is critically important not only that the agency is independent but that the work it does, the reports it produces and the information generated, are freely available to the public, so that the public can adopt an informed view on any environmental issue which arises.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the agency, I would have preferred if it had been a more representative agency being composed of representatives of different environmental interests.  One of the things that would greatly strengthen the independence and public confidence of the agency is if respected environmental organisations like An Taisce, Earthwatch or Greenpeace were represented on the board of the agency.  They could bring their own expertise and the information and skills which they have developed over the years to bear on the work of the agency.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Bill before us.  The Workers' Party will support it on Second Stage.  It could be improved in many areas.  It is a great pity the Government have decided to reject the Bill at <Col N="1475" /> this stage.  Deputy Roche talked about the cynical views that are often held outside this House about its workings.  The cynicism would be reduced if the Government took a positive approach to the Bill and instead of adopting the normal adversarial approach to issues in this House saw this Bill as the basis on which legislation could be enacted here which would establish statutorily the environment protection agency the general public are crying out for and which everybody agrees now should be established. As I said at the beginning I intend to share my time with Deputy Kemmy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time with me.  It is a generous gesture and I appreciate it.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate up to now.  Many words have been bandied about but the debate is timely, good and useful.  Let us hope its content will be studied far and wide outside this House because there have been important and very sincere contributions, not least the last one by Deputy Gilmore.  His was a very thought provoking contribution for anybody who has a fair mind.  Very many words have been used to describe the new body we need to protect our environment. The titles suggested included the words, agency, central agency, council, board and executive.  Call them what you will because words are not important in this context.  What is important is that we have an effective, independent body to see that our environment is protected. That is what the whole thing is about. Talk and good intentions are cheap.  We get a great deal of talk on this question but immediate action is called for.  The people best qualified should be appointed to serve on the new body, not just time servers, political hacks, yes men or yes women.  We have had enough of those in the past on various bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger to our environment is on all sides.  Not to put too fine a point on it, it is on the very doorstep of this House in this city.  Up to recently we as a people have shown a cavalier attitude to and <Col N="1476" /> little enough interest in the protection of our environment.  Improved living standards and increased industrialisation must not be achieved at the expense of our environment.  Economic growth and protection of our environment are compatible. There is no reason that the two should be mutually exclusive.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the environment must be looked at and defined in a wider context. You cannot just narrow it down to one or two items.  It has many parts, many components.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, we can start off with water.  Increased urbanisation, industrial development and more intensive farming have led to increased demands on our water supply on the one hand and increased water pollution on the other.  As a country we have been well served with an almost unlimited supply of water, fresh at that.  This very abundance of water has made us indifferent and careless in our attitude to water, our use of it and our respect for it.  We need constant vigilance in this area.  The year 1987 was the worse in terms of fish kills and flooding and this year was bad enough, too, with fish kills in my own county of Limerick doing away entirely with the stocks of two rivers.  It is a good thing this year was so dry, otherwise the run off of agricultural land would have resulted in far more fish kills.  We must ensure that we have proper water criteria and quality of the highest standard and that our rivers, lakes and sea are kept free of pollution, that our fishing waters are preserved and that swimming, boating and amenity areas and wildlife sanctuaries are protected and expanded for the recreation of our people.  We must ensure that our waterways are not made cesspools through industrial farming or radioactive waste or other such substances.  When I was a young boy in Limerick swimming pools were unheard of by people such as we.  We were glad to swim in the Shannon. It is a fine river, the greatest in these islands, but people can no longer swim in it because of pollution.  Despite the fact that it is tidal for a mile beyond Limerick, those, including young girls and boys, who cannot afford to go to the seaside or <Col N="1477" /> to use swimming pools, and who normally would swim in the Shannon can no longer do so because of pollution.  That is something we hear little about but we should be ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>Air pollution has been talked about for a number of years.  We know all about it here in Dublin but in Limerick recently we had foggy weather and the fog contained an element of smog.  I would not make sensational statements in this House but I am ashamed to say it is true. It was the first time we had smog in Limerick and we cannot be calm about it; it should not happen.  Air quality is now a matter of great urgency in this country and in this city, particularly.  We can be thankful that the prevailing winds &mdash; perhaps in Dublin we should call them providential winds &mdash; blow away the smog, otherwise the Government would have been greatly embarrassed by the smog here.  Everybody knows the danger posed to health and to life itself by smog in our cities.</P>
    <P>We do not hear too much about noise pollution but it exists for all that.  Engineers and road designers have a great obligation to ensure that roads are designed in a way that minimises noise pollution and that they are not built in residential areas where people are affected by noise.</P>
    <P>Another problem we hear nothing about is the noise from discos.  Perhaps I am somewhat old to talk about discos and disco music but the effect of such noise on young people's eardrums can be serious.  I am by no means a kill-joy but I do not see why it is necessary to play disco music so loudly.  It makes no sense.  I would like to see more attention given to this problem in this House and in our legislation enforcement.  In discos there is a great deal of noise and very little music. What music gets into that cacophony is a fugitive music drowned out by the heavy noise.  In my opinion disco music makes no contribution to culture or civilisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to industrial waste.  In the past 20 years we have seen changes in the amount and type of industrial waste.  This matter needs constant attention, monitoring and action.  Litter has not been referred to very much.  We <Col N="1478" /> need a massive intensive education programme to make our people conscious of the fact that litter is spoiling our cities, towns and countryside.  Television and schools could play a role in this.  Prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>As well as setting up this new body to protect our environment we need a national plan linked to Europe because without legislation from Europe we can do nothing to protect our environment. We can learn from the experience of other countries in Europe, especially from the mistakes that were made in Holland, a country which has suffered dreadfully from pollution in recent times.  As Deputy Gilmore said, people must have access to information on environmental matters.  Nobody, either the public or the private sector must be immune in this area.  Wealth should not be able to buy immunity if we set up a body who will have authority, independence and ability to take action.</P>
    <P>In the end responsibility will rest with the Government.  I am not worried about the name of the new body but they must be effective.  We must have action.  We have had enough words.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers have criticised Deputy Shatter's Bill.  Some people referred to flaws and imperfections.  The Bill is not perfect but Deputy Shatter has worked hard to put it before the House and he must be complimented on that. Deputy Gilmore has pointed to some flaws in the Bill and I agree with him. Farmers should not be left out.  The legislation should not stop at the farm gate. The farming lobby in this House is very strong particularly in the Fine Gael Party. I know Deputy Shatter is sensitive to the farming lobby.  I am not so sensitive to them.  There is no reason that we in this House should not point out some of those flaws.  I do so not in any vicious or critical way but in a supportive, helpful way. Whatever flaws the Bill may have and however imperfect it may be in the eyes of some Deputies, it is a genuine attempt to address the problem of pollution and to be constructive in making us aware of the need to set up a body which would <Col N="1479" /> be effective and independent.  For those reasons I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Bill is timely and I compliment Deputy Shatter on the opportunity he has given us.  Perhaps it is an effort by Deputy Shatter to take the limelight away from the efforts made by the Government to bring forward their own environmental protection agency as had been promised some time ago.  The Opposition may say their Bill is being brought forward because of the delay on the part of the Government.  I would not accept that. Deputy Gilmore says this is a Government response to media hype.  I do not agree.  It has been obvious for a number of years that the environment is under threat from within our own country and that Government and local authorities must do something to put the matter right.  It has been on the agenda for a considerable time and the bringing forward of legislation by the Government is to be welcomed.  It is primarily the responsibility of the Government to bring forward legislation.  It is all very well for the Opposition to bring forward legislation but ultimately the Government are the paymasters and they will have to judge, based on the resources available, how best the legislation can be framed and brought forward.</P>

      <P>Interim arrangements are to be made and the agency will be set up on a non-statutory basis.  This shows the haste with which they want to bring this matter forward.  This kind of basis has worked quite well in relation to a number of other agencies pending the implementation of legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore claimed that the agency might be a specialist wing of the Department of the Environment.  Having listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and read the statement issued recently by the Department, it is quite obvious that the board will be totally independent and based on the model of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Most of us would say the Director of Public Prosecutions is totally independent and some of us would claim he should be less independent and should be made to justify some of his actions.  If the agency is based on the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it will be fully independent.</P>
      <P>The advisory council suggested by the Government is novel in that professional people and environmentalists stating a particular view would be able to make recommendations to the board and to the Minister.  It would be advisable to have an independent person overlooking this.</P>

      <Col N="1481" /> Deputy Quinn referred to the fact that An Foras Forbartha have been abolished. The agency proposed is much broader than An Foras Forbartha ever were.  I was a member of a county council and with all due respect to the people working for An Foras Forbartha that organisation was not what I wanted as an advisory body for our county council.  An Foras Forbartha produced reports to which nobody ever listened.  They did not have teeth, which is probably one of the reasons they were done away with.  The Minister has outlined the various functions and controls of the agency, which are very important.  An advisory service would be necessary but there should be much better liaison with local authorities. My experience was that the local authorities were reluctant to become involved with An Foras Forbartha.  Perhaps there should be written into the legislation an onus on the agency to liaise on a constant basis with local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the import and export of waste.  This will be very important in the years to come.  While Sellafield is a major issue where I come from, we on the east coast suffer from a much greater problem, namely the discharge of sewage on both sides of the Irish Sea.  A figure of 450,000 tonnes of sludge are produced by us every year, most of which is discharged into the Irish Sea.  I live by the sea and I remember being able to swim there as a youngster. Many people would not do that now in the area where I live.  There is a particular problem in Dundalk Bay during the summer months when the tide is very low in that a very peculiar type of seaweed has formed which local fishermen say has never before manifested itself in the bay. The suspicion of qualified people with the local authorities is that the quality of the water in the bay is such that this seaweed has accumulated.  We have heard of problems in the Mediterranean but we also have problems on our own shores.  Quite apart from any protection agency, the Department must make a major investment, perhaps with the help of Structural Funds, in proper treatment plants, particularly along the east coast.  We have a <Col N="1482" /> number of fairly major treatment plants already but not enough.  Towns like Dundalk and Drogheda do not have a treatment plant and they are in effect pumping raw sewage into the sea.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will confirm that any treatment plant built in recent years or due to be built is merely a secondary plant, not a tertiary plant.  I understand there is only one tertiary plant in the country, which is in Killarney.  I suggest some thought should be given to making it obligatory to have tertiary sewage treatment plants in towns above a certain population.  I know the cost of such a plant is quite excessive, but if we are genuine in our desire to protect the environment it is vitally important that we insist that tertiary treatment plants be installed.</P>
    <P>The question of smog has been adverted to over the past number of weeks and years.  I am disappointed that everybody has homed in on the problem in Dublin, but other areas in the country are also suffering because of the smog problem.  Only last weekend in certain housing estates in my town the smog was as bad, if not worse, than it ever was in Dublin.  Indeed, I understand that across the Border in Newry they have a similar problem.  While I appreciate that Dublin because of its large population has a great problem, other areas, for example Cork or Limerick, suffer from the effects of smog and some provision should be made to deal with the problem in these areas. While the urban council in my town have a view on the smog problem, they have not the resources to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy was quite right to advert to the problem of litter.  In any literature emanating from either side of the House, there have been very few references to litter although I know it is covered by separate legislation.  Litter is a major problem.  It is a matter of educating our people not to throw litter.  Although various efforts have been made to educate them not to litter their environment, it still goes on.  The solution is in our own hands.  The word should go out from this House to the general public asking them to be less inclined to drop litter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> I think Deputy Kemmy's and Deputy Gilmore's references to farmers, and the IFA in particular, were slightly unfair.  I am not a defender of the farming lobby and I come from an urban area, but I have to be honest and say that most of the farmers I come in contact with are genuine and any accidents that occur are the result of carelessness or genuine mistakes. It is unfair to say that various lobbies are able to influence legislation, because I do not think they are.  The purpose of a Committee Stage is to put down amendments if we feel they are needed.  It is unfair of Members to state that vested interests have been able to influence the Government's position.  I do not accept that assertion.  The IFA and the farming bodies have made an effort over the years to educate farmers on how to dispose of effluent.  While mistakes have been made I believe the situation is getting better.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the discussion on the environment and the House will have to address this issue more often in the future.  I look forward to proposals being brought forward by the Government as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the entire environmental protection area and more specifically the question of establishing an independent environmental protection agency.  There is a growing awareness of environmental issues which has increased considerably in recent years.  There is now a far greater degree of public concern about proposed developments in the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential for harming the environment.  This in turn has had major implications for economic development, particularly industrial development.  In my area, Cork, there have been a number of controversies on this issue, we had the Merrel Dow saga in Killeagh and the Sandoz project which is under scrutiny at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What clearly emerged in these controversies was that the public at large, rightly or wrongly, had lost confidence in the ability of local authorities to monitor <Col N="1484" /> major industrial plants effectively.  This lack of confidence was widespread.  In addition, people also lacked confidence in the IDA's and other public agencies' ability to satisfy public concerns about the environment.  It emerged that the only way to restore confidence in our environment protection system was to establish a national independent protection agency with the necessary expertise and resources.  Such an agency would guarantee objectively in the assessment of any economic development which would threaten the environment.  In the Sandoz debate this was a key demand of people who expressed concern about the project.  A second demand was that the Government would comply with the EC Directive to carry out an environmental impact assessment.  I am happy that the Government are delivering very satisfactorily on both fronts and this has eased considerably the degree of public concern on the issue.</P>
    <P>In passing, let me pay tribute to the Sandoz company who have adopted a very open and professional approach in presenting their case to the community for locating their industry in Ringaskiddy. Eolas conducted a comprehensive environmental impact assessment study and Sandoz made themselves available to all groups who wished to meet them.  In addition, Sandoz's approach by the other chemical factories in the area, which is to the general good of industry in Cork.</P>
    <P>The fundamental point at issue is not whether we allow industry or chemical industries into the country but that we ensure that all industries have effective and satisfactory methods of treating and disposing of their hazardous waste and that we, in turn, have in place a watertight system of monitoring that process and enforcing the regulations.  As a country with high unemployment we simply cannot afford to place a moratorium on industry &mdash; I agree totally with Deputy Gilmore in this respect &mdash; as some people have advocated in recent debates.  In addition, it must be stressed that the chemical industry is not the only <Col N="1485" /> industry that produces hazardous waste. All forms of industry produce hazardous waste and to suggest a moratorium on one form is to open the door for similar action on other fronts.  What we must do is to guarantee effective monitoring of industry and the Government's proposed national environmental protection agency proposes to do just that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Harney's statement that it is necessary to separate the pollution control and regulatory functions of local authorities in relation to complex developments from this role in promoting the economic development of their area and the function of providing infra-structural services.  I think this is fundamental. There is an inevitable conflict of interests because local authorities want development and they want to improve their infrastructure, but in their desire to achieve these objectives they run the risk of subordinating environmental concerns.</P>
    <P>In Cork County Council for example, very few people can question the competence and integrity of the environment officials, particularly Mr. Ian McLean, the environmental officer who has earned a tremendous and outstanding reputation in his field.  However, this is only part of the overall structure and at times its preferences and ideas can be subordinated within the overall scheme in the county council.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with the Minister of State when she identified the need to work out a rational division of functions between the Minister, the agency and the local authorities.  Deputy Shatter's Bill is defective in this regard.  It is vitally important that the new agency should utilise existing resources in the universities and in the local authorities. There is a need to avoid duplication of effort and equipment.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been put to me from UCC that they, and indeed other third level institutions, could house the laboratories and equipment which the new agency would have at their disposal and, by doing this the agency, in tandem with providing an environmental protection <Col N="1486" /> service, would be providing better quality education for students in this field.  I know that in the chemical department of UCC new equipment is badly needed if up-to-date education is to be provided for students in this area.  Similar-type equipment would be required by the agency in the course of its duties.  I consider that this represents a constructive and economic use of available resources.   Indeed, I see no reason the national laboratory facilities proposed by the Minister in her speech could not be located at UCC. As Cork has a major concentration of pharmaceutical industry and likewise its hinterland is a major agricultural area, I think that Cork, and indeed the university, would be an ideal location for such facilities.  Likewise the regional facilities which are being advocated by the Minister in her Bill could be located in other agencies.</P>

      <P>We have debated this amendment at considerable length.  The focus of the House has been on it for a long time.  I would ask <Col N="1487" /> Deputy Farrelly to consider withdrawing the amendment.  As I pointed out to him there is sufficient flexibility within the specifications laid down in the section of the Bill dealing with the issue to allow for different ways and means of appointing the chief executive to be examined in detail at a later stage.  I know he is supportive of the measures we are introducing and I know he would not want this amendment to stand in the way of progress on the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed us that if this amendment was accepted it would be putting the chief executive in a straitjacket.  I would not like to think that the chief executive would be in a straitjacket or that anything I would propose would be associated with putting him in a straitjacket.  If he is the type of person who we all agree should be appointed, holding back is what I hope the Minister would be complaining about: he is moving so fast that one cannot keep up with him.  That is the type of dynamic person we would have and he will not be in any straitjacket.  Under section 5 I was concerned that he would be in a type of straitjacket.  As I have not been able to use my influence to change the mind of the Minister or his officials I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (8), line 3, to delete &ldquo;not be a member of the Board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be a non-voting member of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this amendment the chief executive would be a non-voting member of the board and would be available at the board meetings to take into consideration all the viewpoints raised by the members of the board.  When the new board is <Col N="1488" /> appointed their comments and ideas will be very important.  I expect a number of them to come from the grassroots as they are the people who are deeply involved in the industry not alone now but in past years.  I would like to think that the chief executive would gain a vast amount of experience and ideas from those people and to bring those and his own ideas to bear on the organisation, thus ensuring that we would have a coherent organisation run by the chairman of the board, with the chief executive being a non-voting member of that board.  That is my reason for the amendment and I would ask the Minister to be kind enough to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to agree with the last speaker on this amendment. I am sure I would find many other areas of agreement with him.  I find it extraordinary that a meeting would be held without a chief executive officer who would normally be in attendance at meetings of his board, as the principal officer to the board, and that it would be necessary for him to be a non-voting member of the board that he served.  He is a servant of the board, not a member of the board. To give him the status of a member of the board would put the board in an impossible position because he is there as their chief executive officer to carry out the policy decisions they make.  If we accept this amendment the whole idea of a chief executive officer would be standing on its head and we would no longer have a chief executive officer.  The chairman or somebody else would have to take over that role rather than the chief executive officer.  I would ask the Minister to explain in better detail than I have done to Deputy Farrelly the actual working position and ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go along with what Deputy Stagg has said and ask Deputy Farrelly to withdraw the amendment. The position is that the chief executive will be a servant of the board, but he will be in a position to make proposals at board meetings at board level.  I am trying <Col N="1489" /> to reach the logic of the amendment to see what exactly is in it.  The chief executive will reflect the decisions of the board and he will implement them via his secretarial and staffing personnel which would be available to him.  The fact that he will have the power to make proposals at board level gives him sufficient status at operational level for the board to ensure that there will be sufficient cohesion between his position and the decision-making process of the board proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister feels that the chief executive will have all these rights and availability to the board and if the Minister says that the system as it is known in other areas works, then I would have no hangup on his not being a voting member of the board.  If he attends the meetings he will ensure that the system works efficiently and that the wishes of the members of the board are carried out on the basis that he will be there to take note and, indeed, to advise.  Together they can bring forward the proposals which will be beneficial to the industry long term.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 13, paragraph 7 (a), line 41, to delete &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is not to change the overall numbers on the board but to change the composition of the ten members.  At present in the Bill it is broken up into two fives and I ask that it be reduced to four in each case.  The two remaining places arising from that should be filled by worker-representatives or directors to be appointed by an effective system to be devised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure a wider employee participation in the operation of the board.  Indeed, the Government have already made some progress in this area in other sectors of State interests.  Employees have an enormous contribution to make in defining policy as they have on-the-ground experience, are in touch with the work of the board every day and &mdash; in this case &mdash; will be familiar with the work of their producers and growers.  It would be foolish not to incorporate that experience and talent at board level.  I hope that eventually all economic activity will be determined by workers and consumers instead of the present system.  However, this amendment is not about attaining that long term goal as the Government would have a fundamental ideological difficulty in accepting it.  On the basis that it is simply to improve the board and to give them an expertise which will be missing without worker participation, the Minister, without any ideological difficulty &mdash; which I accept he might have with my overall position &mdash; could accept my proposal as this is already happening in areas under the control of other Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no ideological problem with Deputy Stagg's amendment. However, the problem is that the staff of the board will be relatively small as it will not be a huge, bureaucratic organisation. It would be unwise to accede to the provision in Deputy Stagg's amendment because of the very small number of staff involved.  The board level involvement of workers in other State organisations is an entirely different matter.  We are talking about a very small number of staff and, in those circumstances, we could not appoint people at board level.  Union representation will be more than adequate to look after the interests of those who are working with the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be a bit more forthcoming.  While I accept that there will be a small number of employees relative to other State bodies, will he give us an indication of how he might tap the expertise to which I referred and which will be missing from the board?  The specialised knowledge employees have will not be available immediately to the board.  Will the Minister have consultations on a regular basis, through staff organisations, to advise the board?  I have heard that this has occurred outside the structure of employee-directors in other areas where there is consultation and where workers can have a direct input without being board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a point which I cannot accept.  He said that because the staff was small, their interests would be looked after by the trade unions.  Surely that is not the spirit in which this amendment is tabled?  It is in the spirit of having across the board representations and for the purpose of promoting the objective of An Bord Glas, the development of our horticultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the concept of the board proposed in the Bill. Until such time as we see how this new development works, it would be wrong <Col N="1492" /> to agree to Deputy Stagg's amendment. Members of staff will be <i>au fait</i> with the board because of the officials who have been assigned to this work over the last few years and who have made a fair input to date.  They will also have a fair input to make in the future to the board.  We should get the best people available and this applies to any industry.  Of course, things can change and amendments can be made to the legislation but on this occasion, I agree with the Minister's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the composition of the board.  Having spoken to the people on the ground in the horticultural area of north county Dublin I know there is concern among them about the composition of the board because at the end of the day it will be comprised of nominees of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 7 (a) of the Schedule reads:</P>
      <P>(a) 5 (one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister) shall be persons engaged in, or having knowledge or experience (being knowledge or experience that the Minister considers appropriate for membership of the Board) ...</P>
      <P>That is fair enough because I have no doubt, bearing in mind the Minister's record, he will include people of proven ability on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to Deputy Stagg's amendment there is the feeling among the people engaged in the industry that they should have a say in proposing a member of the board other than a nominee of the Minister so that there be some participation by people working on the ground.  If one looks at paragraphs 7 (a) and (b) one sees that virtually all of the ten members will be nominated by the Minister.  Bearing in mind developments worldwide, and particularly in the semi-State sector here, I contend there should be worker participation.  Regrettably it appears the Minister will not accept Deputy Stagg's amendment but he should demonstrate somewhat more movement or flexibility to meet the legitimate needs of the people engaged in the industry on <Col N="1493" /> the ground.  That is the case as it has been represented to me anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that we will be more than anxious to get a representative board as distinct from a board of representatives.  That is fairly desirable in the case of any body.  It is important to appoint people who will have an input into the wellbeing and deliberations of the board on a continuous basis.</P>
      <P>When one examines the overall spectrum of horticulture the area Deputy Seán Ryan represents is relatively small when gauged against the whole of the industry in this country.  Yet there are many important segments whose representatives should have a say at board level.  Bearing in mind the relatively small number of staff involved &mdash; perhaps ten &mdash; when one examines the various sectors, such as mushrooms, glasshouses, potato growers, the processing people, wholesalers, multiples, all of whom will need to have a say at board level, because of the desirability to maintain the board small and compact, then it would not be desirable to have more members on An Bord Glas than on the board of Teagasc.  We must also bear in mind that much of their professional work &mdash; the educational, advisory and research aspects &mdash; will be catered for by Teagasc whose staff have an input in that body.  Bearing all of that in mind we should leave as many positions as possible available to primary producers, wholesalers, multiples or whoever at board level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could move further than he is doing to meet the case being made.  I think the Minister accepts the genuineness of the case we are making.  He must appoint a certain number of representatives to the board. I accept what he says, that those people must be of the best calibre.  Can the Minister not give the House some assurance that he will be able to find among the staff somebody suitably qualified.  I would even leave it to the Minister to find such a person rather than leaving it to the employees to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The purpose of my amendment is not to protect employees but rather to enhance the composition of the board, rendering it a better one, bringing the specialised knowledge of employees to bear at board level.  That is highly desirable. It is my understanding that, once the Bill is enacted, the Minister will have the requisite powers to do so without accepting my amendment.  If he can indicate that that would be his intention or that he would strive in that general direction I would be happy to reconsider my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a closed mind with regard to the selection of members of the board.  It would be my earnest desire to co-opt good people onto the board, people who have been successful in their sectoral activity, people who could articulate at board level the requirements of the industry so that their views can gel or maintain a balance in the overall decision-making process.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies that I will bear in mind the views they have expressed in the course of this debate.</P>

The day should be long past when perhaps up to 20 people could be chosen from the different sectors of horticulture when no doubt there would be a good chance of there being included some lame ducks. In successful businesses here it has been proven that one should pick men with the requisite business acumen.  I would appeal to the Minister to adhere to that practice on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest respect for Deputy Leonard's point of view.  He always speaks in a pertinent way on agricultural matters.  However, I might sound a note of warning that he is under threat of being reprimanded.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I spoke on this part of the Bill on Second Stage with regard to the content of the board. I made the point Deputy Leonard has just made, which is that the board should not be comprised of nominees of various interest groups within the horticultural sector.  Lo and behold, the county executive of Kildare IFA wrote to the Leader of my party objecting to my remarks saying that they were offensive.  Therefore, Deputy Leonard can expect a letter from the county executive of Kildare County IFA through the office of the Leader of his party who happens to be the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Of course the Deputy is right.  I suppose I am not being very modest but I contend I am in a fairly good position to adjudicate on matters like this <Col N="1496" /> since as Minister for Agriculture I had the task of selecting something like eight to ten boards.  By far the worst boards were those comprised of nominees of interest groups, such as farming organisations, various interest sectors of the agricultural industry in addition to other fringe or ancillary industries.  The best boards are those where the Minister chooses people who have a practical working knowledge of the subject in question.  This is definitely my view as to how the board could be constituted and I have no apologies to make to any body, association or interest group.  God help Ireland if Deputies cannot come into their Paraliament and express an honest view.  There are times when we embellish it with a little poetic licence and that is what we are here for but we are not here to be stuffed shirts.  We are here to express what we have to say, maybe not in as colourful a manner as Deputy Sheehan but in our own little way.  What Deputy Leonard said today and what I said previously, and the Minister went along with it in his summing up on Second Stage, is so correct that I hope that is what comes out at the end of the wash. The Minister should be his own man and not, as Deputy Leonard said, allow himself to be waited on by lame ducks.  There are some good people in the organisations but there are also some bad.  If the Minister wants the best people on the board he should pick them from those recommended by people who have an active interest in the industry and who have the interests of horticulture at heart.</P>

I am satisfied with the Minister's reply.  He has kept his options open as far as our amendment and its objective are concerned, that is, to consider the expertise available with the possibility of making one of his appointments from that group.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 3, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;such persons shall be chosen by the Minister after such consultation as he considers appropriate, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to take amendments Nos. 17 and 18 together.  A lot of ground has been covered so far as this area is concerned. What I am suggesting in amendment No. 17 is that such persons shall be chosen by the Minister after such consultation as he considers appropriate.  That is giving him a free hand to consult with whom he likes and to pick some of the best people who are available.  Amendment No. 18 proposes that five persons shall be chosen by the Minister after consultation with sections of the industry.  I do not want to tie the Minister's hands in any way, but I am just asking him to consult with the industry, which I am sure he will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By now, nearly three years into his lifetime in this Department, the Minister will no doubt be familiar with some, if not all, of the best people in the industry. I hope that, on the basis of these two amendments, he will be free to appoint the five people but I hope he picks the best people to represent the industry.  I know there has to be a balance: there will have to be some people from the retail industry because they too have an important role to play in the development of the industry and in ensuring that the products are properly produced and so on.  They <Col N="1498" /> are the last stop so far as the housewife is concerned.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendments in the spirit of goodwill in which they have been put down.  I hope the people he appoints to the board will be far thinking about what they would like to see achieved in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>To get back to what was said earlier <i>vis-á-vis</i> the chief executive, he should inspire the members and they should respond.  If there is such a combination of people on the board I have no doubt we will have an organisation that will work effectively.  I am recommending those two proposals to the Minister.</P>

I am certainly not going to suddenly close the door when it comes to this matter.  We have had meetings in this regard and obviously more meetings will take place. As I said when I was summing up on Second Stage, Deputy Deasy's contribution reflects his experience as Minister for Agriculture for nearly five years.  He knows exactly what is required with these boards and the sort of chemistry that is needed on them.  You need people who are practical and who know what they are doing in a particular area of activity. Most importantly, you need people who are uninhibited and who will make their input at board level with the long term interests of the industry they represent at heart.  As far as possible, that is the sort of approach we will adopt towards the selection of the board.  I would ask Deputy Farrelly to withdraw these amendments and to put his trust in me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 43 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had not started our discussion on this amendment the last day.  This amendment simply proposes that section 43 (1) of the Principal Act should be repealed. If this amendment is accepted it will mean the deletion in its entirety of section 5 of the Bill as presently drafted.  Like many of the amendments we have discussed on Committee Stage this amendment is on all fours with what has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission in their report.  Having reviewed the arguments for and against this provision and discussed alternatives the commission came to the conclusion that it would be better if section 43 (1) was done away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made this point on Second Stage and I understand that Fine Gael and the Labour Party made similar points.  We asked the Minister &mdash; I hope he is in a position to answer this question tonight &mdash; to give us some indication of the role this section has heretofore played in the prosecution of receiving offences.  If I recall the Minister's words correctly he indicated that this section was vital in the prosecution and pursuit of the receivers of stolen property.  I sought to counter that argument, borrowing from the limited experience I have as a practitioner, by saying that, after almost 15 years in practice in this area, I had hardly come across one instance when this provision had been availed of.  If my experience was a reflection on the use of this provision I wondered how the Minister could consider that this provision, which provides <Col N="1501" /> that the past record of an accused can be called in aid of the prosecution in proving knowledge and intent, could be described as a vital aspect of the armoury of prosecution.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons this provision was so rarely if ever employed by prosecutions was that it had a huge constitutional question hanging over it.  It is prudent for any prosecutor, director or member of the Garda Síochána in presenting a case to consider the prospects of walking into a mire of uncertainty, if one can call it that, of constitutional challenge to proof if the provision is relied upon and used, particularly in the wake of the King case.  I think it was a prudent decision on their part to stay out of troubled waters and simply rely on the facts presented by the arresting officer.</P>
    <P>Including this provision in the modified form proposed by the Minister will leave the same ambiguity and uncertainty about the future of the new section 5.  For that reason I do not believe it will be borrowed upon at all in the future prosecution of this type of offence.  The provision should abandoned at this stage. The most compelling reason we should not rely on this provision is the decision given by the High and Supreme Courts in the case of King <i>versus</i> the Director of Public Prosecutions where the Supreme Court reiterated the fundamental principle of criminal law that the character of an accused should never be called in aid of the prosecution in attempting to establish the factor of guilt in a trial.  This provision basically allows the Garda at the trial of an accused to seek to put in as evidence a fact of a conviction within a specified period in advance of a trial where it is sought to use that proof of fact in establishing knowledge, guilt and intent.  It is clear that this involves putting the character of an accused person at issue.  There is absolutely no doubt that the Supreme Court would have very grave reservations about such a provision if asked to adjudicate upon it.  The reason they have not had to do this to date is <Col N="1502" /> that the Garda as a matter of prudence in the prosecution and earnest pursuit of a receiver have not sought or elected to put themselves in the position where they might have a good conviction thrown into doubt.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister is again ignoring the clear and unambiguous advice of the Law Reform Commission who believe that this provision should be repealed.  I have argued both on Second Stage and Committee Stage that we should be firm in our resolution in terms of pursuing the handler, the man behind the scene of crime.  By including this provision in the Bill the Minister is again introducing a potential constitutional loophole which could be exploited by a successful defendant or a person who wishes to pursue this constitutional ambiguity. Because this provision has not been of practical aid in the prosecution of such cases in the past and will not in the future, the Minister should simply acknowledge the wisdom of the commission and all parties in Opposition and let this matter rest at this stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to unduly repeat the arguments which have been very well made by Deputy McCartan in favour of this amendment.  Our amendment simply proposes the deletion of section 43 (1) of the Principal Act.  This section has been very rarely used and it is considered by the Law Reform Commission to be constitutionally unsound. For these very good reasons it seems to me, and obviously to Deputy McCartan, that this provision should not be amended in the way proposed by the Minister. Therefore, we suggest that, because the Law Reform Commission and the eminent authors of that document have strongly advised that this provision should be repealed the Minister should take that advice and repeal the section rather than amend it.  I will be interested in what the Minister has to say.  I wonder if he will say that the Law Reform Commission erred in their advice.  Has he a <Col N="1503" /> reason, other than that contained in the explanatory memorandum, for proceeding with this provision?  The argument in favour of my amendment has been well made and there is no need to repeat it.  The section should be repealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend repeating the arguments made by my colleagues in Opposition.  We had a full discussion on section 5 on Second Stage when members of the Opposition parties suggested that an amendment along the lines of that put forward by Deputies Kavanagh and McCartan should be adopted by the House.  The Minister in introducing the Bill said he was satisfied that evidence of this type had been vital in the past in helping to establish the <i>mens rea</i> of the accused in cases where it might otherwise have been impossible to do so.  Having listened to the Minister I asked him if he intended to retain that section and if he was in a position to provide evidence of when that provision had been used in the past.</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties have put forward arguments against retaining that section.  The Minister should not ignore the advice of the Law Reform Commission. I should like to impress upon him the views of the commission in regard to this.  They stated that in the light of certain misgivings they did not recommend an expansion of section 43 (1). Indeed, the Law Reform Commission pointed out, as Deputy McCartan did, that the section was rarely used.</P>
      <P>I join with other Opposition Members in appealing to the Minister to leave that section out of the Bill because too many question marks hang over it.  Perhaps the fact that my constituency colleague will be responding for the Minister will make a difference.  No compelling argument has been advanced for carrying the section into the Bill.  If the Minister is not in a position to show where the vital evidence has been successful in the past he should withdraw the section.</P>

      <P>The case has been well made by my colleagues.  In all our deliberations the Constitution must be the bedrock on which we build all our legislation.  We cannot fly in the face of the letter and spirit of the Constitution. We are irresponsible as legislators if we so do.  The case has been made by my colleagues in relation to the unconstitutionality of the old section 43 and I fear that the attempts made by the Minister to improve that section so as to bring it within the terms of the Constitution have not been successful.</P>
      <P>I have taken some advice from leading criminal lawyers on the section largely because of my concern that we should observe the letter of the Constitution.  It has been made clear to me that section 5 as it stands, or the old section 43, are almost certainly unconstitutional.  The concept of the shield which can only be dropped by the accused by deliberate acts in the course of his trial is fundamental to our criminal jurisprudence.  Furthermore, as mentioned by Deputy McCartan, criminal law experts say that the old section 43 was never used because of doubts on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and prosecuting counsel generally, that it would not stand up.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made a relevant point when he stated that guilty people whose guilt could be proved otherwise might get away if the section is used by the prosecution.  We do not want that to happen.  The Minister has received all the advice from the legal experts and, of equal importance, has had the advice of the Law Reform Commission.  They are categorical in what they said.  They have made it clear that there is a reasonable doubt about the constitutional propriety of the old section 43.  I have no doubt that, despite the amendments made under the new section 5, those constitutional doubts remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission must feel very aggrieved at the way the Bill has gone.  They carried out tremendous <Col N="1505" /> research and did a lot of work to reform the law.  Let us be honest and say that their recommendations have been virtually ignored by the Government.  They might as well have thrown the report out the window as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the decisions in regard to the other sections it is important to point out that in dealing with the most serious area of law we are talking about flying in the face of the Constitution. The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in that regard must not be ignored.  I welcome the Minister of State to this debate and I should like to point out to him that he is faced with the united voice of the Opposition who are concerned about upholding the Constitution. I am sure the Minister holds a similar view to ours.  He should accept our amendment and delete this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, section 43 (1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, permits the giving, in receiving cases, of evidence that other property stolen within the 12 months preceding the offence charged was found or had been in the accused's possession, and of evidence of previous convictions for any offence involving fraud or dishonesty within the previous five years.  Such evidence may be given only for the purpose of proving guilty knowledge.  There is a requirement that seven days' notice must be served on the accused of the intention to adduce evidence of previous convictions, and such evidence may not be adduced unless the court has already been given evidence of the stolen property, the subject of the charge, having been, or been found in, the accused's possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is one of the exceptions to the general rule that evidence of the accused's previous misconduct or convictions may not be adduced during the course of a trial, and its use is subject to the overriding discretion of the trial judge <Col N="1506" /> to rule it out on the basis that its prejudicial effect would outweigh its probative value in a particular case.</P>
    <P>The replacement for section 43 (1) proposed in the Bill would re-enact that provision but with certain important safeguards for the protection of the accused.  These are as follows.</P>
    <P>The adduction of evidence of previous possession and previous convictions will be confined under the new provision to cases where the only charges on which the accused is being tried are for handling or receiving offences.  Thus a person being tried for stealing and, in the alternative, handling, or for handling and, say, resisting arrest or obstructing the Garda, could not have such evidence adduced against him.  This contrasts with the present position where such evidence may in theory, at least be brought in once receiving is one of any combination of charges for which the accused is being tried, even though it was held in an English case, when the 1916 Act was still in force there, that that should not be done.  Where evidence of previous possession or previous convictions is given under the new provision, the only offence of which the accused may be found guilty will be that of handling or receiving.  This contrasts with the present position where the accused may, after such evidence has been given, be convicted on any of the charges for which he was tried &mdash; even though he might be acquitted of the receiving offence itself.  An important effect of this safeguard is that where such evidence is adduced in accordance with this provision, the power under section 8 of the Bill to find a person charged with handling guilty of larceny etc. cannot be exercised.</P>
    <P>Before evidence of either previous possession or previous convictions may be adduced, it will be necessary to have given evidence of the accused having, or arranging to have, in his possession the property the subject of the charge, or of his having done any of the other things which would constitute a handling offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> This is provided for in subsection (IA) of the new provision.  At present this restriction applies only to evidence of previous convictions; evidence of previous possession of stolen property may be given at any stage in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The range of offences for which evidence may be given of previous convictions is narrowed considerably from the existing &ldquo;any offence involving fraud or dishonesty&rdquo; to &ldquo;any offence of larceny, receiving stolen property or handling stolen property&rdquo;.  Thus it will not &mdash; unlike under present law &mdash; be possible to give evidence of, say, a conviction for making a false tax return.</P>
    <P>The existing requirement of seven days notice to the accused of the intention to give evidence of previous convictions is restated at subsection (IB) of the new provision.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, when reviewing the existing law in their report, said of this section that there were doubts as to the constitutional propriety of the present section 43 (1) of the 1916 Act.  In the light of those misgivings, they did not recommend any expansion of the provision, and in consequence of their view that it is rarely relied on in receiving cases, they recommend its repeal.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for the Law Reform Commission's view.  However, it would be a pity to let the occasion pass without giving the House an opportunity to consider another approach to the matter which it may feel is more appropriate in the circumstances.  First, whatever doubts may exist as to the constitutionality of the present provision &mdash; doubts as yet untested in our courts &mdash; they are, arguably, amply assuaged by the safeguards proposed in the Bill.  Secondly, the Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated in discussions during the development of this Bill that he would find useful a provision even of the curtailed and restricted nature proposed here, as an aid in showing that the accused had guilty knowledge or belief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> Arguments can be made in favour of the new section.  There is a general principle of evidence that the prosecution may not adduce evidence during the course of a trial of an accused's criminal disposition and this principle is subject to very few exceptions.  There is a general exception at common law, referred to as similar fact evidence.  Furthermore, in some cases it is inevitable that the accused's other misconduct has to be made known to the courts, for example, if he or she has committed an offence while in prison or if proof of an earlier conviction constitutes an element of the offence charged, such as, for example, driving while disqualified.</P>
    <P>A further point which should be made is that the trial judge always has discretion to exclude evidence of the type in question where he or she considers that its prejudicial effect on the accused would outweight its probative value.  The underlying philosophy behind section 43 is that in receiving cases in particular the accused's behaviour in relation to other incidents provides a useful indication as to his state of mind in relation to the offence charged.  If he is charged with handling stolen property, the fact that he had handled other hot property at the same time or on another occasion is thought to provide a valuable clue as to his guilty knowledge in relation to the property that is the subject of the charge. The point is the improbability of coincidence of someone within a relatively short period unwittingly handling stolen property more than once.  The old saying is that lightning does not normally strike in the same place twice.</P>

      <P>I am glad that all sides of the argument have been ventilated in this debate.  While it is worth considering this provision it is not one in keeping with the principle of the Bill on which all of us are agreed.  It is clear that the House <Col N="1509" /> is in favour of accepting the amendment. I have no difficulty in principle with that.  I will take advice between now and Report Stage to see how best we can ensure that section 43 (1) will have no further effect and whether it is possible to organise matters so that it will cease to have effect immediately and not be subject to the three month interval provided for in section 13 of the Bill.  I hope I have explained the position clearly.  I would like to be as helpful as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for a very comprehensive and detailed response to the amendment and I am glad it is a matter he is putting before the House in an effort to allow us tease out the issues surrounding it to see if there are alternatives and so that we can come back to it on Report Stage.  I have no difficulty with that, but I would make one or two points.  First, the Minister for Justice in his Second Stage contribution said he had no difficulty agreeing with the commission that the provision as it stands may go too far in that it might tend to prejudice the rights of the accused.  There is universal agreement even at the Minister's desk that there are problems with regard to creating prejudice, unfairness and unconstitutionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said he was satisfied that evidence of this type has been vital in the past in helping to establish the <i>mens rea</i> of the accused in cases where it might otherwise have been impossible to do so.  Will the Minister advise us on that so that I am better armed, lest we come back to this on Report Stage and I do not know the position?  Is it possible from the statistics available to establish to what extent the existing provision has been relied upon in the past?  I know, for example, that the Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted, and made submissions to the Commission about the range of the offence; and I have no doubt, as the Minister confirmed, that this issue was addressed by him and that the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the view <Col N="1510" /> that it would be a useful provision to have, even in the modified version presented in the Bill.  Did the Director of Public Prosecutions give the commission any statistics to indicate how often he directed this provision to be relied upon during his term of office since its establishment in 1974?  Is there anything there to put flesh on the Minister's statement that it has been a vital element available to the Director in the past?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that protections that did not previously exist are available in the section.  There are three basically, and rather than go into them now, I would make the general point that those protections are not everything the Minister makes them out to be and they would not represent a strong and as heavy a counterbalance against the unfairness element and the constitutional element that must be involved in this.  There is a fundamental element here.  Is it constitutionally proper to introduce evidence of the character of the accused in the circumstances allowed for under the existing law and repeated in substance in the Bill?  The Minister of State talked about exceptions but let us remember that as a general rule that is not proper.  The exceptions do not in any way compare with the exception the Minister is seeking to repeat in the Bill. The law is far closer to what was addressed by the Supreme Court in the King case on the vagrancy issue.  There it was felt that the law as it stood since 1824 was not an exception, that it should be supported and continued and they struck it down.  Those principles could be easily applied to this situation.</P>
    <P>I am most disturbed with the Minister's reason for this provision.  It is well worth ventilating the essence of the issue.  The fact that a person has received property previously cannot and should not be of any assistance in attempting to establish a fact in a current trial.  Is it to be argued that a person who has previously committed an assault, who in a current trial <Col N="1511" /> seeks to suggest justification or self-defence, should be presented with a proof of the prosecution being that the members of the jury should not listen to the defence being advanced in this case because the defendant previously offended in the same way and for that reason has a propensity to commit assaults?  In a current larceny trial are we to suggest that a person standing trial will be faced with evidence that because he was convicted of shoplifting before, his defence that he forgot or inadvertently took an article out of a shop, must be disbelieved?  There is no end to the argument and to the destruction of the criminal code of law as we know it if one pins one's argument to the last argument advanced.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister because that is the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the rule as incorporated in the 1916 Act.  I would simply say that this Bill will be immensely improved by the deletion of the provision. I urge the Minister to take that point on board before Report Stage as opposed to any suggestion that this rule can be modified and made good for future use.</P>

      <P>I would like full clarification from the Minister.  As I understand it the Minister now indicates that while he thought the point should have been fully debated, he largely accepts the view of the Opposition on the constitutional query with regard to this section. Do I take it then that on that basis the Minister is suggesting that between now and Report Stage he will effect the necessary proposal to amend the Bill as he thinks proper, taking into account the time limit factor and that we have a virtual guarantee from him that on Report Stage this provision about which we are so concerned will be removed from the Bill?  Can we put our weapons away in regard to this section on the basis that the Minister has largely accepted the Opposition's viewpoint?</P>

      <P>I listened to what the Minister said as did Deputy O'Keeffe.  I understood the Minister to say that this section is going to be carefully examined between now and Report Stage, the constitutional aspect of the section will be gone into in detail and we cannot say for definite whether the section is going to be removed.  The arguments that were advanced here tonight will be considered fully and if the Minister feels deletion of the section is necessary I am sure he will act accordingly but there is no guarantee about that here tonight.</P>
      <P>We are debating amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy McCartan which seeks to repeal section 43 of the Larceny Act, 1916.  The Fine Gael approach is simply to oppose the section.  I take it there is unanimity among the Opposition on this.  Even though Deputy Kavanagh has nothing here in his name alone I take it from his reaction that he supports the general approach of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, there is a considerable difference between this section 5 and section 43 of the 1916 Act under which evidence could previously be given of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty that was committed within five years of the alleged offence for which the person was being prosecuted.  Under this section the only evidence that can be given is evidence of specific types of offence which are outlined in the section. I raised the point on Second Stage as to whether, in view of the fact that there is now a new <i>mens rea</i> for larceny, this section was necessary any longer.  I am inclined to have some sympathy with the Opposition's approach here.  I am inclined to think that on balance perhaps it is not necessary to include this section, but I am prepared to take on board the Minister's suggestion that the matter be gone into in detail within the Department to see if it is necessary to retain this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan raised the question of statistics, of how often this section had been used.  I cannot anticipate the <Col N="1513" /> Minister's reply but I suspect the reply will be that there are no such statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan will be aware from his practical experience that section 43 has not been used very often. That is my experience also.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the King case and I want to quote from the Law Reform Commission's report, page 40, paragraph 53:</P>
      <P>
        <i>King</i> accordingly, cannot be regarded as authority for a general proposition that any law permitting the introduction of evidence of previous convictions of the accused, except in relation to sentencing, offends the constitutional guarantees of a trial in due course of law and of fair procedures in such such trials.  It is, moreover, a feature of <i>King</i> that the impugned section renders the previous convictions one of the ingredients of the offence.  In the section under consideration,</P>
      <P>&mdash;section 43&mdash;</P>
      <P>the introduction of the evidence is permitted solely for the purpose of establishing guilty knowledge.  All that can safely be said, at present, is that <i>King</i> at least raises a doubt as to the constitutional propriety of the section which must be borne in mind when considering its retention in our law and, <i>a fortiori,</i> its possible extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into the facts, of the judgement of the King case, the unanimous conclusion of the Law Reform Commission was that the King case is by no means authority for the proposition that section 43, much less the watered down section 5 of this Bill, is unconstitutional or vulnerable to constitutional challenge.  Nevertheless, I come back to the earlier point I made, whether in view of the change in the <i>mens rea</i> provision <Col N="1514" /> necessary to establish an offence under this legislation the section should be continued in force.</P>
    <P>I want to make one further point and I think the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, adverted to this.  The statutory provisions to some extent supplement the common law.  There is a rule of evidence known as the similar facts rule of admissibility which would allow evidence of handling earlier then 12 months before the alleged offence.  Even though this is less likely now it might in certain circumstances allow the admission of convictions of theft more than five years before the alleged offence.  Section 5 applies certain restrictions to this; it applies certain limitations.  If the Government's intention is to retain this section in the Bill I would like to pose a few questions to the Minister.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate for him to respond on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>First, under section 5 as I read it the <i>actus reus,</i> the fact of handling has to be proved before the evidence is admitted. Will that continue to be the position where this evidence is admitted in future at common law?  Will these statutory restrictions which have been brought in here under section 5 apply when evidence which could be admitted under the Statute is admitted in future at common law because of the similar facts rule?</P>
    <P>I want to address one further question to the Minister.  I think the answer can be found in the text of section 5 but I am not quite clear on what it means.  There is a case quoted in the Law Reform Commission's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) In any criminal proceedings taken under this Act a statement contained in a document shall, subject to this section, be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence would be admissible, if:</P>
      <P>(a)  the document was compiled by a person acting under a duty from information which was supplied by a person acting under a duty who had, or may reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the matters dealt with in that information and which, if not supplied by that person to the compiler of the document directly, was supplied by him to the compiler of the document indirectly through one or more intermediaries each acting under a duty; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the conditions specified in subsection (2) below are satisfied as regards each of the following: the person who originally supplied the information, the person who compiled the document and any intermediaries through whom the information was supplied.</P>
      <P>(2) The conditions referred to in subsection (1) (b) above are the following, namely:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that the person in question has <Col N="1518" /> been or is to be called as a witness in the proceedings; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that the person in question, being competent to give evidence on behalf of the party desiring to give the statement in evidence, refuses to give evidence on behalf of that party; or</P>
    <P>(c)  that it is shown with respect of the person in question:</P>
    <P>(i)  that he is dead or is unfit by reason of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  that he is outside the State and that it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  that all reasonable steps have been taken to identify him, but that he cannot be identified; or</P>
    <P>(iv)  that, his identity being known, all reasonable steps have been taken to find him, but that he cannot be found, or</P>
    <P>(v)  that, having regard to the time which has elapsed since he supplied the information and to all the circumstances, he cannot reasonably be expected to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the statement.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) No statement shall be admissible in evidence by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) until the completion of the examination in chief of all witnesses to which the paragraph is applicable, except by leave of the court.</P>
    <P>(b) Where by virtue of leave given pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection a statement has been received in evidence on the footing that any person or persons shall be called as a witness in the proceedings, then, if any such person is <Col N="1519" /> not subsequently so called the statement shall not be admissible by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) and (unless it is or becomes admissible otherwise than by virtue of that paragraph) shall be disregarded accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a document setting out the evidence which a person could be expected to give as a witness has been prepared for the purpose of any pending or contemplated proceedings, whether civil or criminal, and that document falls within subsection (1) (a) above, then in any criminal proceedings in which that person has been or is to be called as a witness a statement contained in that document shall not be given in evidence by virtue of subsection (2) (a) or (c) (v) above without the leave of the court; and the court shall not give leave under this subsection in respect of any such statement unless it is of the opinion that, in the particular circumstances in which that leave is sought, it is in the interests of justice for the witness' oral evidence to be supplemented by the reception of that statement or for the statement to be received as evidence of any matter about which he is unable or unwilling to give oral evidence.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where, in any proceeding, a statement is given in evidence by virtue of this section, there may be given in relation to any person who compiled a document containing the statement, or who supplied information to that compiler, including any intermediary, and is not called as a witness&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any evidence which, if that person had been so called, would be admissible for the purpose of destroying or supporting his credibility as a witness;</P>
    <P>(b)  with the leave of the court, any evidence which, if that person had been called, could have been put <Col N="1520" /> to him for the purpose of destroying his credibility as a witness, being a matter of which, if he had denied it, evidence could not have been adduced by the cross-examining party.</P>
    <P>(6)  A statement which is admissible by virtue of this section shall not be capable of corroborating evidence given by any person who compiled the document or supplied any information contained in it, including an intermediary through whom such information was supplied.</P>
    <P>(7)  In deciding for the purposes of this section whether or not a person is fit to attend as a witness, a court may act on a certificate purporting to be a certificate of a duly registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>(8)  For the purposes of this section, a duty includes a duty which is not legal or contractual.</P>
    <P>(9) In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section, regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and in particular to the question whether or not any person who originally supplied the information from which the document was compiled did so contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts dealt with in that information, and to the question whether or not any such person or any person concerned with compiling or keeping the document containing the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.</P>
    <P>(10)  A statement shall not be given in evidence by virtue of this section (without the leave of the court) unless, at least fourteen days before the trial, a notice is served on each of the other parties to the proceedings stating the <Col N="1521" /> grounds on which it is claimed that the statement is admissible and the evidence to be given in support of this claim and having attached there to a copy of the document containing the statement.</P>
    <P>(11)  The court may give leave to give in evidence a statement admissible by virtue of this section notwithstanding the fact that notice has not been given in accordance with the last preceding subsection if the other parties to the proceedings have not been prejudiced by the lack of notice or it has resulted from factors outside the control of the party wishing to give the statement in evidence.</P>
    <P>(12)  Service of any notice pursuant to subsection (10) hereof shall be by prepaid registered post to the home of the accused if he is not represented and to the offices of his solicitor if he is represented.</P>
    <P>(13)  Where in any proceedings a statement contained in a document is admissible by virtue of this section it may be proved by the production of that document or (whether or not that document is still in existence) by the production of a copy of that document or of the material part thereof authenticated in such manner as the court may approve.</P>
    <P>(14)  For the purpose of deciding whether or not a statement is admissible in evidence by virtue of this section, the court may draw any reasonable inference from the circumstances in which the statement was made or otherwise came into being or from any other circumstances, including the form and contents of the document in which the statement is contained.</P>

      <P>This is on the face of it a very substantial amendment which runs to almost three-and-a-half pages on the amendment list and proposes to insert a further section.  Imposing though it appears, it addresses a very simple issue. This cumbersome draft amendment is nothing to do with me.  I have borrowed it almost in its entirety from the Law Reform Commission's report.  There is no shorter cut to take.</P>
      <P>The amendment addresses the issues raised by the famous Myers judgment in Britain in the sixties.  It is a fact of life that manufacturing industry at all levels, retailing, warehousing and wholesaling, is conducted in a modern, electronically-controlled way.  The Myers case related to car assembly where the worker on the floor has virtually disappeared.  Robot machines which are computer-controlled are used in manufacturing production throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical problem relates to proof of ownership.  When an item is produced in a factory, delivered to a warehouse, stored, delivered on to the wholesaler and from there to the retailer and ultimately into the house of an owner, it is <Col N="1524" /> logged by document, number and computer record.  If ever the issue of ownership has to be decided, under the existing law every person along the line can in some circumstances be required to prove the manufacture, the delivery, the warehousing, the retailing etc.  Clearly that is a cumbersome and unnecessarily intricate procedure.  The judgement in the Myers case indicated that, as a matter of law and proof, continuity would have to be maintained.  The English Legislature promptly responded and brought in amending legislation to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are proposing an amendment to our law to bring us into line with the legislative response in Britain to the problem exposed in the Myers case.  This is what my amendment seeks to do.  Our law must keep abreast of change in the Community.  The section provides a régime which I believe will cover all eventualities and provide a simple way of proving ownership.</P>
    <P>I was reading today the report of a trial concluded yesterday in the Special Criminal Court.  The officer prosecuting is a very fine member of the Garda Síochána who has been speedily promoted to the position of detective superintendent in the Dundalk area.  He reminded me of a case in which I was involved ten or fifteen years ago when he was the investigating officer in Naas.  The case involved the theft and receiving of trailers made by a reputable company.  The officer in question had to travel the length and breadth of Ireland to interview about 19 separate witnesses in order to establish the proper provenance and origins of the trailer involved, partly because it did not carry a registration or manufacturing mark which could be traced back.  The report of this case reminded me of the complexities which can be put on the shoulders of the prosecution in attempting to find proof when it could otherwise be a simple matter of extracting computer records or manufacturing files giving the relevant information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> There is a perennial problem in regard to receiving goods, particularly electronic goods and goods of mass manufacture where the immediate owner has not kept the advice given by the neighbourhood watch scheme of writing down the serial number or putting an identifying invisible mark on the object.  The police in those circumstances must try to trace the chain of evidence through the shop, the wholesaler, the warehouser and the manufacturer in order to see if the records have been kept.  If the person who made the record is deceased or has moved to another place of employment or emigrated, there is a difficulty under the current law.  The Law Reform Commission provide a way around that difficulty.  It not only allows for ease of producing records but also for situations where a witness is unable or unwilling for whatever reasons to testify.</P>
    <P>For example, if a company had a disagreement with an employee and dismissed him but subsequently needed his assistance to prove their records because their goods were stolen and had ended up in the hands of suspected thieves or receivers, the former employee cannot be blamed if out of pique or annoyance he is not prepared to help.  There must be a provision in the law to address this situation.  A similar type of exception is made in the 1967 Criminal Procedures Act.  Originally my amendment was not confined to receiving cases &mdash; and I do not think the Law Reform Commission wanted it to be confined to receiving cases &mdash; but in order to ensure that I was fitting full square within the terms of the legislation, I modified it to relate to criminal proceedings taken under this Bill.  I have confined it artificially to receiving cases, or handling cases as they are now known.</P>
    <P>This Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Larceny Act, 1916, ... and to provide for related matters.  It is arguable that even if I had tabled the amendment to cover all areas of criminal law I would be in order, but rather than lose the opportunity to debate this matter, I sought to <Col N="1526" /> confine it to the narrower sense.  The amendment is worthy of support and consideration. It is lengthy amendment but addresses a very concise, perennial and persistent problem.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not simply originate from the Law Reform Commission report on stolen property but was fully explored and dealt with in their earlier working paper entitled <i>The Rule Against Hearsay in Civil Cases.</i> They recommended in the context of civil law that this type of régime should be introduced, and the report argues that it should be extended to handling cases of offences or proof of offences under the criminal law. The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Finlay over the years has advocated that this matter should be expanded and developed as a means of streamlining the administration of our law.  Some ten years ago I remember he gave an address to the Law Society in which he asked that this type of a development be explored as much as possible. There is no doubt that many of the rules of evidence and of practice in the courts need to be updated and made to reflect modern life.  For that reason I hope the Minister will accept this amendment and include it as a good working proposal that will make the Bill all the more effective and workable.</P>

      <P>Clearly there is a lacuna in the law in regard to evidence. This was very clearly illustrated in the report of the Law Reform Commission. Under the laws of evidence, the owner of goods may be unable to identify the individual items which are the subject of the charge and would then try to bridge this evidential gap by producing invoices or delivery dockets of one kind or another, but he may come up against the objection that only the person who entered the invoice or dockets could prove ownership of the goods and they may not be available in court and the chain would then be broken.  The Law Reform Commission came up with a <Col N="1527" /> recommendation to deal with this. Deputy McCartan has tabled an amendment based word for word on the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  In principle, I am totally supportive of the view expressed by the Law Reform Commission and now in Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister could resolve the problem of evidence possibly in the same way he dealt with section 5.  Deputy McCartan touched on a point which I am concerned about.  I want to see the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission put into effect quickly; however, I want to see it put into effect in relation to all criminal charges.  As Deputy McCartan mentioned, his amendment deals with criminal proceedings taken under this Act.  I invite the Minister to take on board the points raised by the Opposition.  I cannot speak for Deputy McCartan, but I feel we would be of the one mind on this: if we got a guarantee that this provision would be introduced on a general basis in criminal proceedings, we would be happy when dealing with cases of receiving, etc. that the prosecution would be able to rely on the approach encapsulated in Deputy McCartan's amendment.  The Law Reform Commission has recommended this approach.</P>
      <P>I believe Deputy Kavanagh would be in favour of this amendment.  We, in Fine Gael, would like to see a change made so that it would be applicable to all criminal proceedings.  I, therefore, invite the Minister to give a guarantee that a Bill will be brought before the House quickly that covers this point in relation to all criminal proceedings.  If I had that guarantee, it would resolve the issue so far as our stance is concerned.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy for the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan.  However, one has to point out that the Myers case was decided in the House of Lords by a majority of three: two, which considerably weakens <Col N="1528" /> its authority here.  The Law Reform Commission report on stolen property states that in the Law Reform Commission working paper on <i>The Rule Against Hearsay in Civil Cases</i> doubts were expressed as to whether Myers represented the law in the jurisdiction.  It was pointed out that a less restrictive approach to the admissibility of records prevailed in other common law jurisdictions. The Law Reform Commission went on to refer to two recent Irish decisions where the Irish courts took a somewhat ambiguous approach towards that.  Having said that, one has to be sympathetic to the thinking which underlines the amendment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there are a number of issues relating to the law of evidence which need to be updated and modernised, such as the competence and compellability of spouses as witnesses.  I understand the Minister has asked his Department to prepare legislation on this matter which will also take this issue into account.  No doubt, the Minister will inform us further on that.  In view of the uncertainty on the admissibility of evidence of this kind, I would like to see &mdash; I am speaking personally &mdash; something written into the legislation which would clarify the matter and put it beyond doubt.  However, if we are updating the law on evidence, this is the most appropriate place to take on board Deputy McCartan's proposal, to which I have no objection in principle.</P>

      <P>Recommendation 9 in the Law Reform Commission's document has been translated into a scheme for a Bill to be produced by the Minister. Deputy McCartan has cleverly extracted the portion that brings recommendation 9 into operation in this Bill.  Unfortunately, it is not in the Bill before us but the opportunity is given to the Minister to include it.  What I and other people on this side of the House have been saying is that we would have hoped that the Minister would have taken the scheme of the Bill provided to him in the Law <Col N="1529" /> Reform Commission's document and made amendments to it rather than make so many amendments to the 1916 Act and approached larceny from a 1989 point of view, which would carry us through into the next century rather than attempting to amend a Bill that is now almost 80 years old.</P>
      <P>We have all given figures as they relate to crime in this country.  The increase in that type of crime that has occurred, particularly in the last ten years, has arisen in many cases with so much knowledge, new technology and modern methods in carrying out the crimes that were never envisaged when the 1916 Act was brought in.  The 1916 Act was passed in a type of Gilbert and Sullivan period when people were singing about the burglar being out doing his duty and the policemen trying to catch him.  We are now dealing with sophisticated methods of stealing very large sums of money. The people who are doing that &mdash; the godfathers and the handlers &mdash; benefited from crime last year to the extent of about £32 million.  This amendment endeavoured to bring this Bill up to date as far as it goes.  This amendment deals with the records, the methods of modern business and the usage to which modern technology in business is put to nowadays and how that can be used to defraud the owners of their property, property that can have immense value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is considering doing something on Report Stage, then all of us will await that.  I hope he will do as he has already suggested he would do with the previous amendment and that he will come back having considered what attempts are being made by the Opposition, to try to give this Bill a more comprehensive approach to crime.  All of us are interested in doing that.  We are fed up hearing every morning from Gay Byrne and others the extent of crime that exists in Ireland.  We all want to bring in legislation that can get to grips with the larceny end of that crime and to see a Bill that will be modern and up to date and <Col N="1530" /> which will give the Garda and the courts every facility to catch these people who are making enormous wealth out of crime.  An amendment such as this attempts to do that.  I hope that the Minister, being the sensible man he is, will take this amendment into consideration and sleep on it overnight and that when we come to deal with it on Report Stage he will have considered that it is well worthy of inclusion in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is not opposed.  I agree with the object which Deputy McCartan is seeking to achieve in this amendment, that is to facilitate the admission of evidence of certain business and administrative records in criminal proceedings.  In fact, the Minister has a Criminal Evidence Bill in preparation which makes provision for the admissibility of these records as well as for the competence and the compulsion on spouses to give evidence in criminal cases.  It would also be hoped to include in the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission evidence of child sexual abuse cases if the commission's report, expected early next year, is received before drafting of the Bill is completed.  The proposals in the commission's report on receiving from which the Deputy has taken his amendment were based on provisions in the British Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984. These provisions were replaced with modifications in a Criminal Justice Act last year and the Bill which is now on the stocks takes account of these modifications. I expect that in the next week or so the Minister for Justice will be furnishing the heads of the Criminal Evidence Bill to other interested Departments for observations, which is the usual procedure, as a preliminary to sending them to the Government for approval to have the Bill so drafted.  As I said earlier, the principle is not opposed.  It is the aim of all Members in this House to bring in as good a Bill as <Col N="1531" /> possible.  I hope I have clarified some of the important matters.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister again for the information he has afforded us here.  It helps to update our information on the stage which work is at within the Department on this important point.  The purpose in seeking to include this amendment in the Bill at this stage was simply to get the Minister to address the Law Reform Commission's report and its extensive work in this area.  It was a pity that the Minister did not tell us on Second Stage what we have been told by the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who is deputising for the Minister.

Putting down the amendment did not involve the staff great deal of work but it did involve the Law Reform Commission in exhaustive work and it certainly involved the staff of this House in considerable work in reproducing three and a half pages of an amendment when all of that could have been avoided if the Minister had told us on Second Stage what we have now been told.  The Minister might take back to his <Col N="1532" /> colleague this point: when he is addressing a Bill and he has a document as excellent as this one, in his Second Stage speech perhaps he might consider addressing the issues it raises whether he is taking them on board or not.  It would avoid a lot of the difficulties.  I am sorry to introduce a small sour note.  I welcome what we have been told and in those circumstances I am withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>Cork Regional Technical College was built in 1974 and very little money has been spent on it since then despite a huge increase in the number of students attending the college.</P>
      <P>A letter in 1984 promised a new atrium and library and funding for equipment. The students are concerned about the method by which they have been grant-aided in the past.  The number of students increased from 1,227 in 1978 to 3,250 this year, a 56 per cent increase in a ten year period.  In all that time no additional study facilities have been provided for the students and there is now a ratio of 17 students for every one place in the library.</P>
      <P>I opened the atrium in 1986 and it was intended that it would be available for restaurant facilities and relaxation for the students.  However, because of the pressure on library places there is an overflow to the atrium which is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of students who are studying because of the noise from people who are eating and enjoying themselves.  It is also unsatisfactory because the number of places available to people who wish to take a meal has been diminished because of the students using the atrium for a purpose for which it was not designed or intended.  If this continues it will have a detrimental effect on the quality of the work of the students and, consequently, on the quality of graduate which the college is turning out which, I am sure, neither the House nor the Minister would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college was promised that the library would be completed some years ago at a cost of about £7 million but the work has not yet been undertaken.  I want to ensure that the best facilities are available to students to enable them to pass very difficult examinations.  Even though a grant for equipment was given over the last seven years there is still a great shortage.  Much of the original equipment is still in use but it now needs to be replaced.  New technology has also become available in the intervening years <Col N="1534" /> which should be made available to students, again with the purpose of turning out the best quality students so that they can take advantage of employment which will be available to them in the Common Market in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>These points were put to the Minister for Education yesterday in a parliamentary question for written reply.  She said:</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties that exist in Cork Regional Technical College with regard to library and other facilities.  This problem will be addressed within the context of a rolling programme of capacity enhancement and rationalisation to be carried out in all the regional technical colleges from 1990 onwards on a priority basis.</P>
    <P>Setting aside the jargon, it seems that there is not much intention of doing anything about the overcrowded conditions in Cork Regional Technical College in the next financial year.  However, there is still time for the Minister to include it and to set the wheels in motion to allow the construction of extra library facilities to give students a chance to graduate from a college that is properly equipped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Barry, for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment debate.  Like Deputy Barry, I was disappointed with the Minister's written reply to yesterday's parliamentary question because, having met the people concerned and seen the lack of facilities, I am acutely aware of the major problems experienced by students in Cork RTC.  I fully support the case they have presented to the Minister and her Department and they deserve an immediate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry summed up the argument well; while student numbers have increased by almost 60 per cent from its opening to the present day, the budget for equipment facilities has been reduced by almost 50 per cent since 1982.  One does not need to be a student of the college to know that that equation does <Col N="1535" /> not add up.  There are 17 students for every library place, which is most unsatisfactory. The fact that facilities are totally inadequate will make it very difficult for any Minister to ensure that further college places can be made available.</P>
    <P>While we were all pleased to hear that extra college places will be available over the next number of years those of us in Cork who know the situation are asking where the students will go because there certainly is no room at Cork RTC.  The work done in Cork RTC over the past ten years speaks for itself and people who are concerned about education and the future of Ireland after 1992 strongly advocate that extra places and facilities be made available to regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The facilities in Cork are not good enough for the students and we cannot even begin to think of extra places until the students at present attending the college have the facilities to which they are entitled.  As a result of changes in EC policy from January next the grant-aid limit for mature students will be increased which means that extra students will be attending college.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the increased number of students attending secondary schools during the early eighties will now automatically be transferred to third level colleges.  Automatically this will lead to a greater number of students seeking places.  If the present scenario obtains at Cork RTC the necessary facilities will not be available there.  The students' union produced an interesting document which I am sure was made available to both the Minister and her Minister of State.  They met most Cork Deputies in recent weeks and presented a very genuine case.  Anybody interested in ensuring that Ireland of the nineties has an adequately educated population must strive to ensure that extra facilities and finance are made available to colleges such as the Cork RTC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I hope the Minister of State will give us some good news to take back to Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which exist in Cork RTC in regard to the library facilities.  I accept that the increased demand for third-level places generally has strained facilities in all RTCs.</P>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for the very reasonable case they made in respect of the Cork RTC this evening.  I cannot disagree with anything they have said.  It is my intention that the limited funds available will be spent in such a manner as to alleviate the most serious accommodation deficiencies and that the allocation of such resources between the various colleges will be as fair as possible. I welcome the presence of Senator Batt O'Keeffe in the House this evening. More than anybody else he has consistently brought this problem to the attention of the Minister and myself, he being a member of the staff of Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
      <P>I recently asked the officials of my Department to initiate an analysis of accommodation and its ulitisation in all the Cork Regional Technical Colleges and in some of the other colleges also. This analysis will form the basis of further discussion with the college authorities, enabling current needs and priorities to be established.  Questionnaires were issued to each college principal in mid-November to which replies are awaited. To date one response only has been received but it is expected that others will be forwarded shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to jargon on the part of the Minister in the form of a reply she gave the House yesterday.  I must refute that allegation.  The Minister is particularly committed to the provision of accommodation which we accept is urgently needed in Cork RTC.  Indeed she has taken a keen interest in the progress of that college and their very good results.  Far be it from me to score a <Col N="1537" /> political point here against any Opposition Deputies but one major problem has emanated from the fact that, over a four year period of the last Coalition Government, absolutely no planning took place with regard to the provision of extra facilities for Cork Regional Technical College.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having allowed me the opportunity to raise this important matter on behalf of so many people in my constituency.  It is generally accepted on all sides of the House that the new towns on the west side of Dublin have been disgracefully under-provided for in terms of resources.  However, citizens in many parts of Tallaght, for example, have thrived despite official neglect and, through their tenacity and persistence over the years, have gradually shaped vigorous, forward-looking communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Kingswood and Kilnamanagh the capacity of the people to realise their full potential, to consolidate <Col N="1539" /> an indigenous community spirit is being hampered and obstructed by the scandalous failure of successive Governments, over ten years, to provide the area with a second-level school.  Towards the end of the seventies, and especially throughout the eighties, parents in this enormously populous area have had to make arrangements to bus their children to several outside schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to put the refusal to build this second-level school at Kilnamanagh/Kingswood in Tallaght in the context of the huge population of that area where there are more than 3,000 houses and a population of almost 20,000.  Where in Ireland is there a town of almost 20,000 people, with more than 3,000 primary-level school children in the care of 80 primary teachers, without a second-level school? Up to 1,000 children per day will have to be bussed out of Kilnamanagh/Kingswood to 17 outside schools if this second-level school is not built.  Let us put that in the context of a town like Tralee with a population of 16,495, or Clonmel &mdash; as the Ceann Comhairle will know &mdash; with a population in excess of 12,000.  One may well ask how many second-level schools are there in the Clonmel area? If one compares the population of, say, Thurles, 7,059 or, say, Letterkenny, 6,691, then one can readily appreciate the enormity of the problem obtaining in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I am indeed sorry that the Minister herself is not present because I should like to have asked her about Athlone which has a population of 9,444.  The area about which I speak has a population of almost 20,000, the majority of whom are at family-formation stage and where there is not a single second-level school. I should like to have had the opportunity to ask the Minister how many second-level schools there are in Athlone.  I can recollect two readily.  Are there more than two; say three or four, in an area with half the population of <Col N="1540" /> Kilnamanagh/Kingswood?  This is a disgraceful position that cannot be allowed continue.  Does the Minister appreciate those numbers?  In the opinion of the Minister for Education do the children of Kilnamanagh/Kingswood have a lesser right to education than her constituents in Athlone?  Does the Minister consider it proper that many parents in Kilnamanagh/Kingswood must bear additional transport costs compared with, say, her constituents in Athlone? Does the Minister consider that such a large community should be disrupted in this manner for so long?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the fact that if this school was opened in 1990 there would immediately be 300 local children from the sixth grade available for enrolement in September.  For every year thereafter for the five year cycle there would be an additional 300 new pupils, giving 1,500 pupils at the end of the five year cycle in that school.  The people of the area are not looking for a school to cater for 1,500 pupils; they are looking for a school to cater for 800 pupils, which means that up to 700 children would still have to get buses out of Kilnamanagh-Kingswood. The statistics have been assembled by the local people, the families are young, and the projections are that there will be more than enough pupils to almost twice fill such an 800 pupil school.</P>
    <P>I sometimes think that when the Minister glibly talks about other areas of Tallaght beginning to show signs of winding down demographically she knows nothing about the distances involved in a place like Tallaght.  It is nonsense to suggest to over 3,000 householders in Kingswood-Kilnamanagh that they may in future have access to some places in a school five, six or seven miles away in another part of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Ever since the mid-seventies the Kilnamanagh-Kingswood area has been promised a second level school.  The present Minister for Education espoused the cause of the local people when she <Col N="1541" /> was spokesperson on Education for Fianna Fáil.  Eventually a commitment was extracted from the then Minister for Education, Mr. Paddy Cooney, to build a school at the end of the period of office of the 1983-87 Government.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil were returned to office and the school was stopped despite the promises of the local Fianna Fáil organisation to the people in the area.  Indeed the Minister protested &mdash; I had anticipated that she would be in the House but I did not want to embarrass her with quotations from her contribution &mdash; about the desperate need for the school during her time in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is not the only Minister who has betrayed the parents of Kilnamanagh-Kingswood on this issue.  As recently as the debate of 7 December 1988, Deputy Mary Harney claimed that the Department had acquired two sites for the school and that design fees of up to £250,000 had been committed.  She supported the cause of the local people and demanded that an announcement should be made soon.  She warned that 1,000 children would have to get buses out of Kilnamanagh-Kingswood if the school was not built.  Deputy Harney is now Minister in this Government but the children of Kilnamanagh-Kingswood still have not got their school and, even worse, they have to get buses in the early morning in the terrible conditions of smog that now exist in the Tallaght region.  The Minister for smog is as ineffectual in tackling the smog problem as she was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is as ineffectual in that area as she is in delivering on her promise to the people of Kingswood-Kilnamanagh.</P>
      <P>There is a distinction in this case.  The construction of this school is the policy of Dáil Éireann.  On 7 December 1988 a Workers' Party amendment was put to this House to have that school built and it was carried with the support of Fianna Fáil, indeed with the unanimous support of this House.  The Minister is not only ignoring the needs of the people of Kilnamanagh-Kingswood; she is flouting a decision of Dáil Éireann that this school should be built.  Indeed my own colleague, Councillor Don Tipping, at Dublin County Council was successful in ensuring that the site was not made derelict.  It is still there while we wait for the Minister to act on the decision of the Dáil to build this school.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government committed themselves to doing what they could to ensure that children would be retained in second and third level education in so far as the resources would permit.  Dublin has the lowest retention rate of children in second and third level education.  If the Government were really serious about that commitment they would build adequate second level schools in the community so that the people would not have to endure the additional costs, distress and disturbance that parents in Kilnamanagh and Kingswood have had to bear for so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister this evening who is in Brussels on EC business.  As the Deputy is aware, it is my Department's policy to monitor carefully developments in all areas of Dublin which have been expanding over the past ten to 20 years.  This is especially true in the case of the Tallaght area generally where the Department have an excellent record in the matter of provision of educational facilities at primary and post primary levels.</P>
      <P>In dealing with Castleview I must also mention the adjoining area of Kilnamanagh. It was originally felt by my Department that two schools might be required &mdash; one in Kilnamanagh and the other in Castleview.  Accordingly two sites, one in each area, were acquired. On the recommendation of the Dublin Advisory Council for Post Primary Accommodation, my Department decided in May 1977 that a 1,000 pupil school would be required in Kilnamanagh in 1983-84.  No decision was taken on the provision of a school at Castleview.  The Department have had doubts about the need for a school at Kilnamanagh to cater for that area alone since 1980.  While the numbers leaving primary school in Kilnamanagh are growing there is a major decline in the numbers of primary school leavers in the adjoining Greenhills and Walkinstown areas.  In 1983 the then Minister, Gemma Hussey, decided that the proposed school for Kilnamanagh should be deferred.</P>
      <P>I would like to correct a number of gross inaccuracies in what Deputy Rabbitte has said about the need to transport children for up to five and six miles.  There is no necessity to do that and I am surprised Deputy Rabbitte is not aware of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as the site in <Col N="1544" /> Kilnamanagh, the Department own a site in Castleview which is further west and closer to the Belgard area of Tallaght. Local interest groups in the Kilnamanagh and Castleview areas joined together to lobby for one school to be built on the Castleview site to serve the two areas. This question was discussed by the Advisory Council on Post-Primary Accommodation for the Greater Dublin area at their meeting on 17 April 1986.  The council decided that the post-primary accommodation position in the Tallaght area should be examined in detail by a subcommittee of the council.  The subcommitte's report was considered at a full meeting of the council on 3 December 1986.  Arising from their discussion on that date the council's recommendation to the Minister was that a post-primary school should be provided in Castleview to serve the needs of the Castleview/ Kilnamanagh area and also to take surplus pupils from the Springfield area.</P>
      <P>On 16 June 1987 the Minister decided that a post-primary school for north Tallaght should be provided in Castleview on the site owned by the Department and to accommodate about 600 pupils.  In March 1988 a review of policy for the provision of new and replacement accommodation for primary and second level schools was completed by an interdepartmental committee consisting of officials of the Departments of Education and Finance.  A crucial recommendation contained in the review was that:</P>
      <P>In major urban areas, where there are no defined catchment areas, consideration of an application from any school or area for new, extended or improved accommodation shall have regard to the accommodation situation, actual and projected within reasonable access of the particular school or area.  In this context and in the light of the school transport provisions, a distance of three miles is not considered unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> The most recent review of the Castle-view-Kilnamanagh area, completed last April, has concluded that there are sufficient pupil places available at present in schools in areas within a reasonable distance of the Kilnamanagh/Castleview areas to cater for post-primary pupils from those areas.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that some parents will be concerned that they may be unable to get their children into the school of their choice.  However, my Department's main function in this matter is to ensure that overall there are sufficient places available in post-primary schools which are readily accessible. The needs of the pupils in the Kilnamanagh/Castleview and adjoining areas will of course continue to be carefully monitored in my Department on a regular basis and appropriate action will be taken as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to a number of points the Deputy has made.  He talked about the Minister glibly giving statistics and so on.  If our Department had proceeded with the construction of post-primary schools, as had been recommended ten years ago, we would have been accused of gross negligence in the expenditure of public moneys.  It annoys me a little to hear Workers' Party Deputies coming in here day after day telling us that we should build schools here, there and everywhere around the country without any cognisance of where exactly the money is to come from.  I would put it to Deputy Rabbitte that it is incumbent on <Col N="1546" /> him as a Deputy in this House to remember that the most important prerogative of all politicians at present is that we spend taxpayers money carefully.  To spend on the demands of interest groups in every area would be grossly negligent of us.</P>

(i) an enhanced alarm transmission service (Tele-Alarm) will be introduced on a trial basis in the next four-five months.  (ii) A new consumer survey will be issued with telephone bills in January 1990. The purpose of this survey, called The Irish Way of Living Survey, is to compile an information database on the Irish consumer.  This information will be held by the company and will be made available to firms seeking to market goods and services in the Irish market-place. It is not possible, at this stage to give definite figures in relation to the job creation potential of these new enterprises but it is estimated that they are likely to generate at least ten new jobs between them.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for RTE.  RTE reports that the provision of full TV and radio reception coverage throughout the Republic is difficult due to the topography of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE provides reception from a total of 46 high and low power transmitters scattered throughout the country.  In <Col N="1319" /> addition a further 32 community-owned self-help systems extend coverage to small isolated pockets of poor reception. The population covered is in excess of 99 per cent, but the quality of reception varies from excellent to fair-to-poor.</P>
    <P>There is still a small number of pockets of poor TV reception, mainly in counties Wicklow, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan and Tipperary.  RTE is continuously extending and improving the network in areas where reception is not as good as RTE would wish it to be.  The pace of this development is dictated by the availability of capital resources.</P>
    <P>On radio coverage, RTE operates a total of 21 medium wave and VHF/FM transmitters.  A programme to extend and improve VHF/FM stereo reception is continuing.  Areas of priority, where FM reception is presently less than adequate are mainly in counties Cork, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan, Waterford and the Midlands.  RTE medium wave reception is generally adequate, particularly during daylight hours.  Reception on medium wave during the hours of darkness, however, is restricted in some areas, particularly in Kerry, Cork, Mayo and Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke) Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total estimated amount outstanding is of the order of £644,000.  In all 24 licensees out of 40 are in arrears, <Col N="1320" /> ranging in amounts from £310 to some £366,000.</P>
      <P>I would be reluctant at this time to list the names of the licensees because of the sensitive nature of negotiations which are taking place with a number of them regarding arrangements to pay off.  In a number of instances such discussions are taking place in the context of possible sales of the systems.  In other instances the possibility of legal action being taken exists and I am concerned that my Department's position should not be prejudiced.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases the amounts owing date from 1986-87 or later when all but three cable companies withheld payment of licence fees as a protest primarily against the undermining of their business by illegal rebroadcasting systems. The lion's share &mdash; £366,000 &mdash; is owed by one company.  The company in question had initiated legal action seeking substantial damages as a result of alleged loss of business due to my Department's alleged failure to deal with illegal rebroadcasting systems in the licensed area of the cable company.  The company in question has recently agreed to pay off the arrears over three years and have already made a substantial payment. Most of the other companies who are in arrears have entered into agreements with the Department to pay the arrears by instalment.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the arrears situation on cable licence fees can be cleared up over the next few years through a combination of agreements and legal action.  In the last two months the overall level of arrears has been reduced by £100,000.  Over the years civil action has been taken in the courts against 13 licensees.   I have asked the Chief State Solicitor to prepare a case against another licensee and my Department's experience in this case will determine tactics in the future against recalcitrant payers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No inspections of records of cable systems have taken place due to lack of suitably qualified staff.  As the information which cable companies are required to produce to my Department to enable their licence fee liability to be <Col N="1321" /> determined must be audited by a qualified professional there is little value in such inspections.</P>

      <P>That provision was specifically designed to curb serious abuses which had arisen in that regard.  Its purpose and scope was welcomed during the debate in the Oireachtas on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and I have no plans to amend the legislation.

    <P>The level of recorded indictable crime for County Cork for 1988 indicates a slight decrease over the figures for 1987. The figures for recorded indictable crime <Col N="1322" /> for Cork city for 1988 showed an increase of 3.4 per cent over the figures for 1987. I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures for Cork city and county for the first ten months of this year indicate a significant decrease in the level of recorded indictable crime by comparison with the corresponding period in 1988.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda authorities keep the crime problem in Cork, as elsewhere, under continuing review and can be relied on to continue to do their utmost to tackle the crime situation generally and to take all appropriate measures to deal with any particular crime problems that arise.  In reply to Priority Question No. 52 on 9 November last I outlined a series of new measures that are being taken to tackle crime generally and on 16 November I announced a package of initiatives involving the commitment of substantial additional resources for this purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to public concern at delays by the Gardaí in responding to 999 calls in the Dublin area; if he will give the average time taken to respond to such calls; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average number of &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls received in the Garda Communications Centre for the Dublin Metropolitan Area is running <Col N="1323" /> at about 450 per day at present.  In addition, incidents are notified to the centre by other phone calls, by gardaí on patrol and by alarm calls, a very large proportion of which, regrettably, are false alarms.  In November the total number of calls made to the centre was about 36,000.</P>
      <P>The degree of urgency that attaches to the various calls within this total of 36,000 varies enormously.  A very high percentage of &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls do not require an emergency response while included in the other calls is a number of calls which do require such a response.  For this reason it would be totally misleading to give average times for response to &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls only.  The Garda have found it necessary to classify all calls for assistance into different categories of priority and the Garda response is geared to meet the urgency attaching to each particular type of call. I am assured by the Garda authorities that incidents which come into the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; class are responded to, almost invariably, within minutes.</P>
      <P>During the month of November 1989 a response time of under one minute was recorded in 435 cases.  Less urgent calls are responded to as speedily as possible &mdash; as an indication of overall responses times I am informed that over 70 per cent of the 36,000 calls I have referred to, which I must emphasis include a vast number of non-urgent calls, were responded to in under 30 minutes.  I should perhaps make it clear that by &ldquo;response time&rdquo; is meant the period between the receipt of a call and the arrival of gardaí at the scene of the incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals for the establishment of a separate Law Reform Commission <Col N="1324" /> for the purpose referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply which my predecessor gave to similar questions put to him on 20 April last &mdash; columns 2426 and 2427 of the Official Report &mdash; in which he stated that his approach to the need for updating the criminal law was to deal with the matter on a systematic basis affording priority to those areas most in need of review.  I share his view in that regard.</P>
      <P>To attempt a comprehensive review and codification of the entire field of criminal law would necessitate the diversion of staff resources from priority areas.  A great deal of work has already been done, however.  Over the last two and a half years a significant number of important criminal law Bills have been enacted or have been introduced: the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 and the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial Hatred Act, 1989; the Criminal Law Rape (Amendment), Bill; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill; the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill and the Larceny Bill.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the fact that 37 persons have died in Garda or prison custody during the past ten years, he will consider establishing a sworn public inquiry to examine the circumstances of these deaths and to make recommendations for the more effective supervision of persons in custody; if he intends to take any action in response to the comments of the city coroner and the rider of the jury at the recent inquest into the death of a person (details supplied) in Mountjoy Prison, held on 20 October 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances of each death in custody are examined by the appropriate authorities and these examinations fully cover the background and circumstances of each death.  A specific objective of these examinations is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature.  Each death is also the subject of a public inquiry by way of <Col N="1326" /> inquest.  I announced recently the establishment of an advisory group &mdash; comprised of representatives of various disciplines involved with the care of prisoners &mdash; to specifically examine the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations in relation to any aspect of this matter.  There will be full consultation with those &mdash; including staff representatives &mdash; who may be in a position to help in this work and I have asked the group to conduct their task with the necessary sense of urgency.  In the circumstances I am not satisfied that an inquiry of the nature referred to by the Deputy would serve any useful purpose beyond what can be achieved under existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The rider of the jury in the case of the inquest referred to by the Deputy was to the effect that the bars of all the windows in Mountjoy Prison should be inspected to see if it would be possible to eliminate the risk of their being used by prisoners in attempts to take their own lives.  This matter of the bars in prison windows has been given careful consideration but the reality is that it has not so far proved feasible to devise any system which would totally eliminate all possibility of attempts at hanging and which at the same time would meet security needs. The matter will, however, continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have recently announced a comprehensive package of measures designed to fight crime, including measures to increase the numbers of gardaí available for operational duties and provide a more visible Garda presence in all areas.  The major elements in this package so far as the Garda Síochána are concerned are: 250 civilian clerical staff are to be appointed to release gardaí from office work to perform outdoor police duties; 250 gardaí in the ranks of garda, sergeant and inspector, who would be due to retire over the next two years on reaching age 57, are to be enabled to serve until age 60; and the rate of recruitment of 1,000 trainee gardaí is being accelerated.  Three hundred and forty-eight trainees will be taken on during 1990, which is 50 more than originally planned.</P>
      <P>I have also made an additional £500,000 available for overtime work in Dublin to increase the number of gardaí on the streets during the busy Christmas shopping period.  I am satisfied that these measures will make an important contribution to strengthening Garda resources in the fight against crime in all areas of the State, urban and rural.</P>
      <P>Modern technology is being fully utilised by the Garda Síochána.  The Garda communications network has been operating very successfully for some time in the 18 Garda divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the system designed specifically for the DMA came into operation earlier this year.  The Garda Síochána also have computerised information systems which are of valuable assistance to the Force in the discharge of their duties.</P>

To assist the gardaí in dealing with the problem I have obtained from the Government approval for an additional £500,000 to provide for extra Garda overtime during the Christmas period.  This extra allocation will enable the Garda authorities to put additional gardaí on the streets of Dublin where and when they are most needed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cross-country comparisons of child support are difficult and may not be totally meaningful given the different types of social security systems and financing arrangements in EC countries. In some countries a family supplement is paid, in others payments vary by age of children.  Certain countries, for example, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and Greece, relate the payments to earnings.</P>
      <P>The Government are firmly committed to improving the position of families particularly those on low incomes.  The 1989 budget contained very significant increases in respect of children.  The measures announced in that budget constitute a major initiative in improving their position and tackling poverty.</P>
      <P>Child dependant allowances rates generally were increased by 3 per cent.  In addition a minimum rate of £10 per week was introduced.  The payments in respect of children for a three child family on short term unemployment assistance were increased by £3 per week, and by £2.20 per week for a person on long-term unemployment assistance.  The rate for the third and subsequent children on these payments was increased by 25 per cent for short-term and by 19 per cent for long-term recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these increases, payment of child dependant increases was extended for long-term recipients including those in receipt of unemployment assistance and invalidity pension, and old age pensioners, children in full-time education up to the age of 19.  Child benefit was improved by paying the higher rate of £21.75 in respect of the fifth child from next October, which will mean an <Col N="1350" /> increase of £6.70 per month to families of five or more children.</P>
    <P>Special measures were also taken for families at work on low pay, which are of special benefit to those with children. These measures involved an increase from £5,000 to £6,000 in the tax exemption limit for married couples together with a new special exemption of £200 in respect of each child.  For a married couple with five children on £7,000 a year the net gain is £13 a week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of dentists in the Dublin North East constituency who are participating in the scheme to provide cover for spouses of insured workers; the names and addresses of the surgeries of those participating; and if he is satisfied that all constituents are obtaining adequate cover.</P>

      <P>A total of 62 dentists in the Dublin area have signed agreements to treat dependent spouses of insured persons. Of the 62, 24 dentists are based on the north side of the city.  Dependent spouses living in the area referred to by the Deputy, would generally have access to these dentists.</P>
      <P>Overall, of the 670 dentists, approximately, who are active on the Department's dental panel, 222 &mdash; i.e. over 33 per cent &mdash; have signed agreements covering dependent spouses.  Although some dependent spouses may have to travel outside their immediate area to obtain treatment, the overall number of dentists treating this category is considerable and provides a service in most parts of the country.  The scheme is operating well, and to date, over 54,200 dependent spouses, mainly women working in the home, have applied to the Department for approval of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of dentists who have signed <Col N="1351" /> agreements covering dependent spouses are available at the Department's local offices.  Any person who requires dental treatment can obtain details of their nearest participating dentists from these offices or by telephoning the Department. This arrangement has existed since the extension to the scheme and has been operating well.  In the context of the ongoing dispute between the dentists and the Department, it is considered that publication of a list of participating dentists would not be in the interests of claimants or the dentists concerned.</P>

This new office will be provided as soon as resources permit.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there were particular queuing difficulties at Swords Garda station on Tuesday, 5 December 1989.  Every year at this time, the Garda are asked to carry out advance certification of unemployment for claimants.  This is done to facilitate clients and to simplify administration over the Christmas holiday period.  It also means that these clients will not have to call again until early in January.  This year four forms had to be certified on the one day.  This caused special problems of congestion at Swords Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the pre-Christmas circumstances I have mentioned have aggravated the situation in Swords, difficulties in regard to queuing have occurred there which, while not on the pre-Christmas scale, give cause for concern and my <Col N="1354" /> Department is considering the possibility of introducing special measures to relieve the problems which arise in that location.</P>

      <P>This scheme provides very generous levels of grant in respect of the costs of appliances and related materials, installation and making good any consequential damage.  In so far as the 100 per cent grant limits applicable to tenant purchasers are concerned, I am satisfied that these are sufficient to meet the cost of supplying and installing a chosen option, while bearing in mind that the grant scheme does not cover the cost of betterment or upgrading in any case.  It would not be possible to meet such costs by way of increased grants nor to extend grants to meet the costs of additional structural works which might be found necessary in regard to the installation of certain heating options in particular cases.</P>

      <P>Fume emissions from motor vehicles are at present governed by Articles 30 and 90 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of <Col N="1361" /> Vehicles) Regulations, 1963.  The existing statutory framework must be extended to take account of EC Directives on the control of gaseous emissions from new cars and new commercial vehicles.  The EC Directives set emission standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, and will require the use of unleaded petrol and, in many cases, catalytic convertors on new cars.  I hope to publish a discussion document on the proposed arrangements for the implementation and enforcement of the EC Directives in Ireland, including the planned timescale, early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the existing road traffic regulations on vehicle emissions is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána. Heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances must be roadworthiness-tested annually under the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations, 1981 to 1986.

My Department has overall responsibility, at national level, for supervising the vehicle testing scheme. Table 21 of the Bulletin of Driver and Vehicle Statistics, 1988, published by my Department, shows that pollution/smoke is not among the ten most common defects in vehicles tested.  My Department's analysis shows that 267 vehicles or 0.6 per cent of 46,500 vehicles tested in 1988 were failed for pollution/smoke defects.</P>

      <P>The parking of vehicles generally on public roads is subject to various prohibitions and restrictions imposed directly by the Road Traffic Acts, by <Col N="1362" /> general road traffic regulations made by me under those Acts and by local traffic and parking by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent.</P>
      <P>The traffic and parking by-laws include provisions which apply to parking bans in a range of positions including clearways and bus lanes during their respective operational periods.  No exemptions to these controls are granted for the delivery of goods.  While a parking ban is also applied at places where double yellow lines are provided, the loading and unloading of goods can take place at such places provided the operation is completed within a period not exceeding 30 minutes from the commencement of the parking.</P>
      <P>A similar exemption is granted in places controlled by single yellow lines and where parking is allowed on a restricted basis.  That exemption is not, however, allowed where disc parking is in operation.  In addition, the by-laws allow for the provision of loading bays in areas to allow for the loading and unloading of goods.  The enforcement of parking controls is a matter for the Garda.</P>

      <P>Following are details of schemes currently available for purposes outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> Investment in registered tourist accommodation qualifies for relief under the business expansion scheme (BES) and for generous capital allowances for taxation purposes.  There are currently no grant schemes in operation for the provision of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte currently administer a scheme of assistance for the development of tourist amenities.  Projects assisted from the £.5 million allocated for this scheme in 1989 included facilities for visiting anglers, equestrian enthusiasts and water and field sports specialists as well as a number of day visitor attractions in the historical and cultural area.</P>
    <P>In addition, investment in the development of the following facilities for overseas tourists qualifies for business expansion scheme relief: boat/ cruiser/passenger boat/water craft hire; horse drawn caravan hire; equestrian centre services; sailing/yachting centre/marina services; sub-aqua centre services; heritage houses, castles and gardens: improvement and development of ancillary services for tourism; sea angling boat hire; game fisheries angling services; interpretive centre services; chauffeur-drive operations for tourism only; international conference centre services; resort companies wholly or mainly for the provision of approved services; outdoor pursuits/activity centre services; tourist guide agencies; and tour coach services.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme and the Bord Fáilte amenity scheme have nationwide application.  However, there is also a number of other tourism schemes which apply only to certain geographic areas.  These include the agri-tourism scheme under the western package, which applies primarily to the western counties.  It provides assistance for farmers developing tourism projects such as angling, equestrian activities, golf, walking routes and theme farms; the International Fund for Ireland, provides assistance for the development of leisure facilities linked to registered accommodation in the Border counties and County Sligo and for other tourist amenities and marketing initiatives which are <Col N="1371" /> geared towards increasing overseas tourists to the region; individuals and communities in the same region are also benefiting from over £.5 million allocated for tourism promotion from the ERDF Special Border Area Programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, persons interested in seeking funding for tourism investment can also, of course, apply to (i) the Industrial Credit Corporation who provide loan assistance to the sector for certain capital developments, through moneys borrowed from the European Investment Bank; and (ii) the National Development Corporation who are prepared to consider taking equity in selected tourism products.  Further information on all the above can be obtained from the investment unit, Bord Fáilte Éireann, Baggot Street Bridge, Dublin, the regional tourism organisations, or the relevant administering agencies.</P>
