      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  I would refer the Deputies to the statement I <Col N="1038" /> made in the House yesterday on my meetings in Moscow and on my official working visit to Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the statement the Taoiseach made in the House yesterday, could he elaborate a little on the proposal he put to the Soviet delegation regarding a partnership in our oil refining and oil storage facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great elaboration I can give.  It is very simple a proposal.  It seemed to me to be a proposal which would arise directly from our other proposal for some kind of barter arrangement in regard to the supply of Soviet oil.  As Deputies know, the Government have been considering for some time the question of taking a producer country partner into Whitegate and/or Whiddy with us.  This would make a lot of sense.  It is the way oil business is going generally around the world &mdash; the producer countries are seeking to become more involved in the final stages of their product.  I would like also to deal with a few remarks which were made during the course of the debate yesterday.  It was suggested that the Government were dealing with a multiplicity of possible partners in regard to these installations. That is not so.  I do not think there is any harm in letting it be known internationally that we would welcome a good sound working partnership by a producer country but at the moment, apart from inquiries of one kind or another, there are actually no specific substantive negotiations in train with any particular possible partner.  I just want to make that clear.  We are totally free to make an arrangement with the Soviets if we wish to do so without any complications with regard to any other possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks the Taoiseach has referred to were not made by myself, they were made by other Deputies.  Can the Taoiseach indicate, in view of the strategic importance of the product we are talking about &mdash; oil and the oil supply to the Irish economy &mdash; and the importance of our having control <Col N="1039" /> over whatever refining capacity we already have, whether in any partnership deal, either with the Soviets or other groups who may be making proposals to the Irish Government, we would intend to retain control of our refining capacity and of the storage facilities we have at Whiddy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, within limits, I would be glad to agree to some such principle but the Deputy will understand that a partnership would be a partnership and there would have to be mutual benefits on both sides.  The fact that the installations are on our territory would, to a considerable extent, give us the sort of security perhaps that we would need but these are matters which would have to be discussed.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the exercise would be to seek to give us some sort of stability in the supply situation in regard to oil.  As the Deputy knows, the international world market for oil can be volatile and quite unpredictable.  All that is needed is an accident in some part of the world to cause an upset in the market and in the price structures.  There would be a lot to be said for some sort of reasonably permanent arrangement for the supply of at least a substantial proportion of our needs on a permanent stable basis.  That is what we would have in mind.  As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, we are establishing a high level technical committee between ourselves and the Soviets to look at the compatibility of Soviet oil supplies with our refining capacity at Whitegate.  In that regard I would like to say that some of the remarks made yesterday about the nature and quality of Soviet oil were very wide of the mark.  I think, Deputies, it would be as well to leave these complicated technical matters to the expert committee we are setting up to look fully into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been the origin of some of the remarks to which the Taoiseach refers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1040" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not thinking of that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not surprise me. It would help you to think a little more about it on your various perambulations around the world so that you might not put your foot in it quite so often.</P>
      <P>With regard to what the Taoiseach has just said concerning the partnership arrangement with Soviet oil suppliers and the fact that he says that it is the only discussion going on, does that mean that discussions with a potential Nigerian partner have now been terminated, or does it mean that there never were any substantive discussions of any kind with a potential Nigerian partner?  Also, since the Soviets seem to be regarded as a potential partner, in the event of a partnership of that kind coming about, could the Taoiseach give us a guarantee that Irish workers in a refinery with that kind of partnership would not have to submit themselves to the kind of Soviet economic democracy that Deputy De Rossa was trying to sell to the House a couple of weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that perhaps should be addressed more specifically to the Minister concerned. My knowledge of the matter is that there are no other negotiations of substance in train at the moment.  I could arrange to have the Deputy given information by the Minister for Energy about any other negotiations or inquiries that are made. I think that it is common knowledge that there were discussions with the Nigerians. My understanding of the matter at the moment is that these are no longer extant.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At present at any rate they are not at the stage of practical discussion. The way is quite clear for us to enter into substantive discussions with the Soviets, or indeed with any other suitable oil producing possible partners.</P>

      <P>During the Taoiseach's visit it was reported that a number of companies had indicated their intention to invest here to a value varying between £20 million and £30 million.  The Taoiseach's statement yesterday did not refer to this report.  Could he either confirm that that is the case or deny that that report was factual?  If so, could he indicate how soon investment would come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the report is correct.  There are five specific corporations in the course of active negotiations with the IDA.  These negotiations are at the point where announcements can be made.  I set my face against coming back and making specific announcements about specific projects.  I did give a general omnibus figure but did not want to go any further than that.  All the different projects, practically, have different constraints with regard to them.  In some cases the final decision has to go to some particular high level board at home in Japan.  In other cases some negotiations have still to be completed here with regard either to our own situation or perhaps with regard to Community obligations. I think it is better in these cases that particular projects should be announced by the corporation themselves in due course, or by the IDA, or in some other way.  I do not subscribe to the concept of my coming back and making grandiose announcements just for the sake of making them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received the report of the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission on recent trends in international oil prices; the recommendation which the report has made regarding the review of petrol prices in May 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my meeting with the oil companies on 13 April last I requested the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission to undertake, in a private capacity, a study on the trends in international oil product prices and to report to me by 30 April in order to provide an objective guide to review prices in May and subsequent months until the Fair Trade Commission inquiry is completed.</P>

Will he be considering the position of the INPC in the context of this review?  Secondly, will he, as suggested by the Minister for Finance, be having an eye to crude oil prices which have not budged during April, or will he be looking at petrol prices which have risen very substantially during April?</P>

Crude has increased, but the decisions are made in relation to the petrol product, and the Deputy will be aware of the major fluctuation which has taken place in the price there.  It rose from $171.23 per barrel in December to $274.15 today.  While we have had a 3 per cent increase in our petrol prices, <Col N="1046" /> countries such as Germany have had nearly a 30 per cent increase.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will introduce legislation to remove restrictions imposed by accountancy bodies on their members in relation to advertising in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Fair Trade Commission of 11 November 1987; if not, the reason; and if accountants are still fixing fees and restricting advertising in contravention of the recommendations of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission <Col N="1047" /> (now Fair Trade Commission) report of study into concerted fixing of fees and restrictions on advertising in the accountancy profession, was the first in a series of reports to be produced by the Restrictive Practices Commission as part of a wide ranging study commissioned into the rendering of certain professional and analogous services.  This report was received in March 1987 and it was published on 11 November 1987.</P>
    <P>My predecessor received the Restrictive Practices Commission (now Fair Trade Commission) report of study into concerted fixing of fees and restrictions on advertising in the engineering profession, 1987, in May 1987.  The report was published on 14 April 1988.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that the Minister should introduce legislation to make it unlawful for any person or group of persons to recommend fees or charges, to collude in setting fees or charges, to prevent members of these professions from setting their own fees or charges or to prevent them from deciding individually the basis on which fees or charges are calculated.</P>
    <P>In the area of advertising, the commission recommended that the Minister should introduce legislation to make it unlawful for any person or groups of persons to attempt to prohibit or restrain such persons from advertising, from advertising fees or charges, or from making unsolicited approaches for business to potential clients by means of direct mailing or &ldquo;cold calling&rdquo;.  The commission also recommended that a group of such persons may, for the purpose of protecting the repute of the profession, make rules prohibiting advertising or prohibiting direct mailing or &ldquo;cold calling&rdquo; in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The commission concluded by suggesting that prior to introducing the recommended legislation, the Minister might consider inviting the bodies to make the necessary amendments to their respective rules on a voluntary basis, within six months.  My predecessor accepted these recommendations and <Col N="1048" /> gave the bodies a six month period to amend their rules.</P>
    <P>A number of accountancy bodies have indicated their acceptance of the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations and are complying with them.  I am aware that certain other of the accountancy bodies and the engineering bodies did not accept the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission reports, and have not, therefore, desisted from the practices of fixing fees and restricting advertising.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission have recently completed their study into restrictions in the patent and trade marks profession and this is being examined. Reports are awaited on the legal profession, and on architects, surveyors, auctioneers and estate agents.  When all of these reports are to hand, I will then be in a position to introduce whatever legislation is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the bodies concerned have not complied with the six months requirement, is it the Minister's view that the appropriate response to this report is to introduce enabling legislation now and that he could, by order, extend the remit of that legislation to subsequent bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to involve myself in piecemeal legislation in the manner the Deputy has just suggested. However, I assure the Deputy that whatever legislation requires to be enacted will be enacted to deal with the three professions, and I intend to do it globally rather than enacting legislation on a piecemeal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to put some sort of termination date to the voluntary amendment of rules so that he can bring some pressure to bear on these bodies rather than have them waiting until the last minute when legislation is finally got through the draftsman and so on?  Could he consider putting some termination date beyond which legislation will be inevitable if they do not comply voluntarily?</P>

      <P>As I have said, I await the Fair Trade Commission's report in particular on the legal profession.  As regards a termination date, that will be a matter for the legislation itself.  In advance of that I assure the Deputy I am in contact with representative bodies of the various professions with a view to bringing into line those who have not come into line with the commission's recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in respect of export credit insurance policies underwritten by his Department in respect of the export of beef to Iraq in 1987 and 1988, the average amount of cover afforded by such policies as a percentage of the invoice value of the beef exported to that country in those years; and the reason approximately 22 per cent of all the cover afforded by him for all exports of goods and services to all countries was granted to two companies in respect of one product to one high risk country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of indemnity provided for beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988 insured under the export credit scheme was 80 per cent of contract value for contracts with credit terms of 12 months and 70 per cent of contract value for contracts with credit terms of 18 months.  These levels of indemnity were set in 1987.</P>
      <P>The level of cover provided at any one time for any one or a number of markets or for any exporting sector can be determined by such factors as the level of market opportunity available, the capacity of the exporting sector concerned and the assessment of commercial and political risks involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with Iraq, in particular, there is also the additional element of the political goodwill which developed between both countries since the beginning of the eighties which has expressed itself over the years in intensified levels of commercial co-operation.  Indeed, as <Col N="1050" /> a former Minister for Industry and Commerce the Deputy himself led the Irish Government side to the first joint commission with the Iraqis in May 1982 in Baghdad thereby facilitating the development of trade between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Up to early 1983, Iraq had been a good cash customer for Irish exports. However, by 1983 the continuing demands on the Iraqi economy and on its oil exporting capability began to affect its ability to pay cash for imports.</P>
    <P>In June, 1983 the then Government, mindful of the importance of the Iraqi market to Irish exporters, decided that a longer term perspective was necessary in the provision of export credit insurance for exports to Iraq, over and above the normal commercial underwriting considerations. In effect, this amounted to a confirmation of continued confidence in the development of our economic relations with Iraq.  Consistent with this, all cases requiring cover for Iraq required, from that time, prior ministerial approval.  This policy was adhered to by that Government throughout the following years.  Throughout this period increased levels of export credit insurance cover were approved in various correspondence between the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>This Government, when they took up office, decided to implement this policy with a view to continued support for the development of indigenous business, particularly our agri-business, our exports and the creation of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>This policy met considerable success in that Ireland's experience in the area of export credit with Iraq has been that a payment pattern emerged whereby funds were generally remitted to Ireland three to six months after the due date.  In the light of our repayment experience, cover for the market expanded in line with the increased level of business opportunities there.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1987 an increased level of interest in doing business in the market had begun to express itself especially within the beef sector which was reacting to the demonstrated interest <Col N="1051" /> by the Iraqi authorities in Irish meat products.  The main difference between this potential new business and normal applications for export credit insurance was one of volume.  On the other hand, the business involved was such that many downstream benefits would follow for the economy in terms of output, added value, employment and export earnings.</P>
    <P>The element of payment was, of course, important but the fact still remains that Iraq has never defaulted in a trade debt to Ireland.  Indeed, I might take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that to single out one country such as Iraq as being high risk, in a context such as this, cannot be beneficial to our trade and economic relations with that country and can cause apprehension in the minds of other trading partners about the manner in which we conduct our business affairs with them.  For my part, I would like to confirm the Government's confidence in the wellbeing of our economic relations with Iraq.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the two companies which obtained export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq in 1987, I have already outlined the position in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 56 to 59 on 20 April 1989.  The first two companies to apply had, at the time of their applications, firm contracts for the supply of beef to Iraq.  At the same time the total amount of insurance cover sought by these two companies &mdash; when added to existing exposure on the market and allowing for a reasonable level of residual cover for industrial exports &mdash; reached the overall limit set for the market.  Accordingly, it was possible to facilitate only the first two applicant companies with export credit insurance in respect of their firm contracts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got an answer which is extremely important and very lengthy.  Perhaps part of the reason for its length is to conceal some of what it does not answer.  The assertion I have made in the last part of the question &mdash; that 22 per cent of all the cover afforded <Col N="1052" /> for all exports of all goods to all countries ends up covering two companies for one product in one country &mdash; is significant. Would the Minister agree, in view of the answer he has given to the earlier part of the question where he said that there was 80 per cent cover for 12-month credit and 70 per cent cover for 18-month credit, that as a result of that information the excess of insurance cover provided by the Irish Government over our actual exports is greater than was believed to be the case up to now?  That figure now appears to be somewhere in the region of £50 million to £60 million rather than £35 million as previously suggested.  What is the origin of these exports which were covered by us but which, according to our own CSO, did not emanate from this State?  Did that beef come from Northern Ireland, another Community country or somewhere else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has, through various Deputies in the House, had about 24 questions down on this matter.  I have answered continually and said I am continuing to examine the question of the differences between the CSO figures and the insurance figures, in consultation with the CSO, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the exporters.  That examination, which I consider to be very important, as the Deputy apparently does, is ongoing and I should not like to speculate on the outcome of the investigation.  As far as the first part of the question is concerned, in the whole series of questions on exports to Iraq the Deputy seems to be suggesting that in some way favouritism was shown to particular companies.  I would emphasise the policy in relation to exports to Iraq. The following letter was sent in December 1988 to seven companies who indicated an interest in the Iraqi market:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am writing to you in response to your application for export credit insurance for beef sales to Iraq and to convey to you the Minister's decision on your application which has already <Col N="1053" /> been notified to you by telephone on 16 December 1988.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to inform you that on production of a signed/ confirmed contract, he is prepared to consider your application as sympathetically as possible, within the overall limit of national cover established for the Iraq market which is limited.  The Minister wishes to emphasise that the above should not be taken as a commitment to automatically grant the cover sought having regard to the constraint outlined above.</P>
    <P>I assure the House and the Deputy that this is the general policy in relation to all companies and no specific company get particular treatment.  In relation to the overall question on export credit insurance, there are about 450 companies which use the scheme.  They have an approved credit limit for about 20,000 buyers in about 130 markets.  They employ about 40,000 people.  This export credit insurance scheme is a very great help to our export drive and I fail to understand the consistent sniping at it in recent weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no sniping at this scheme.  There is sniping, if it could be called that, at the abuse of the scheme. The letter which the Minister conveniently read out was dated December 1988 after all this had blown up and it was very politic to write such a letter to keep it on the record.  Why does the Minister complain about my describing Iraq as high risk commercially and politically when he himself on 1 January 1989 took Iraq off cover because of the risks involved and because of the non-payment? In the earlier years, 1986, 1987 and 1988, almost all other western European countries, so far as one can judge, had Iraq off cover because the risks were too high.  Notwithstanding that, we ploughed ahead and the State has a potential liability to exporters and banks here in excess of £100 million.  Why did the Minister allow that to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The point to emphasise <Col N="1054" /> is that we have never had Iraq reneging or defaulting on a trade debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">

      <P>There is no question of a roll over.  The Deputy listens to the wrong people &mdash; people who have vested interests &mdash; rather than listening and getting the facts right.  Despite the fact that he put down more than 20 questions in different names he was still not able to read the situation correctly.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that Mr. Finn, senior executive of RTE, indicated to press reporters that they were seeking legal opinion as <Col N="1059" /> to the Minister's right to make an order with regard to some of the charges involved and that it is hardly appropriate to refer to Mr. Finn as &ldquo;some elements within RTE?  Will the Minister also indicate the basis of his conclusion that £440,000 is adequate recompense to RTE for the service provided when RTE were quite adamant that £612,000 was required in order to provide a service on a commercial basis?</P>

      <P>As far as RTE are concerned, obviously they asked for the highest price they thought they would get.  The whole object of putting the section into legislation was to leave room for the Minister of the day to decide between the excessive amount RTE would want to do it on a commercial basis and the minimum the commercial operator would want to pay; and that legislation passed through this House unanimously.  In relation to the charges with RTE I would refer the Deputy to the joint statement from me and the RTE Authority following my meeting with them.  The charges laid down by the Minister will be operated by RTE and the Minister reiterated that these involved no question of a subsidy from RTE to an independent contractor; that a review of the operation of the maintenance will take place after 18 months to ensure that this is so; and the process of finalising the contract between RTE and Century will now proceed.</P>
      <P>In regard to reports in the newspapers about RTE seeking legal advice, I saw the Chairman of the RTE Authority being interviewed and he clarified the position and specifically stated that there was no question at any time of the RTE Authority asking for legal advice in relation to the legal right of the Minister to make a decision.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister inform the House whether the sum eventually settled on was the sum originally sought by RTE?  When I made a statement on this whole matter, the Minister accused me of not having the correct <Col N="1060" /> figures.  He intimated to me that he would supply me with the figures.  To date I have not received them.  Would the Minister now inform the House what RTE sought originally?  Was it more or less than the figure that Century were originally prepared to pay?  I ask because I feel that there are some questions to be answered in relation to this whole affair.</P>

      <P>After I spoke to the Deputy in the corridor of the House, all the information in relation to the figures were public knowledge.  The whole schedule of figures was published.  As to whether they were the exact figures that RTE originally asked for, no they were not; but they were reasonable figures, which involved a payment for access to the RTE facilities in the FM sites and 2 AM sites of £35,000 per annum to increase yearly in line with the consumer price index, in relation to maintenance charges for equipment.  There were other charges and they were all well publicised in the media.  They are not what RTE were looking for but that is exactly what was in mind when the legislation was passed through this House.  The legislation provided that the Minister would decide between the demands of RTE and the offer of the contractor.  The one point I want to emphasise is that there is no question of subsidisation by RTE of the commercial operations.</P>

I want to ensure that they would not be in a position to carriage phone services and so on, which an upgrading of Cablelink would allow, but rather to carriage television services.

      <P>I have said before in replies to similar questions that I would like to see foreign language services on Cablelink and I have made my views known to Cablelink.  However, it is a matter for the company to decide the foreign services it wishes to relay and I have no intention of obliging the company to carry any particular foreign language service.  Given that the number of services available exceeds the capacity of the Cablelink system it is a matter for the company to decide which mix best suits the demands of their customers.  I said in reply to Question No. 95 on 16 November 1988 that Cablelink were considering the possibility of &ldquo;time-shifting&rdquo; certain foreign language programmes.  I understand that the company are still trying to find equipment which would allow them to do this automatically.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why his view has changed since he previously replied to questions on this matter?  He indicated that he would first try to persuade the company, and would consider the possibility of obligation, to carry continental language television services, in view of the importance of foreign languages in the context of 1992.  Why has the Minister hardened his view not to impose an obligation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly because of the present limited capacity of Cablelink. Cablelink are trying to facilitate the TV5 language service by time shifting.  Later relaying is what is involved.  Super Channel which is being taken over by the Italian broadcaster currently carries Italian language programmes throughout the night and that service is also available on Cablelink.  My view is that TV5 should <Col N="1066" /> be carried at some stage but it is a matter of commercial judgement as to when it can be carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many large Irish corporations have not yet established effective 1992 internal committees, notwithstanding the Government's <i>EUROPEN</i> Campaign and the support given by the Taoiseach in July 1988; the steps he proposes to take to ensure that every Irish enterprise likely to be affected by the 1992 process will take the necessary steps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A primary objective of the Government's information campaign on 1992 has been to ensure that every business firm in the country likely to be affected by the fundamental changes which the completion of the internal market will bring are aware of the changes now being put into place which will affect their operations.  To this end both I and my colleagues in Government, in close consultation with the social partners, including the trade unions and employer bodies, have engaged in a systematic series of seminars, meetings and information dissemination to make clear to the business sector the opportunities and the threats which 1992 will bring.  As part of this campaign we have published information leaflets and booklets on the changes being put into place and we have provided a check list of actions which firms should undertake to prepare for 1992.  I am firmly of the view that if firms prepare adequately the completion of the internal market will offer very significant new opportunities for the growth and development of Irish business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must, however, be made perfectly clear that the ultimate responsibility in <Col N="1067" /> preparing for the changes which the completion of the internal market will bring &mdash; which indeed have already started &mdash; rests with each individual firm.  No amount of advice, information and support from the Government and their agencies can substitute for the practical preparations and hard commercial decisions which individual firms must undertake to prepare for the new opportunities and the more intense competition that will arise with the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>As a matter of general operation support from the State industrial promotion agencies is available only to firms which can demonstrate that they have in operation an effective business plan.  Any such plan must now inevitably take into consideration and provide specifically for the changes in the existing and potential markets of the firms that arise from the completion of the internal market.  This is the only practical way the Government and their agencies can bring leverage to bear on individual firms to ensure adequate preparations for 1992 and this approach will be maintained.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the campaign being run by his Department has been largely unsuccessful up to now in that small and medium sized companies are not taking any steps to prepare for 1992?  While I accept that it is their own responsibility to do so can the Minister tell me what steps the IDA are taking to encourage the establishment of linkages between companies in Europe and medium sized companies in this country and if there has been much activity in this area so as to ensure that these companies are strengthened through the formation of partnerships before the advent of 1992?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  There is a great awareness within companies but I would like to see more action being taken by a number of the companies.  I can assure the Deputy that the linkage programme forms a very important part of the IDA's development <Col N="1068" /> work not only within Europe but also outside of it.  I can also assure the Deputy that everything that can be done by the State agencies is being done.  Not only are we using the IDA, we are also using the marketing side of CTT as we can give some of our own companies the benefit of their marketing knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged that many of our companies do not have the necessary management capacity or resources.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the mentor scheme, aimed at helping smaller companies, which has proved very successful.  Under this scheme retired senior executives from a wide range of companies across the country make their time and expertise available to smaller companies.  Of course the IDA are the promoters of that scheme.  In that way we are helping smaller companies.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that the full resources of the agencies concerned will be made available but there are constraints on manpower and there is no point in denying that in the House.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister indicated that the number of persons employed in companies in which NADCORP hold investments is projected to rise to 2,500 over the next three years.  Can the Minister tell us how many jobs have been created over the last three years?</P>

      <P>As I have already said, the information is available in the annual report of NADCORP.  After two years in operation NADCORP are making satisfactory progress overall.  Currently, they hold investments in over 50 smaller companies with a value of around £17 million.  The report for 1987 shows that investments approved by NADCORP between 11 June 1986 and 31 December 1987 totalled £11,416,000.  Investments made in the period 11 June 1986 and 31 December 1987 totalled £10,927,000. Investments held at 31 December 1987 were valued at £12,983,000.  The report also gave details of the 42 companies in which NADCORP held investments at 20 April 1988, including investment transferred from the National Enterprise Agency.  The details of the investments are given.  The actual amount paid for each investment is not disclosed, for very good commercial reasons.  The 1988 report is due to be published in June and it is not my intention to anticipate what may be contained in that report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 39, 51 and 55 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set a target of creating approximately <Col N="1073" /> 20,000 extra jobs in manufacturing industry &mdash; including international services &mdash; on average per year over the next ten years.  Based on the results of end year surveys undertaken by the industrial promotion agencies over 19,500 jobs were created in 1988.  When account is taken of the net increase in temporary employment the target of creating 20,000 extra jobs was fully achieved.  I expect that a similar number of jobs will be created in manufacturing industry in 1989 in line with the targets set in the programme and in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i> Just under 17,000 jobs were created in 1987.</P>
    <P>In relation to job losses the programme indicated that, while the offsetting trend in job losses cannot be foreseen accurately, <Col N="1074" /> the more competitive economic climate and the greater attention being given to the indigenous sector will make existing jobs more secure.  This has been confirmed by the annual employment surveys which indicated that between 1987 and 1988 job losses in the manufacturing sector have fallen by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of job losses there was a net gain in manufacturing and international services employment of over 2,000 in 1988 which compares with a net loss in 1987 of over 5,000.</P>
    <P>A detailed breakdown of the jobs created in 1988 on a county basis is not available.  I am arranging to have circulated with the Official Report a breakdown of the jobs created on a regional and sectoral basis.</P>

      <P>The whole emphasis is on the industrial manufacturing figure which I have just given.  The plan states that some 29,000 jobs are estimated to have been created throughout the whole economy in 1988 and it is my Department's aim to step up the annual rate of job creation on a progressive basis to at least 35,000.  That is part of the whole plan.  As far as the estimates are concerned we believe, in consultation with the social partners, in setting realistic targets that can be achieved rather than the mythical targets which were a feature of <i>Building on Reality</i> with which the Deputy's party &mdash; and he as a Minister of State at the time &mdash; were so closely associated and which was a dismal failure.</P>

That is good news and I am sure the Deputy is as pleased as I am that so many jobs are being created within the economy to give our people at home an opportunity of work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 10, lines 43 to 46 and in page 11, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Whenever it is proposed to make a regulation under this Act, a draft of each such regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the regulation shall not come into effect, until a motion approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this amendment on behalf of The Workers' Party.  I accept the ruling of the Chair that we should take amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and sections 4 and 5 together.  I will be seeking the permission of the Chair to deal with sections 4 and 5 in the course of this debate because The Workers' Party are opposed <Col N="1116" /> to those sections.  The object of the amendment is simple and straightforward and it is similar to amendments that come before the House very frequently.  We are seeking to change the method of dealing with regulations that are drafted by a Minister for the purpose of implementing the minutiae and provisions of a Bill once it has been passed.  We want the regulations to be presented by the Minister to the House and we want the House to ratify them in advance of them becoming law.</P>
    <P>The more popular form nowadays is contained in the Bill in that regulations once made stand unless a nullifying motion is passed within a specified period.  Needless to say for Independent Members, and Members of small parties, this presents difficulties.  Indeed, it presents difficulties for all parties in Opposition because the only time available to them to act against a regulation that is not to their liking is during Private Members' time, a very scarce commodity. That time is valuable and useful to deal with other matters rather than with the specifics of a Bill or regulation introduced by a Minister.  It is our view that because of the importance of the legislation, and because of the impact it will have on the general area of the law, the Minister should present his regulations for debate, comment and, if necessary, amendment in the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need make that case in any greater detail.  I should like to remind the House that many of the Minister's colleagues when presented with this argument, and our form of amendment, readily agreed in the interests of debate and democracy to accept it.  I hope the Minister will accede to our request on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are opposed to section 4.  We are concerned that any regulations introduced under that section should be subjected to the greatest parliamentary scrutiny possible.  I have grave doubts as to whether section 4 is constitutional. It provides for legislation by ministerial regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4, which deals with regulations to remove difficulties, states:</P>
      <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the Minister in seeking to get the legislation up and running encounters any undefined difficulty he may introduce regulations.  In accordance with section 3, those regulations may not be subjected to debate, observation or vote in the House.  The Minister may, courtesy of section 4, consign the Bill to the dustbin, the shelf or wherever one puts something that is not politically expedient.  I have never seen a provision that gives such extraordinary powers to a Minister contained in a Bill.  It appears that those powers allow for legislation by ministerial order.  I have very fundamental questions about that.  I have seen provisions similar to those in section 3 arise virtually in every piece of legislation which has come before the House whereby the Minister in order to implement the minutiae and nuts and bolts of legislation requires regulations to do so, for example, regulations to put the legislation in place, regulations to <Col N="1118" /> establish an office or secretariat, regulations on the rules governing applications to or from the Minister or applications under the sections themselves. All those forms of regulations enable legislation to be put in place but this provision is entirely new.  This section allows the Minister to scrap the Bill entirely from top to bottom merely on the basis of meeting a difficulty or because he might find it expedient to remove the difficulty in whatever way he so decides.</P>
    <P>We will discuss section 4 more fundamentally later on in Committee Stage but I refer to it at this point merely because it is another section which allows for regulations to be made.  The regulations to be made under section 3 will be regulations which in the current form will not place any onus on the Minister to make a presentation to this House of what he intends to do.  This Bill could in fact be set at nought in the Minister's office, and that is certainly not my understanding of the way we as legislators should act.  If section 4 is to remain in the Bill any regulations, because of the importance of this legislation, should come before this House.  I hope the Minister will recognise that fact and agree to accept the amendment I have proposed.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy McCartan.  I suspect that we both take more or less an identical view on the fundamental need for regulations of major substantive importance made under far-reaching legislation, such as this legislation, to come before this House for a vote of approval before they become operative, rather than having this negative procedure whereby the Minister can publish the regulations and place them before the House and then, unless a negative vote is passed within 21 days, they become operative.  There is a slight difference of approach between Deputy McCartan's amendment and the amendment I propose on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill gives the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice and the Central Bank wide powers to make regulations. The powers under section 3 relate to regulations in the strict sense of the term in that they will be regulations to be made for the general purposes of the Bill or will prescribe matters the Bill expressly states should be dealt with by way of regulations.  It is quite normal in major pieces of legislation for some of the substantive procedures which will be applicable to be provided for through ministerial regulations.  I would also <Col N="1120" /> accept that there are regulations which may have to be made under this Bill but which may not be of such large importance as to require on all occasions an approving vote by this House for them and that this House could, in the context of some of the different regulations that may arise to be made, exercise a degree of control by the power conferred by section 3 (4) which would allow the annulling of a regulation within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Under other provisions in the Bill, the regulations which may arise may be so fundamental as to create a situation in which the particular provisions in the Bill may be virtually meaningless until we see the substance of the regulations.  There are provisions in the Bill which could be described as skeletal in that they lay out what is intended generally by the Government and envisage the possibility of a series of safeguards and controls being put into place but which, without those safeguards and controls being put into place it is unknown whether, for example, the consumer may have the protections in reality to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to section 4.  I want to refer to sections 4 and 5 and then go on to refer to other areas in which I think there should be adopted a different approach from that proposed by the Minister.  First, section 3 (4) does not simply relate to section 3.  It relates to all regulations.  This is curious because it would have been expected that the provision in section 3 (4) which lays down the procedure to be applicable to the making of all regulations in the context of a Bill which has a variety of different sections, which gives regulatory powers of different importance under a series of different headings to a variety of different Ministers, would form a separate section in the Bill rather than being subsumed or hidden within section 3.  One suspects that it is hidden within section 3 because section 3 is the more usual, less inoffensive section regarding regulatory powers.  The Minister's regulatory powers under section 3 are constrained by the statutory provisions enacted in this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Sections 4 and 5 are a different kettle of fish altogether.  Both have the extraordinary effect that they appear to envisage that the Minister can, by the issuing of simple regulations, replace both Houses of the Oireachtas and the President in the context of the enactment of legislation.  In other words, instead of amending the legislation after it has been enacted and if amendments are needed, by the bringing before this House of a building societies' amendment Bill, they let the Minister, by ministerial dictate, if you like, produce a regulation which can substantially change any section or subsection in any part of this Bill.  That is to say that the Minister could &mdash; and I am not suggesting that this is his intent &mdash; drive a coach-and-four through the Bill, through all the consumer protections provided in the Bill and through some of the constraints imposed on building societies by the Bill, simply because he thought some of its provisions were giving rise to difficulties in its operation.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that sections 4 and 5 are unconstitutional.  I do not believe it is constitutionally possible for the Houses of the Oireachtas to abdicate their legislative constitutional responsibilities and to hand them over willy-nilly to a Minister or group of Ministers.  I believe there is constitutional precedent in case law for that view.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the powers conferred under sections 4 and 5 are entirely unnecessary and dangerous. They could create circumstances in which a Minister might be under pressure from building societies not to create difficulties. Perhaps building societies want to raise the mortgage interest rate by a couple of percentage points, and the Minister might decide &mdash; perhaps there is a general election approaching &mdash; to be seen putting up the mortgage rate by one or two percentage points as he travels down the road into the last couple of weeks of an election campaign.  So the building societies are called in and they say: Minister, we do not like some of the constraints you have imposed on us under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; for example, in the area of conveyancing &mdash; and we do <Col N="1122" /> not like the way we are being constrained in that we have to keep separate accounts to indicate that we are not using conveyancing as a loss-leading mechanism to get additional loan business, or we do not like the constraints imposed on us with regard to the provision of financial services and we want to involve ourselves in some other areas.  The building societies may say that this section will prevent the provisions of the Bill being properly implemented and they will tell the Minister what they will do.  They will tell him that they postponed increasing the mortgage interest rate by a couple of pecentage points for a couple of months if, by regulations, he will amend the provisions in this Bill they do not like.</P>
    <P>This section is not simply a question of bad drafting.  It is not simply a question of the Minister, his colleagues or their advisers trying to cover up or to make provision for any simple operational difficulty that might arise with its implementation. These particular provisions are political smoking guns which, in the long term, could be misused.  I am not suggesting this Minister would misuse them. I am simply saying it is inappropriate that they be included.  I contend they will leave whoever may be Minister for the Environment following the passage of this Bill open to manipulation at the hands of the building societies in circumstances in which, for political reasons, the Minister may wish to postpone or prevent a mortgage interest increase, when there might have to be some trade-off so that the Minister is not politically damaged at an inopportune time for him by the eventuality of mortgage interest rates increasing.</P>
    <P>I contend sections 4 and 5 in any form should not be included in this Bill.  If there are operational difficulties with this measure due to an express statutory provision contained therein passed by this House, the Minister has the same remedy as all of his current colleagues in Government and all of his predecessors in the Department of the Environment, which is to introduce an amending Bill to remedy that defect.  One does not remedy the defect by way of regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> My initial reaction to section 4 &mdash; in so far as the Minister can, by regulation, vary any provision of this Bill if it creates operational difficulties &mdash; is first, it should not be there; second, I firmly believe it is unconstitutional; and third, I believe it is enacted in its current form and regulations thereunder are made subsequently, they will be found to be unconstitutional if ever challenged.  I believe section 4 should be opposed and should not remain in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I say the same of section 5 which presents a similar problem.  Its provisions stipulate that if there are any modifications of any enactments in force relating to companies or banks, and it appears to the Minister to be expedient to modify the provisions of this Bill for the purpose of assimilating the law relating to building societies to that relating to companies or to banks, the Minister may do so by regulation.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill building societies are neither companies nor banks; they are a curious statutory hybrid.  For example, banks have shareholders, as have companies, and they may be publicly or privately quoted.  By and large banks are quoted on the Stock Exchange; some companies are, some others are not.  If I have deposits in a bank I am not automatically a shareholder. Building societies, as we are establishing them under the provisions of this Bill, are neither one thing nor the other.  The principle of mutuality is gone.  For example, if one is a depositor or has a share investment account apparently one is a shareholder.  Yet, in other ways, one has no involvement in the running of the company at all because it is not a company, it is a building society.  It may be useful for building societies at some stage to want to assimilate their position identically to that of banks and companies. That may be appropriate in the context of a time when their structure is identical to that of banks and companies. However, after the passage of this Bill, their structure will not be identical, although they will be involved in many similar financial areas to those operated <Col N="1124" /> by banks and will be competing with banks.</P>
    <P>I do not see any justification for a provision which allows the Minister, by regulation, to amend portions of this Bill in this way.  I believe section 5 is unconstitutional. I do not believe it will work.  I believe that regulations made thereunder will be challengeable and will be successfully challenged.  Therefore, my second point is that I believe section 5 should not be included at all.  It may be the case that the Minister will not be willing to withdraw sections 4 and 5 but I believe he should.  Indeed, I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to seek to amend them in a way that would render them acceptable.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue at some length on Second Stage.  On the assumption that it may not be possible to get a majority of the Members of this House to vote for the deletion of sections 4 and 5, the next best alternative is by way of amendment No. 2 which I have tabled and which would require any regulations made under sections 4 or 5 to be brought before and seek the express approval of this House before becoming validly enacted regulations under this Bill albeit they may still be unconstitutional.  At least it would leave to this House a positive approval role, not just a negative one.  At least the Houses of the Oireachtas would continue to have some legislative function in the context of building society legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 has a three year time limit in that the Minister can act as sole legislator for three years only.  No doubt that proviso was inserted by the Department or the Attorney General's Office because they had suspicions about the constitutional infirmity of section 4.  I would ask the Minister to place on the record of the House the advice he has received from the Attorney General's Office about section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>Section 5 has no time limit.  We could enact this Bill and, in 20 years' time there could be some change <Col N="1125" /> in company law, pursuant to which the Minister of the day could amend this legislation by way of regulation.</P>
      <P>First, I contend these sections should not be included and, second, if they are included, at the very minimum, they should require an affirmative vote of this House to accept regulations.</P>
      <P>I might refer to the second part of amendment No. 2.  That deals with sections 31 and 32 which no doubt will be discussed at greater length later, so I shall not enter into a lengthy discussion of them now.  Suffice it to say that section 31 extends to building societies powers to engage in conveyancing.  The provisions of section 32 extend to building societies powers to provide auctioneering services. There are a number of curious factors about both those sections but we shall deal with them in detail later on.</P>
      <P>One of the claims made for section 31 is that its provisions will render conveyancing a great deal cheaper and more efficient, resulting in the home purchaser having to incur less outlay and expenses when purchasing a home.  Section 31 recognises something very fundamental, which is that conflicts of interest can arise specifically between lending institutions, in this instance the building societies, and the borrower.  It recognises that there can be a whole series of conflicting circumstances and, in the context of the Minister's approach to this legislation, even if building societies are empowered to engage in conveyancing, regulations need to be made to provide a whole series of protections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, I went into some detail on the areas in which it is envisaged protections may be required, and I intend to pursue that further when we deal with the detail of section 31.  The reality is that section 31 is so vaguely put together that it is not known what meat will be put on it by the regulatory powers the Minister has taken to himself pursuant to that section.  That section should not come into force until regulations are enacted, otherwise building societies may be carrying out conveyancing without any of the consumer protections put in place that are necessary.  Because of the <Col N="1126" /> importance of ensuring that protections are there for the community, and because of the importance of ensuring what the Minister believes to be the objective of this provision is attained, I do not believe section 31 should come into force without this House seeing the detail of the proposed protections the Minister wants to put in place to protect the house purchaser. Accordingly, I believe that should require an express approval order from this House for regulations.</P>
    <P>The same applies to estate agents.  The Minister envisages building societies playing the role of estate agents and provides for the enactment of regulations to provide a variety of protections for the general public and the consumer.  We do not know the detail of those protections. In parts of sections 31 and 32 it goes beyond mere regulatory powers.  The regulations that will have to be made will fundamentally impact on the nature of the services that building societies, after the passage of this legislation, will be empowered to provide and will fundamentally impact on the effectiveness of any protections put in place for the general public and the consumer.  It is not appropriate that regulations of such a fundamental nature simply be published by the Minister and, unless negatived within 21 days, become part of our law.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, amendment No. 2 is designed to ensure that if we are stuck with sections 4 and 5, any regulations made must get the approval of the House and on the basis that sections 31 and 32 will, in some shape or form, remain part of the Bill, the regulations made under those sections must get approval.  Ultimately, amendment No. 3, which I am referring to in this context, provides that none of the regulations made under sections 4, 5, 31 or 32 and laid before the House will become operative without the approval of the House, and that neither sections 31 or 32 at a later stage should come into force until the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would have a detailed response to these issues. I am disappointed he has not sought to deal with them in his amendments <Col N="1127" /> because they were raised at great length on Second Stage.  These are not simply technical or harping objections or criticisms, they are of fundamental importance in the enactment of this legislation. In the context of sections 4 and 5, the use of those sections could fundamentally change this Bill to the extent that all the consideration we will give to all the sections later in this Bill could, ultimately, become irrelevant because the Minister would arrogate to himself under these sections powers to amend any particular provision in the Bill that he saw fit to change following the Bill's enactment.</P>

      <P>I hope that will not be the practice that has been followed here for the last few pieces of legislation that we have been talking about, otherwise we will be here until the end of the year without a single section being passed.  If that is the attitude Deputies are going to start the day with, then so be it, but I do not think it is the way to get through legislation which has been called for and to which everybody has already given their approval on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not get into an argument at this stage about that.  This is the first Minister for the Environment who had the courage to introduce this Bill.  Many people have been talking about this for a long time.  It is huge complex legislation and it took some time to draft it and it took me a while to consider it.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If amendment No. 1 on section 3 (4) was accepted it would result in all regulations to be made under the Bill coming before the Dáil and the Seanad for discussion and approval prior to their implementation.  Given the ongoing large programme of primary legislation that has to be dealt with, I do not regard the amendment as realistic.  It certainly runs <Col N="1128" /> contrary to many of the demands made on the House at other times about the slowness and the lack of legislation being promoted through the House.</P>
    <P>The whole legislative process would become a logjam while the implementation of primary legislation and policies would be delayed and disrupted by a plethora of relatively minor matters. Deputy Shatter alluded to this and said that the House could end up dealing with nothing but regulations and that legislation might never become operative or effective.  This would run contrary to the stated aims of all sides of the House over the past couple of years.  Apart from those practical problems which the amendment would give rise to, I do not think the arguments put forward are well founded.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (4), regulations under the Bill will have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and Members of either House will have an opportunity to put a motion to annul the regulations. From listening to Deputy McCartan, one would suspect that this was being done in a hidden way.  That is not the case.  That is not the case as it applies to this legislation or, indeed, to any other legislation for that matter.  The Members of the House do have the opportunity to annul regulations if they choose to do so.  Secondly, regulations under this section cannot go beyond the specific powers conferred by the provisions of the Bill. Thirdly, the procedure proposed in section 3 (4) is not new.  One would feel from listening to some of the contributions &mdash; and it is not only in relation to this legislation but a number of other items of legislation with which I have been associated recently &mdash; that something new is being adopted by the Government in dealing with the whole procedure of regulations attached to legislation.  That is not so.  It is a well established practice in legislation and it has served legislation well down through the years.</P>
    <P>Finally, regulations under the Bill will be the subject of discussions and consultations between the relevant regulation making authorities &mdash; that is, the <Col N="1129" /> Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice as well as the Central Bank.  All that discussion and consultation would have to go on, particularly in this legislation, it is not confined to the Minister for the Environment.  It is wrong to suggest, as Deputy Shatter did, that the Minister for the Environment in some way is going to manhandle all this subsequently by way of regulation.  Consultations are laid out, and particularly with relevance to the Central Bank and this makes it a very safe way of doing business as far as I am concerned and as far as the regulations attached to this legislation are concerned. All in all, when I consider those three items, I am satisfied that section 3 (4) is the proper and efficient way in which to deal with matters which the Bill require to be dealt with by regulation.</P>
    <P>There was reference to amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  If those amendments were accepted the same would apply: they would result in regulations under sections 4, 5, 31 and 32 having to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for formal approval before they could be brought into operation.  The same arguments made on amendment No. 1 would apply here.  Given the fact that the regulations must be laid before the House thereby giving Deputies and Senators an opportunity to put down a resolution annulling the draft regulations, and that the regulations must accord strictly with the relevant provisions of the Bill, I do not think it is necessary to require that the regulations should await positive approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas every time a Minister, after consultation with the other relevant Ministers and the Central Bank, decides to have regulations applied to the legislation. It would be a guaranteed method of making the thrust of the legislation non-effective.  It would slow up the whole process and logjam the House to a terrible degree.  That must be appreciated by everyone.</P>
    <P>Any regulations or provisions of regulations that are likely to be controversial or have major implications for particular groups will be identified well in advance <Col N="1130" /> by those likely to be affected.  From listening to some of the people who have contributed already one would be suspicious that the people who would be affected would not have full knowledge of what was being attempted by the Minister by way of regulations.  We all know that the regulations are laid before the House and particular groups in our society are well accustomed and are well aware of everything that happens so far as the legislation is concerned.  These items would be identified well in advance by those who would be likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>The section, as drafted, allows ample opportunity for Members in either House to put down a resolution annulling the regulations.  While that might not happen too often, the facility is there should an individual or a party wish to utilise it.  Maybe it is not used too often, and perhaps that is an indication of the satisfactory way in which legislation is dealt with here in the first instance.  To suggest that the regulations in some way are intended to escape the knowledge of either the Members of the House or the people, the organisations and the interests they represent is going too far as far as I am concerned and does not stand up.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to section 4. This section has been opposed by Deputies De Rossa and Shatter.  It is well to remember that it simply provides a mechanism whereby the Minister could, by regulation, modify a provision of this Bill if a difficulty arose in bringing it into operation.  It could not and would not be used, as some Deputies seem to suggest, to change the intent of the Bill as passed by the Oireachtas.  How could it?  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility with a Bill as large and complex as this which covers so many different areas, that unforeseen technical difficulties might arise in bringing a particular provision into effect.  For example, it could transpire that the provisions in relation to meetings of societies, or the election of directors, or the preparation of annual accounts could contain some relatively minor provision which could create undue practical difficulty for societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> In section 4 I provide the straightforward method of dealing with such technical problems, no more or less than that, without the need of amending primary legislation.  I suggest it is reasonable. If one were to concede the point that there should be amending of primary legislation every time a minor technical difficulty arose in the implementation and effective use of the legislation, that would be intolerable.  If one were to multiply that across the board as regards the arrangements for any other legislation, if Deputy McCartan had his way, the total time of the House would be concerned with moving amending legislation for trivialities &mdash; perhaps not trivial to the people involved, but in so far as our understanding of minor matters is concerned, it would be totally out of proportion to the importance attached.  That is why section 4 is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  The Valuation Act, however, had a particular relevance to all the matters that we would be contemplating here as being important.  This section does not go even as far as some of the provisions in the same Canals Act and the Farm Tax Act.  Both of those Acts allow regulations to amend other enactments.  It should also be noted that the provision lapses after three years, as Deputy Shatter rightly remarked.</P>
      <P>A matter was raised not too audibly by Deputy Quinn but it was audible enough for the Minister to hear so far as the constitutionality of the section is concerned. This matter was checked consequent on its being raised at some length on Second Stage.  Very careful note was taken of all matters raised on Second Stage.  Because of the large number of matters involved it took a little time to get them together.  The matter of constitutionality was checked legally to be absolutely sure and my best legal advice is that there is no constitutional difficulty attaching.</P>
      <P>Section 5, I understand, is also being discussed with this section.  The concerns expressed on this section are not well founded.  After all, this is quite a narrow provision which could permit the Minister for the Environment to apply to building societies relevant future changes which the Oireachtas could make to company and banking law.  Many of the provisions in the Bill parallel similar existing or proposed provisions in the Companies and Central Bank Acts.  The Minister would not be allowed to break new legal ground, as it were, but a mechanism would be provided whereby laws already adopted by the Oireachtas could be readily applied to the societies.  Some of those laws have not yet been passed by the Oireachtas and may be adjusted or amended here.  The facility allows it to be possible for the Minister to apply that legislation, or the legislation in its amended form, to the societies also. Surely that must be seen by all concerned as a sensible approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> All that would be permissible by regulations under section 5 is the modification of provision in this Bill to bring them into line with changes that have been adopted in company and banking law. This provision is particularly relevant at present because extensive new company and banking legislation is before the House.  It is quite possible &mdash; indeed, one could say it is probable &mdash; that the House will make changes in one or both of those pieces of legislation.  It is wise &mdash; in fact, it is very important &mdash; that it would be parallelled in this legislation because of the very close relationship between Central Bank legislation and building societies legislation proposed here.  That is why I gave an undertaking that when the Central Bank legislation was going before the House, the building societies legislation would run in tandem with it.  That is our intention and I think the Whips agreed that that is good.  In fact, the parties recommended that on Second Stage. There may very well be amendments accepted, promoted, in either piece of legislation and they would have to apply in a very particular and special way to the building societies legislation.  I want to have the three pieces of legislation in parallel and this is the facility to allow the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be passed before the other two; that is the likelihood as things stand at the moment in the Order of Business.  It hardly seems necessary that I would have to come back to the House in those circumstances.  It would be too much to suggest that if those changes took place in any of that legislation, and if this Bill were cleared through the House in advance of them, amending legislation would need to be made.</P>
    <P>It was suggested &mdash; I think by Deputy Shatter on Second Stage &mdash; that this section might not stand up to close constitutional scrutiny.  That matter was also checked.  I must put on the record that the legal advice is that the approach is not constitutionally objectionable.  In those circumstances I would ask that the Deputies might reconsider their position and to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the advice I have received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I waited to hear what the Minister had to say in regard to this matter.  I am not unduly concerned about section 3 although it is not ideal, and I am not unduly concerned about section 5 because there are limitations on it but, quite frankly, the Minister's defence of section 4 is not at all adequate.  Section 4 is a very unique piece of legislation which will run into severe difficulties in the court, in my opinion.  Sometimes claims are made here from Opposition benches that something might not be constitutional. We get reassuring paternalistic statements from Ministers saying that the legal advice is that it is all right.  Everyone is supposed to take that as holy writ, therefore you are not supposed to pursue it or you are in some way unreasonable if you do.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise how frequently nowadays the courts keep declaring unconstitutional legislation passed by this House?  The number of such cases in the last couple of years I believe has been somewhere between 12 and 15 each year, so much so that Deputy Kelly, who only recently produced the second edition of his large volume of the Constitution, had last year to produce a supplement to it because, although it was only three years old at the time, there were already more than 200 new decisions relating to different aspects of the Constitution.  A week or two ago I saw a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of some further Act declared unconstitutional and it merited just a few paragraphs because it is no longer an uncommon thing to happen.  We can take it that the rate at which the courts will declare various legislation, both contemporary and older, to be unconstitutional will be quite considerable.  The kind of assurances given by the Minister that he got it right in his Department, and it was all right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Legal advice, yes. That has no standing at all.  I do not want to be personal about the Department of the Environment but I would respectfully draw the Minister's attention to the fact <Col N="1135" /> that the legal section of that Department and the Supreme Court do not seem to be on the same wavelength as far as the Constitution is concerned.  For example, there has been a celebrated difference of opinion on the extent of the protection of the right to private property in the Constitution where the Supreme Court obviously do not take the same view as has been the traditional view within the legal section of the Department of the Environment.  We have all suffered greatly by that.</P>

      <P>Surprisingly, the Minister quotes three precedents for this section 4.  I will have to go and check them because they do not seem to be noticed if they existed, but I make the comment on them that they are all of very recent origin which makes them a little suspect because it means they have not been challenged in the courts as yet.  I do not see that the Farm Tax Act, 1985 is of much value to the Minister as it is repealed.  Neither do I think that the Canals Act, 1986 is of much significance because that legislation really has very little effect on anyone other than the Board of Works presumably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Valuation Act, 1987 could be significant and I would like to take a look at it, but I doubt very much if these three Acts have yet been challenged in the courts.  It would be interesting to see the outcome because the facility with which the courts are declaring different pieces of legislation unconstitutional at the moment is considerable indeed.  I would not like to be backing section 4 of this Bill because I do not think it will survive.</P>
      <P>I would not put section 5 in the same category because the power to amend there is confined only to bringing it into line with whatever changes have been made in company law and banking law. That is fair enough.  The Minister cannot go beyond whatever changes are made, so our delegating to him the power to make changes is done within very clearly defined parameters.  I think the High Court and Supreme Court would find that acceptable and the measures would not be looked on as the Oireachtas abdicating its responsibility under the Constitution. As with section 3, I think the type of amendment Deputy Shatter proposes is right.  I agree with the Minister that there will have to be a huge number of regulations under this, and if everyone would have to be positively passed here before it would come into operation, that is going too far.  There would be a huge volume of them.  Deputy Shatter's suggestion that regulations under sections 4, 5, 31 and 32 should be positively passed and that the others should operate as they are in the Bill under section 3 (4) in the negative fashion is a satisfactory compromise.  I recommend that to the Minister because the very controversial provisions are going to be under those four sections.  They are very difficult, and I think that is a good compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister really will have to take a look at section 4.  There is not much good in this House passing this on a vote if it is going to go anyway.  Things have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court that certainly are not as offensive to the basic rights of citizens or <Col N="1137" /> to the legislative rights of the Oireachtas as this is.  There have been quite a number of cases dealing with the purported exercise of powers of delegation which have been found unsatisfactory.  Let us look at section 4 on its own.  Suppose you were to make a minor change in it and instead of saying: &ldquo;If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation .... the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty&rdquo;, you were to change the word &ldquo;this&rdquo; into &ldquo;any&rdquo; and apply that test: &ldquo;If any difficulty arises in the operation of any Act the Minister shall by regulation change it as it seems to him to be expedient&rdquo;.  Or, let us say, substitute the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; for &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and then this House and the House upstairs and the gentleman in the Phoenix Park could all gracefully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;go home because they would have no function.  By changing a couple of words in section 4 you could abolish the entire constitutional legislative function of the Oireachtas.  That is ridiculous and I think it is the way the High Court would look at it.  They would not go along with it. That is what you might have seen in Eastern Europe pre-<i>perestroika</i> or pre-<i>glasnost.</i> It is going too far.</P>

      <P>You would still find it in Panama and maybe in Paraguay, Mark II, but it is not acceptable here and I do not think it will be found to be compatible with our Constitution.  the test is: do not take it literally as it is there, just change a few words; change &ldquo;this&rdquo; into &ldquo;any&rdquo; and change &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; into &ldquo;the Taoiseach&rdquo; and then pass it and the Taoiseach of the day would have power to change in any way he wanted any legislation that had been passed by this House. <Col N="1138" /> The word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; is not defined in this section, therefore the question of what is or is not a difficulty in the operation of an Act is a subjective thing so far as the Minister is concerned.  That is not good enough.  This is a regulatory Bill to regulate the operation of building societies.  They are vast institutions now, by our little standards anyway, with assets of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some of them have assets of billions of pounds, and proportionately within Ireland they are very big even though by world standards they are tiny.  Therefore, they are very powerful within Ireland.  If they were to go to a nice Minister who likes to be helpful to everybody and explain to him behind closed doors that a difficulty within the meaning of section 4 had arisen &mdash; in other words, that they do not like the regulations because they are too stringent and they would like things freed up, with no control and much easier operation for the big boys &mdash; and if the Minister could be convinced that there was a difficulty in relation to the operation of a provision of this Act, he could remove the regulation.  What is the point of bringing in regulatory legislation if the regulations which bite and actually control can be regarded as difficulties in the operation of the Act?  If there is a difficulty which is acting in a way which is restraining the proper exercise of commercial freedom by a building society, the Minister should have to come to this House and say that he has listened to the building societies saying that this provision is inhibiting them wrongly and he should suggest a change to the House.  If the House is satisfied, it will change it. That would be open and above board, but it is questionable whether it should be done privately.  I do not think it should operate that way.  It should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would love to read the opinion of the Attorney General on this matter.  I think he would find it very hard to go along with it.  To try to cut down they have put a three-year time limit on it.  If this is as necessary as the Minister says, it should not have a three-year time limit.  The three-year limit was put in to give the High Court the impression that this is <Col N="1139" /> temporary, that it should not be judged as permanent law would be and that the same criteria should not be applied to it.  That is not sufficient.  If there are all these precedents, are there simlar time limits on the others?  I presume not.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is very doubtful and the Minister should withdraw it.  He can justify section 5, and with the amendment suggested to it section 3 can be justified. These are three important sections because there will have to be many regulations made and we cannot be unreasonable in regard to them.  With respect, the Minister is unreasonable in insisting on section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not making the kind of progress I should like to see.  I will try to be as concise as possible.  We have 120 sections to go.  This Bill was over a year later than the industry expected, through no particular fault on anybody's part and 1992 will not be deferred to accommodate us.  It behoves this House to move as fast as possible in getting this legislation enacted.  Then the real work will start when the Department write the regulations.  Somebody in the Department is looking for belt, braces, and suspender belts in relation to section 4.</P>
      <P>I would concur with the analysis by Deputy O'Malley.  I would not be in favour of the standard Workers' Party resolution <i>vis-à-vis</i> the regulations until such time as this House improves its own efficiency.  To give one example, it takes 20 or 25 minutes to vote when we should be able to do it within three to five minutes by way of electronic mechanism. Until such time as there is general Dáil reform we do not have the luxury of every regulatory provision coming before the House and being subject to a motion of affirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the amendment to section 3, I fully support Deputy Shatter's request.  Lest the Minister argue that this will unnecessarily tie up the time of the House, provoke delays and make the business of the House cumbersome, there is a provision whereby the Whips <Col N="1140" /> can agree that an order will be taken without debate.  It is sensible because it does not take up any time.  Regularly this House takes items without debate.  The argument may be that we cannot have affirmation by way of motion of a regulation to give effect to any one of these four sections because of the possibility of delays, but if the regulation is a reasonable one it can be put through without debate once people have had a look at it.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have the task not just of making law but of scrutinising the enactment of laws by the Executive.  A lot of what the Administration does, provided people are aware of it, is not subject to negative obstruction.  In many cases it is positively encouraged.  I do not see why the Administration fear a request for an affirmation by way of motion of regulations in areas which will be in some dispute.</P>
    <P>A potential difficulty in section 4 has been identified.  I will not repeat what Deputy O'Malley said so succinctly.  Let us suppose in the liberalisation of the operation of building societies certain changes are required involving work practices linked to a productivity deal or a request for an increase in money and that the staff refuse to undertake these new work practices unless they get an increase in money.  Consequently the representatives of the big five building societies, who are not noted for their shyness or lack of access to the Custom House under its present incumbent, might say that they cannot make this section work because of a &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;.  The difficulty might be the rather truculent attitude being adopted by some members of MSF. Would the Minister be empowered to introduce a regulation that would remove that difficulty?  What would removing that difficulty amount to?</P>
    <P>I am deliberately making the extreme argument in order to draw attention to the possibility that in some circumstances this could be seen by the Supreme Court as being in conflict with the Constitution. The time-table of three years indicates that this is seen as a transitional section. The Department wisely anticipate that there may be unforeseen problems and <Col N="1141" /> they want a certain degree of flexibility in responding.  They are stating with a degree of humility that there are 120 sections in this Bill which they think address all the problems but they are not 100 per cent sure and they want an expansion joint built into the legislation to accommodate unforeseen problems.  I have no problem with that concept.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of positive common sense in the making of law.  If the Minister wants the House to agree to that degree of flexibility, there should be a corresponding counter balance in that he should let us have sight of the regulations before proceeding.  I would earnestly ask the Minister to consider this point.  I would not necessarily expect him to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment now but I would ask him to consider it because it is a reasonable counterbalance to what the Minister is seeking, which in some respects could be a blank cheque.  Not all of the Minister's successors will be as reasonable, balanced, sane, mature and wise.  There could be a change of Government after 15 June.  This House is at the mercy of the lowest common denominator in politics, not of the current distinguished holder of that office who resides in the Custom House.  That is another good reason for looking for this trade.</P>
    <P>I will not take up the time of the House in relation to section 5 because broadly speaking I agree with the analysis put forward by Deputy O'Malley.  We are, in essence, going to agree the sections through the relevant Companies Act and the changes in the Central Bank Bills as they go through.  Therefore, the requirement for a democratic scrutiny will prevail. Again there is the argument in relation to bringing forward the regulations and how the Minister is to align the operation of a particular section in the Building Societies Act with the Companies Act.  I commend the Minister for seeking this kind of flexibility because lack of it has in the past prevented necessary legislation coming forward at the appropriate time; but there is a <i>quid pro</i><Col N="1142" /><i>quo</i>, that of bringing forward the regulations.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating my refutation of what I think is the standard argument of defence: regulations coming before the House do not necessarily have to take up the time of the House but can be taken by agreement without debate if, having had sight of them, all of the parties and Members are satisfied that they are a reasonable response by the Minister of the day to difficult circumstances.  On those grounds I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment in the name of Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the Minister's reply to the propositions put forward by me in pursuing The Workers' Party amendment, No. 1.  I do not believe that volume of work is a basis on which to abandon principle in this House.  The fact that our procedures are outmoded, inefficient or whatever should never be seen to be taking away from the basic principle which is, that if we are going to give effect to important legislation by way of regulation, this House must have the opportunity to scrutinise, debate and, if necessary, vote on those regulations in due course.</P>
      <P>I agree with the suggestions that have been made as to ways of tackling the enormity of the task.  There is a possibility of appointing a special committee of the House to look at regulations.  It has been agreed that the parties might well agree, having had sight of the regulations, that there is no contest and that the matter can be tabled without debate or the guillotine used so that we can get on with the business without difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are too easily abandoning an important principle.  Deputy Shatter's amendment is being commended by the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party as perhaps preferable.  If, at the end of the day, that is the one we stand on, The Workers' Party will have no problem in supporting it.  If the Minister were to give some indication that he would have fair regard to amendment No.3, I would certainly withdraw amendment No. 1 in favour of it. <Col N="1143" /> Let me make the point before we finish on this: the vast bulk of regulations of whatever hue or complexity introduced under this new Act will be under sections 4, 5, 31 and 32.  So The Workers' Party will not be conceding a lot by abandoning amendment No. 1 &mdash; the general principle &mdash; to the more expedient, perhaps more tidy one, amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>The Bundestag of Germany have a special committee of that House which deals with every regulation, directive and resolution that emanates from the European Parliament and, within a time period of, I think, six months, they can scrutinise, report on and recommend necessary legislation to implement and deal with the workings of the European Parliament as it effects the national law in Germany.  That is the kind of workload they are prepared to undertake.  They are not prepared, as we are here, to allow every directive of the European Cabinet to pass into the national law by ministerial regulation.  That is the sort of job we are supposed to be getting on with here.</P>
    <P>This legislation is fundamental and represents a major departure in the area of building society law and the related areas of auctioneering and conveyancing.  It has been suggested here that because it might represent a heavy workload it would not be right for us to have regard to the regulations if and when they are introduced. Last year when we were dealing with the Intoxicating Liquor legislation the Minister accepted amendments and brought in the regulations to implement those provisions; and we spent time discussing the number of washhand basins a restaurant should have for males and females, as the case might be, the number of chairs to be provided and the area for people to stand in as they have their pre-dinner drinks.  All parties contributed and we dealt with it in a very short time.  If we can find the time to debate those matters, this House has an obligation and a duty to find the time to deal with the regulations the Minister will introduce under this legislation.  I do not accept the suggestion that all regulations must clutter the House.  We can find some <Col N="1144" /> mechanism to put those that are not contentious through without debate and find time to look at those that should be debated.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Minister's provision allows only for annulment of a regulation.  We are notified that the regulations are made.  We are not circulated; it is a matter for us to search out the regulation and, if we are not happy with any aspect, the option is a motion to annul the regulation in its entirely.  The section does not allow an opportunity to amend.  That is a wholly unsatisfactory way to deal with such regulations.  There may be aspects of such regulations that are not satisfactory or that may worry us. We might be in agreement with 90 per cent of them yet our only option is to put down a motion to annul the regulation in its entirety.  This is not satisfactory and it is all the more reason the Minister must listen to what we are saying here.  Let us forget about the suggestion that there is suspicion on this side of the House.  There is not.  We are talking about doing our job as legislators and being true to our obligations.</P>
    <P>The other argument the Minister makes is that the legislation is innocuous specifically because the powers are delimited to the sections within the Act and he cannot provide regulations above and beyond what is already laid down in the section set out seriatum in the Bill. That is clearly not so.  Section 4 is a writ for the Minister to do whatever he wants with regard to this legislation.  The Minister is in no way limited under section 4. It is open to him to regulate his way out of any difficulty that might be presented by the building societies in particular or anybody who wants to lobby him.  There is no limit in section 4 and that is a major worry.  That is not suspicion; I am merely talking about the way we as legislators interpret this Bill and how it may work.</P>
    <P>We have to put this legislation into context.  There are major competing interests such as the Law Society, the lawyers, the building societies, and auctioneers and invariably there will be an invasion with the approach of 1992. One only has to look to the neighbouring <Col N="1145" /> jurisdiction to see how this type of legislation has operated there.  A degree of competition, practice and malpractice has arisen.  The abuse of people's interests has been well documented in terms of this amalgam of building societies, conveyancing and auctioneering properties all in one.  I am not saying that will necessarily happen here.  There are very useful regulations and constrictions in the Bill and those of us who have looked at this legislation carefully are most particular that those constrictions and regulations remain, but that will not happen if section 4 remains in the Bill and certainly not if section 3 is coupled with it.  We have no opportunity to debate the regulations or deal with them here. Let us learn lessons from what has happened elsewhere when similar legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>It is possible that great pressure will build up with regard to this legislation. Huge lobby interests will bear down on the office of the Minister and it is not acceptable that all those issues can be dealt with in the office of the Minister by way of regulation.  I do not accept the Minister's second point that he is in some way delineated.  I accept it with regard to section 3 but not if section 3 is coupled with section 4.  Section 31 provides for the introduction of conveyancing.  Very wide-ranging powers are given to the Minister under that section.  He is allowed to deal with the matter by regulation. While parameters are laid down, they are extremely wide but are nothing compared to the provisions in section 3. The same applied to section 32 with regard to the auctioneering authorities.  I do not accept the suggestion that the Minister is very much constrained by the limits of the Bill, under sections 4, 31 and 32.  The range is so vast&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The third point raised by the Minister was that in implementing regulations he would have discussions <Col N="1146" /> with the authorities concerned, the Central Bank, the building societies and so on.  Why not have discussion and debate with the Members of this House, the legislators?  Why are we not involved in the process?  The Minister can take time and use the energies of his Department in debating and discussing the matter outside of the House but we say, come into the House and debate them here if necessary.</P>
      <P>Finally, I thank the Minister for the precedents he says exist for this type of legislation.  I have grave doubts about these issues.  They have been well ventilated by other Deputies who have vast experience in the area of law as practitioners and as academics, and I will not go into that but I will certainly be looking at the three examples the Minister quoted.  The arguments he advanced do not convince me that we should abandon the amendments being pursued here.</P>
      <P>I stand by amendment No. 1 in the name of The Workers' Party because the principle is important but there appears to be consensus that we accept amendment No.3 in preference on the basis that the sections to which it refers are crucial and the most important in the legislation.  I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment No. 1 on the basis that the Minister would give serious consideration before Report Stage to adopting an amendment along the lines contained in amendment No. 3.  Otherwise, I hope Deputy Shatter will push his amendment.  The indications are that there is sufficient support on this side to allow our will to prevail on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies O'Malley, McCartan and Quinn for the support they have expressed for amendments Nos. 2 and 3 which are linked.  I want to assure Deputy McCartan that I intend to push my amendment this evening if the Minister is not prepared to accept it.  The Minister's response was most disappointing. He used the argument against Deputy McCartan's amendment that if every regulation had to come into this House to be debated first or for an approval motion, the work of the House would become log-jammed.  I accept that it is not always necessary to bring legislation, in respect of which regulations may be appropriate, before the House for approval motions.  Indeed, if we had reformed the structures of this Parliament we would have a separate Oireachtas committee through which all regulations such as EC or ministerial regulations would be processed and possibly would require approval.  In that way there would be a true degree of accountability and scrutiny of the massive numbers of regulations produced by way of statutory instruments by different Ministers, but we do not do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to use the same argument as regards amendment No. 2. As other Deputies have said, that amendment is more specific.  It confines the need for approval motions to four particular areas, to regulations made under sections 4, 5, 31 and 32.  Unless the Minister has a raft of prepared amendments under sections 4 and 5 that none of us know anything about &mdash; on the assumption that these sections are there bona fide for the reason the Minister describes, in case there is some minor operational matter that needs to be put right &mdash; I do not really understand how accepting amendment No. 2 could portend the House being clogged up for months to come in processing regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a specific precedent for what is proposed in amendment No. 2, that is, a provision contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Under that Act the Minister for Justice was given regulatory powers subject to the negative veto as is contained in this Bill.  Deputy Woods who <Col N="1148" /> was then spokesperson on justice, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, made exactly the same point on that issue as I am making on this one, which is that the regulations are so important as to require debate and approval in this House.  The then Coalition Government agreed to amend the Criminal Justice Bill and the necessary amendment was made by the Government on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I invited the Minister to bring this amendment before the House but he has not done so.  This is an important amendment.  It is about issues which are of some considerable importance in the context of the Bill.  It is a safeguard mechanism in the context of how the Bill will operate.  In particular it ensures that any changes made under sections 4 and 5 do not fundamentally encroach on the intent of the Bill and that sections 31 and 32 will not come into being until the relevant protections that the Minister appears to think are necessary are probably in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that all these regulations he intends to introduce may be discussed with particular groups.  In my time in this House, I have never heard of any Government publishing draft regulations for informal discussion by Members of this House prior to presenting them as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  It is not acceptable for the Minister to say that he will have talks with the building societies or whoever may be affected by this legislation behind the scenes, that if regulations are introduced they will be all right and we will not have to worry about them.  We as legislators have a role to play.</P>
    <P>I specifically asked the Minister to tell us what advice he received from the Attorney General's Office.  The Minister said that he has been advised that the approach adopted in sections 4 and 5 is not constitutionally objectionable.  I want to know whether he received that advice from the Department of the Environment or the Attorney General's Office.  We have been talking about the constitutionality of section 4.  If it is unconstitutional even amendment No. 2 would not solve that problem although it <Col N="1149" /> would at least give this House an active role.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a Supreme Court case, Cityview Press <i>versus</i> An Chomhairle Oiliúna, reported in the Irish Reports, 1980, page 381.  In that case the Supreme Court discussed the powers of the Oireachtas to delegate legislative functions to Ministers or outside bodies and whether it was constitutional to do so. The Supreme Court formulated a general test and said:</P>
    <P>The test, in the view of this Court, is whether what is challenged as an unauthorised delegation of parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself.  If it be, then it is not authorised, for such would constitute a purported exercise of legislative power by an authority which is not permitted to do so under the Constitution.  On the other hand, if it be within the permitted limits &mdash; if the law is laid down in the statute and details only filled in or completed by the designated Minister or subordinate body &mdash; there is no unauthorised delegation of legislative power.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 4 the details are not filled in.  The law is not laid down beyond saying that the Minister could correct anything needed for operational purposes. It would seem that, if one were to apply the test enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Cityview Press case, there is an unauthorised delegation of power in section 4.  I would accept that this is more debatable in relation to section 5 as there would be some constraints.  Both sections, in particular section 4, raise serious constitutional issues.  I want to know whether it was the Attorney General's Office or the Department of the Environment who gave the Minister the advice he referred to and I ask the Minister to indicate how he reconciles the views expressed in the Cityview Press case with the legal advice he has obtained.</P>
    <P>The broad range of powers being conferred on the Minister in sections 4 and <Col N="1150" /> 5 differ substantially in substance from those contained in the Valuation Act and the Canals Act which deal with more particular and specific issues.  They have not been challenged as yet in the courts. That is relatively recent legislation.  As this legislation is a good deal more controversial and would apply far more widely it is far more likely to be challenged. I invite the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  On a number of occasions the Minister has indicated that he wants Members on this side of the House to contribute positively. Amendment No.2 is not an attack on the Minister's legislative prerogative, rather it is designed to improve the Bill.  The same applies in respect of amendment No.3.  They are designed to improve something which I suspect is unconstitutional and will improve it to the extent that the House would have a specific role &mdash; to authorise the making of regulations.  I invite the Minister to accept both of the amendments.  It is quite clear that there may be majority support for the amendments if put to a vote.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very important one.  I said at the outset of my Second Stage contribution and I repeat it now that by and large this Bill has the support of the Fine Gael Party but we are anxious to ensure that the Bill is right and there are not inbuilt problems which could upend if following its enactment.  If we enact the Bill containing provisions which are potentially unconstitutional and would allow the Minister to act as a legislator, instead of sections 4 and 5 assisting the Minister, in that he would not have to rush into this House with amending legislation in the autumn or assisting some successor, they could result in the Minister having to rush into the House very soon after the Bill has been enacted. Therefore, I hope the Minister will give some further consideration to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 and consider accepting them.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said in relation to section 4.  No doubt it would be an <Col N="1151" /> excellent section for any Minister to have in place and if it passes through I think we will find a similar section included in all legislation that goes through the House.  For three years he would be able to chop and change anything he liked to remove a difficulty.  I am sure the Minister has the best of intentions and I would not disagree with him if he said that this type of power was absolutely necessary. I wonder however whether such a provision is constitutional, or whether it is legally proper to pass a Bill containing a provision which would allow the Minister to change it?  The words &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; are used but who would decide whether it was necessary or expedient to do so?  Therefore, this provision could be used to remove every possible difficulty which may be perceived by the Minister over a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I have not seen a similar section included in other legislation.  Perhaps it has and I would like the Minister to tell us if this is so.  I am not a legal person. Perhaps some of the others in the House can tell us if they have ever seen a similar section included in other legislation.  It appears that this is a section which should not be included in a Bill.  Where regulations are to be made it should be specified in what area these would be made. This emphasises the need for an amendment of the type we have proposed, which we have proposed to other legislation and which would stipulate that such regulations would have to be approved by the House rather than that they would go through unless annulled within 21 days by the House.  I would like the Minister to tell us if a similar section is contained in other legislation and to give us some idea why this section is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the provisions in section 5 which would give the Minister the power to make regulations to assimilate two codes of law are probably constitutional and free from any major objection.  A clear policy is laid out in the section which would enable the <Col N="1152" /> Minister to assimilate two codes, introduced into this House in tandem, with a view to having a level playing pitch between the banking system, which is under the control of the Central Bank at present, and the building society system which will be under the control of the Central Bank when this Bill comes into being.  I have no major difficulty with the notion of giving the Minister the power to assimilate two statutory codes in any particular way which may be required.  If one introduces two separate Bills in an effort to create a level playing pitch between two separate activities, undoubtedly there would be difficulties in drafting in that you do not know what will happen to one on Committee Stage and what will be accepted to make the two Bills diverge as they go through the House.  I have no principled objection to the second section.  From a legal point of view it does not occur to me that sections 4 and 5 are wrong.  However, section 4 is wrong on two grounds, first, there is the question of principle and second the leg of constitutionality.  I could also add the question of self respect because if we are legislators it starts as a basic concept here that we should get what we enact in order and we should not put into law a measure with which we are so unconfident and so ill at ease that we have to give somebody else &mdash; the Minister in this case &mdash; the power to amend it effectively in any way that appears to him to be desirable on the very loose pretext that a difficulty arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla correctly asked what a difficulty is.  A difficulty can be virtually anything, it could be something which is merely an unforeseen complication, it could be an administrative burden which was unforeseen and it could be something much more substantial.  It could mean that a loophole had appeared in the legislation and that a major abuse seemed to stem from the existence of such a loophole.  In those cases the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; is so vague as to mean virtually anything.  I wonder if the phrase &ldquo;if any difficulty arises&rdquo; adds anything to the sense of that section because if a difficulty is something which exists objectively in <Col N="1153" /> the mind of the Minister, if it is a set of circumstances which is deemed undesirable by the Minister &mdash; which is about the most broad definition you can put on the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;&mdash; it really means that the Minister is given discretion to amend the legislation in the light of circumstances, to put it no more concretely than that, for a period of three years.  Is it necessary to do that?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter when he quoted the Cityview Press case of what is required of this Oireachtas before it puts in place any power of delegated legislation to a Minister or other body.  It sets out clear policy guidelines and a clear delimitation and circumscription around the power it is giving to whatever body or persons to exercise that power.  I wonder if section 4 is enacted in its present form how it could be said that there was any direction to the Minister as to how he should resolve any difficulty he comes across.  Is there any direction of substantive policy which is either implicit or explicit in this Bill which would say that the Minister would resolve it in one way rather than another?  I do not think there is.  In those circumstances, the power given to the Minister is a rudderless one as far as direction built into it is concerned.  It is something which is entirely at the discretion of the Minister and in the circumstances it is undesirable from the point of view of democratic principle.</P>
    <P>On the constitutionality front the Minister will be aware that more recently the Imposition of Duties Act was challenged and it seemed to be an equally open-ended power given to the Government or the Minister for Finance &mdash; I do not remember which &mdash; to impose duties of excise or customs on certain goods at will. Even though the Act provided that an order made had to be confirmed or would cease to have effect within a given period, the same principle applied.  It is the principle of darning and stitching on the Revenue side, that you give the right to a Minister to plug loopholes or change the law substantially to meet unforeseen difficulties. In this case the words deserve close scrutiny.  What do the words &rdquo;if <Col N="1154" /> in any respect&rdquo; mean?  They must mean something, this is not a case of two people leaning up against a pub and indulging in colloquial conversation.  The words have a definite legal meaning.  It is not to be just a narrow definition, it is to be a liberally construed section.  &ldquo;If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation ... &rdquo;  That is fairly clear but even in that case there is possibly an argument that it is a limited purpose for which it is reasonable to delegate a power to deal with the issue.  The next bit says &ldquo;or in relation to the operation of any such provision&rdquo; which is utterly open-ended and deserves close scrutiny.  If there is a difficulty of any kind in relation to the operation of any provision of this Bill the Minister may, by regulations, do anything which appears necessary or expedient to him.  This is phrased in such a way as to make it deliberately designed to make it non-open to court scrutiny thereafter. It is not even a necessitated obligation under the European Treaty.  It means things which are necessary but also things which he thinks are expedient for removing that difficulty &mdash; this means a difficulty in any respect &mdash; and for bringing that provision into operation, which is a separate matter.  He can either remove the difficulty or change the Act to bring it into operation or for securing or facilitating its operation.  &ldquo;Any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid.&rdquo;  It goes on to say that no regulation shall be made in relation to any provision of this Act after the expiration of three years commencing on the day on which the relevant provision of this Act came into operation.</P>
    <P>Why should there be a limit of three years in those circumstances?  Is it a concession to the self respect of this House? Will the Minister have a three year trial period in which to iron out difficulties and will difficulties which may emerge up to three years be dealt with by ministerial regulation?  If a difficulty arises three years and one month as opposed to two years and 11 months after the date of <Col N="1155" /> coming into operation, will amending legislation be necessary?  What is the principle behind it?  It is sheer and unadulterated lazy-mindedness in the drafting and carelessness in principle as to what the respective roles of an Executive and Legislature should be.  It is a lazy-minded, undesirable and open-ended provision which, if it is used, is infirm legally and flawed constitionally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come into the House with a provision of this kind in the Bill and has given as an excuse that the Canals Act, 1986, had a similar clause.  However, that was a technical Act which was designed to transfer statutory functions for CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.  It involved a wealth of 18th and 19th century legislation which might pose some difficulties and which, in any event, has not been challenged by the courts. For him to cite that as a precedent is a bit much.  The Farm Tax Act, 1985 has gone.  That was an entirely new Act of a fiscal kind and all I said about the measure in the Bill before us I would have said, had I been here, about the provision in that Act.  If I am right in what I say about the Bill before us I would have been right about the Farm Tax Act.  I do not see this as much of a precedent of that kind.  Of course, it has the precedent value in that the Minister thinks that by referring to it he can in some sence embarrass any Member who voted for it at the time.  Does that carry the issue of principle any further?  I wonder if it does. The Minister cited the Valuation Act, 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What was transacted here before is a matter of the greatest indifference to me.  Precedent is one thing when it is a matter of determining certain issues, such as the order of this House, but as the Ceann Comhairle, and very frequently, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are the first to remind me, an error, an omission or an oversight from the Chair is no precedent to cite when one is clearly in breach of other principles.  The Valuation Act, 1987 which must have passed while I was a Member, set up this tribunal and it effectively modified 19th century legislation in relation to valuations and the method of deciding on valuations.  I will not digress on that subject but I should like to say that the law in that regard is a total farce.  To cite it as a precedent before including this section in the Bill is most undesirable.</P>
      <P>If this provision is to be included in the Bill before us why is it that it is not included in two or three Bills that go through the House?  I can imagine that there are some Bills which are so simple and direct that we might as well leave them as they are, without any right to amend, but certainly every Social Welfare Bill, if this is to become acceptable, should include a provision like this.  If a loophole emerges why not plug it?  Every Bill of any complexity could be pointed out as legislation that will benefit from having a clause of this kind.  We have difficulty here deciding dividing lines between the Legislature and the Executive. Last night I said I thought that Fine Gael in their proposal were trenching into the area of the Executive but in this provision the Executive is trenching into the area of the Legislature.  If last night's motion was a bit of political trespass into the realm of Government the provision before us is a fine example of Government trespassing into the realm of the Legislature and asking for powers which they ought not have.</P>

      <P>I object to this provision in principle and as a matter of <Col N="1157" /> parliamentary self respect.  I have doubts, certainly in respect of section 4, on a legal and constitutional basis as to their desirability and their validity.  In those circumstances the Minister should see his way to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment. In my view it is sensible and restricted in its form.  Senator Brendan Ryan asked me one day if there was any excuse for allowing the Seanad to veto every regulation made under any statute.  He said it was a non-representative body and it was given equal rights to strike down delegated legislation with the Dáil.  That is a wider question but I notice that the Seanad would have the same rights such as they are, the exiguous rights, under the Minister's text and under Deputy Shatter's amendment.  If we are talking about being a democracy, when the day comes, as doubtless it will some time, that the Seanad is not controlled by the same power blocs wield influence in this establishment &mdash; undoubtedly and statistically it will happen some day &mdash; there will be chaos because of the powers that have been given to the Seanad to effectively obstruct any form of Government being transacted in this country.  That is something to look forward to.  I should like to indicate opposition to this provision and I call on the Minister to indicate that he will either accept the amendment now or introduce on Report Stage an amendment designed to meet Deputy Shatter's worries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed with Deputy O'Malley's contribution in so far as it related to the precedents I named in the House concerning section 4.  I am disappointed to think that Deputy O'Malley would feel that the House would be less concerned with other legislation than it would be with this.  I can see Deputy McDowell's point, that if something is right in one Act it should be right in another.  It was not found to be in any way offensive to the House on several occasions when other legislation, with more stringent provisions than that proposed in section 4, was passed.  I do not see any legislation being promoted as more important or less important than <Col N="1158" /> other legislation.  All legislation requires the sanction of the House, the Seanad and the President.  He was being somewhat less than complimentary to the Front Bench spokesperson who would have dealt with such legislation.  The provisions in other legislation that I offered as a precedent are more far reaching than section 4.  Deputy McDowell introduced a political tone to this and I should like to finalise it.  If the provisions I referred to were acceptable to Members when the National Coalition were in office I fail to understand why they are so objectionable now.  The Deputy introduced the element and I did not offer it as a reason for promoting this provision this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is well taken as far as Deputy Shatter is concerned.  If the House on previous occasions found it acceptable to have similar provisions of less portent than I am suggesting for this Bill, and did not have any exception to it, why is so much hassle being raised now about a provision that does not go quite as far as the precedents I have quoted? The section does not go as far as similar provisions in the Canal Act or the Farm Tax Act.  They allow regulations to modify the provisions of any &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; and not just the enactment under which they are made.  The section seems to be a sensible provision and it could not be used to change the intent of the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The whole purpose of it is that it could enable the Minister to deal with an unforeseen technical difficulty that might arise giving effect to any provision.  Deputy McDowell did not have any objection to that element of the provision in section 4 as drafted.  He found some exceptions to other parts but not to that part and found it reasonable to expect that that might be <Col N="1159" /> so.  I agree with the Deputy that this provision has to be used carefully and it would be expected that any regulations made in that way would be so used.  That is what the Legislature is there to safeguard and guarantee and that is the reason for placing these regulations before the House.  I find it incredible that people would suggest to me that those who have an interest in these matters, Deputies, supporters or whoever, might not be aware of these provisions, or might be less aware of them because they are laid before the House and not dealt with in some other way.  I do not believe that.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Malley had his way and if it were to be a case in point that the Minister could subsequently change the wording of this section to put in changes of personalities other than the Minister for the Environment or if he could include any particular words, then of course there would be a good case to be made in support of Deputy Shatter but we can deal only with what is in the text and not with what might be in it if somebody wished to alter it.  If one applied that basis of argument to any legislation, one would change the whole tone, purpose and intent of the legislation. That is not the case and so far as I am concerned it is spurious to be putting forward that kind of argument.  To make the kind of changes Deputy O'Malley referred to by way of different wording and intent, is a pretty big if.  If this happened, if that happened or if certain words were changed, would certainly give a different direction and power to that section, but that is not what we are dealing with here.</P>
      <P>I have to say that Deputy Quinn has at least been consistent in hoping that legislation might be processed through the Dáil a little quicker.  He is anxious to expedite legislation, and so am I.</P>

The Deputy made a very comprehensive contribution on that occasion and because of that I had the matter referred to the Attorney General's Office who are tendering the advice on this occasion.

    <P>Deputy McCartan dealt at some length with reform of the House.  He seemed to range quite a long way from the text of the Bill in so far as what he would like in that regard.  That is a matter for another day.  The Deputy also referred to European arrangements in dealing with regulations and so on but there is no point in my wasting the time of the House in dealing with something which should be taken up at a different level.  Deputy McCartan persisted in his view that regulations were difficult to come upon.  The question that it is difficult for Members or interested parties to become aware of regulations which apply should be set aside once and for all.  It should not be promoted either that there is not a method or means whereby things can be annulled if they are found to be offensive <Col N="1163" /> either by interested parties or those representing them in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to a possible difficulty in so far as its constitutionality is concerned.  I am pleased to see that the Deputy has returned to being a good constitutional performer.  I remember during a recent debate on other legislation the Deputy tempted the Minister to test the waters of constitutionality. I am glad that the Deputy has changed his attitude in so far as his obligations to the Constitution are concerned in this instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the kernel of that Cityview Press case, while well known and interesting in itself, was that the Minister is confined to the powers conferred on him by the legislation and cannot exceed them.  I do not think it is possible to exceed that power by taking section 4 on board.  That is my attitude to that.  It is not unreasonable to ask the House to pass this Bill, as framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While appreciating some of the points made by Deputies I think they will agree that all the provisions of section 4 do is empower the Minister to modify the provisions of the Bill by regulation if that technical difficulty arises in enforcing the <Col N="1164" /> provisions.  The Deputy is quite right in saying that that power will lapse after a period of three years from the date of commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are similar provisions in other legislation.  I do not know whether it is right or proper, or should be conceded, that a Minister should hold up a precedent as being a proper reason for the inclusion of such a provision in legislation but at least it is a good point to make.  It seems to me that if Members of the House could find no objection to similar provisions in other enactments, it would be proper and right to promote such a provision at this time.</P>
    <P>Listening to all of the cases made I have to say they have been somewhat repetitious.  I have not heard any good, case to do down something already in existence in other legislation and which has worked satisfactorily.  So be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the point of precedent.  The Minister has mentioned three previous enactments in which a similar section appeared. Although I have not seen them I take it from the Minister that they are similar, that this provision is almost an exact replica of what appears in three other Acts &mdash; the Canals Act, 1986, the Farm Tax Act, 1985 and the Valuations Act, 1987. The first point to be made about them is that they are recent enactments.  How did we miss out on the year 1988?  However, in the year 1989, we are perpetuating that precedent.  It also begs the question: how did Ministers ever manage without this marvellous section in enactments for the previous 60 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point the Minister made was that everybody in this House passed that provision in those three previous Acts.  I should like to know from the Minister whether the relevant section was ever reached in this House in relation to those previous Acts?  For example, was the guillotine introduced?  Indeed one might well ask: how many sections of this Bill will be reached and debated in the House since it contains 127 sections and five Schedules?  Will sufficient time be <Col N="1165" /> allowed to debate the whole Bill, every section.  Indeed one can ask the question again: was sufficient time allowed to debate those previous Acts in their entirety?  Was the guillotine introduced; was this provision ever reached before in the course of debate in this House?  The point to be made is it has been reached on this occasion, it is being debated this time; it has not been guillotined because it happens to appear in the first four sections.  Probably that is how it was slipped through on the other occasions.  The fact that it is now being discussed here can have grave implications.  Now is the time to decide whether this is or is not a precedent.  A time lapse of three years is a bit much after which to decide one has created a precedent.  The fact that that provision was passed in two Coalition Bills gives the Minister a great stick with which to beat the Opposition, saying: &ldquo;In 1985 and 1986 it was all right; I got it through in 1987 when it was not discussed: now, in 1989 it is being contended there is something wrong with it.&rdquo;  The point is that in 1989 we are debating it in this House.  The Minister advanced many excuses.</P>
    <P>At one stage he seemed to say that he would not be changing the wording of the Bill &mdash; I do not know whether he actually said that &mdash; but the wording of the whole section as drafted, allows him to do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for the removal of a difficulty.  Section 4 also contains the words:</P>
    <P>.... and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act ....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May modify&rdquo; means that he may cut out a piece, possibly add a piece, change a piece or omit a section or part thereof.  I do not know what &ldquo;modify&rdquo; means but I am sure it means all of those things &mdash; to effect fairly drastic changes in the provisions of the Bill, because the Minister has power to do so.  The fact that he may say: no, I have no intention of doing that cuts no ice with Members in this House and certainly not with me.  The Minister may not be in office after another three weeks or whenever; we do not know. <Col N="1166" /> Therefore what the Minister says are his intentions are of no consequence.  The point is the powers he is given in this section.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party feel very strongly that no Minister should be allowed to have the powers conferred in this section. It makes nonsense of whatever we may say, amend, discuss and agree in all of the other 126 sections and five Schedules of this Bill, if the Minister can chop and change and modify to suit his purpose, as he feels to be necessary and expedient, in order to remove whatever difficulties may arise in enforcing a provision of the Bill.  For example, it renders it very easy for a Minister, when a civil servant comes to him and says: look, this is creating great difficulty because, if we do this, that will happen, or whatever, with all sorts of predictions of trouble, expense and so on.  It makes it very easy for a Minister to say: do not bother; we will change it by regulation; let us do it this way; is that what you would like?  The civil servant will then respond: yes, that is fine.  It is as easy as that for three long years.  I do not know what will be the implications of 1992 for the provisions of this Bill but it would appear it will have something to do with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not in any way alleviated my fears in regard to the dangers of a section like this.  It is most important that the House is debating the section. Certainly we are opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably we have gone as far as we can in debating this issue. However, I want to respond to two points the Minister made.  The Minister wondered why it was that it seemed to be acceptable to have included this provision in other Acts yet it was not acceptable in this Bill.  I made the point very specifically that the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, when published, provided for regulatory powers subject to the nullifying provision. Deputy Woods, of the then Opposition, objected to that.  Indeed I and a number of colleagues raised that issue with our party in Government.  Because of the serious implications and importance of that Bill it was agreed that it <Col N="1167" /> would be amended.  The type of procedure I am now suggesting be applied in the context of certain regulations having to come before the House for approval before becoming operative, as is proposed in amendments Nos. 2 and 3, was the exact procedure adopted in the case of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to throw precedent at me in this regard, if he wished to be consistent with his colleague, from the then Opposition benches, with regard to another measure, he would be willing to accept the amendments I have proposed here.  Of course, the difference was that the previous Government were open to argument and discussion, were prepared to be receptive to a constructive proposal to improve a Bill, were not interested in trying to play party politics with it by pointing to the plethora of similar Acts introduced by previous Fianna Fáil Governments in which they would not allow regulations, first, to be approved by this House before becoming operative.</P>
      <P>It is open to this House to regard some legislation as having more far reaching implications than others.  It is proper for Members of this House to take the view that in some circumstances it is appropriate that regulations be published and become operative within 21 days unless there is a motion annuling them and, in the context of other legislation, it is appropriate that they do not become operative without a debate in this House and a motion approving them.  That is what is proposed in amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  The Minister has not advanced any good reason he cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We differ on the constitutional implications of section 4.  I do not believe there is anything to be added to it other than what the Minister has said &mdash; that the Attorney General's office approves of his approach and so do his legal advisers in the Department of the Environment.  We now know if that section is ultimately enacted and found to be unconstitutional both the Attorney General's office and the Minister's office will be blamed, <Col N="1168" /> therefore, the blame will not be confined to one particular Department.</P>
    <P>It has not been unusual in past years for the Attorney General's office to get it wrong on constitutional issues.  If they did not get it wrong on constitutional issues so regularly the large number of successful constitutional cases in the courts would never take place.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the Minister openly responding and confirming that he did seek advice from the Attorney General's office.  I have to put on the record of the House that I appreciate that the Minister looked into the issue when it was raised on Second Stage.  While we differ on constitutional issue, I hoped the Minister would have accepted amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  If he is not willing to accept this, I am anxious, like other Members of the House, to deal with other sections.  I think we should now deal with the particular amendments before the House.</P>

      <P>Not my day but the Deputy has made my case in this regard.  Perhaps this might help the Deputy to readjust his attitude towards this amendment in so far as he made a big point about the existing legislation to which I referred that had similar provisions that is, that they were less than three years old or something to that effect and that an opportunity had not yet been availed of to test them.  That was the kernel of what the Deputy said.  Of course that is not true.  It is true that the provisions I am talking about might last three years as well but this proves the point that they are only needed to help to introduce and facilitate the legislation and that the three year proviso might just fall into place with what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that three years was not an adequate time scale in which to test the other Acts.  I am saying that three years is all I am asking for in this instance.  As far as Deputy Shatter is concerned, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  I am not prepared to ask the House to get involved in a situation where every regulation for every single item, minor or major, that attaches to the introduction of any legislation will come in here and delay the time of the House, which is precious, in that way.  It is not necessary.  If the Deputy wishes to <Col N="1170" /> pursue the question about some other arrangement for dealing with regulations attached to all legislation then, of course, it is open to his party leader to do so.  I think, and it was conceded by Deputy O'Malley, that that would be an unnecessary intrusion in the business of the House.</P>

      <P>At present building societies which comply with certain requirements have the power to make unsecured loans for house improvements in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Building Societies Regulations, 1987, which were made under section 3 of the 1986 Act.  This amendment will ensure that any society which is entitled under existing legislation to make such loans will continue for a transitional period to be entitled to do so despite the repeal effected by section 6 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The corresponding power in this Bill is contained in section 23 (1) (e), but since this, being unsecured lending, is an adopted power it cannot be exercised until passed by special resolution and approved by the Central Bank.  However, once a society adopts a memorandum containing whatever power wishes to adopt, this transitional provision will cease to have effect as each society will then have had the opportunity of deciding which powers it wishes to adopt.  All existing societies must, under section 124, adopt a memorandum within two years of the commencement of the section.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 14 to 18, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (3) from section 6.  This section deals with the question of redemption fees.  The Minister has said <Col N="1175" /> that this Bill is designed to give a better deal to the house purchaser and the consumer. The case is made in the context of section 6 (3) that it is appropriate in the context of fixed interest loans for building societies to be able to charge redemption fees to the borrower who wishes to redeem his loan at an early date.  The Building Societies Act, 1986, prohibited the general charging of redemption fees by building societies. This applied to all loans, including fixed interest loans.  That Act was effective in curtailing building societies from exploiting their position in the market by penalising borrowers who sought to repay their loans at an early date.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that there should be a different approach to loans based on a fixed interest rate as opposed to other loans.  I am not totally convinced that it is necessary under this Bill to reintroduce redemption fees, which were abolished as short a time ago as 1986.  I would also question whether it should be possible for building societies to seek redemption fees in the context of loans which may have preceded 1986.  It seems to me to be creating a situation that there are fixed interest loans taken out in the period 1986-89 up to the enactment of this Bill, without risk of having to pay redemption fees, but this Bill will now reintroduce redemption fees in respect of those loans. Perhaps the Minister could clarify what his reasons are for including subsection (3) in the Bill and indicate why he believes it is necessary to change that aspect of the 1986 Act at such an early date.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (3) simply provides that the prohibition on the charging of redemption fees will not apply in the case of certain fixed interest rate loans, that is, loans where the rate of interest is fixed for a period of one year or more. My purpose in this is to ensure that there are no barriers to societies providing fixed interest rate loans.  I want them to be able to do this.  As matters stand, the blanket ban on redemption fees would mean that it would be commercially unattractive for <Col N="1176" /> building societies to offer fixed rate loans, because societies could face a loss where borrowers opted to redeem their loans at a time of falling rates, while societies would be stuck with paying a fixed rate on the moneys they had raised to fund those loans.  I would like to make it clear that the charging of redemption fees will continue to be banned on all variable rate loans, that is, ordinary mortgage loans. It is to help to provide a better, wider range of facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister have any statistical information that he can supply the House as to the number of fixed interest rate loans made by building societies in respect of mortgages in each of the years from 1980 up to 1988. Could the Minister indicate what portion of the mortgage market is involved? Could he indicate, for example, what would be the position of someone who took out a fixed interest rate loan in 1987 or 1988 in the belief that if they redeemed their mortgage the question of a redemption fee would not arise?  Does the Minister have any statistics to indicate, for example, that there were no fixed interest rate loans made available by building societies during that time because of the impact of the 1986 Act acting as a disincentive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to be helpful in asking this. I want to tease it out, and I am open to argument; but I am concerned about the impact of this.  The rules were changed in 1986.  It put people on fixed interest rate loans in a position where they could redeem their loans without paying redemption fees.  That position pertains up to now.  There are two sets of people now who have problems.  There are the people who took out loans prior to 1986 and found their situation improved by the 1986 Act but who now find that if they have not redeemed their loan in the intervening period they will be back in the position where they could be liable to redemption fees.  At least those people when they took out their loans originally knew they were at risk of redemption fees.  There may be a second group of people who took out loans between the <Col N="1177" /> enactment of the 1986 Act and the coming into force of this Bill without being at risk of redemption fees and who are now going to find their mortgage arrangements are retrospective varied by the provisions in this Bill, and I would be concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are such people.  I would ask the Minister to do some homework on this and come back to the House on Report Stage.  If there is an argument for redemption fees being applicable to new fixed interest rate loans in that this provision coming into operation would act as a catalyst to the building societies to provide fixed interest rate loans when they have not provided them or have provided very few in the last two or three years, there would seem to be at the very least an argument that anyone who got one between 1986 and 1989 would retain an exemption from liability for redemption fees because they took out their loan at a time when they were not at risk of redemption fees since there was a statutory prohibition on them.</P>
    <P>It is important to have the relevant information from the building societies. I specifically introduced this proposal to delete this subsection from the Bill on Committee Stage so that we could tease this out and I could hear the Minister's thinking on it and we could find out who will be affected by this.  I am not sure to what extent the 1986 Act has acted as a disincentive to building societies providing these loans.  I am not sure to what extent loans of this nature have been playing a substantive role in the market in recent years.  They may have been a feature of the fifties and sixties, but to what extent they have been a feature in recent years with variable interest rates is questionable.  They were more a feature of my childhood days and possibly the Minister's childhood days than a feature of the current market.</P>
    <P>Then again it may be the case that building societies might to some special customers offer a concessionary arrangement by giving them a fixed interest rate loan that they may not be prepared to give to others.  For example, would I be right in saying that perhaps the <Col N="1178" /> employees of building societies would get fixed rate loans?  Perhaps those in a managerial position in building societies get fixed rate loans.  I want us to tease out who in reality is getting them at present. Perhaps the Minister could give the House some information on that aspect of matters.  I would assume that anyone who is an employee of a building society would get a concession, as do bank employees, in regard to the interest they pay on loans raised for housing purposes. We need to tease out who would be affected by the change in the law being brought about which will reintroduce and impose an additional payment on the house purchaser and, in a sense, penalise someone who has a mortgage for seeking to pay off the capital sum due on that mortgage at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>I have one final point.  The rationale is that the building societies themselves may have entered into loan arrangements with the moneys they are providing for long term fixed interest loans.  Of course, if the building society realises its capital at an earlier stage there is nothing to stop it either making that capital available for a loan that is not on a fixed interest rate, and possibly giving them a greater return, or investing those moneys themselves in whatever way they deem appropriate.  It would seem that the rationale the Minister gives, that the building society might be financially disadvantaged, does not at first sight stand up.  I would ask that the Minister clarify that aspect of the reasoning behind that subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more or less what I feel is the situation.  I do not want to create any barrier to fixed interest rate loans in the future.  It is as simple as that. There have not been any taken out since 1986 and the 1986 legislation is what stops them.  I want that option to be there.  As far as I understand, there have been no fixed interest rate loans since 1986.  The situation is beginning to develop in the UK that it is coming back in as a very satisfactory option, and I would like that option to be there.  If there are people who took out fixed interest rate loans <Col N="1179" /> between 1986 and 1989, I can do something about them.  This move is purely to give a wider option to mortgage seekers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment yesterday I was saying that as far as the Progressive Democrats are concerned the Fine Gael proposals raise a number of difficulties.  We are reluctant to take a negative view of any proposal which is designed to improve the financial procedures in this House and to make the financial activities of the Government more accountable as far as this House is concerned, but we take the view that <Col N="1181" /> the proposals set out in the White Paper published by the last Government, of which Deputy John Bruton was the main author, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nations's Finances</i>, and which dealt with a lot of this territory, are on balance, and on reflection preferable to those now being proposed.  They have the undoubted merit that they are consistent with the Constitution where as it is our view that the present Fine Gael proposals are inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 17.2 of the Constitution requires any measure, whether by way of Act, resolution or vote of this House, which involves the expenditure of public revenues to be dealt with on the basis of a recommendation from the Taoiseach. It seems the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; means that the Taoiseach must favour the resolution in question.  Therefore, Estimates which are brought before this House and amended against his wishes could not be the subject matter of a recommendation from him and an Appropriation Bill which is later put before the House could not be validly passed under the Constitution unless it was wholeheartedly recommended to the House by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We take the view that the intent of the present proposals from Fine Gael is to entrench the powers of the Executive under the Constitution, and that these proposals are more appropriate to a Constitution under which a congress and an executive is elected for fixed periods.  We in this House have the right at any given time to dismiss the Executive of the day and to dissolve the Dáil or simply to replace it with another Executive if the Taoiseach of the day no longer carries the confidence of the Members of this House, unlike the constitutions of continental countries to which Deputy Noonan and Deputy Dukes referred when proposing this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not dealing with a president and a congress or an executive president as is contemplated by the French Constitution or the arrangements which apply in America.  We do not have a system whereby an executive is elected to govern <Col N="1182" /> for a particular period subject to a negative veto by a congress or a legislature. We have the diametrically opposite system whereby the Executive is instantly and absolutely accountable to the Legislature. The difference also is that the Executive is given more discretion and is given a monopoly of control over the planning of public expenditure.  That is the balance that has been struck in our Constitution.  It is a parliamentary balance which is not mirrored in every country's Constitution but it is the cornerstone of our present constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the document published by the last Government, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i>, there was a limited suggestion of a consultative role for the Dáil which might result in amendments to Estimates being made, but only with the consent of the Minister of the Government in question.  That is the difference between what Deputy Bruton then proposed and what is now proposed by Deputy Noonan.  To us it is a fundamental difference in principle.  The effect of the adoption of the Fine Gael proposals, even if it were open to this house to adopt them, which I doubt &mdash; I am not making a procedural point of it &mdash; because I think they are <i>ultra vires</i> under the Constitution, would be to make every Deputy a Minister for Finance and, as far as the Estimates are concerned, a member of Government.  It would reduce the influence and power of Government to that of merely putting before the House a document to be negotiated and would limit the scope of the negotiations to internal redistribution of expenditure by way of departmental Votes.</P>
    <P>Those apparent delimitations are illusory.  For instance, in regard to the health Estimates, if this House was to be allowed slash the State expenditure on hospitals by, say, a couple of hundred million pounds and apply that money to community care &mdash; a policy which some Deputies might propose at some stage in the future &mdash; that would be a dramatic and radical change in policy.  To tell a Government, by a vote of this House, to implement such Estimates and to require <Col N="1183" /> them to introduce an Appropriation Bill to give effect to such Estimates would be, if the Government were opposed to such a measure, to ask the Taoiseach of the day to live a lie because the Appropriation Bill in question could not be recommended by him to the House.</P>
    <P>The measures now being proposed amount to a misunderstanding of the respective roles of the parliament and the Government.  We said so in October 1987 when these proposals were first brought before this House, and our minds have not been changed by anything that has been said today.  Therefore, since we voted against them then, I regret to say we will have to vote against them tonight. We are not in a position to offer support. We consider that the correct thing to do is to vote against the proposals in the name of Deputy Noonan and moved by Deputy Dukes.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to this debate last night and again to this evening's contribution by Deputy McDowell.  It is hard to see the logic in this proposal from the main Opposition party.  The proposal being put to us in this motion is that the Committee on Procedures and Privileges should examine the existing Dáil Standing Orders with a view to amending them to allow Deputies who are not in power to put forward amendments to individual Estimates and thus have a direct influence on public expenditure patterns and priorities.  The power and responsibility of the Executive would be diluted and the Government of the day would be in the unenviable position of being held accountable by the electorate for expenditures which did not form part of their own plans and objectives. This would be an unacceptable state of affairs and would clearly undermine the constitutional position whereby the power of initiative in relation to the public finances is vested in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the Government of the day to execute their expenditure programmes in line with their stated objectives and <Col N="1184" /> priorities and to be judged on that performance. It is unthinkable that a Government who have made such progress on the public finance front should be asked to divest themselves of their decision-making powers.  The fact of the matter is that the proponents of this motion are attempting to have an important part of the powers of Government in the area of public expenditure transferred to them.  They want to have a major say in the detailed determination of public expenditure.  In effect, the supporters of this motion want the opportunity to saddle the Government with policies with which they are not in agreement &mdash; the very antithesis of sound Government.  Public expenditure strategies are at the heart of public policy in sectors of activity such as Health, Education or Social Welfare.  Deputy McDowell last night rightly pointed to the scope for fundamental disagreement on policy within agreed overall Vote totals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes stated last night that the resolution of our public finance problem is the essential key to everything we want to do in the economic and social areas.  It is being suggested, therefore, that the procedures being proposed, if implemented, would be a means of improving the control mechanism of public expenditure.  There is, of course, no evidence to suggest that the arrangements proposed would do that.  On the contrary, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, pointed out, there is every reason to suspect that the procedures proposed would simply result in disruption and delay in settling the Estimates for a particular year and leave Departments and agencies under their aegis in a no-man's land of uncertainty pending the final passing of their Estimates in the Dáil.  Contrary to serving the interests of the people the proposal would be a recipe for disaster and dissent and would benefit no one.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office in 1987, we were faced with the legacy of the failure to confront the problem of the public finances.  The reality of the first part of this decade was a very <Col N="1185" /> steep rise in national debt, little real progress in reducing Government borrowing and no real growth in national wealth.</P>
    <P>On taking office, we were determined despite being a minority Government, to end this stagnation and to restore the conditions for lasting growth in the future.  This required decisive action to tackle the problem of the public finances and the ever rising debt and debt servicing costs associated with that problem. We took bold steps in 1987, 1988 and yet again this year in the budget to create a new environment for growth.  There is little doubt but that the progress we have made would not have been achieved if the decision-making process envisaged in the motion before us tonight had been in place.</P>
    <P>The assertion by this Government of control of public spending has been the single most significant factor in the restoration of confidence in our ability to manage our affairs and the resumption of growth in economic activity.  The situation confronting us was one which called for a firm hand on the tiller.  The confidence of the business community and of international financial markets was not easily regained.  After the mismanagement of the preceding four years can anyone seriously argue that it would have been possible for the Government to project the leadership and dynamism necessary if they were placed in the situation of having to engage in protracted negotiations with the Legislature before implementing the necessary and vital corrective action?</P>
    <P>Our achievements to date have been remarkable.  We have reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirement by over seven percentage points of Gross National Product &mdash; from about 13 per cent when the Coalition left Office to a projected 5.3 per cent this year.  Because of the decisive and determined action taken by this Government there is now confidence in the will and the ability of the Government to take charge of events.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to public and political debate on the issues of economic policy and the public finances generally has improved in recent years.  The growth <Col N="1186" /> in awareness of economic issues, particularly since the publication of the NESC report entitled <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990,</i> is a welcome development. We all have a stake in the economy.  It is right that we should be involved and have views on policy questions.</P>
    <P>Much can and has been done to give Members of the Oireachtas a chance to have a more effective role in Parliament short of actually handing our Executive power to the Opposition.  Deputy McDowell referred in his contribution to the 1981 discussion document, <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances,</i> in this regard.  I, too, wish to acknowledge the fact that this was a significant first step in bringing about a more mature and realistic debate on political and economic matters.  The document put forward a wide range of proposals, including changes in Dáil procedures for consideration of Estimates and financial business. Many of the reforms which have been made in Dáil procedures in the last number of years have stemmed from that document.  One need look no further than the quality and timing of the presentation to the House of information on the Estimates to appreciate the degree of change and improvement that has taken place over the past three years.  The Government have done their upmost to facilitate debate on economic matters in this House and to ensure that all Members of the House are given the most up-to-date information on the Estimates as they unfold.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned yesterday the earlier publication and presentation of the annual Estimates Volume to the House.  This has allowed for a wide-ranging debate on the Government's expenditure plans and priorities some months before the beginning of the financial year.  Over the past number of years significant progress has also been made in improving the general presentation of the Estimates in consultation with the Public Accounts Committee of this House.  To take just a few illustrations &mdash; the format of the Education group of Estimates has been radically <Col N="1187" /> overhauled and we now have a more coherent presentation of the expenditures involved.  Moreover, the Estimates Volume now includes agency operating statements for all major State bodies in receipt of grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme has been radically improved in recent years. Information on the outputs and the employment content-potential of programmes is generally provided.  This has facilitated, I would suggest, useful debate on the quality of State investment.  The trading results and financial position of State-sponsored bodies are published in the booklet in composite form.  Other innovations include the presentation in the booklet of tables and graphs which summarise trends in the main components of the Public Capital Programme over several years, specify volume changes and break the programme down into its three major component parts, viz sectoral economic, productive infrastructure and social infrastructure; and detailed information, statistical and descriptive on all expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>Another major step forward in the provision of more information on public expenditure has been the development of the comprehensive public expenditure programmes book.  The programme presentation identifies all major areas of State spending by programme activity rather than by departmental responsibility and has placed a wealth of detailed information and data at the hands of all public representatives.  It shows the total costs associated with each area, provides background information on the activities and policies being pursued and, in time, will incorporate measures of output and performance where possible.</P>
    <P>The aim is to tell the Oireachtas in detail what public expenditure is achieving as compared with the more traditional documents which provide a legal and accounting basis for that expenditure. The information brought together in the programmes and the requirement imposed on Departments to make explicit their objectives and the total cost of each activity are an essential element <Col N="1188" /> in not alone improving financial management within Departments but also in improving the ability of elected representatives to play a more constructive role in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The procedures for dealing with parliamentary questions have also been greatly improved.  Deputies now have a more systematic access to Ministers with Ministers answering questions every five to six weeks and with time being alloted each day for priority questions.  This is of major interest and importance to the Opposition parties in that their spokes-persons can table questions of national importance to the Minister.  They can, without interruption, question him and elicit information which will be to their benefit and that of the House.  All Opposition parties have the opportunity, based on their membership, to table priority questions and the traditional ordinary questions.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that much has been done in the area of Dáil procedure to improve the quality and quantity of information which elected representatives have at their disposal to enable them to enter into constructive debate with the Government on all aspects of Government expenditure policy.  In saying this it is right that I should acknowledge the part played by previous Governments in bringing about these improvements.  The Government will always be ready to listen and consider constructive advice on improving Dáil procedures but the question of surrendering, even in part, the Government initiative in relation to the public finances to this House as is suggested in this motion before us clearly cannot be put on the agenda.</P>
    <P>At first glance, of course, the proposals contained in this motion look inoffensive and plausible.  In reality, as was pointed out last night by the Minister for Finance and by Deputy McDowell, they undermine the constitutional relationship between the Government and the Dáil.  I have no doubt that what would happen in practice is that while Deputies would have no problem in advocating increases in expenditure they would have extreme difficulty in putting forward proposals for <Col N="1189" /> offsetting reductions.  That is where the main flaw lies.  The suggestion that giving the Minister for Finance a veto on proposals would somehow safeguard the system and allow it to operate smoothly is simply not credible.  Deputies on all sides are only too well aware of the many demands imposed on the Minister for Finance by his existing numerous responsibilities.  Anybody holding ministerial office will know that this is true but it applies particularly to the Minister for Finance because he has virtual responsibility for the overall financial management and overviewing the expenditure in all Departments and State agencies.  The idea that he would be expected to justify his objection to proposals for increases in expenditure coming from Deputies is simply untenable.</P>
    <P>Another criticism of the proposal is the delay which it could entail in settling the budgets of spending Departments and their agencies at a time when the benefit of early publication of the Estimates volume, which has been a feature of the past two years, should be allowing them to plan to live within the allocation decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance stated last night, restoration of order to the public finances remains a priority national objective and will continue to be at the forefront of Government policy in future years.  The thrust of Government budgetary policy over the medium term will be to achieve further reductions in Exchequer borrowing with a view to bringing about a progressive decline in the national debt to GNP ratio.  The <i>National Development Plan</i> specifies an EBR target of the order of 3 per cent of GNP by 1993 and a national debt-GNP ratio target in the region of 120 per cent. While the resumption of economic growth will of itself contribute towards the achievement of these targets, the need to simultaneously achieve other Government objectives over the medium term, such as the progressive easing of personal taxation, which we did in the budget, and the move towards fiscal harmonisation throughout the Community <Col N="1190" /> will require continued strict discipline on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Over the medium term priority will have to be given to those programmes which contribute to the development of the economy and the creation of self-sustaining employment.  This will require that other expenditure will have to be rigorously contained.</P>
    <P>Further fiscal adjustment is therefore inevitable and the Government would clearly not be helped in this difficult task if in determining their public spending priorities they have to subject themselves to a time consuming process before securing the agreement of the Dáil to the granting of supply, or indeed, as I have already pointed out, the process may result in the Government being saddled with expenditure programmes with which they are not in agreement.  This is constitutionally unsustainable.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal for the doubling of the Structural Funds we now have in our grasp probably the best opportunity we have had for a quarter of a century for sustained economic growth with all the benefits that that entails.  It will leave us in the position of being able to implement a major programme of investment while maintaining the impetus of budgetary adjustment.  The opportunity is there for us to benefit from the greater overall performance of the European economy and to look forward to a period of buoyant growth in output and employment. Through the policies we have been pursuing, and will pursue, we are increasing the number of viable self-sustaining jobs. We are, as Deputy Dukes stated last night, striking at the very root of the ills that plague our society &mdash; poverty, alienation and division.  All this will require a continuation of the firm leadership which is being provided by this Government.  The motion before this House, which proposes to overturn the long-standing constitutional relationship between the Executive and the Legislature, would serve to frustrate, rather than assist, the provision of effective leadership.</P>
    <P>The motion before us is a very complex one.  It is too cumbersome to have a <Col N="1191" /> system whereby the Government or their Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance, would find their policies vetoed by the Opposition.  It would be impossible for the Government to allocate funds to each Department and to have clear criteria laid down in the disbursement of those funds.  It would be very hard to make those Departments live within the budgets allocated to them if there was a complex way of deciding the finances of the State through debate in this House. Therefore, we cannot accept the motion and we expect it to be rejected.</P>

      <P>I wish to briefly comment on the motion before the House. My party do not support the Fine Gael motion for a number of reasons.  They are going about this problem in the wrong way.  I am very strongly in favour &mdash; and have been for many years &mdash; of setting up Estimates committees in the House. We urgently need committees of that kind on the health services, education, social welfare, agriculture, the environment and foreign affairs.  Those committees could examine in a comprehensive way the financial and policy content of the Estimates and present a report to the House giving their considered opinion of them.  We then would have a parliament conducting its affairs in a meaningful way.  In the last eight or nine years the House has devoted a couple of hours to each Estimate with ritualistic statements, drafted at official level, being made by Ministers and attenuated half hour responses from the spokespersons of the Opposition parties. All contributions are in a very rigid and non-debatable form.  That is highly unsatisfactory particularly when we are dealing with the expenditure of billions of pounds of public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates debates have seriously deteriorated in recent years.  For all practical purposes only 17 Members out of 166 Deputies &mdash; one must include the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who must attend &mdash; are at present empowered to deal with the presentation and passing of Estimates. <Col N="1192" /> Ministers of State &mdash; I held that post in the Department of Finance for the best part of one year &mdash; are no more than supplicant altar boys carrying the robes of their respective Ministers as they parade before the House.</P>

      <P>Many Ministers of State do not have access to Government papers but they should have a formal role to play in relation to their respective Estimates. If we had Estimates committees Ministers of State could go before them to debate the background to all policy decisions.  They could bring with them, and this would be of critical importance, the respective public servants.  Most Deputies, apart from tabling a series of parliamentary questions and making occasional speeches outside the House about matters which are of passing interest to them, spend most of their time dealing with constituency matters, trying to ward off the multiple supplications they receive from their constituents and to protect their seats from their colleagues in their own party who would willingly seek to take them from them. That is not what we are here for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had Estimates committees Deputies could specialise in their respective interests and make major contributions.  We have a number of committees of the House such as the Committee of Public Accounts where Members can participate on an ongoing basis.  However, that committee deal solely with the accountability aspects of expenditure and do not deal with the fundamental policy decisions that underline the Estimates.  In fact, that committee cannot report on policy matters other than where they might impinge on the wrongful spending of money in the implementation of policy decisions.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European <Col N="1193" /> Communities barely reflects Estimates decisions.  Now and again it deals with such issues as overseas development aid but, by and large, has few functions to perform.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is an important committee but, apart from some aspects of the Public Capital Programme, it does not deal with the Estimates of the House.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary time is very restricted and as a result Members have little time to get involved in their specialised interest that may arise in Estimates.  Estimates committees should be serviced by staff of the House of the Oireachtas.  I visited most of the parliaments in Europe, and some outside the Community, and suffered acute embarrassment when I compared the services available to other parliamentarians with ours.  Most parliaments have Estimates committees.  If we had an Estimates committee consisting of Deputies and Senators we would be ensuring that the interaction of the Seanad with Dáil would be more effective.  One wonders what takes place in Seanad Éireann from time to time.  Certainly, whatever else takes place, there can be no doubt that there is little debate on the Estimates.  In fact, there is no provision for a debate on the Estimates in that House.  I do not wish to sound derogatory but many of our colleagues in the Upper House could put their talents to better use if they joined us in debating the Estimates on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>Estimates committees would give an opportunity to the many pressure groups that exist to make a case before Members.  In that event they would not become supplicants of Buswells Hotel or Powers Hotel in their efforts to meet Deputies but would meet us at committee level and present their case to us.  The proceedings of such meetings could be properly recorded and public officials from the Department of Finance could advise the committees on the merits or otherwise of submissions made to them. In simple terms, we would be modernising the Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I do not share the contrivance put forward by the Fine Gael Party on this issue. It is not Deputy Noonan's motion because he is a sensible man.  The genesis of this was Deputy Bruton, a former ministerial colleague of mine.  He has a touching faith in human nature and it is his opinion that if we could bring all the money onto the Floor of the House we would be able to haggle as to how it should be divided under the different subheads.  I can imagine the chaos that would occur if we had Deputy Yates, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Health, suggesting that the allocation under the heading of &ldquo;Mental Handicap&rdquo; should be transferred to hospitals, or vice versa. Under the proposal before the House no further money could be made available under any subhead.  The Estimates would be immutable and we could not do anything with them except trick around with the subheads.  This is not a recipe for parliamentary coherence; it is a recipe for groups to exercise inordinate pressure in a chaotic manner.  We saw examples of that in regard to the health services in recent weeks, much to my embarrassment, but the matter has since been resolved and I hope it will be resolved in a more effective way in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Under Article 17.2 of the Constitution the Fine Gael motion is clearly unconstitutional.  The proposers of the motion must now be well aware of this.  In making my caustic comments about Deputy John Bruton I want to put it very clearly on the record of the House that he is one of the very few Deputies in this House who has sought year in year out for the reform of the structures of the Dáil.  However, this is not a particularly well thought out proposition and I have no doubt that on reflection Deputy Bruton will not press the matter.  I appreciate that there may have been some anxiety to get a motion before the H ouse this week which would not cause <Col N="1195" /> any further chaos in the mind of the Taoiseach as to what in God's name he might do.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile the choice can be comfortably deferred from this evening.  With that criticism, I hope that my comments on behalf of the Labour Party have been in a positive mood.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, who has just spoken has put forward a totally sustainable case.  I share the equally valid criticisms of my colleague here on my left, for the purposes of this debate, Deputy McDowell, and I think in those circumstances the Fine Gael Party will appreciate that my party intend to abstain tonight from the vote on this motion because I do not think we can bring about a change in that regard.</P>
      <P>Finally, I submit that we should ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, through the Ceann Comhairle, to have a very serious look at the structure of the debates in this House and the manner in which we conduct our business.  If this is not done we will never see the reforms which are so urgently needed introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to compliment Deputy Desmond for making the record clear as to how he stood with regard to certain pressures which were brought on this House.  I am convinced that if he was the spokesperson for his party he would have had to courage to withstand those pressures because I think he was completely in tune with <Col N="1196" /> the Minister for Health last week on the morality of the arguments which were put forward.  However, that is an argument for a different day.</P>
      <P>This motion must surely rank as one of the more stupid motions to appear before this or any other Dáil.  It is doubly silly in that the Dáil has already rejected the idea, if that is the correct word, incorporated in this measure.  As has already been noted in contributions here last night, a fundamental aspect of the relationship between the Dáil and the Executive is contained in Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  That Article provides that while Dáil Éireann retains, <i>inter alia,</i> the powers of the public purse among its constitutional responsibilities, the Executive, the Government of the day, retain the right of initiative in money matters.  It is difficult to see in our system of government how we could have a system which is otherwise.  The balance of power between the Dáil and the Executive in this matter could not be more clearly expressed.  Article 17.2 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was pointed out by the Minister, and I think by Deputy McDowell, last night, this language could hardly be any clearer. Last night Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael rejected the point that the motion was unconstitutional.  Like the motion, his rationale for rejecting this point was, to say the least, odd.  The only argument he actually produced in his contribution against the argument of unconstitutionality is that it is a trick by lawyers to suggest that things are unconstitutional when they are faced with a good argument and they cannot come up with a good counter-argument.  That is a little disingenuous to lawyers and I suggest that it denotes a very severe handicap on the part of Deputy Noonan, who <Col N="1197" /> is a member of a party where that noble profession is more than amply represented. It suggest to me also that he must carry a fair burden of an inferiority complex on his shoulders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The truly interesting aspect of the motion from a technical point of view is that it is not only clearly at variance with the Constitution but it is also at variance with Fine Gael's stated policies. If I recall correctely, this point was made also by Deputy McDowell last night.  These policies were enunciated in Deputy John Bruton's document &mdash; and I compliment him again as I have done so in the past on writing this document &mdash; on policy on Dáil reform, which was referred to by Deputy Desmond, as far back as 1981.  That is where the initial set of Fine Gael policies with regard to Dáil reform were set down.  Those policies were elaborated on in the White Paper <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances.</i> At no point in either document did this proposal emerge.  Indeed, the limited measures proposed in the White Paper for varying the Estimates were very precisely circumscribed and would have required the prior agreement of the Minister. Those measures are completely at variance with this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net impact of the motion would be, as I think somebody said last night, to create 166 Ministers for Finance in this House.  I am not sure if the Irish people would welcome that development.  A likely outcome of the passage of this motion would be to place the Government in the position where they could be <Col N="1198" /> forced to fund policies with which they are in fundamental disagreement.  That does not seem to make any sense at all, particularly as those policies could be out of sync with other policies and objectives being pursued by the Government.  As Deputy Desmond suggested, we would have a sort of a Ballinasloe horse fair here every time we debated the Estimates where at the end of a long day of hard debating we would spit in our hands and split the money one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy Desmond which is very valid is that the whole exercise would be no more than simply an elaboration of the system of <i>virement</i> which applies within Departments anyway in that the Opposition, who presumably would be moving these amendments to the Estimates, would not be in a position to amend the overall size of the Estimates and would simply be enabled to fiddle about with the deck-chairs on the ship.</P>
    <P>The point was made last night that the constitutional role of the Dáil is to consider the Estimates and not to rewrite them.  That is a very valid interpretation of what the Constitution seeks to achieve. The point was also made that the end effect of implementing this very silly motion would be to radically alter the concept of the Executive being accountable to the Dáil, which is central to our Constitution, and to replace that central notion with a sort of shadow of the American system where the Government of the day &mdash; and it would have to be a minority Government &mdash; would have to negotiate with the Dáil.  The point here is that if the Dáil wished to control a Government who had a majority, clearly it would not have the opportunity to do so via this motion.  It could only effect the change on a minority Government.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt at all that we need to reform the manner in which Dáil Éireann fulfils its objectives as guardian and controller of the public purse.  Equally there is no doubt in my mind that the Dáil only vicariously fulfils its constitutional responsibilities in this matter. For many years the whole system of Estimates has been rightly criticised.  The <Col N="1199" /> ludicrous position has obtained for decades whereby the Dáil finds itself &mdash; or found itself until recently &mdash; presented with Estimates after the commencement of the financial year to which those Estimates pertain.  Then it only got around to debating those Estimates half way through the financial year.  I was pointing out to a group of people to whom I was talking yesterday a particular year in which something of the order of 63 per cent or 64 per cent of all current expenditure was actually debated and passed on the nod in this House on the last day before the summer recess a few years ago.  When one examined the quality of debate that had been devoted to the remaining 35 per cent one found it left something to be desired.</P>
    <P>That practice has been changed to a welcome degree by an initiative on the part of this Government, proposed by many in this House, that the Estimates should be introduced earlier.  The Government have done that this year and did so last year.  They introduced a procedure whereby the Estimates are now being introduced well in advance. Indeed the Government deserve credit for that.  As I have said, the idea is not a particularly new one but then anyone can have a good idea; it takes a good Government to implement good ideas.</P>
    <P>However, the fact remains that while the Estimates themselves are being introduced earlier than was the case heretofore, the quality of debate on those Estimates, to say the least, is parochial. Inevitably many of the contributions fall far short of being precise, concise or constructive. Usually they are geared at local consumption.  Inevitably they are geared toward the local press and invariably have little to do with the Estimates under consideration anyway.</P>
    <P>Of course there are problems other than the quality of debate.  The form of the Estimates itself needs to be examined. The system of Estimates, the system of public accounting we have could reasonably be characterised as shoe box accounting.  I have suggested to groups in another forum that there is <Col N="1200" /> no doubt in my mind that even small businesses could not survive with the form of Estimates and accounting we have.  We need a comprehensive accounting system with regard to the public Estimates. Otherwise, the debates make no sense.  If one examines the system under which the Estimates are laid out one discovers that they could not be designed more ingeniously to disguise precisely on what it is the money is being expended. Currently money is aggregated in the Estimates under meaningless subheads. The system of subheads does not allow one to establish precisely the cost of individual programmes.</P>
    <P>Again, comprehensive systems are being researched and devised in the Department of Finance and two sets of comprehensive accounts have been published by them.  The facts of the matter are they have not been debated and, in my view, it will be a long time before we see them in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond returned to an old theme of his, the lack of an effective committee system.  Certainly his arguments in that respect ring true with me. However, the facts of the matter are that an effective parliamentary committee system can exist only if we have a truly effective parliamentary system.  In our committees at present we lack staff, money and a sense of direction in order to achieve anything worthwhile; it could not be otherwise.  I can say, as chairman of one committee, it is extremely difficult for Deputies &mdash; concerned as they are with many other issues &mdash; to devote time to parliamentary committees in order to achieve anything worth while.  For many years Deputy Desmond and Deputy John Bruton have argued the case for effective committees.  It appears to be a good idea on paper but the reality was that, while they were in power, they did nothing to implement those good ideas.  As I have said already, it needs good Government to implement good ideas.  Certainly that is what we did not have in the four years prior to the present Government assuming office.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary reform can move ahead only alongside administrative reform and <Col N="1201" /> reform of our electoral system.  I agree with the points Deputy Desmond made regarding the impact of the multi-seat constituencies.  As he has argued the case inside and outside this House, the larger the size of the constituency the greater will be the competition.  I wonder if Deputy Desmond sincerely believes this view &mdash; certainly he has repeated it on sufficient occasions for us to believe that it is his sincere view.  Yet why is it that on every occasion on which there is a suggested change in the parliamentary system, or in the electoral system, or when there is a suggested change in the number of seats in constituencies, he seems to scream so loudly?  He is correct when he says that one cannot expect Dáil Deputies &mdash; who must, of necessity, devote the vast majority of their time to constituency tasks &mdash; to turn around and devote an equal proportion of their time to committee work if, by devoting that time to committees, they endanger their very existence in this House.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the very way we go about conducting our public finances, the whole way we go about controlling them, requires to be reviewed from time to time.  The only effective measure in this area introduced in the last decade was the decision taken last year, and this year, to produce the Estimates well in advance of the financial year to which they pertain.  There was another initiative some years ago but it aborted by the then Coalition Minister for Finance, former Deputy Richie Ryan, in 1973 when he decided to terminate an experiment, also introduced by Fianna Fáil.  That was an experiment into an overall change in the Estimates system, or what was described as experimental programme budgeting.  Perhaps it was Deputy Ryan's inexperience at that time that led him to bow to pressure from the Department of Finance and other Departments to get rid of that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are left in circumstances in which we are confronted this evening with a truly stupid motion.  There can be no doubt in my mind that the Dáil will reject it.  I cannot see any sense in the motion.  It is doubly silly in the fact that <Col N="1202" /> it has already been rejected by Dáil Éireann.  I see nothing in this motion to commend it to the House.  For that reason I am pleased to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I require no more than five minutes.  First, may I thank Deputy Carey and the House for their graciousness in agreeing to allow me participate in this debate.</P>
      <P>I found the arrogance of the previous speaker &mdash; often illustrated in this House &mdash; to be absolutely unlimited.  I find it remarkable, that though no longer a Member of this House than I, he can comment on former Deputy Ryan's inexperience in 1973, that former Deputy of this House now a member of the Court of Auditors of the European Court.  Then he went on to inform the House that this is an utterly stupid motion.  It is not a stupid motion at all and is deserving of a little more consideration than to be subjected to that type of dismissive arrogance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two fundamental issues have been raised here this evening, the first suggested by the Labour Party amendment &mdash; which I understand has now been abandoned and is not being moved, for whatever reason &mdash; deals with the whole question of the adequacy of funding in Estimates generally.  Certainly that is a subject that deserves argumentative debate at any stage.  I can understand the insensitivities of somebody on the Government side of the House having to address that issue at any time.  On the other hand, the question raised by the Fine Gael substantive motion, in itself, is a worthy one which should be examined, <Col N="1203" /> that is, how, once the figures have been struck, how we might influence their allocation or manoeuvre in order to meet current needs in the way in which the House feels they should be met.  The issue is a very worthy one, and if the Labour Party amendment had been moved The Workers' Party would have supported it. In the event that it has not been moved, I do not think further comment should be made.  In the short time I have &mdash; and I appreciate the facility being afforded me by Deputy Carey &mdash; I simply want to comment on the more substantive motion and the issue that will be put here tonight.</P>
    <P>The question clearly is one as to whether this House and the Deputies here should have a say in the moving around of the level of funding to particular areas.  I cannot understand why, once the Estimate has been laid, we cannot, for example, argue whether money should be moved out from one subhead into the Department of Health Estimate, for instance, to take it away from support to private hospitals, consultants and the clinics and move it into public health to try to reduce the long queues of people who are waiting for badly needed and urgent medical, dental and emergency care.  How often do we hear of the inadequate number of beds, as illustrated by the situation in St. James's Hospital, which has been forced to close its doors in the last few days because of inadequate number of beds.  Imagine the situation now arising in a major urban hospital, where after one casualty session alone it can be put to full capacity and be forced to close the doors to other admissions with cancellations down the line.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with putting forward in the course of a debate on the Estimates, a proposition to say that money earmarked under the health Estimates, for example, for private hospitals, for consultants fees, for support to the private clinics, be not so spent but be moved to where it can meet the needs of the general public? The same arguments can be put with regard to education.  What is wrong with Deputies in this House arguing, for <Col N="1204" /> example, that perhaps the lavish supports afforded to private schools might in some way be curtailed in favour of public education to help with pupil-teacher ratios and to help with remedial teachers in disadvantaged areas?  It simply belies all logic or understanding whatsoever of a Member who takes an active part in this House to argue against such a proposal.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal is a very modest one in this context because it provides a failsafe procedure for the Minister moving the Estimate or indeed, the Minister for Finance, in particular, to avoid a decision that is not satisfactory or acceptable to Government.  It allows for the Minister to bring before a Dáil committee a certificate &mdash; no more than that &mdash; saying that the decision of the Dáil does not meet with the objectives laid down in the Estimate or Government policy.  It is an absolute safeguard.  It is incredible listening to Government Deputies suggesting that this motion from Fine Gael is an attempt to undermine the authority of the Minister for Finance or to undermine the Government in their policy or indeed any particular Minister moving an Estimate or calling for support.  The Taoiseach's response and that of his Government to this motion was somewhat hysterical.  It deserves far more careful consideration. It certainly was deserving of better contributions than I have heard here tonight.</P>
    <P>The final point I would make is that it is clearly a motion designed to meet with the current situation of a minority Government.  It is only fair and proper that where a Government are running the country and moving Estimates from a minority position they should be susceptible to a majority view on the particulars of each Estimate, as is available with regard to the overall Estimate.  The motion suggested no more than that.  For anyone to suggest that it is some form of democratic subversion is ridiculous and hysterical.  The Government could have been far more magnanimous and level headed.  They should have considered taking this on board rather than creating the kind of situation which has helped to <Col N="1205" /> fuel the rumours going around.  In conclusion, on behalf of The Workers' Party, I would like to say that, if the Taoiseach wants an election, let him call it and let us get on with it.  We welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night my colleague, Deputy Dukes, moved the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to present immediately amendments to Standing Orders governing Estimates debates to provide that:</P>
      <P>He listed (a), (b), (c) and (d).  This is the second time this motion has come before the House in two years.  Many cases were made for and against it in this House.  I suppose the most impressive aspect about this Government is the way in which they have adopted the enterprise culture. Indeed, the Minister for Finance was very expansive last night when praising himself for the achievements which his Government had undertaken since they came to power.  He was niggardly in giving any credit to the Opposition and, in fact, he decried any suggestion that some of the proposals which this Government have acted on originated in other quarters like, for example, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, who was probably the author of this motion.  Certainly, he was the author of the Estimates of October, 1986, which were the basis of the budget of 1987 and which set the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, on the high road.  I applaud the then Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach for taking good advice and for doing exactly what the country needed.  I am not in any way niggardly in saying that; but on the other hand, I would like if the present Minister for Finance would be a little more generous regarding the efforts and the sacrifices that my party had to suffer as a result of saying that this country was financially almost insolvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us last night about how matters have progressed and how we have now succeeded in bringing forward the Estimates.  I applaud him for that.  That was an objective of Deputy <Col N="1206" /> Bruton.  He worked hard in the Department for Finance to see that this matter was put in place.  Similarly, with regard to the tax amnesty, he went abroad and studied it and all the ground work was in place.  I recall that when the first basis of the tax amnesty was introduced here and when the sheriffs were mentioned the Fianna Fáil Party were roaring and shouting about what sheriffs would do.  The sheriffs provided a major weapon in the tax amnesty.  But the Minister for Finance did not get up and say last night that the sheriffs did a good job.  He said that we took no good decision, that we were afraid to take the right decision, that we were afraid to take decisions that would result in good Government, in good financial order.  I thought the Minister for Finance would be much more generous. Certainly, when he was on this side of the House he would always end his contribution by saying that Deputy Bruton was for private investment and that he would rely more on the private sector to take this economy out of its difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional crisis might occur then.  This motion was put down because of the position of minority Governments.  Certainly, the Taoiseach has been successful since he became the leader of the third minority Government of which he has been in charge.  In any case, as far as I am concerned, this minor adjustment which would have to take <Col N="1207" /> place as a result of this motion should not cause the Taoiseach any embarrassment.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance are not that fallible and if there was a minor mistake in the Estimates, or budget, or somewhere along the line which the Opposition felt should be rectified but with which the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance disagreed &mdash; if they got a blind spot in the matter &mdash; should we go to the country on a trivial matter like that?  Why should the country be faced with an election, or a vote of confidence?  Why can this country not have a period of stability and confidence?  My party have offered that to the country.  At the IMI conference in Killarney a couple of years ago there was talk about confidence and delight that the main Opposition parties were supporting the Government to at least rectify the financial position.  The buzz in the National Chambers of Commerce meeting in Ennis was about the prospect that Fine Gael would support the Government again in the following Finance Bill.  That was the position in financial and business circles with people who wanted to provide employment and create wealth.  They recognised that the Fianna Fáil Party were in minority Government and needed our support.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance was criticising my colleagues, Deputy Dukes and Deputy Noonan last night, I thought that at least he would have mentioned the consensus in the House.  That word &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; does not exist at all in the Minister's vocabulary.  The Minister does well, &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; is the big word with him, as are &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and &ldquo;the deal&rdquo;. This motion trivial as it is would create more confidence in this House, it would be a historic event because a minority Government would not have to fall on a small matter and we could do a little deal across the House without people outside making it awkward for Opposition parties to have any truck with Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the idea that this motion would be contrary to the Constitution. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle served on Dublin Corporation and was able to persuade the city manager that his estimates <Col N="1208" /> could be changed within the different heads.  In some cases he had to argue long and hard, but most of the results turned out to be good.  When the elected representative stuck in his shoe and looked for something, even small, with regard to a transfer from one head to another, it always turned out well.</P>
    <P>All we are asking for here is that the dead hand of the Department of Finance be lifted.  We had a rehash of a script from the Minister of State.  The Taoiseach would want to get them to do something about their word processors, because the same material is given out over and over again.  They seem to have no new ideas, certainly not when they are criticising proposals such as this.  This is the case especially when their authority is being undermined, or even questioned. Parliament could compliment the Department of Finance, or that Department might compliment Parliament.  We could work together.  The simple motion produced by Deputy Bruton is casuing great hassle and has been rejected out of hand for no reason other than that there is not the enterprise, and the Department do not want to experiment or change.</P>
    <P>The big target that we must aim for is 1992.  We all want to see everything put in order.  The Minister lectured us last night about cost competitiveness, despite the fact that he put 5p on the price of petrol in the budget, among other things. We want to be ready to make the leap forward and big business is involved with regard to 1992.  They have put in their oars and are going forward.  The Taoiseach himself realised this, which is why he made the supreme sacrifice of spending four days in Japan, necessitating a gruelling journey.  He realises that the chop-down date for 1992 is fast approaching and if this Government and the next Government do not get their act together with the Japanese and other large businesses in the next two or three years we will have lost out totally.</P>
    <P>The motion is a proposal to improve the simple efficiency of this Dáil without having an election that everybody dreads and to avoid embarrassment to minority Governments.  It was put down in a <Col N="1209" /> generous spirit.  I am surprised at the other Opposition parties in the House &mdash; one for constitutional reasons but for a spurious reason by the Labour Party &mdash; rejecting it.  The Department of Finance are running the Government, which is why the Government have knocked it down.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, when he returns to his office, to have another look at the contents of the motion.  Perhaps he might implement it; it will be historic and a leap forward and he will have done something positive for the country in the financial area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow the persuasive tones of my colleague, Deputy Carey, and the good sense which he is enunciating.  This is a very serious debate.  This motion seeks to do something very important to give the Dáil and the Oireachtas more powers and a more direct and relevant role in the most important aspect of ordinary people's lives, which is the provision of public services and the expenditure of public money.  Much lip service has been generated over very many years from different parties to the effect that we must modernise and reform our Dáil procedures, but when something practical is put forward specifically to do something to this effect, we have only the support of Fine Gael and The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>Our present structures in relation to public expenditure are quite clear.  We have the Committee of Public Accounts, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the former Committee on Public Expenditure.  They all had one thing in common; they could examine public expenditure only after the money had been spent.  This motion seeks to allow amendments to subheads of individual Estimates, which can only improve our parliamentary and Government system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into this House in 1981, both as a backbencher and now as a Opposition frontbencher, I have utterly rejected the view that a monopoly of wisdom exists within the Civil Service and the Cabinet, even to the exclusion of <Col N="1210" /> Ministers of State.  This arrogant viewpoint, unfortunately, is reflected in the Government's text book answers which the Minister and the Minister of State came forward with tonight and last night. Two years ago I, also, had the pleasure of visiting Japan.  Even though Japan has had one political party in power for 34 years, there is a strong system under which the budget is agreed and debated in the Parliament for a period of months. It is on a consensus basis that detailed programming of expenditure is developed.  Similarly, we all know that on a daily basis dialogue and interaction take place between Capitol Hill and the Presidency of the United States for developing their bugetary arithmetic. Similarly, right across the Continent, with both minority and Coalition Governments, it is common to see parliamentary procedures which allow a consensus to develop on matters of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is simply ridiculous that this Dáil is allowed to have a role solely in terms of Committee Stage debates and to have an input into how finance is raised through Revenue and taxation but has no say in relation to public expenditure which often exceeds public taxation, except for these hollow and meaningless four hour Estimates debates that are usually tumbled together before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate there has been much talk about procedures, talk in the abstract.  I wish to hone in on one aspect of the public service which is crying out for urgent procedural reform.  I am referring to the appalling deterioration in the quality and availability of our health service which other people have spoken of in this debate.  Unfortunately, over the last two years we have seen a desperate deterioration in the public health services. Take three brief examples of the biggest problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to outline the problem. As we speak here tonight there are 50,000 people on a waiting list for either in-patient or out-patient hospital services &mdash; young children who could suffer permanent hearing damage who are awaiting ENT treatment, people who have cataracts and are awaiting ophthalmology treatment and so on.  The first major problem in relation to how we spend our health money is the waiting lists for public patients for hospital treatment.  This problem has worsened over recent years and often people become traumatised because of the delay in carrying out hip replacements operations and they have to be admitted through the accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>The problem of waiting lists is added to by the restrictions on the care of the elderly.  There is no proper planned provision of the 10 per cent of our Health Vote that goes to the mentally handicapped services.  There are not enough places for adult mentally handicapped persons.  We have the Child Care Bill going through this Dáil but no planned extra provision for child care facilities that are urgently needed.  We have seen the virtual elimination of dental and optical services.</P>
      <P>Is the Dáil to be confronted with the simple, straightforward position where we say £1.3 billion is enough to run the health services, or are we to have a more meaningful role where we can say there is a choice between cutting the frontline of health care services and going for other options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believe through this motion that there is an alternative.  By altering the subheads of Health Estimates Votes we can get a fundamental reorganisation of the delivery of our health services to free those resources in that Estimate towards the areas of greatest need that I have outlined.  The case for restructuring <Col N="1212" /> the Health Estimate expenditure is obvious when we contrast the position between health expenditure here and in the UK.  We spend £22.50 <i>per capita</i> of our total population on our health services. Britain spends £23 per head of population.  In this country medical card holders comprise somewhere under 40 per cent of the population; those are the only people entitled to free medication, free GP services and free hospital service. In Britain, for 50p extra per head of population they are entitled to free GP care, free hospital care, free consultant care and free drugs &mdash; everyone, 100 per cent of the population, and their charges are far lower than ours.  For a difference of 50p per head of population, how can they give a free service to all their population when we give an inadequate service to 40 per cent of our population?  In this country 34 per cent of the population are paying £120 million through the VHI because of the inadequacy of their cover.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates will appreciate that his contribution is more in accordance with a debate on an Estimate for Health.  He has not yet demonstrated how the application or acceptance of this motion would remedy the alleged omissions and shortcomings to which he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving to show there are clear alternatives and areas where we could switch the money from one subhead to the other, if you will allow me a little time to develop it.  I am making the point by international comparisons that the volume of expenditure on health is not unreasonable.  We spend £120 million of the health expenditure on drugs. Only today a report from the Consumers Association of Ireland says we pay the second highest prices for drugs in the EC, second only to West Germany.  Of the short range of drugs used, we are by far away the most expensive on ten items. My contention in relation to this motion is that we are spending needless amounts of money on drugs in two instances, firstly because we have an unsustainable agreement with FICI whereby we pay UK <Col N="1213" /> prices plus 10 per cent, when we can buy some of the same drugs at half the price on the Continent.  Secondly, we can obtain savings on drugs by using generic drugs that do not have expensive brand costs attached to them through R and D and patent expenditure.</P>
      <P>The second area of reallocation of resources within the health services becomes available when one sees that of the 56,000 people employed in the health service over 7,000 are employed in clerical and administrative duties.  The front line of health services, mainly nurses in hospital wards, have borne the brunt of the cutbacks, while under the present structures administration is swallowing up increased resources.  We have eight personnel and finance systems through our eight health boards, despite the fact that the Department of Education through one simple administrative system can pay more teachers than there are staff in any one health board.  Therefore, I believe direct efficiencies can be made by giving this House the powers envisaged in this motion by reallocating resources and not saying it is simply a question of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Health Estimates and that we are satisfied that the Minister for Health is adequately managing our scarce resources.  If we look at the adoption of the latest technology methods, we have very minimal levels of computerisation of such matters as medical records that are very labour intensive.  We lack technology when it comes to energy conservation such as thermostatic controls in hospitals and in catering and laundry services, greater efficiencies can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this House to have an empty, hollow, meaningless role when it comes to spending £1.3 billion on an essential service that affects people whether they are in the town or the country, rich or poor, or are we just to act as a rubber stamp because we have no other way of making an input?  When we look at our Health Estimate as one Estimate we will see that this motion is of direct relevance.  We spend only 1.7 per cent of the Health Estimate on health promotion in terms of preventive medicine, when experience <Col N="1214" /> shows that &mdash; the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health spent a great deal of time promoting positive health programmes and healthier lifestyles &mdash; if you can achieve a positive health programme and a better and healthier lifestyle, that is the best way to reduce your health bill.</P>
    <P>This motion is not an academic daydream, not some nebulous Private Members' motion.  It is of direct relevance to the hundreds of thousands of people on waiting lists who are crying out for services.  On the capital side many hospitals are urgently awaiting equipment and there is a paltry allocation of £3 million on the capital side of the Health Vote this year.  Let us look at our property management in the health service to see if we have idle assets that could be reworked into providing vital lifesaving equipment for our patients.</P>
    <P>I could refer to many other areas in our health service, such as management training and reform, in two minutes' time this House will be given a choice between the textbook approach of Deputies Reynolds and Treacy, Minister for Finance and his Minister of State who say that the power of the Department of Finance, the pyramid structure or the Executive of the Cabinet is not to be breached in any way, and what Fine Gael propose in this motion.  The Ministers' approach flies in the face of all international experience and a public desire for our parliamentarians to have a greater role.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond in this debate said the correct answer to this problem was to have Estimates committees.  He acknowledged that the debating structure for Estimates is appallingly inadequate. I have been chairman of a committee of this House.  Committees are allowed to produce reports and are given back-up services, but we have not got very far in debating reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Committees are not an adequate response.  To say that Deputies have the privilege of putting down Parliamentary Questions is not a reasonable response by the Minister of State to the crisis in health and other vital services.</P>
    <P>Is this House to be modernised?  Are we to play a more meaningful role or <Col N="1215" /> are Deputies expected to push paper and spend more of their time on vocational education committees, county councils and other local committees?  If we are to have a meaningful role, we must modernise this House.  The Fine Gael Party, both in and out of Government, have consistently put forward reforms of this <Col N="1216" /> House.  This is another in that long list.  I call on the House and on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle to consider it and act in a positive fashion so that we are able to deal effectively with Estimates of public expenditure.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening because it is something very serious and worthy of attention in this House.</P>
      <P>The cancellation of all routine admissions to St. James's Hospital in Dublin both yesterday and today highlights once again that our public hospitals, particularly in Dublin, cannot cope with the number of sick people requiring hospitalisation. Now only accident and emergency cases can be admitted to most of the public hospitals in Dublin.  Patients are either left until they become emergencies before they can get a bed or are becoming emergency cases in order to get a hospital bed.</P>
      <P>The problems that arose in St. James's Hospital when they were on call last Monday night are not unique and have occurred several other times this year.  In order to facilitate admissions while the hospital was on call the management had to use the 12-unit day care bed centre to facilitate the patients who came in that night and required hospitalisation.  This resulted in that ward not being made available for the many long planned investigative cases including at least six colonoscopies and in 25 people having to be sent home yesterday morning.  It is appalling that patients who had already begun the preliminary procedures required before entering hospital for these treatments should be treated in such a way.  Sick animals would be treated better than this; it would be easier to have a sick dog attended to in Dublin than a sick person.</P>
      <P>Last summer when problems arose in the accident and emergency services in Dublin the Minister established a committee, one of his famous 21 committees appointed since he assumed office, to review the situation and to report to him. That committee, consisting of representatives of the public hospitals and of departmental officials have, I understand, submitted their report to the Minister. I understand they confirmed that there is a serious shortage of beds in the public health system in Dublin.  I would like to ask the Minister to comment on this report and to say whether he will make its contents available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in Dublin arise from the fact that the Minister has closed both Dr. Steevens's and Baggot Street Hospitals <Col N="1219" /> without making any provision to replace the beds lost.  Approximately 1,000 beds have been taken out of the public hospital system in Dublin since Deputy O'Hanlon took office.  This Minister has adopted a policy of cutbacks without setting in place the necessary management procedures to ensure that there is not an undue delay and that hardship is not being caused, particularly to public patients.</P>
    <P>Over 75 per cent of all the beds in the Mater Hospital are now at the disposal of the accident and emergency services. In the Adelaide Hospital's annual report for 1988, published last week, they confirm that they cannot now do any elective work.  Over 100 beds at St. James's Hospital are designated for emergency cases; obviously, this number is quite inadequate for the demand, given what happened on Monday night last.  The taxpayers have already spent over £70 million on the building of two new hospitals in Dublin which have been lying idle for up to two years.  One such hospital is at St. James's and the other is at the Mater. The Minister refuses to give any date for the opening of these new hospitals and I am now calling on him to give these dates and, in particular, to say when he intends to open the new hospital at St. James's. Already £5 million has been borrowed to equip this hospital.  I would call on the Minister and the Government to do whatever is necessary to ensure that these facilities are used.</P>
    <P>Our hospital services are now in a very serious position and the immediate future looks very bleak indeed.  As the year progresses the problems that came to light this week at St. James's Hospital will become far more serious and far more common as the hospitals begin to run out of money.  The Minister must act now and stop hiding behind health boards and hospital managers.  It is Deputy O'Hanlon's responsibility to ensure that the public have access to hospitals when they require it.  It is not good enough that 25 people had to be sent home yesterday from St. James's Hospital, and may be more today, because the day ward was <Col N="1220" /> otherwise occupied.  If such a serious situation could arise on a normal Monday night in Dublin, what would the consequences be if we had a major catastrophe such as happened at Hillsborough recently?  Would our hospital system in Dublin, or indeed in the country, be able to cope?  It is no longer good enough for the Minister to simply wash his hands of his responsibility and to pass the buck and blame others.  It is now his clear-cut responsibility as the Minister for Health to come clean and tell us whether it is a lack of funding or bad management that is causing the problem.  It has to be either of these or a combination of both.  The Minister should take whatever action is necessary &mdash; and in doing so he would get the support of this House &mdash; to make sure that public patients in particular have access to a much needed hospital system when they require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to assure Deputy Harney that it is neither lack of funding nor bad management that is responsible for the problem that arose in St. James's Hospital on the night before last.  On the question of funding, St. James's received an allocation of £36.628 million in the current year compared with £34.2 million in 1988.  That sum of £36.6 million is well over half the sum the North-Eastern Health Board received to run four acute hospitals, two major psychiatric hospitals, six hospitals for the elderly and a whole range of community care services. Certainly, lack of funding is not the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that the management in St. James's is, in my view, particularly good.  The problem is that on this occasion the hospital was on call for the south side from 5 p.m. on the previous evening and 38 people required admission to hospital that night.  There has not been a similar occurrence for 12 months <Col N="1221" /> and the hospital simply was not geared for it.  I am sure Deputy Harney would be the first to complain if any hospital in this city was to keep beds available on the offchance that 38 patients would turn up for admission.  The usual number admitted to hospital at this time of the year is 12 patients a day and that is the reason this problem arose in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the anxiety and the upset experienced by the people but, as I have said, the extraordinary numbers requiring attention that night could not have been anticipated by those who organise the service.  There is a general consensus that this was an unusual occurrence. As I have said, a similar situation occurred only once in the last 12 months and was dealt with in exactly the same way as on this occasion.  Problems such as this arise from time to time because of the difficulty in predicting the number of emergency cases likely to be presented at a hospital in any period of time.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that you cannot organise hospital services or the number of people who turn up at a hospital in the same way as you would organise an air flight across the Atlantic where seats are booked a fortnight in advance.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable and unfair to select isolated incidents such as this and to cause unnecessary anxiety to patients and their relatives.  It is particularly inappropriate to do so in the case of St. James's Hospital which has shown a dramatic increase in the number of patients treated there in recent years.  There was an increase of 7 per cent in the number of patients treated there in 1988 over 1989.  It might interest the Deputy to know that 220,000 outpatients were treated in St. James's in 1988.  Deputies then come into the House and complain that we are not providing a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 18,000 day patients and nearly 20,000 in-patients were treated at that hospital in 1988. <Col N="1222" /> I would pay a tribute to the staff and management of St. James's for the way they have responded to the challenges that everyone in the public service has had to respond to in the last number of years, for very obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>On the question of the buildings in St. James's, I accept that they are not all suitable for service but I would point out to Deputy Harney that last year we provided £10 million to equip the X-ray department in that hospital and that has now been done.  Funding has been provided this year to equip the general hospital but it will not be ready to be occupied until the end of this year or early next year.  It is hoped to open the out-patient department later in the current year.  There is no lack of resolve on the part of the Government.  As I have said, we have provided quite adequate funding in the last year for the X-ray department, the out-patient department and the new in-patient block.  The new accident and emergency unit is part of the phase one development and is due to be opened later this year.  This includes 14 overnight beds, which should help to avoid the sort of problem that arose two nights ago.  I would assure Deputy Harney that the management and the funding of St. James's are adequate to provide the necessary level of services in the south Dublin area.</P>
      <P>On the question of the committee, I do not make apologies to anybody in this House for the fact that I set up committees. The difference between myself and the members of the Progressive Democrats is that I admit I do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  I am glad to bring in experts to advise me on a whole range of subjects such as hearing aids on which I have no technical expertise.  One of the committees to which the Deputy has referred deals with that matter.  I also set up an advisory committee on health promotion and that is another area that is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an ongoing committee and will be there, I am sure, for many years to come.  They report to me on a regular basis.  In the case of St. James's they reported that in November 1987 the total attendance at the hospital was 16,900 patients and in November 1988 it was 23,652 patients, an increase of 6,500 &mdash; and that is the service that is claimed to be run down.  Those are the reports I am getting from the committee. I accept there are difficulties with the accident and emergency unit because of the large number of people who attend. As I have often said in this House, there are areas that we have to look at, such as the level of consultant staffing in accident and emergencies and the level of general practitioner service that is available in the city of Dublin after 5 p.m., the whole question of prevention of accidents, of people not taking risks, what can be done to try to avoid accidents in the home, <Col N="1224" /> particularly with elderly people and children, and also on the roads, in the work-place and on the farm.  These are all areas that can be addressed.</P>
      <P>What happened in St. James's on Monday night was an isolated incident. Only once before in 12 months did the same problem arise.  There is no way of predicting that over three times the number of people who normally attend will turn up at accident and emergency for admission.  As I said earlier, I am sure Deputy Harney would be the first person to come in here and criticise me if I told St. James's Hospital to keep 40 beds available on the offchance that 40 patients would turn up.  On this occasion they dealt with the matter in the only way that is possible and practical to deal with such a matter.</P>

The insurance industry itself is conscious of the need to control and improve efficiency and a number of Irish insurers have introduced up to the minute computer technology with the aim of streamlining their operations.

      <P>Section 13 (1) of the <Col N="1086" /> Science and Technology Act, 1987, was designed to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce formal power to direct the agency in relation to significant policy measures.  I do not consider that the suspension of the furniture testing service at Eolas, for which, I understand, there was very little demand, constitutes a significant policy measure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the position regarding the dispute between his Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the staffing in the Companies Office, in order to allow extra staff to be appointed to that office to speed up the creation of companies on the basis that the increased activity would generate more than sufficient fees to pay for any extra costs involved in appointing additional staff.</P>

      <P>There is no dispute between my Department and the Department of Finance regarding staffing levels in the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, control of public service costs is a key factor in this Government's economic strategy. The Department of Industry and Commerce, along with other Government Departments are subject to the current embargo on the recruitment of staff and the filling of vacancies.  As a result, my Department have suffered a reduction in staffing levels which has impacted across all sections of the Department, including the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance referred to the fact that the reduction in staffing made it imperative that the public service be organised and managed in the most efficient way.  In keeping with this statement, the management of the Companies office are continually reviewing existing procedures. As a result of the implementation of new procedures in relation to the formation of new companies, I understand that the <Col N="1087" /> backlog which had existed in this area has been virtually eliminated.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the purchase of Irish raw materials and services by foreign grant&mdash;aided industry over the last three years for which data is available, 1985-1987, has increased significantly.</P>
      <P>Based on the results of annual economy expenditures surveys carried out by the IDA it is estimated that for foreign owned industry, purchases of Irish raw materials rose from £825 million in 1985 to £956 million in 1987 in constant 1987 prices.  The proportion of these companies' total expenditure on raw materials sourced in Ireland has risen from 27.5 per cent in 1985, to 29.6 per cent in 1986 and 31.6 per cent in 1987.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish services it is estimated that purchases of Irish services by foreign owned industry rose from £763 million in 1985 to £932 million in 1987, again in constant 1987 prices.  The proportion of total services' expenditures sourced in Ireland rose from 66.9 per cent in 1985 to 68.3 per cent in 1986 and 69.8 per cent in 1987.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, an <Col N="1089" /> experienced official was assigned, on a temporary basis, to the registry to assist with the merger of the FWUI and the ITGWU.  The amalgamation process is proceeding on time.  This special arrangement is being continued to deal with further steps in the process and any other matters that arise.</P>
      <P>If it should become necessary in the future to deal with major mergers of trade unions the question of augmenting the Registry staffing can be considered.</P>

      <P>No formal application <Col N="1090" /> for an increase in the price of petrol has been received from the oil companies.

Until the report of the Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission which I received last weekend has been fully examined and discussions have taken place with the oil companies I am not in a position to indicate what changes will take place.</P>
      <P>Because of this and the volatile nature of international prices, which can be seen from the fact that international spot prices increased from $173.63 in December 1988 to £274.10 in April 1989, it is impossible to predict what the retail cost of petrol will be over the next six months. The investigation currently being undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission may also have an effect on future retail prices.</P>

      <P>During the council negotiations I had sought no exclusion of producers because of the date of expiry of their non-marketing period.  While I was unable to obtain council agreement to this request, I did however, succeed in securing the more favourable date of 30 September 1983 which effectively applies only in Ireland as opposed to the date of 31 December 1983 which applies in other member states.</P>

      <P>The final part of Question No. 44 of 27 April referred to the dalay in determining the date for an appeal hearing for the person in question and the reply indicated that it had been decided to grant an oral hearing and that the person would be advised of the arrangements for the appeal as soon as possible. This was the best information available at that time.</P>
      <P>The conditions governing the processing of appeals are laid down in Part VIII of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  This prescribes that the chief appeals officer is responsible under the legislation for the distribution of cases among appeals officers and for the prompt consideration of appeals.</P>
      <P>While an appeals officer may decide an appeal summarily, in this particular case the claimant is being afforded an oral hearing to present his case personally to the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>Oral hearings are arranged in strict rotation by the chief appeals officer. While it was known that there was to be an oral hearing in this instance, the chief appeals officer had not arranged the hearing and it was not possible to give a definitive date.  The fact that this case had been specially referred to the medical adviser for an assessment of the medical evidence before it was submitted to the appeals officer added to the time taken in the appeal process.</P>
      <P>I now understand that this case will be listed for hearing by an appeals officer who will visit the area towards the end of the month.  The person concerned will be informed of the arrangements as soon as possible.</P>

They will, however, be extended to companies by regulations. As I indicated in my Budget Statement, it is intended to extend the arrangements to companies this year.  (ii) The Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, made provision for eventual repeal and amendment by ministerial order of sections of the superannuation code dating back to 1834.  The Act provided this would be done in conjunction with the making of a consolidated principal Civil Service superannuation scheme.  The scheme has been drafted and is with the Parliamentary Draftsman's office for clearance before being signed by me.  (iii) Section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the repeals contained in section 26 thereof relating to section 21 of the National Monuments Acts, 1930, and section 15 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, are not yet in force.

      <P>Under the export credit scheme, export credit finance is available to exporters who have both an export credit insurance policy and who trade on bills of exchange or letters of credit.</P>
      <P>Export credit finance is made available under a guarantee issued by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc (ICI) to the exporters financing bank, to which the exporter is also a party.  Finance may be drawn down by the exporter only after shipment and on presentation to the bank of various documents including shipping documentation.</P>

      <Col N="1103" /> As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 56 on Thursday, 27 April 1989, in the general operation of export credit insurance, the matter of giving a competitive advantage to any applicant does not arise.  In fact, a practicable approach to underwriting business is as far as possible adopted consistent with the desire to maximise export achievement which is the objective of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I had discussions with the oil companies on both 31 March and 13 April.  Prior to the meeting in April some of the companies had threatened to cease importing petrol into Ireland.  At an early stage of that meeting they agreed to continue importing petrol.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed on the fundamental importance of attaining faster economic growth in Ireland and on the essential contribution which low inflation must play in achieving this.</P>
      <P>It was noted that the difficulties in the market for petrol related to one-quarter of the total oil market.  Diesel, fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene are the products of key importance for agriculture, industry and the business sectors and account for three-quarter of the market.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting I introduced a maximum prices order controlling the retail price of petrol at levels current at that time; announced plans to introduce legislation banning the use of gifts, stamps and other incentives at petrol stations; allowed an adjustment between wholesale and retail margins to take account of the abolition of the gift schemes; requested the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission to undertake a study in trends in international oil product prices and announced that the INPC would produce additional supplies at below world market prices.</P>
