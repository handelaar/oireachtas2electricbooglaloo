    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in view of his stated commitment to proper funding of the arts, the action he is taking to ensure that increased moneys will be available to the Arts Council in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in voted moneys and in national lottery funding for the Arts Council in 1989 is £7.117 million.  This level of funding, which is 20 per cent higher than in 1986, is a reasonable achievement in the context of the reduction of public expenditure that has had to be made in many services over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, the Coalition Government organised that 35 per cent of the lottery takings, of the disbursable money, should go to the arts. Could the Taoiseach say what percentage is the £7 million that he has just announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The £7 million is not from the lottery.  It is from public funds and the lottery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say, then, what percentage of the surplus money from the lottery funds is given to the arts, by comparison with the 35 per cent designated by the Coalition Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to do a little calculation for the Deputy on that. Money for the arts does not go only to the Arts Council, but to the National Heritage Council, cultural institutions and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is only a very minor percentage by comparison with the 35 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Coalition Government ever delivered on the 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We delivered Fianna Fáil a lottery, which has been used since then.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nealon, with a final supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does all the money now arising from the lottery through his Department go through the Arts Council to the various beneficiaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that anything from the lottery for the arts should go straight to the Arts Council. The other situation was undesirable, whereby the Taoiseach was becoming a sort of second court of appeal from the Arts Council.  It is better that whatever money is to go to the arts from the lottery should be disbursed by the Arts Council. Then, there will be other moneys from the lottery for the National Heritage Council which will go straight to them. Further, there will be money for the cultural institutes such as the National Gallery and so on, which will go straight from the Taoiseach's Department to those institutions.  In so far as the general public <Col N="507" /> are concerned, apart from the National Heritage Council, all the money will go to the Arts Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach get in touch with the Minister for Education about that practice?  He might pass along that information to the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I apologise if I am repeating questions that have already been asked?  Has the money for 1989 allocated from the lottery to the Arts Council been given to them yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be given on the basis of a number of commitments already entered into by the Taoiseach's Department which the council must meet out of this year's allocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy has in mind.  The Arts Council will be given as much as we can give them from both State funds and the lottery. After that, it is a matter for them to disburse these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I have in mind is if the Taoiseach gives money from the lottery to the Arts Council for 1989, will that money already have been promised to various bodies around the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be completely free to spend that money in any way that they like, all of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can think, yes.  I do not know if there will be any on-going or repeat commitments from the disbursement made in 1988, which may have to be met by the Arts Council in 1989.  Offhand, I cannot think of any. As far as I am concerned, all the lottery funds will be handed directly to the Arts Council and disbursed directly by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether proceeds from the national lottery were used to fund the purchase of a computer, terminals and data processing equipment in his Department and the amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Urgent additional computerisation at a cost of £193,000 was undertaken in my Department in 1987 out of savings in the Department's Vote. The savings arose from the receipt of national lottery funds for cultural purposes and from savings in salaries and travel.  The computer expenditure was made by <i>virement</i> between subheads in accordance with standard Government accounting procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach now accept that this was an illegal use of the lottery funds, the purpose of that funding not being covered by section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, which specifies the purposes for which lottery funds can lawfully be applied and very specifically sets forth those purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not accept that.  The matter is absolutely in order. The lottery funds were, in fact, dedicated to cultural purposes.  Under the well known and well established financial document <i>virement</i> the funds were used for this other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of <i>virement</i> was that it involved a transfer from one subhead to another.  Surely the Taoiseach will accept that moneys coming into his Department from the national lottery may not be transferred under the <i>virement</i> rule, because the Act under which they came in, the National Lottery Act, does not permit of such transfer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Deputy that both he and I are a little out of our depth in this matter.  It is a matter of technical finance administration. The transaction is, I understand, fully in accordance with established financial procedures and has been validated by the accounting officer concerned and presumably by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The matter has also been aired at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Taoiseach's explanation.  I suggest that this was an illegal use of lottery funds. They were not Exchequer funds which were transferred from one subject to another; they were lottery funds which were specifically covered by the Act.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it should be incumbent on him &mdash; and his Ministers &mdash; to ensure that all moneys must be spent in accordance with the law and that the greatest care must be taken that the law is not broken in the expenditure of any public money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I fully subscribe to that and that is what happened in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of meetings of the Central Review Committee which have discussed progress on the employment targets in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>; and the areas in which progress has not, to date, lived up to expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Review Committee have met on 12 occasions to date and they reviewed the progress in achieving the employment targets at virtually all of those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 25 January 1989, in reply to a question from Deputy De Rossa, two of the meetings <Col N="510" />&mdash; on 26 October and 30 November 1988 &mdash; dealt entirely with a review of progress on job creation.  The committee published a report on 10 December 1988, and copies of the report were made available to the Oireachtas Library.  The committee's report shows that new jobs are being provided in full accordance with the targets set by the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are all behind the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, will the Taoiseach agree that we are deceiving ourselves to suggest that we have a success on our hands in creating 25,000 jobs when our own public statistics show that the manufacturing industry has lost 5,000 jobs since the beginning of the plan?  Jobs in the construction industry have been reduced by 10 per cent since the beginning of the plan.  Will he, therefore, agree that there is need for a much more realistic assessment of success in the area of jobs than the contents of the report to which the Taoiseach referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting out of hand the figures quoted by the Deputy. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> dealt with the creation of new jobs and did not advert to redundancies or job losses.  Apart from that I agree that progress on the whole job creation front needs to be expedited and intensified.  I have said this on a number of occasions and acknowledged the fact that there is an urgent need to create many more jobs if we are to keep pace with the increase in the workforce and make any inroads into unemployment and emigration.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is showing considerable results this year and there is a general acknowledgement in business and commercial circles that there is a pick-up in a number of areas, including the construction industry.  In addition, we will very shortly bring forward a national development plan, the vehicle which we will use to draw down the increase in Structural Funds over the next five years.  That will be mainly an investment plan and we can, with a great <Col N="511" /> deal of justification, expect increases in employment both in the implementation of the plan and in the spin-off of economic activity which will follow from the investment envisaged in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach request that the review committee, chaired by the Secretary of his own Department, will for their next review concentrate on net employment?  Will he agree that the national plan should be judged against the targets for net employment because until there is a net increase we are only codding ourselves by producing figures that do not reflect the true position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that if you did not have the creation of new jobs the net position would be much worse.  In fact, the Minister for Labour told me that already this year the figure for redundancies is very considerably down, which is another encouraging sign.  I will certainly ask the committee to bring forward some information regarding the net position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach concur with the view expressed by some members of the Government &mdash; particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; that even if these targets are achieved in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and even if the redundancy figures are down this year, it will have only a minimal impact, if any, on the unemployment figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be that pessimistic.  As I said, in 1989 we will start on the implementation of the national development plan which is related to the increase in Structural Funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the introduction of changes in regulations to establish the Irish National Ballet Company on the same footing with his Department as the National Concert Hall, or the Royal Hospital Kilmainham as distinct from the present status where the National Ballet Company operates through the Arts Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make any changes in the present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, the Arts Council have withdrawn all grants from the Irish National Ballet Company which amounts to a deliberate <Col N="513" /> killing of the company.  In view of that, and without in any way interfering with the independence of the Arts Council, will the Taoiseach consider making alternative arrangements for funding and for keeping the Irish National Ballet Company alive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I was discussing with Deputy Barry a moment ago; I gather from his question he would like the Arts Council to be totally independent and free to decide these matters for themselves.  I indicated I did not want to be in a position of being a court of appeal from the Arts Council. In an endeavour to help the situation and to leave it open to be considered by the new Arts Council I allocated some lottery funds to keep the company going until the end of the year so that the position would remain outstanding until the new Arts Council looked at the matter.  That is exactly what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's point but he knows the Arts Council have announced that they will have no funding for this year &mdash; or the next two years &mdash; in this area which means that the Irish National Ballet Company are being killed.  It is the end of the story as far as they are concerned. In view of this, does the Taoiseach not feel some obligation to put something in place which will sustain modern dance or ballet as an art form in this country, or is he going to abandon it entirely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must suggest to the Deputy that it is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Arts Council.  The decision whether or not to continue to support the Irish National Ballet Company is a matter for the Arts Council and any decision to put something else in its place would equally be a matter for the Arts Council, not for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach misinterprets the intention behind my question. The purpose was to find out whether the Arts Council, while appearing, from the Taoiseach's words, to be independent, are in fact getting moneys which have been already allocated by the Taoiseach's Department.  He assures me that that is not correct, and that they are free to spend their 1989 allocation any way they like.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it has been taken more than a generation to build up an audience for and an appreciation of quality of dancing in this country through the Irish National Ballet Company which would be irreplaceable if it were to be wiped out at this stage, and that it is incumbent on the Government to provide some funds to ensure that the work of a generation is not lost at this stage?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As no such regulations were made in 1988 I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, 1988, which was passed by this House recently.  It will be a matter for the national Authority to be established under the legislation to arrange for detailed publicity on the provisions of this legislation, when enacted.  I have no doubt that the authority will have regard to the important role of safety representatives when issuing guidelines on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to issue a directive to the new Authority to ensure that this information is made available as it is of vital importance that workers and employers should know their rights under this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions on the functions of safety representatives &mdash; that is not the only information the Deputy is seeking &mdash; in section 13, but it may and probably will be the Authority's wish to elaborate on these through guidelines and codes of practice or by regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> With regard to the provision of information, the most important and immediate task I will be asking the national Authority to undertake will be to ensure that all workers and employers are made aware of the provisions of the legislation and how it will affect them.  It is envisaged that the national Authority will provide information about the Bill by way of publication of guidelines, codes of practice and regulations and through the medium of seminars and training courses where appropriate.  I will be asking &mdash; not directing &mdash; the Authority, advising and requesting them to undertake a high profile for the contents of the Bill at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

There should be no disagreement on this either in this regard or in regard to giving a high profile to the contents of the Bill since all workers are covered by this legislation, the self-employed included.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings already and I hope to conclude the talks in the next few months.  It is only fair to say there are still fairly major differences of opinion and that these will remain.  The FUE would not wish to see any radical alterations in the present structures for part-time workers and the Deputy will know the ICTU are anxious that there will be <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for part-time workers.  I have to give consideration to both of those views and come to a balance.  I have said previously in this House that because there is a major change in the structures of work &mdash; the number of part-time workers has grown from just over 40,000 ten years ago to over 60,000 now, which is effectively just over 5 per cent of the workforce &mdash; there is a need to give more protection to people working in the part-time category for under 18 hours, but a balance must be struck on that.  Surveys have shown that the highest proportion of part-time workers are females, that up to 46 per cent of those are in part-time employment because that is what suits their family circumstances.  Against that there are people who are permanently part-time workers, who have no entitlements to holidays, maternity leave or <Col N="522" /> redundancy payments and have no redress in the case of unfair dismissal. That seems unfair, so I am trying to edge both sides towards a consensus.  I would be very glad to be able to deal with the issue tomorrow but, to be realistic, it will take another few months to get to the stage of a set of proposals which I can bring before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that 46 per cent of the working population would choose part-time work.  I think it is through necessity rather than anything else that they are forced to do so in many cases.  I can well understand the attitude of the FUE because at present lack of proper protective legislation for the worker is in favour of the employer.  The whole thing is being exploited to a frightful degree.</P>

      <P>That is a supplementary question.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some greater benefits in Europe.  The percentage of people in part-time employment is far greater in all other member states.  I know the figure is growing here and I agree with the purport of the Deputy's question that we have to make those changes.  I do not believe it is possible &mdash; this is where <Col N="523" /> the difficulty arises &mdash; to bring every part-time worker within the net in terms of the various pieces of legislation.  You have to find some definition that provides a basis for people who are regular part-time workers as opposed to part-time work, and try to bring them within the net.  I am seeking to get agreement on that. There are cost factors in this.  It is not just a matter of me bringing legislation before the House.  There is an employer's cost to it.  There is an employee's disadvantage in cost also.  There are fears among some employees that they may not continue to have employment.  I do not take too much cognisance of that because I think it is an excuse used by some unscrupulous employers who abuse this privilege but in the social welfare code there will be major changes to be made on foot of the legislation I will be bringing in.  Such issues are what will delay us in coming to a conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment are already provided for in certain sectors of the economy covered by joint labour committees.  It is open to any trade union or organisation claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of new joint labour committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the reform of industrial relations I gave consideration to methods of dealing with low pay.  It is my view that the joint labour committee <Col N="524" /> system provides an effective method whereby statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions can be established for various sectors, taking account of the economic, employment and industrial relations circumstances in those sectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill on industrial relations reform which is at present being drafted will, however, contain provisions designed to improve the operations of the joint labour committee system.  In addition, the new labour relations commission which will be provided for in the Bill will be charged with the responsibility of carrying out periodic reviews with a view to ascertaining whether new joint labour committees should be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I heard everything.  The Minister was rather rapid but I understand he intends to pursue this through the joint labour committees.  Will he agree that the manner in which they can do anything in this area is very limited at the moment and would involve around 40,000 workers?  Does the Minister intend to extend the legal powers of those committees in relation to a minimum wage? Secondly, has the Minister read the comments of Mr. Gerard McMahon, lecturer in industrial relations in the College of Commerce, Rathmines, to the effect that the provision of a statutory minimum wage could be of great benefit to the economy and to productivity in industry as well?

      <P>Yes, I read Gerard McMahon's submission in January and we have found it quite useful and interesting from the point of view of discussion and of how exactly to approach this matter.  We do intend to give some further strengthening of powers to joint labour committees.  The present position under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, is that if a group of workers, a trade union or the Minister in any sector believe that a group are not getting the full benefit of free collective bargaining, that group can apply to the Labour Court for the operation of a joint labour committee.  There <Col N="525" /> are 14 at present covering between 30,000 and 40,000 workers, all in the low wage area.  They could be used much more frequently.  There is a reluctance on the part of organised trade unions to use joint labour committees because they do not require them but in the unorganised area of the workforce there is, perhaps, room to beef up industrial relations.  There are independent members and an independent chairman and the committees are comprised jointly of employers and workers.  Such a committee is a useful forum.  At the same time we recognise the studies which have been done and Gerard McMahon's considerations on low pay.  They have a part to play.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The reduction in relation to the maximum rate payable under the social employment scheme for materials and supervision applies only to public sector projects and is applicable to new projects commencing after 1 January 1989.  I have no proposals to restore the rate of payment to its former level.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the average level of grant claimed that the reduction will not adversely after local authority participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The savings made will go towards maintaining the numbers participating in the scheme at the highest possible level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately refrained from reducing <Col N="526" /> the rate of grant payable to voluntary bodies sponsoring social employment scheme projects as I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by many of these bodies in raising funds for their activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reduction will be a disincentive to local authorities to continue with much needed social employment schemes in local authority areas, especially in view of the shortage of finance already being experienced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it will. There is still a great demand for places in the scheme.  This year the FAS budget will be £43 million and the SES Exchequer allocation will be over £40 million.  The claims history for public sector bodies shows that while they could claim up to 53 per cent, the actual amount paid was 45 per cent on average.  This is why I believed it could be reduced. Originally the numbers participating through the local authorities were very high.  The up-to-date analysis of the scheme shows that the apportionment of participation between public sector and voluntary bodies is as follows: public sector bodies, 45 per cent; voluntary bodies 55 per cent.  It was the other way around.  I do not believe it will create too much difficulty.  For the information of the House, the breakdown now will be 30 per cent for materials and 12 per cent for supervision costs.  The breakdown of the voluntary sector grant is 15 per cent for materials and 13 per cent for supervision. The balance is still in favour of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that the local authorities will have to reduce the number of people employed in social employment schemes otherwise they will have to recoup the money elsewhere. Will it mean additional money on the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will.  If I believed that I would not have made the changes.  I based it on the two cases <Col N="527" /> stated.  The claims were 45 per cent.  We have done a major study of the social employment scheme and while it has some disincentives, I do not think this is one of them.  We have made some changes in the budget regarding the social employment scheme and I hope to make more.  It is a very useful scheme and I am very glad we can continue it at the same level in the local authorities.  I do not believe this will be a disincentive to them. The demand continues to be extremely high for social employment places.  This slight reduction and a few other changes in the scheme will allow more numbers to participate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that FÁS in some parts of the country have been advertising jobs in Great Britain; if it is appropriate that public moneys allocated by his Department to FÁS should be used for such purposes; if he approves of this practice by FÁS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Freedom of movement to take up employment is one of the fundamental principles of the European Community.  The principles are contained in Articles 48 to 51 of the EC Treaty.  The procedures to implement the principles are contained in Regulation 1612/68 which prohibits any form of discrimination in the treatment of nationals, including employers, of other member states.</P>
      <P>FÁS are, therefore, obliged to treat vacancies notified by non-Irish employers and from the employment services of other member states in the same way as they treat vacancies arising in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As part of their pre-departure advisory services for prospective emigrants, FÁS provides information on working conditions and employment opportunities in other member states.  Most of the information is generated through SEDOC, the EC information exchange mechanism on job vacancies and job-seekers in the Community.  An important part of the information and advice service which FÁS provide to intending emigrants is concerned with dissuading from seeking employment abroad those for whom it would pose particular risks; e.g. the young, the unqualified and the unskilled.</P>
      <P>The organisation and delivery of job vacancy information is a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <P>I am shocked at the implications of the Minister's reply.  Is <Col N="530" /> the Minister saying that FÁS, funded by the taxpayers to retrain people in Ireland, are correct in advertising jobs abroad, in circularising employment exchanges and individuals about jobs abroad, particularly in London or New York?  Is that part of their function?  Is the Minister saying that jobs available in EC countries must be advertised in employment exchanges?  Will the Minister outline the role of FÁS in regard to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Regulation 1612/68 of the European Community freedom of movement constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their families. Under article 2 of the regulation any national of a member state, and any employer assuming an activity in the territory of a member state, may exchange applications for and offers of employment without any discrimination resulting therefrom.  According to article 3 of the same regulation provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action or administrative practices of a member state shall not apply where they limit applications for and offers of employment.  Section 4 (1) of the Act establishing FÁS, states: &ldquo;whenever so requested by them to facilitate and assist persons, in whatever manner An Foras considers necessary or desirable, in obtaining employment in a state that is a member of the European Communities&rdquo;. That, in simple English, means that FÁS must give information.  They do not use the SEDOC system to anything like its full potential.  Many young people are demanding that under that law opportunities or positions that come through that system should be made known to them.</P>
      <P>In some cases vacancies in member states are being advertised in FÁS offices. It is not something that is overly encouraged but there is a vociferous group who believe they should be advertised.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that, regrettable though it is, due to the fact that there is high unemployment and high emigration this is an entirely appropriate function for FÁS?  Is the <Col N="531" /> Minister aware that the manpower placement services of other Community countries have established offices throughout the Community and that they are finding jobs for their nationals, unlike us?  I can understand Deputy Mac Giolla's alarm at hearing we are placing people abroad but in my view it is better that our emigrants should have jobs before they leave rather than departing in the hope of getting a job and, perhaps, ending up sleeping under a bridge.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that what FÁS are doing is in compliance with EC law.  The extent that they should do it is a matter for debate. They are complying with an obligation imposed on them by the Community. They must comply with our Act to give information if they have it.  I must admit that that is not done to the extent that similar agencies in other member states do it.  That matter is under consideration by FÁS.  They have an obligation to ensure that they step up their activities but I must point out that they have done a lot of work since autumn 1987.  They have concentrated on advising those who are not suited, those who have not planned such action, are too young or who do not have skills.</P>

They say that Ireland voted on two occasions to stay in <Col N="532" /> the EC and that they have a right to know of vacancies in other Community countries.  Like other Members, I have heard young people say that the SEDOC system should be freely available here.  I must admit that if the SEDOC system was fully operational the number of jobs in Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain advertised here would be greater. The FÁS offices would be full of notices about jobs abroad.  We will have to look at this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not made an approach to the European Commission for financial support to assist in the settlement of Irish emigrants in Britain.  The European Social Fund can assist the integration of migrants into the host country with vocational training or, if necessary, language training.  Normally such a request for funding is made by the host country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this year the funds allocated for the assistance of <Col N="534" /> voluntary organisations providing front-line services for Irish emigrants to Britain have been increased by £250,000 to £500,000.  This major increase in funding will greatly facilitate DÍON &mdash; the London based committee which advises me on matters of emigrant welfare, in exploring new ways of helping Irish emigrants in Britain.</P>
    <P>In addition, FÁS, the Training and Employment Authority, who have responsibility for providing pre-departure information and advice services for intending emigrants, are in the process of upgrading those services so that people seeking employment abroad will receive every assistance in considering all the factors affecting their decision.  It is also FÁS practise to dissuade from emigration those who are not suitably prepared and who do not have the qualifications, skills and resources to ensure a reasonable chance of success.  In such cases, advice and information is offered on employment and training opportunities at home.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the vast majority of emigrants to Britain are well able to cope and manage to find employment and accommodation without recourse to voluntary organisations.  The real solution to the problem of enforced emigration is, of course, to create more employment here in Ireland.  The indications are that the Government's policies to boost the economy are now beginning to bear fruit.</P>

Would he not agree in view of the prohibitive cost of accommodation, particularly in London where it averages £90 per week, in view of the new restrictions by the DHSS which means that any Irish emigrant going there cannot qualify for <Col N="535" /> social welfare payments for a minimum of two months, and in view of the considerable squalor and subhuman conditions in which many Irish are living in Kilburn, in Camden Town and other parts of London, it is high time we made a direct application for such aid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that under the present European Social Fund rules assistance for the settlement of migrants may be claimed only by the host state.

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the fact that most EC aid that is disbursed comes, by and large, on a pound-for-pound basis, and in view of the fact that the Minister has this year made available an additional £0.25 million for DÍON thus bringing it to an inadequate £0.5 million, there could be considerable amenability on the part of the EC at least to provide an additional £0.5 million to enable the plight of the Irish emigrant to be considerably ameliorated?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the recent statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office which showed that the average weekly wage for women was considerably below that for men; if he intends to take any steps to promote greater equality in earnings between men and women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statistics to which the Deputy refers and which indicate that while the average weekly wage of women remains considerably below that for men, the slow but steady improvement of the index for women in manufacturing industry is being maintained.  The differences in the earnings shown between men and women result from a wide range of factors including wage rates, hours worked, overtime payments, shift or unsocial hours premia, payments by results, bonuses for output levels and payments for length of service. In addition, the statistics cover only a percentage of women who are at work and relate to the industrial sector where women tend to be segregated into certain low pay areas and confined to a restricted range of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the differential in pay between men and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone but in improved access for women to a wider range of jobs.  Nevertheless, there are a number of changes which I propose to make to the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, in the context of the general review of the employment equality legislation.  These changes will simplify, and make more <Col N="537" /> effective, the procedures for the pursuit of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that part of the problem is due to the fact that so many women are now employed on a part-time basis?  The Minister has just informed us that 46 per cent of the working population work part-time. While this prevails there will not be equality in the work place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 5 per cent of the workforce worked part-time.  I said the higher proportion were women, about 67 per cent.  The survey highlights why there are differences under various categories. The differences result from a huge range of factors.  The Employment Equality Agency and FÁS are trying to build in a bias for women.  In my view it is the range of areas, particularly in industry, that women are excluded from that creates many of the imbalances.  The report that Deputy Mac Giolla refers to shows that. It includes a great amount of data on the subject which I could perhaps circulate rather than reading through it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the claims made by the Free Legal Aid Centres that women workers are being denied the right to return to work after maternity leave by some employers, because of the over-complexity of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981; if he intends to simplify the procedures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="538" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, provides a general right to return to work after maternity leave.  That right is subject to the employee notifying her employer at least four weeks before the expected date of return and confirming this notification between four and two weeks before the expected date of return.  These requirements are necessary to provide adequate information to employers who must then make arrangements facilitating the employee's return to her job.</P>
      <P>Employees are clearly informed of the requirements of the Act on the application form for the Department of Social Welfare maternity allowances schemes.  In addition, the Department of Labour provide an explanatory booklet setting out the requirements of the Act.</P>
      <P>I understand that only a small number of cases come before the Employment Appeals Tribunal on this issue.  Over the last seven years an average of less than five cases per year have been heard by the tribunal in relation to the notification procedures.  This number of cases is estimated to represent only 0.05 per cent, or one in every two thousand, of all women who take maternity leave under the Act. Clearly, the notification procedures pose no difficulty for the vast majority of women availing of the maternity leave provisions of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take the last part of the Minister's reply first.  The Minister refers to the very small numbers who come before the courts in this regard &mdash; something like five a year.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is only a tiny percentage of people who will pursue such matters through the courts.  Consider all the people who accept a notification sent to them that they did not comply with the Act and are, therefore, not entitled to their allowance.  Will the Minister agree that the regulations are quite complex?  A series of written notices must be sent to the employer and the onus is on the employee to ensure that all of those notices are sent and if one is missed they lose their entitlement to maternity leave.  Could the Minister <Col N="539" /> reassess the complex procedures required and make them much simpler?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are over-complex.  I do not mind looking at it again but people are informed of what they have to do and, in fairness to employers, I do not think I can go all one way.  If an employee wishes to return to work having been out for a number of weeks, I do not think it is too much to ring up just to say they will be back with four weeks to go, and then to send a note with two weeks to go.  An employer who probably would have taken on a locum or a temporary person can then make the necessary arrangements to let that person go and bring back the person returning to the job.  The fact that the job is there is not the kind of thing a person would forget.  There are a very small number of cases only.  I understand that women are informed by the Department of Social Welfare when they go on maternity leave.</P>
      <P>What would introduce more certainty would be further notification by the Department of Social Welfare which might be too costly.  I examined that possibility but it would appear it would be too cumbersome and would cost quite an amount of money.  All we can do is engage in a campaign to exhort those people on maternity leave to be somewhat more diligent.  For example, last year there were four people involved only.  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that women would adopt the attitude &mdash; there goes my job.  That is not what happens in the case of the Employment Appeals Tribunal of the Labour Court.  It is more likely they would be fighting their case whether or not they were covered and most employers would not be too rigid in implementing the law. We are talking about employers who play the legislation to the ultimate.  But I will examine whether there is any way of notifying people without incurring substantial expenditure.</P>

      <P>It seems most unfair that, for a technical reason, a <Col N="540" /> person would lose the right to return to work.  Perhaps a provision stipulating that an employer would have to write to them before the relevant date would overcome the problem.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the reasons Irish industry has not been as successful as it might, and one of the contributory factors to poor industrial relations over the years, has been bad management?  In view of that would he agree also that there is great need for more and better management training?  Furthermore, if he accepts that contention, would he agree that we should be very slow to reduce assistance to the Irish Management Institute which is our only management training institute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy says.  The recommendations of the report refer to the relevant statistics, showing that of the top 1,000 companies <Col N="541" /> the vast majority spend less than £1,000 per annum on management training, and that there is a handful only who expend the necessary resources on the provision of proper management training.  The report contends that the bulk of State expenditure is devoted to business education rather than management training. For example, they state that £12 million was spent in 1986 on business education, £8.5 million of which went to the RTCs, just over £2 million to universities and £0.8 million to the NIHEs whereas, in contrast, £3 million only went to management training and development, that being divided between the IMI &mdash; which received less than £0.5 million &mdash; and the balance going to the Institute of Public Administration and FÁS.  The report in its recommendations emphasises that these moneys should go to the participants rather than the people who conduct the courses.  That is a matter that warrants consideration.  I agree with the Deputy that, were we to take all funding from the IMI, it would create enormous difficulties and constitute a retrograde step.</P>

In response to what Deputy Jim Mitchell has said, is the Minister aware that the Irish Management Institute have said that they are already adapting their procedures to the possibility that the day will arrive when State funding will be withdrawn and that they should then be given asistance for management training from within industry?</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major section of the Bill and deals with social insurance benefits. The measures included in this Bill represent an unprecedented improvement in the level of income maintenance support provided by my Department and will significantly improve the position of those dependent on social welfare, particularly families.  The approach I have adopted is to concentrate the available resources on improving the basic levels of payment in line with the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and in the ESRI poverty report.</P>
      <P>The 1988 and 1989 budgets provided significant increases for those dependent on the lowest levels of payment and it must be recognised that these increases are not reflected in the results of the ESRI survey.  Deputies will recognise the major improvements I have brought about since the ESRI survey was carried out.  This section deals specifically with the social insurance side of these improvements.  I have maintained the complete system of social insurance and since last year have extended coverage under the social insurance scheme to bring in the self-employed.  Of course, this has resulted in additional considerable income being brought into the social insurance fund and a reduction in the cost to the contributor.  Therefore, the PRSI payer is benefiting under the more equitable arrangements introduced last year and this is reflected in the cost of providing the increases under this section.  Consequently, there has been no increase in the PRSI contribution rates, either this year or last year.  In addition, we have through better management and control also made considerable savings for the taxpayer and for the PRSI member while, at the same time providing a better service.  The overall package of social welfare improvements of which this is part will this year cost £157 million on a full year basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 3 provides for an increase of 3 per cent in the weekly personal adult and child dependant rates of both social insurance and occupational injuries benefits.  The new rates of payments are set out in Schedule A to the <Col N="631" /> Bill.  These levels of increase are in line with the commitment contained in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i>&ldquo;to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits&rdquo; and have been achieved without any increase in PRSI contribution rates.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office the Government have more than honoured their commitment to maintain social welfare payments in real terms.  The personal rates of social welfare payments generally have increased by 6 per cent since July 1988 while the personal rates of long term unemployment assistance have increased by 24.3 per cent over that period.  To give some examples of the results of these increases in social insurance benefits, an old age contributory pensioner with an adult dependant, in other words, a couple on old age pension, will now receive £102.20 per week; a contributory pension for a widow with three children or for a deserted wife with three children will now be £96 per week; a person on invalidity pension with an adult dependant under 66 years of age will receive £85.60 and with three children will receive £119.80 per week.  A person in receipt of unemployment benefit with three children will now receive £124.30 per week.  This is a payment of £105.80 plus £18.50 in pay-related benefit, and is on the basis of the full pay-related benefit rate of 12 per cent which applies right throughout the period.  A person on unemployment benefit, with three children, and who is in receipt of pay-related benefit will receive £124.30.  In addition, in this section we have been streamlining the adult and child dependant allowances.  Since July 1988 the number of different rates of child dependant allowances for all social welfare schemes has been reduced by two thirds, from 36 to 12, and a minimum child dependant allowance of £10 per week per child is being introduced.  On the social insurance side an estimated 385,000 recipients with 278,000 dependants, a total of 663,000 people, will benefit, therefore, from these increases.  The effective dates are: for unemployment <Col N="632" /> benefit 20 July, for retirement pensions 27 July and for old age and widow's pensions 28 July.  The date, July, is similar to last year's date in this respect.</P>
    <P>This is very fair, worth while maintenance of the social insurance fund and of the benefits which members have from this fund.  Because of both the savings we have been able to have over the period through increased control and management and the improved income as a result of the self-employed participating at this time, we are able to do this without increasing the rates of social insurance contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is accepted on all sides of the House that the amounts involved are modest and many of the people who are living in poverty are those in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  That is why a number of the amendments I have tabled to this Bill relate to what I believe to be the main cause of poverty, that is lack of jobs.  I hope the Minister, even if he does not take the amendments I have tabled fully on board, will approach the social welfare legislation with a view to eliminating all aspects of the Bill which are a disincentive to employment.  If that is done we can tackle the cause of poverty and there will be more resources to increase the amounts available to those who will not be able to secure jobs.  I will return to that point in relation to a number of other sections, but I have to state here my fundamental approach to social welfare legislation.  It is absolutely necessary that this review take place so that all disincentives to employment be removed from the system.  That will ensure that we have more people working and more resources available to increase the quite modest amounts that are available for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in particular and, indeed, for the other social welfare categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I suggest to the Minister that further streamlining of this system is possible. Look at the figures now in regard to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  In many cases more <Col N="633" /> money is available to those in receipt of unemployment assistance than to those in receipt of unemployment benefit.  The latter, of course, have made contributions. The figures range from £42 to £45 unemployment benefit and £42 to £47 unemployment assistance.  The Commission on Social Welfare suggested that there should be a margin in favour of those who have paid their contributions; 10 per cent was the suggested differential in favour of those who had paid contributions and were in receipt of benefit.  I suggest the entire distinction be abolished altogether and the trend which has now developed be changed so that the amounts available to people on unemployment be the same.  The differential then would arise only from the point of view of means.  Those with contributions would be entitled to their payment based on their contributions, irrespective of means.  The amounts should be the same, and I commend to the Minister very strongly an approach for the future towards that end result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I am surprised at the Minister opening his contribution here today with yet another attempt at undermining the figures which show the level of poverty in our society.  I dealt with that on Second Stage and I am surprised the Minister should return to it and try to claim &mdash; or imply at least &mdash; that the levels of poverty are not as bad as shown by the ESRI because some improvement has been introduced in the meantime.  It may well be there are marginal improvements here and there, but the poor remain poor and nothing the Minister has done by and large has dramatically affected that.</P>
      <P>As another speaker on this section has said, the only effective way to tackle poverty is through job creation but not just any kind of job creation.  They have to be decent jobs with decent pay.  The ESRI report showed that a significant number of people living in poverty have jobs and they are in poverty precisely because they are on low pay and deprived of benefits which they might get if they were not inclined to work at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> I had nine amendments down to section 3 and all nine have been ruled out of order.  The amendments I put down sought two things, first to bring the dates on which the improved social welfare payments are paid back from the end of July to early April; second, to highlight the gap that still has to be filled to even go significantly towards meeting the proposals of the Commission on Social Welfare which urged massive increases in social welfare in order to alleviate the worst effects of poverty.  All those amendments have been ruled out of order, and because of that I propose to call a vote on section 3.  I am not satisfied that it is satisfactory that the payments being made or the slight increases being offered to those in poverty are deferred yet again to the end of July.  It is totally unsatisfactory that over the years, certainly since I came into this House, gradually these increases have been deferred from April to July.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increases we are proposing in the rates, I have proposed that there be an increase of up to £50, that social assistance, for instance, would not be less than £50 a week.  I picked that figure, not on an arbitrary basis but on the basis that it is necessary to move to that figure as a step towards full implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  In a budget submission my party made to the Minister for Finance, we called for a target date for meeting the goals set in the commission's report.  We urged that the figures proposed by the commission be met within a two-year period and that it would not be acceptable if the poor in our society remained so much under the breadline in 1992 when this country, we are told, will be open to all the vagaries of the open market, with its effects on the poorest.  It is significant that, according to the EC estimate, there are 44 million people on the poverty line and 16 million unemployed in the Community as a whole.  We contribute substantially to those figures.  Something like one-third of our population has been estimated to be on the poverty line and we have 250,000 people unemployed.  These are <Col N="635" /> just the official statistics.  We all know there are others who are not included in the unemployment figures because they are on jobsearch or training schemes or have simply emigrated.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the way young people and those not so young are dealt with by our social welfare system when they are living at home.  If a young person aged between 16 and 18 is living at home with parents, at least one of whom is working, there will be no benefit for that young person.  If that person or an older person is living at home with parents who are working, they are means tested to the point where in many cases the money they get is a mere pittance.  I have referred previously to the case of a 35-year old man living at home with elderly parents whose unemployment assistance consisted of £12 per week.  That cannot be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister continues to attempt to undermine the figures, demonstrating the levels of poverty in our society.  I am concerned that the dates for the payment of the increases being given are again deferred to the end of July.  I am also concerned that the amounts being allocated to those who are poor are quite unsatisfactory, while no indication has been given to when the targets set out by the Commission on Social Welfare will be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My first comment relates to the points made by Deputy De Rossa. Whatever about bringing payments forward to April, which I know would involve costs, I see no justification for paying the increases in one set of benefits on 20 July, increases in disability benefit and deserted wife's benefit from 27 July and increases for old age pensioners and widows from 28 July.  The reason it is necessary to have three different dates is beyond me.  The increases should all be effective from the same date.  If taxpayers are to get the benefit of tax changes in April &mdash; and we are moving in the direction of improvements in the tax system for workers &mdash; I should like to think that welfare recipients would also get their <Col N="636" /> benefits from April.  The welfare and tax years should coincide with each other. That is the most effective way of introducing any proposed changes either in social welfare or taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the increases to the long-term unemployed in particular.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, in certain situations those on long-term unemployment assistance will actually receive more than those on unemployment benefit.  This brings into question the whole concept of social insurance.  I know the option has been given to take the higher rate.  It begs the question as to whether social insurance is insurance in the strict sense or merely another form of tax.  I will deal with that at greater length when we come to the sections on PRSI.  I see no justification for paying two different rates to people who are unemployed, for always paying somebody who never had the chance of a job and, therefore, never had the possibility of paying PRSI, a lower rate than some who did have that opportunity.  It is to move away from that distinction between the two categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI in their report for the Combat Poverty Agency highlighted the dire poverty which exists.  They took three different sets of income against which to measure poverty.  The overwhelming cause of poverty is the huge level of unemployment.  The greatest level of poverty is being suffered by the families of the unemployed.  The most effective way to bring up the rates for families is not by increasing the recipients' rates but by, perhaps, leaving them static for the moment and trying to bring up the rate of benefit for the spouse. The spouse of an unemployed person or somebody on disability benefit receives about £28 per week.  I tabled Dáil Questions recently asking what it would cost to bring that figure up to, say, £42 per week, which would be a huge increase for a family.  It is the only way of ending the anomaly between single people and married people with families.  The cost would not be by any means prohibitive. For the unemployed it would be approximately £58 million in a full year, but since <Col N="637" /> the increases are not coming into effect until well into the year, the figure would be about half that.  This is less than the amount given in increases to the long-term unemployed and the other categories included.  It is the most effective way of helping families who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister is moving towards further rationalisation of the child dependant allowances.  The number of allowances has been reduced from 36 to 12, but there is still a long way to go.  My view is that we need two rates, one for younger children to the age of ten and a slightly higher rate for children over that age, whose requirements in terms of school uniforms and so on are obviously more expensive.  I see no reason for the Minister not moving further along this road in the next year.  He could have done it in this budget.  It would mean some loss for some families but overall it would simplify the social welfare code, make people aware of their exact entitlements and help them to avail of them.  Obviously we would like to move away from the system whereby welfare is calculated to a large extent on the number of children but that will not be possible.</P>
    <P>Many people make the point that income is not calculated on the number of children in a family, that the worker receives a salary for the job and is expected to live on that amount.  We would all like to think that eventually our welfare allowances will be so reasonable that it will not be necessary to take into account the number of children in a family, that a couple or a single person will be paid a certain rate.  However, our financial circumstances are such that we cannot in the short or medium-term move along that road.  The best we can do is to rationalise the number of payments in respect of children and, in particular, to pay a higher rate in respect of the older children whose needs and demands are greater than younger children.  Families on social welfare who have teenage children find it very difficult to cope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that the <Col N="638" /> amount of unemployment benefit paid in respect of a husband, a wife and three children was £124.30.  The point to make about that benefit, which includes PRSI, is that many of those who pay PRSI do not qualify for a number of reasons. Those who pay PRSI do not have any guarantee that they will receive a payment in addition to the flat rate benefit. It will depend on the level of earnings and the net take-home pay of the individual.</P>
      <P>Benefit under the PRSI system has been whittled down from 30 per cent of earnings to about 12 per cent and that represents a bad investment for any worker.  It would be better if it was integrated into the flat rate benefit.  If it is contemplated reducing that benefit further, we should give workers the option of investing the amount they pay in PRSI in savings certificates because they would get a better return when unemployed. In effect, PRSI amounts to additional taxation on the PAYE sector.  It is worth remembering that benefit under that system is not paid for the first five weeks with the result that a huge proportion of workers do not receive any benefit.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that there has been an increase of 3 per cent, 5 per cent and 11 per cent in benefits but that does not amount to very much.  It would represent a good increase if the percentages related to a figure of £20,000 but those percentage increases related to figures of £40 or £50 and do not amount to much. We must bear in mind that most of those who receive the increase have to pay more in rent and the usual increases in the cost of food.  One cannot claim that they are better off as a result of those increases.  I do not see how anybody can claim that a person in receipt of social welfare benefit will be a lot better off if he or she receives an increase of £1.20 or £1.40 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the increase in the benefit paid to the long-term unemployed but it is still far short for that recommended by the commission.  Had the recommendations of the commission been introduced on a phased basis over five years we would have made progress. Such a formula has been accepted in wage <Col N="639" /> agreements.  At the rate we are going I do not think we will reach the figure recommended by the commission. Inflation and other hidden costs are seldom taken into account with the result that we will always have people living below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy De Rossa about the system. Last year I tabled 50 amendments to the Social Welfare Bill but I discovered to my horror that they were ruled out of order because they involved a charge on the State.  That brought home to me the fact that we do not have any way to amend sections which are deemed to be financial sections.  Standing Orders should be changed to give us an opportunity to amend such sections.  We are forced into the position that while we may agree with certain aspects of a section we must vote against it in order to lodge a protest against the system.  Procedurally that is not correct but we do not have any option if we are to voice our objections on behalf of the under-privileged.  We will be opposing the section on the basis that the increases are below the recommendation of the commission.</P>
    <P>A huge proportion of those who emigrated &mdash; 32,000 last year &mdash; left because they did not see any future here.  They were disgusted with the system.  In my constituency I met young people who, having been means tested, were told that they were entitled to the huge sum of £15 or £10 per week.  In one case a young person was awarded 50p per week and he had to travel five miles to collect it. That demoralises our young people who have spent years at school and reached a high standard of education.  They are forced to sign on at employment exchanges because they cannot find employment.  If their mothers or fathers are employed they suffer in that they receive £10 unemployment benefit.  It is an insult to hand a young person £10 and expect him or her to get by for one week. There is no incentive for our young people to stay around to see if they can find employment.  The Minister should have another look at the system of means <Col N="640" /> testing.  That is a sore point with young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies O'Keeffe, Bell and De Rossa that the provision of jobs is the best approach. That is the Government's objective in their economic programme.  As Deputies will be aware, last year was the first year there was an increase in the number recorded at work and those who compile such statistics expect that there will be a further increase this year.  The Government are concentrating on the provision of jobs but in the meantime we have many people who depend on the payments we make through the social welfare system.  I accept what Deputy O'Keeffe has said about avoiding any disincentives to employment but that involves a greater debate and a look at the PRSI system as a whole.  For instance, employers are anxious to have their level of contribution reduced or abolished. Our rates of contribution are, generally, lower than those of our EC partners. In the one case where they are slightly higher, the employer has to pay on the total income.  That does not apply here. I would, of course, be interested in anything that will remove disincentives while not upsetting or reducing employee's benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and others mentioned that since we increased unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed it is now, as a basic rate, ahead of unemployment benefit.  This was a choice we had to make.  There was a certain amount of money available and we had to decide if we were going to bring up long-term unemployment assistance to £47.  Short-term unemployment benefit is higher than short-term unemployment assistance.  It is only when comparing short-term unemployment benefit with long-term unemployment assistance that the assistance is higher than the benefit, but even here there is a potential difference of £18.50 a week in pay related benefit which applies to unemployment benefit.  I recognise the point made by Deputy Bell that not everybody may get pay related benefit, but the average is <Col N="641" /> over £12 a week in any event.  That is a fair indicator of what happens with that scheme.  The commission suggested that that should be abolished and incorporated in the basic benefit to maintain the differential between benefit and assistance but these are all things which will have to be looked at further in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said the improvements generally were marginal and was concerned that I was attempting to undermine the figures of the ESRI.  I recognise the value of the ESRI figures but the survey done by the ESRI was in 1986 and beginning of 1987, so their figures are now fairly old.  That is not to take from the trends they showed because such trends went back over a number of years and indicated particular things which I will come back to in a moment.  What I want to point out is that the increases last year and this year were made since those figures were published and must be taken into account when talking about the extent of the poverty, the size of benefits and payments made.</P>
    <P>I was on a radio programme recently. I am sorry it was a recorded programme because the part I am going to refer to was cut out.  The gentleman questioning me asked me if there were thousands of families living on less than £50 a week. Let us get our facts straight.  There are no families getting less than £50 a week. With these increases the basic personal rate is £47 a week and after that there are other increases.  The people who were identified by the ESRI as the people in greatest need, the long-term unemployed with families, are the group who have received priority from the Government.</P>
    <P>In that connection a family with five children were on £107.90 a week pre-July 1988 and will be on £127 a week post-July 1989, an increase of £20.65 a week and they will have another £1.55 increase from child benefit on top of that.  This increase was aimed at helping larger families generally, particularly the larger families of the unemployed.  It is in that context that I want to talk about the ESRI figures.  These increases have been given since those ESRI figures were garnered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> Let us take a look at some of the other figures.  A special scheme was brought in for widowers.  A widower with five children will get an increase to £40.30 per week, and allowing for inflation, the real increase there is £35.90.  A married couple with five children on long-term unemployment assistance will get an increase of £19.10 which in real terms, allowing for inflation, is an increase of £12.70 per week.  I mention those figures to emphasise the fact that the increases in that period are substantial and contribute substantially to tackling the problems in our society today.  We have greatly improved benefits especially for the people who were identified as in most need by the ESRI report.</P>
    <P>Obviously the rural unemployed have done a little bit better in that period because we have brought them level with the unemployed rate generally.  Given the economic difficulties at the moment, especially last year and this year, that is a very substantial step in the direction suggested by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments have been ruled out of order because they have financial implications.  There is no opportunity to discuss that aspect now, but every Deputy had an opportunity to discuss and vote on the financial note in the budget debate.  That is really where the extra finance comes in, and that is where the opportunity to debate those extra financial provisions arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney talked about the different rates.  The main reason for the two different rates is that one is paying a back week and the other is paying from that week forward.  In regard to the question of bringing the date forward to April, as Deputies know, the previous Coalition Government, just before they left office, proposed a November date.  At very considerable cost, the incoming Government brought that date back to July and have maintained it.  Deputy De Rossa proposed and Deputy Harney proposed bringing the date back.  The cost of paying the increases from April would be £37 million in 1989.  I think Deputies will recognise that we are trying to achieve <Col N="643" /> particular priorities in the payments system, bringing certain people up to the same level as other people or whatever, especially when those people are at low levels.  That is what we gave priority to and that is where the money has been spent this year.  Obviously the cost of any of those steps we have taken would be much greater for the whole year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney talked about the need to rationalise the rates further.  There has been a very substantial rationalisation in the rates and that rationalisation always has been upwards and at a cost.  If I remember rightly, the commission suggested that we rationalise some of the rates downwards and get to a minimum of £10 per child per week; we have now done that.  I would like people to at least recognise that that has been achieved, without reducing the rates for any other children.  It has been achieved by rationalising the rate upwards.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, some of the rates such as those for widows and deserted wives in particular are higher rates.  We have allowed those higher rates to remain at their present level and we have also applied the 3 per cent increase to those rates but to bring all the rates up to that level would be particularly expensive and would, needless to say, bring in a lot of other implications.  I think we have gone a good way in improving the position in regard to rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Some comments were made about the PRSI system generally and perhaps they are more appropriate to the later sections of the Bill.  In relation to this section which deals with insurance contributions, young people are included in unemployment benefit if they are over 16 years of age.  It is with the unemployment assistance &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Bell is aware of that &mdash; that the problems arise.  Once these people get work, if they are over 16 years of age they are included in the system.</P>
    <P>These were some of the main comments made by Deputies on this section. I understand from what has been said that The Workers' Party and the Labour Party plan to vote against the section.  I <Col N="644" /> regret this because I think a great deal has been achieved this year and that that will be recognised on the ground.  When the increases come into being they will be recognised as substantial increases.  I know from my own communications and contacts, from meeting people fairly regularly, that it is recognised that there has been a substantial increase, especially for those on lower payments.  There is widespread welcome within the community for the increases that are being given in this Bill.  Naturally, people will be very anxious to see this Bill passed and to see the increases come into law. Consequently, I welcome the support of those Deputies in the House who support these increases and who recognise that they are needed.  They are substantial and will do a great deal to redress the situation that exists at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section dealing with new rates of social assistance payments. We discussed the increases in general terms on the first sections.  What I had to say on section 3 applies with great force to this section because those in receipt of social payments, especially those on long-term unemployment assistance, generally are the people in receipt of the lowest level of payments.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides for increases in the rates of social assistance.  This subsection, in conjunction with section 11, also provides for the abolition of the lower rate of unemployment assistance. Therefore, in many ways this is an historic section in that it provides for the removal of the lower rural rate of unemployment assistance, a differential that has existed since 1934.  We are now removing that differential so that, henceforth those in receipt of unemployment assistance, whether in city areas or areas hitherto defined as rural&mdash;areas such as parts of Tallaght, parts of Cork, parts of Blanchardstown and some major towns&mdash;will now receive the same rate of unemployment assistance as is applicable to the remainder of the country.  Henceforth there will be one long-term rate and one short-term rate of unemployment assistance; there will be no differential obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases provided for in subsection (1) are 12 per cent in the case of personal rates of long-term unemployment assistance and single woman's allowance, over 7.5 per cent in the personal rates of short-term unemployment assistance; increases ranging from 3 per cent to 6 per cent in the adult dependant rates payable to recipients of unemployment assistance and increases ranging from 3 per cent to 25 per cent to child dependants in the case of recipients of unemployment assistance.  This is in part what I referred to when I spoke about averaging up the child dependant rates, the increases in some instances being quite substantial.  For example, in the case of personal rates of supplementary <Col N="646" /> welfare allowance, there is an increase of over 11 per cent, a 6 per cent increase in the adult dependant rate of supplementary welfare allowance and increases ranging between 5 per cent and 25 per cent for child dependants payable to recipients of supplementary welfare allowance.  Therefore, it will be seen there are major increases for those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance. As we all know, it is those on long-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance who were the two groups most clearly identified in the studies indicating those at greatest risk in our society.</P>
    <P>The weekly personal adult and child dependant rates of all other social assistance beneficiaries are being increased by the standard 3 per cent.  The new rates of payments are set out in Schedule B of the Bill.  These increases are in line with the Government commitment to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and, within available resources, to provide greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.  For example, the basic personal rate of unemployment assistance goes up from £42 to £47 per week, an increase of £5, whereas the payment to a person with an adult dependant goes up by £6 to £76 per week.</P>
    <P>A married couple on long-term urban unemployment assistance with five children will have their payment increased to £127 per week.  Henceforth rural recipients of long-term unemployment assist-ance&mdash;that is a married couple with five children&mdash;will receive a similar amount, £127 per week.</P>
    <P>The single woman's allowance is being increased by £5 per week, from £42 to £47 per week and the non-contributory widow's and deserted wife's basic allowance is being increased to £49 per week. I have already mentioned the streamlining of the child dependant allowances. The different rates of child and adult dependant allowance increases payable under the various social assistance schemes are being further streamlined.  The number of different rates of child dependant allowance is being reduced from ten <Col N="647" /> to five.  In addition, a minimum child dependant allowance of £10 per week is being introduced.  This, of course, has a very significant effect in the case of unemployment assistance because the rates previously were considerably lower. There are currently four different rates of adult dependant increases payable under the unemployment assistance scheme. This will be reduced to two rates from July.  In the past two years the number of different rates of adult dependant increases under the various social insurance and assistance schemes will have been reduced from ten to six.</P>
    <P>In this section I am providing also three new social assistance schemes: the pre-retirement allowance scheme which will be payable at the same rate as long-term unemployment assistance; the widower's non-contributory pension and deserted husband's allowance schemes, both of which will be payable at the same rate as the widow's non-contributory pension. The maximum personal and adult and child dependant rates for these payments are also specified in Schedule B of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The numbers who will benefit under this section are estimated at 350,000 recipients weekly with 330,000 dependants, a total of 680,000 people.  If we take this figure together with those who will benefit from insurance benefit increases, a total of 735,090 recipients with 609,000 dependants will gain, an estimated total of 1.3 million will benefit under these two sections of the Bill.  These are very important improvements.  This is the second year in which such improvements have been made in this area, not only have the basic rates been increased but we have gone further and introduced three new social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the widower's non-contributory pension and the deserted husband's allowance scheme, this is the first time that such schemes have existed and we are bringing into being these two new schemes together with the pre-retirement allowance scheme.  Some Deputies will wonder about the pre-retirement allowance <Col N="648" /> scheme because we had previously made arrangements whereby we could make special provisions for people over the age of 60 years, in particular.  The difference is that we are providing a scheme which will be a much more satisfactory and comprehensive arrangement for those who will come into the pre-retirement category.  I commend the section to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not oppose the section but there are a number of points that I would draw to the Minister's attention. I ask the Minister to bear these points in mind in any future reform of the social welfare system.  They relate to assistance payments.  First, a more determined effort will have to be made to reach the poorest of the poor, in particular, those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances and where the personal rate or the child and spouse dependant rate is applicable.</P>
      <P>The most appalling statistic in the Combat Poverty ESRI report was the fact that a significant number of people were not even in receipt of the lowest payment available to them.  I urge the Minister, from the point of view of reaching out to the poorest of the poor, that the first thing that must be done is to ensure that there is full uptake by those who are in greatest need and every effort be made to reach those who for one reason or another are not receiving their just basic minimum entitlements.  As far as resources permit, priority should be given to increasing those basic minimum payments.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Harney that there should be a concentration on the payment to the spouse, which is very low indeed.  I urge that those at the bottom of the pile should receive priority in any future changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I wish to refer to the benefit and privilege provision in the assessment of unemployment assistance.  This arises when somebody is living in a family home, whether with their parents, cousin or brother&mdash;and this was discussed in <Col N="649" /> detail by the Commission on Social Welfare. They concluded that for those over the age of 25 years it was altogether wrong that there should be an assessment against their unemployment assistance by reason of the fact that they were living at home.  As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, the procedure is that the very low level of unemployment assistance can be reduced further, and in some cases entirely eliminated because of the fact the applicant is residing at home.  That might make some sense in the case of a young person but it certainly makes no sense whatever for an adult.  I have seen cases where lonely bachelors of 47 to 50 years of age are left with either a reduced rate of unemployment assistance or nothing at all merely because they are living with a relative.  I urge the Minister very strongly to consider eliminating that provision in so far as it relates to those over the age of 25 years.</P>
    <P>Third, I wish to refer to the assessment of means for old age and blind pensions.  One of the greatest anomalies is that pensioners are being assessed with means they do not have.  This is altogether unfair.  It arises because of the small return they get on their bank deposits.  Despite the fact that they might be getting 3 per cent net on their few pounds funeral money in the bank, they are being assessed as in receipt of interest at the artificial rate of 10 per cent.  That is altogether wrong and is very poor treatment of the senior citizens of this State. I urge that a change be made and that the assessment of means be made of the person's actual income.  Surely it is not an outrageous proposal that people are entitled to be assessed on what they are getting and not be assessed at a notional artificial rate?</P>
    <P>Fourth, I wish to refer to supplementary welfare.  I think it was Deputy De Rossa who referred to poverty among the low paid.  I have an amendment down which provides for access by the low paid to supplementary welfare, particularly for rent supplements but I have been told by the Ceann Comhairle that as this would involve a charge on the Exchequer the amendment falls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> I take the opportunity on this section to urge the Minister to give serious consideration to allowing access to the social welfare system to those on low pay.  If we are to provide a bridge for those on unemployment assistance and jobs, the kind of disincentives that exist have to be broken down and we have to build up the plans so that people can be encouraged to take up jobs.  Those jobs may not in all cases be well paid but we should certainly remove any obstacles that exist to having them taken up, so that at least people would have the dignity of work as opposed to spending years on the dole.</P>
    <P>A major disincentive is the fact that those who are in receipt of rent supplement while on the dole cannot get the same rent supplement when they take up low paid employment, even though the net amount they will receive from that employment will be no greater than they will get on the dole.  If we were actively trying to stop people coming off the dole, that is surely a way of doing it.  My approach to this Bill is that one of the main things that needs to be done is to isolate in the social welfare system any disincentive to employment.  The one I have outlined is a particular disincentive and I would urge the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>This section provides for increases.  I do not oppose the increases.  I wish we were in a position to vote more substantial increases.  I would seriously ask the Minister to consider the four points I made&mdash;reaching to the poorest of the poor, removing the ridiculous anomaly which is assessing pensioners with more income than they are actually getting, removing the anomaly for people over the age of 25 where their assistance is reduced because of living with a relative and, lastly, providing access to the social welfare system for those on low pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the points I made in relation to the last section apply here, for instance, the fact that the rate of payment for the spouse of those on unemployment assistance, or on assistance generally is still so low that it places families in very difficult circumstances <Col N="651" /> and puts many of them into poverty.  The same applies in relation to the number of payments for children.  As I said earlier, we need just two rates.  I accept what the Minister said, that that would mean bringing the higher rates down somewhat, but if we are to simplify the system we have to move in that direction as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>This is as good a time as any to welcome the decision of the Minister to end the distinction between the urban and rural rates of unemployment assistance.  This distinction dated back to 1934.  It was ludicrous in this day and age because it meant that in many parts of the country people living in the same circumstances, in the same estates, were getting different rates of payment.  It was time that distinction was ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the means testing of persons for old age non-contributory pensions.  I agree with what he said.  The figure that is taken in relation to the remuneration on savings and bank accounts is wrong and is very unfair to elderly people.  As a result many elderly people keep their savings under the mattress and we know the kinds of problems that leads to in terms of crime.  They are afraid that if they place their small savings in a bank or building society they will lose a lot of their entitlements.  Many elderly people save small amounts of money, perhaps £1,000 or £1,500 to pay for their funerals.  I first came across this when dealing with elderly constituents after I had been elected as a representative to the Seanad.  I was surprised at the need they had and the pride they had in providing for their funerals.  I thought it was very sad that that was the case but I say that even the poorest of the poor of elderly people will try to put some money aside to pay for a decent burial.  Given that that is the case we need to be a bit more flexible when it comes to the non-contributory old age pension, which is very low anyway.  Everybody in the House would agree that generally speaking the elderly do not defraud or abuse the social welfare code.  By and large they are the group who are the least likely to <Col N="652" /> try to get something to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment in relation to means testing and it will probably come up later.  The amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it would be a charge on the Exchequer.  My purpose in putting it down was to save money and to end the plethora of schemes in existence and redeploy some of the people involved in means testing to other sections of the welfare system.  If we were to introduce a single means test on the basis of self assessment it would save a huge sum and not cost any money.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  I was very disappointed that my amendment was ruled out or order for what I would regard as a phoney and wrong reason.</P>
    <P>We need to move along the lines I suggest, particularly when it comes to establishing a person's financial means for the purpose of paying social assistance. When we realise that almost 250,000 means tests are carried out each year and that 235 officers of the Department are involved in this task, we can see that it is in all our interests and particularly in the interests of the Department of Social Welfare to simplify the process of establishing a claimant's means, as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in this section to increases in the supplementary welfare allowance.  I support the operation of a supplementary welfare system as it is important to have a fire brigade system that deals on an emergency basis with those who are in great need and that essentially is what the supplementary welfare system does.  However, the system, because it is arbitrary and left very much to the discretion of the local community welfare officers, is implemented on a different basis in different parts of the country.  In the Dublin area some community welfare officers will not give any payment towards mortgage repayments and so on. Yet in other parts of the country&mdash;which is the correct approach&mdash;the officer decides to examine the person's actual circumstances and they do not automatically rule out certain categories of <Col N="653" /> persons simply because of the way they might receive particular weekly payments. That is very important.  I know that guidelines are issued by the Department to the community welfare officers. It is important that these guidelines are such that there is not such an arbitrary and different system in place in different health board areas.  Although the system is operated by the Department of Health through the health boards, since these are essentially welfare measures, it is important that the Minister for Social Welfare would ensure that the scheme is not so arbitrary as to effectively be meaningless in the Dublin area in particular and in the Eastern Health Board area in general.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    <P>In the section the increases are to come into effect on different dates.  I take the point the Minister made in relation to the comments I made on section 3, but I do not accept that they are valid.  All the increases, no matter which category of welfare is involved should come into effect on the same day.  I know there may be bureaucratic difficulties so far as that is concerned because of the complicated nature of our system, the issuing of books and so on and the different dates that apply to the payment of welfare allowances but it is only fair and just that whatever date is selected apply to all payments.  I see no justification whatever, although it may lead to simplification and to less bureaucracy&mdash;for having a whole collection of different dates for the application of the increases.</P>
    <P>In relation to the allowances paid to deserted wives and prisoners' wives and people in that category there seems to be a very long delay in the processing of these applications.  Last week, I paid tribute to the great improvements which have been made in the Department of Social Welfare in recent years.  Those comments were well deserved but I believe that in relation to these applications in particular the delays are unnecessarily long.  I believe this has something to do with the establishment of means and so on and a person's financial <Col N="654" /> circumstances.  That is why a simplification of the means test procedure would go a long way towards expediting these applications.  They deserve attention because a long time seems to elapse after an application has been made until a decision is subsequently arrived at.  I am aware that in some cases a delay must occur because of the requirements of the scheme concerned but even where that delay exists it is still a long time after the passing of the date in question before a decision is made.  We could go a long way to improving that position with a little more efficiency and a simplification of the method of establishing means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two points on the section.  The Minister, in introducing this section, was at pains, and from his point of view, rightly so, to tell us about the advances that it makes in terms of increased assistance to recipients. These increases ring very hollow indeed for a certain number of people who find themselves excluded from any benefit by virtue of the interpretation by this section of the assessment of means. By way of background, I should say that I have recently had a case of a person in north Longford living on a smallholding in the ownership of his brother.  That person applied for unemployment assistance&mdash;he has no other income as the holding is not big enough to provide income for himself and his brother &mdash; but he has effectively been ruled out on the grounds of means.  The Department has applied section 146 (1) (e) of the 1981 Act and they say that it provides that the means of a person has to take account of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him; that is fair enough.  In practice, the Department take the benefit of the board and lodgings the applicant has, in this case as a guest in his brother's house.  Legally, that is all he is.  If the Department assessed board and lodgings strictly speaking this person would be entitled to some, if not all, of the entire weekly benefit.  In effect, the Department assessed against him, not just a figure for board and lodging, but a notional figure attributing to him a distributive share in <Col N="655" /> the holding.  In this case the parents are on the holding plus two sons.  In such a case the Department take the entire yearly value of the holding, divide it by four and assess a quarter of the yearly value against the applicant.  A quarter of the yearly value far exceeds what could be a reasonable figure for board and lodgings.</P>
      <P>In applying that method of assessment the Department effectively exclude the person I am speaking of from unemployment assistance.  No doubt he would hear with a rather grim humour and in an ironic sense, the Minister's self praise in telling us about the advance in benefits under this Bill.  The Department of Social Welfare are applying a method of assessment which is certainly inappropriate and is probably illegal.  I have had correspondence with the Department and they say this is the way it is done and that is that.  I would have no objection to a notional figure for board and lodging being assessed against an applicant because it is a yearly benefit under the Act but I strongly object to board and lodgings being translated into a notional distributive share in the holding in question because the applicant has absolutely no legal entitlement, and no moral entitlement, to reside on the holding or to receive any part of its rent or profits. As a result of the interpretation of &ldquo;the yearly value of any benefit or privilege&rdquo; by the Department the person in question is deprived of any assistance whatsoever and must now live entirely on the charity of his brother.  The alternative is to emigrate because there is no employment in the locality except, perhaps, an odd day here or there but even that is doubtful.  I am quite certain that the Minister, whose party had billboards plastered only a couple of years ago with notices indicating their hostility to emigration, would not like to see this legislation interpreted in such a way as to force this unfortunate person to go abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in the position of deciding whether we go to the Ombudsman, who may very well say this is not a question of maladministration, it is a question of <Col N="656" /> legal interpretation of the section, or we have to take law.  That would be an intimidating process for a young man with no means to face into a legal battle with the Department of Social Welfare on the correct interpretation and application of section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  I would say to the Minister that a serious injustice is being done to applicants against whom the section is being interpreted in the way I have outlined.  By all means assess a figure for board and lodgings but do not equate a figure for board and lodgings with a notional distributive share or entitlement in the holding in question.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the rates of increase.  I note from the explanatory memorandum that, for example, persons aged 80 years or more and married couples will get an extra £1.60 per week.  I have heard it said in County Meath that that increase of £1.60 has been immediately swallowed up by a rent increase of £2 per week which is being imposed on many of these people living in county council houses or cottages.  In effect, one arm of the State, the Department of the Environment, are imposing a penury by increasing the rents by £2 per week and undoing what the other arm, through the Minister for Social Welfare, is doing by granting an increase.  There is not much point in giving an increase of £1.60 per week if there is going to be a net loss as a result of the activities of another Government Department.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at anomalies such as that and not come in here and tell us that there is an increase of £1.60 per week when the result for the unfortunate recipients is a loss of 40p per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the points raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  He suggested that we should try to reach the poorest people in any steps we are taking. We have given priority to the lowest paid generally.  That has been the policy of these increases.  The Deputy is concerned about non-take up where this occurs.  I would certainly be concerned about that also.  The actual surveyed amounts of non-take up are fairly small except for <Col N="657" /> some schemes such as the family income supplement scheme which is a special case and which we have discussed separately. I accept the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe that we must give priority to the lowest paid.  If there are some among the lowest paid who are not taking up the entitlements which are available for them, we must give our attention to that and ensure that they are made aware of the benefits that are available for them.  Deputy O'Keeffe also talked about concentrating on the spouse in that context.  This point was made also by Deputy Harney.  It relates to bringing up the payment in respect of a dependent spouse as one of the principal ways of dealing with poverty.  There is a general figure of a factor of 0.5 which is often used by EC countries in relation to a dependent spouse.  The commission decided on a factor of 0.6 in their study and used that factor.  If we look at the position at present for those on long-term unemployment assistance, we are increasing this payment to £47 per week and the dependent spouse will receive £29 per week, which is just a little over the factor of 0.6.  Therefore, in the increase which has been given to the dependent spouse, we have more than maintained the factor the commission proposed.  This matter will have to be looked at further in future budgets but it is noteworthy that we have maintained that ratio.  In fact, we have more than maintained the ratio, which would represent a sum of £28.20, by giving £29 to the dependent spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to rationalising the means test, and I think Deputy Harney also raised this matter. We are looking at and reviewing this means test at present.  I recognise the questions which were raised and the difficulties which can arise but no matter what arrangements one makes, once there is a means test there will always be difficulties in assessing means.  There will be difficulties for everybody involved, including the staff who will have difficulties in establishing what the means are.  I am anxious to make progress on this issue.  I think Deputy Harney referred to <Col N="658" /> self-assessment in one of her amendments and as the Deputy knows we have introduced a degree of self-assessment already in relation to unemployment assistance payments.  I am currently reviewing the possibility of self-assessment in other areas.  Widows pensions and old age pensions are two areas where this might be possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also raised the question of benefit and privilege.  This question was raised by a number of other Deputies, including Deputy Cooney.  It is a fairly large question and I will deal with it in a moment.  With regard to Deputy Harney's point on the possibility of having a single means test, we are trying to rationalise the means test so far as we can.  We have made some progress in this regard and we hope to go further on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also referred to the question of supplementary welfare allowance and the fact that this can vary from health board to health board.  We are carrying out an examination of supplementary welfare allowance and this is a major study.  As Deputies know, we have done a number of things to rationalise some of the payments within that area.  I would refer in particular to the free fuel scheme and the footwear scheme.  We are working further on this issue.  I accept that there are variations. One of the difficulties is that if you give discretion there will almost inevitably be some variations but needless to say we want to try to keep those within reasonable limits so that they do not vary too much from one place to another.  This is all part of the examination of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is going on at present.  Deputy Harney also talked about bringing all these payments in on the same day.  They are all coming in in the same week.  I know one is a back week and the other is a forward week but basically the payments are being made for the same week. With regard to delays in the payment of, for example, deserted wife's allowance there are, of course, problems in an area like that but I will certainly look into <Col N="659" /> the question which was raised by Deputy Harney in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney spoke about means generally.  The question of means came up several times and I should like to point out that in general applicants for social assistance payments who have capital are assessed with a notional income from that capital.  Under existing arrangements, in relation to capital alone a married couple could have joint capital of over £53,000 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  Under the notional income the percentage rates used vary but the maximum 10 per cent rate of assessment is applied under the old age pension and unemployment assistance schemes to amounts of capital over a certain level. The assessment system is not related to interest actually earned but is based on the determination of a capital value. Under the old age pension scheme a person can, of course, have means and as Deputies will be aware it is £6 per week for a single person or £12 for a couple.  The question of any changes in the present means testing arrangements would, of course, be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context because it would have financial implications.</P>
    <P>Under the system which is in operation at present a man with a wife and two children with savings of £43,900, can receive the minimum rate of unemployment assistance, a widow on a non-contributory pension with savings of £51,000 can receive the minimum rate and the maximum rate if she has savings of £5,400.  The same applies to the deserted wife's allowance where a deserted wife can have £5,400 in savings. Some Deputies, and I think Deputy Harney in particular, spoke about the need to set aside some money for funeral expenses.  A certain sum is allowable in relation to this.  With regard to the other areas, such as the old age non-contributory pension, a married couple can have almost £6,000, £5,975, and still receive the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension and can have up to £51,700 and still receive the minimum rate of old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> Significant amount of capital can be held by people as capital.  A notional value is assessed on this capital and people can still get the minimum rate even if they have substantial amounts of capital.  This applies also to supplementary welfare allowance where a man with a wife and two children can have up to £40,000 and still receive the minimum rate of supplementary welfare allowance.  There is considerable scope in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the calculation of the value of benefit and privilege there are no statutory criteria in relation to this but over the years two distinct formula have evolved which are used in this assessment: the first is that the applicant is residing in a household supported by a farm income and the second is that the applicant is residing with a wage earning family.  A combination of both methods is used if there are both wages and a farm income in the household.  The method of assessing benefit and privilege for both farming and non-farming families has been set out on several occasions.  This method is under review at present and I can assure Deputies they will hear more about this in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost involved, the abolition of benefit and privilege would cost, at a minimum, £14 million in a full year.  That is fairly substantial.  When it comes to allocating resources, the decision for any Minister for Social Welfare is whether to put that money into something else or to apply it in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How much would it cost to confine it just to those over 25 years of age, as in the proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly somewhere in the region of £7 million to £10 million, but that is only part of the cost, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of rents was raised by Deputy Cooney.  I shall certainly look into that.  An increase in rent is decided on by the appropriate local authorities. Judging by some figures I saw recently, the increases were not anything like the order suggested by the Deputy.  Let us take some examples.  I give the actual increases for the Dublin area.  If the <Col N="661" /> increase on an old age pension was £3, the rent increase came to £1.10.  In the case of an old age non-contributory pension in the Dublin area where the increase is £1.40, the rent increase is 20p.  For a married couple on old age non-contributory pension, if the social welfare increase is £2.20 the rent increase is 50p. Those ratios would not appear to apply in the case of Dublin Corporation rent increases or a number of other cases which I saw recently.</P>
    <P>In the area of long-term unemployment assistance, there is an increase on the personal rate of £5 per week and the rent increase is 50p.  For a married couple on long-term unemployment assistance who have four children, if the social welfare payment is £9.50 the rent increase taken by the local authority is £1.30.  The Deputy mentioned an increase of £1.60 leading to a loss of £2. I would be very surprised at that, but I will look into the individual case.  The cases that have come to my attention would indicate a very much lower rent increase by the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two further points on this section, both in relation to the assessment of means.  In the light of the Minister's reply is there not obviously a clear discrimination as between farm and non-farm families? This arises in the context of how much is assessed against an applicant for unemployment assistance for the privilege of living on the charity of a relative.  It is now clear from the Minister's reply that although there is no statutory basis for it, somebody living with a relative who happens to own a farm can have a much greater assessment made against him or her than if that same relative were living on a salary in a town or city.  That is most unfair and is a major discrimination against the rural community.  To the applicant himself or herself, it makes no difference.  That person is not entitled to nor does he or she receive, any portion either of the salary in the case of the relative living in the town or city or of the farm income in the rural household. It is quite outrageous that merely because such people are living in a farmhouse <Col N="662" /> they may find a notional figure put against them that, effectively, will eliminate their entitlement to unemployment assistance, even though they have not a bob to their names.  The Minister should, as the Commission on Social Welfare did, go along the road of eliminating that discrimination against rural families.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to raise is the question of means testing.  The Minister would be doing much for the Department of Social Welfare if he were prepared to accept the principle of a single means test at this stage.  That would open up many possibilities from the point of view of graduated entitlement to various benefits but without that single means test that kind of approach cannot be adopted.  At the moment, we have a plethora of different means tests within social welfare and outside it.  We have many other means tests.  I am thinking about the health board means tests, of which there is a number.  These apply to medical card applicants, disabled person's maintenance and others.  In other areas there are further means tests.  Local authorities have a means test from the point of view of differential rents.  The Department of Education, through the local authorities, have a means test for educational grants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney and I raised this matter and we are <i>ad idem</i> on what the end result should be, although our approach to it is somewhat different.  Essentially, it is to remove the plethora of means tests within social welfare and other areas and to establish a single certificate of eligibility.  Based on that, a person would be entitled to the appropriate entitlements, from the social welfare services or otherwise.  There would be huge savings in administration but, more important, because one would be able to use such an approach to bridge the gap for those on the dole queue to paid employment, the single means test could be the greatest contribution from the Minister for Social Welfare to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, there are people in receipt of social welfare benefits who cannot take a job because of the loss of non-cash benefits.  They may lose their <Col N="663" /> medical cards and, in addition, their council rents may go up and other benefits to which they are entitled while on the dole are lost.  Surely the Minister must recognise that to be a major barrier to employment.  If we want to use every effort to create jobs, the Minister must ensure that his contribution is made.  I believe very strongly that this is perhaps the greatest single contribution that could come from him.  I urge him to give very sympathetic consideration to the establishment of a system which will involve a single means test and, following that, graduated entitlement can be given, irrespective or whether a person is on the dole or in employment.  We will then not have the ludicrous situation where someone on a low paid job will lose out as a consequence.  We will have established a system where his entitlement can remain even if his salary increases to the limit of the graduation.</P>

      <P>I want to mention another category, children who are assessed on the basis of their parents' means. The Department of Social Welfare apparently consider those aged between 18 and 25 to be still in the care of their parents and to assess them on the means of the parents.  At a time when we have introduced legislation to reduce the age of majority from 21 to 18 years of age and when for all legal purposes a person is no longer a minor after reaching the age of 18, it is unreasonable that the Department of Social Welfare should assess an applicant in that age group on the basis of the parents' income.  For the purposes of claiming social welfare and unemployment assistance generally, a young person pretends to move away from home&mdash;and in many cases leaves the home&mdash;to claim these allowances. Deputy Bell referred to this on Second Stage and said we are encouraging young people to leave home and to move into inadequate living conditions for the purpose of getting an income they can call their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unreasonable to expect parents to keep their children until they are 25 years <Col N="664" /> of age when there is so much unemployment. It is also unfair and unjust to treat people of 18 to 25 years as dependent on their parents and to treat them as children.  It is not possible for many of them to get employment and, therefore, they cannot qualify on their own pay-related social insurance.  I remember raising this matter at Question Time and the Minister said it would cost about £14 million per annum to assess young people in this category on an independent basis. Regardless of that, there is no justification for the Department of Social Welfare to arbitrarily say that a person under the age of 25 will be assessed on the basis of his parents' means.</P>
    <P>The child dependant allowance should also be paid to children in full-time education and depending on their parents. The present position is the worst of all worlds when people are not in education or do not have a job where they can qualify for PRSI.  As Deputy Bell rightly said, it has forced many young people to leave home and to live in totally unsuitable conditions.  Constituents of mine in this category tell of me of people who invent addresses and I am sure that happens as it is probably impossible to prove where somebody lives.  I should like the Minister to tell the House how much a proposal of this kind would cost and to give a commitment in this regard.  It is not possible for us to table an amendment because it would be a charge on the Exchequer.  However, this reform is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the comments made by other Members including those of the Minister's party because they receive the same complaints as I do.  This is one of the biggest bones of contention among young people and it is encouraging them to emigrate.  They feel very sore at the community, Dáil Éireann and the whole administration. As I said before, the system forces people out of their own homes to take up accommodation in broken down flats at an exorbitant rent.  Five or six people can be living in one house which is rented to them by a speculator.  The young people <Col N="665" /> are removed from parental control.  It is degrading to have to live in these conditions and I cannot understand why they should have to go to an employment exchange to receive £10 or £15 although I believe the average is £12.  They certainly cannot afford to give anything up at home from a sum of £12 per week.  That amount would hardly take an 18 year old to a disco and it is one the greatest injustices perpetrated on young boys and girls.</P>
      <P>These young people have spent years in school and have achieved a high academic level within the educational system.  Because we cannot provide them with full-time employment they leave home and go into a miserable flat or caravan in order to receive full unemployment assistance.  We must find a way to overcome the problem because a father cannot possibly afford to clothe, feed and provide the basic requirements for a young person and provide money for entertainment.  An 18 year old cannot watch television for seven nights per week.  Indeed, a 20 year old may be considering getting married and we are leaving them with no hope.  In some cases it leads them into bad company with the resultant problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased, the Minister recognised the anomaly in the urban-rural rates.  He said they had been in operation since 1934 and that many Governments have come and gone since then.  Perhaps it made some sense in 1934 when people living in the country could live more cheaply but that is no longer the case. Even people who have cattle no longer churn as it is cheaper to buy butter and other essentials in the supermarket.  They do not even grow vegetables at present. Outside the urban area of Dundalk and the borough boundary of Drogheda there are two separate rates so I see the problems at first-hand in my own constituency. I have received correspondence and calls from all over the country in relation to this anomaly which I am glad has now been eliminated. There are many more anomalies but at <Col N="666" /> least this is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of benefit in privilege and considered that the system discriminated against those living in rural areas, for example, on farms.  It is widely recognised that there is a difficulty in assessing farm income, as against assessing income which is fairly well known, set out and established.  There is a difference but this is due to the fact that the running of a farm is a business and consequently it is necessary to assess the income which arises from the activities on the farm. Therefore it would be difficult to get away from having two different kinds of assessment. I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention to discriminate in any way against those living in rural areas.  Very often the opposite is the case.  As the Deputy is aware from his own experience, as a result of it being so difficult to assess farm income a person could receive benefits which a person in an urban area whose income is very well known would not receive.  I think this is a problem that will be with us for all time to come because of the difficulty of assessing farm or other business income.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to the means testing system.  The Department of Social Welfare are moving towards a single means testing system.  There may be cases where allowances are paid which would not apply for other people but these could be assessed in a single means test.  The Department of Social Welfare are moving in that direction.  I cannot speak for other Departments but I can say in relation to differential rents that as far as local authorities are concerned they very frequently use the findings of our assessments.  For example, if we carry out an assessment in respect of an application for unemployment assistance they will accept the findings and use them for their own purposes.  The same applies in respect of medical cards.  There is co-operation and I think this is what the Deputy is referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also raised the question of those in receipt of unemployment <Col N="667" /> assistance not taking up jobs because they may lose a medical card or a fuel allowance as a result.  This is something which militates against me as Minister for Social Welfare in getting increases for people in receipt of unemployment benefits.  It is an argument used against me all of the time.  The argument is that the more we give the more difficult it is to get people to go back to work.  Nevertheless I would argue and I know the Deputy would argue that certain basic levels should be provided.  We would aim to meet those basic living requirements.  That is our approach and philosophy and it is one which I think is supported on all sides of the House, but it does leave us with some difficulties.  Obviously, there should be an adequate wage for a job and a balance needs to be struck in this area.</P>
    <P>We have tried to address this problem in two ways.  First of all, we made available a family income supplement which will be reviewed very shortly.  This supplement is paid to people on low incomes at work so as to enable them get over this problem which has been recognised by Deputy O'Keeffe.  Secondly, a new scheme was introduced in this year's budget, the child-related tax exemption scheme, which will result in a benefit for a family with five children of £13 per week.  The aim is to make it worthwhile to be at work.  A difficulty arises as regards the number of children.  We are giving a minimum of £10 per child to those in receipt of unemployment payments but of course this will not be given to someone at work.  We have taken certain steps to tackle this problem, such as making available the family income supplement to those in receipt of low wages and introducing the child-related tax exemption scheme in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also referred to the abolition of benefit and privilege and the figure she quoted, £14 million, is the right one at the minimum.  That would be the sum required to abolish benefit and privilege in respect of those on reduced rates at present.  Others would be brought in, not included at present, and this would <Col N="668" /> result in an additional cost above the figure of £14 million.  It would be very difficult to calculate the figure but going on the number of people on reduced rates at present the figure would be just over £14 million.  If we were to implement this we would have to make some kind of estimate as to how many extra people would benefit as a result.  A substantial additional cost would be involved.  I referred to this earlier when Deputy Harney was not present in the House&mdash; perhaps she was having a well earned cup of tea, which we could all use.</P>

      <P>We had a discussion on this point at that stage.  The question of assessing 18 to 25 year olds on their parents' income was also raised.  In response let my say that the household income applies regardless of whether a person is over or under 25 years of age or living on a farm.  In the case of a farming household, the household would be in receipt of the farm income.  Therefore they are assessed on the household income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell also referred to the question of benefit and privilege and talked about people being in receipt of £12 per week as a result.  Funnily enough, the commission recommended a minimum of £10 per week.  At the end of the day I suppose it is a question of more money.  I made the point earlier in reply to Deputy Harney that any Minister for Social Welfare has to decide what the priorities should be.  Up until now certain other areas have taken priority in respect of the £10 million or £14 million that was available.  We are examining this matter at present and it is one for further consideration in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell welcomed the removal of the anomaly in urban and rural rates and I must say that I am very heartened by the fact that Deputies on all sides of the House have welcomed this step.  I welcome their support for this very important measure.  It means there is the same payment whether it is in a rural area or an urban area even bearing in mind all <Col N="669" /> the anomalies which existed, and they were extraordinary.  I welcome the support Members on all sides of the House have given to the removal of the low rural rate and the raising of the rates uniformly all over the country to one single unemployment assistance rate broken into two parts, long term and short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be missing the point we raised in relation to the single means test.  There should be a single means test.  It would save a great deal of money in administration.  It should be based on net income.  The very point the Minister raised, that there is an argument against him for the time he will be in Government seeking better assistance rates and more support for social welfare, is taken care of under a single means test based on net income which would then permit a graduated entitlement to various allowances and benefits. It would make no difference then to the person whether he or she was on social welfare, wages or a salary.  Whatever is the net figure in the salary or whatever amount the person is getting from social welfare would fix that person at the position on the single means test of entitlement to various State benefits.  That is why I urge the Minister to give very serious consideration to the proposal.  It could provide one of the greatest incentives to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point relates to the benefit and privilege provision.  Again, the Minister has missed the point.  This was covered by the Commission on Social Welfare who clearly point out that in the application of benefit and privilege a distinction is made between non-farm families and farm families.  Having looked at this distinction, I am convinced it amounts to discrimination against farm families.  Why?  When you are talking about non-farm families the method of assessment puts a comparative notional value on board and lodgings in households with different levels of net income and family size, whereas in relation to a farm the procedure is to assess the net yearly income from the farm and divide it between the members of the household, <Col N="670" /> even though the person applying for unemployment assistance might not be entitled to a shilling of that farm income.</P>
    <P>The commission further mentioned that in the case of families engaged in farming, a notable feature of the method used is that a nil assessment cannot occur in any case, and the amounts assessed can be fairly substantial even at very low levels of income.  That highlights the point.  The commission mentioned that, particularly where the family farm income ranges below £90 a week, the applicant can end up with a figure which clearly would be far less than he would get in the town.  The commission recommended that there should be a common method of assessment between farm and non-farm households.  That seems to be the obvious way forward to remove this discrimination.</P>
    <P>The problem is not the amount of the farm income.  I know that is difficult to assess.  That is done commonly nowadays in relation to small farmer's assistance etc., but a proportion of that farm income is assessed to the applicant who is not entitled to any part of it, whereas in a non-farm family a different approach is followed.  There should be a common approach and this discrimination should be removed.  That seems to be the obvious solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said there is a difficulty in assessing income in farming.  I take the Deputy's point that the kind of assessment is somewhat more restrictive in the farm situation.  We are looking at that in the context of our review of the means assessment and I assure the Deputy we will bear his comments in mind in that review.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section.  I should declare interest.  I am father of a large family and I suppose in <Col N="671" /> the light of other controversies one should be very careful about the comments one makes where there is a possible, albeit very minor, personal benefit.</P>
      <P>I want to raise two matters with the Minister.  First, while the Minister and his party have made great play of the fact that, at the very minimum, allowances and benefits have kept pace with inflation, child benefit has not.  There has been no increase in child benefit since this Government came to office.  I think the last increase in child benefit was in 1986.  There has not been an increase even to keep pace with inflation.</P>
      <P>The payment of child benefit is a vehicle which if resources permit, should be used more and more.  Its advantage is that it is not means tested.  In other countries their population is falling and they are now, at a very late stage, trying to increase their child benefit and children's allowances.  All the demographic trends clearly indicate a decline in the fertility rate here.  There is a fall projected at around 16 per cent in child population under 15 over the next ten years.  It is important that Government take note of that and, rather than leaving matters too late as has happened in Germany, France and other countries of the western world, the need for at least updating child benefit must be accepted by this Government.  I am not saying the amount of child benefit has a major bearing here, but our whole approach to child support is important.  The fact that this is the one area of social welfare where there has not been an increase, even to keep pace with inflation, is an indication that this trend has been ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make on this section is that it would be helpful if the Minister in this House now made a very clear statement as to the future of child benefit.  We all recall the confusion that arose from the half-baked proposal of his colleague in his Budget Statement that some child benefit would be withdrawn. There followed a whole series of statements from the Taoiseach and colleagues of the Minister which made it clear that that ill-considered proposal was, at the <Col N="672" /> very minimum being reconsidered.  The Minister seems to imply on Second Stage that the half-baked proposal to withdraw child benefit from some mothers had been shelved.  It would be helpful if the Minister would clearly and unequivocally confirm that this is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that child benefit be targeted in particular to poorer families.  The Minister made the point very clearly in his Second Stage speech that giving a higher increase to the fifth and subsequent child is to help larger families.  If there is justification for helping larger families&mdash;and obviously there is&mdash;there is certainly even more justification for giving more to poorer families. To pay each mother the same child benefit regardless of her financial circumstances is wrong, regardless of the political controversy it may have caused. I said in my Second Stage speech that unlike most women in this House I felt it should be targeted.  However, the Official Report, perhaps because I was not very audible, does not have the word &ldquo;unlike&rdquo;; rather it has the word &ldquo;like&rdquo;. There is a very important distinction.  I believe it is important to target child benefit. The suggestion that £30,000 should be the limit was a good one, although it would have saved only £5 million per year.  That could have been targeted to the poorest families in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During his Second Stage speech the Minister in a very clearly worded sentence made reference to the fact that every mother would continue to receive child benefit.  That was put in after a suggestion that it would be targeted to lower and middle income families rather than paid equally to everybody.  That was to be done through the taxation system. He referred to the fact that in about 70 per cent of cases the Department with the Revenue Commissioners could match income to child benefit and it was hoped it could be done for all families.  This would be the way of targeting benefit, which I presume would mean the benefit would be considered part of income and tax accordingly.  The next morning when <Col N="673" /> the Minister went on to explain what he had said he, or somebody acting on his behalf, briefed the political correspondents and the media generally that the child benefit was now to stay and that he had made this announcement in the Dáil, which I do not think was very clear. In an interview the following morning he certainly made it anything but clear that child benefit was to stay and when pressed constantly by the interviewer as to whether it would stay the Minister kept referring to the proposals for this year. He did not give a firm commitment that child benefit is to stay.  There is a lot of confusion.  Despite the Minister's own view that it should stay, that view is not shared by his colleagues in Government. It is important once and for all that the Minister should make it very clear whether child benefit is to stay.  Is the proposal by the Minister for Finance, which it seems was backed up by the Taoiseach's comments during the budget debate, now gone or is it still under discussion? If so, when will the matter be resolved?</P>
    <P>I reiterate my strongly held belief that the payment of child benefit on the same basis to every mother regardless of her financial position is not fair or just.  I accept that women, be it in the tax system or the social welfare system, who are not independent and do not have their own income deserve special attention.  I do not believe that the only way to do this is by the payment of child benefit.  If that were the case it would mean that a married woman who had no children and no income would not be entitled to anything from the State.  Similarly a woman whose children were beyond the age for child benefit would not be entitled to anything.  If this was the only way of remunerating wives dependent on husbands it would not be the best course of action.  It might be better to pay directly to them the tax free allowance for a dependent spouse.  There are better ways of helping spouses who are dependent on other spouses for financial aid.  It is no argument that persons may be married to wealthy spouses who may not give them their due amount of money.  I have <Col N="674" /> heard this argument used by many people.  It is no argument for having child benefit because a woman with no children would get nothing and neither would a woman whose children were beyond child benefit age.  The State would have a responsibility to do something for those women.</P>
    <P>This issue has been around for a long time and is a political hot potato.  In 1962 when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he said in his budget speech that he intended over the next 12 months to look at the possibility of having a selective system of children's allowance.  Twenty-seven years later it is still paid across the board to everybody.  I did think that once and for all we were going to bite this bullet and move in the right direction.  I am sorry that it seems we are not.  Perhaps the Minister would spell out clearly the Government's exact intentions in this regard.  There is a lot of confusion in the minds of the public, including those who support the continuation of the present system and those who want to see it changed, as I do.  At best, taxing child benefit will at the top tax rate of 56 per cent recoup only 56 per cent to the Exchequer.  It is an expensive way of paying out from one Department and taking back by another.  There are much better ways of targeting this benefit and I should like to think we will go down that road as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we would all welcome an increase in child benefit, especially since that aspect of social welfare has fallen very far behind in the past few years because of the lack of recognition of the need for increases.  The ESRI report by Nolan and Callan clearly established that poverty was greatest among families with four children or more.  I am not suggesting that there is not poverty among families with fewer than four children, but they identified that poverty was at the highest level among families with four or more children. While the impression may be created that the increase is very substantial, we are talking about an increase of £6.70 for families with five children or more, which <Col N="675" /> is effectively £1.54 each per week.  That would not be recognised as a major assault on poverty in relation to families of this size.  The Minister might explain why the increase should apply only from the fifth child.  It would have made a major contribution if that type of increase had applied to all the children or certainly to families with more than two children.</P>
      <P>It is clear that women would under no circumstances tolerate the elimination of child benefit, whatever excuse might be given.  This is one benefit which goes directly to a mother.  There are five children in my own family and I have never seen the children's allowance book.  My wife felt it was something she should have so that every month she could buy clothing and footwear for the children.  It was something she would look forward to.  No argument put to her would justify the removal of the child benefit.  There will be difficulty in justifying a reduction in the benefit irrespective of the level the Minister decides to set.  Women consider that benefit as something special for them, something they earn for themselves. Any Government, or Minister, who considers abolishing that benefit or altering it to the detriment of women will have to answer to the women of Ireland. Women are discriminated against in many ways and do not have any rights. Successive Governments have promised to do this, that and the other in recognition of motherhood, in recognition of the hours women work in the home and their lack of social activity but they have done very little for them.  The Labour Party will resist any attempt to interfere with that benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides for an increase in child benefit for the fifth child and successive children from £15.05 per month to £21.75 per month.  The payment for each child up to the fourth child will be £15.05 per month.  The increase in benefit will cost £3 million in a full year and it is estimated that 35,000 families will benefit.  Several Members have asked why we did not apply the increase to the third and fourth child.  Deputies also <Col N="676" /> made it clear that for many years proposals for some degree of selectivity in the system were considered.  Deputy Harney said she would like to see some selectivity and targeting of the resources while Deputy Bell was anxious that the benefits be improved across the board, when we can.  Both points of view have some degree of merit if our resources permit but it is because our resources are scarce that the Government had to consider how best to target the increases this year to those most in need.</P>
      <P>I accept that Members did not need a study by the ESRI to know where we should direct our resources.  It is clear that our priority should be to help families. It is a matter for the Government to decide how to allocate the available resources.  Obviously, those in receipt of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare benefit are in the lowest income bracket and, therefore, we should direct the greatest amount of money we can to them.  The child dependant allowance for those recipients was increased to the minimum recommended by the commission.  We streamlined the system upwards which meant further increases for those families.  In the case of some of those child dependant rates the increase amounted to 25 per cent. The emphasis is on improving the benefits to such families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty the Government had in regard to child benefit was how to direct available resources to those most in need. It is clear that the larger families are under considerable pressure and the decision to increase the benefit in respect of the fifth and additional children was a step in the right direction.  The Government allocated a further £20 million but instead of giving that to child benefit paid it out in the form of a child related tax exemption which meant that those on the lowest incomes benefited.  It is clear that those on low incomes, whether at work or in receipt of social welfare payments, are in need of support and that was the thinking in the budget.  As a result of the increase a family with five children and living on an income of £7,000 per year can benefit to the tune of £13 per week. <Col N="677" /> The benefit tapers off for those on an income between £7,000 and £9,500 per annum.  We have devised a good system for getting money to those who need it most.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made clear what the position will be next year, that these matters will be up for discussion and, as Deputy Harney has pointed out, such discussions have been going on for many years.  There are various ways one could approach this.  If the economic position improves next year we will be able to do more but we are not likely to have enough money to raise all the benefits across the board.  Undoubtedly, we would be in a position to consider increases for specific cases.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Harney suggested that we should grant an increase in respect of school-going children.  She made the case that there was a need for a higher rate of social welfare for families who have children at school.  That may have been suggested in the report by the commission. I am aware that when children reach the age of 12 they consume a lot more and they also need more footwear. In Germany, for example, there is an increase in benefit for those between the ages of 20 and 25 but the increase is not paid to those above a certain income.</P>
    <P>The suggestions made by Deputies are matters for a future budget and, if adopted, for implementation in a future Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy Harney mentioned the £30,000 income limit.  Even at this income a person paying full PAYE and PRSI has a net take home pay of £18,000.  So £30,000 looks like a lot of money on paper but what is taken home is substantially less.  Families with five, six, seven or eight children would stand to lose a large proportion of their net take home pay.  All these factors have to be considered when these measures are debated and I drew up all the necessary tables relating to this long before these recent debates started because it is important to know exactly what one is doing.</P>
    <P>When resources are scarce and one <Col N="678" /> wants to target those resources in a particular direction then one has to be selective. The debate on this issue will go on and can go further between this and next year.  We will continue to match incomes with people.  We only know that we pay child benefit to 475,000 families, just under 1.2 million children.  We know about the children and the families, but we know nothing about their incomes. There is considerable administrative difficulty in relation to incomes because one has self-employed incomes and PAYE incomes and so on and one has to define the exact income situation in individual cases.  I am aware of all these things and they must be borne in mind when looking at any of these proposals.  The Revenue Commissioners are providing us with information about the incomes.  The matching process is 70 per cent complete at this stage and can go on to completion in due course to provide future Governments with the opportunity to look at these relationships in the context of taxation and ploughing the money back into the system or in the context of giving special increases only in particular areas, for example, increasing across the board by 3 per cent, and in the case of particular groups by more than 3 per cent, if that is what the Government wanted to do in the future.</P>
    <P>This time the Government decided to spend a certain amount of money on improving the position of those at work as well as those on social welfare by increasing the allowance for the fifth child and giving more money to lower income families via the child-related tax exemption. This arrangement is a novel one and we will have more information about that before considering anything for next year.  All these matters can be discussed in future budgets but this is what we are proposing to do as part of the package this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister has sent out more back pedalling signals but the Government should, in fairness to the people, particularly the mothers, make a clear statement on this issue.  So far this has not been done.  There was a specific <Col N="679" /> proposal in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 25 January.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In order to introduce a measure of targeting of resources under the scheme, the Government propose that, as from early next year, child benefit will be confined to families with income below a certain level.</P>
      <P>That was a clear statement of a Government proposal.  I accept that on Second Stage on 7 March the Minister, by implication, suggested that that proposal no longer existed because on that date he referred to the matching of the tax and social welfare systems and mentioned that this would enable the Government to use the child benefit system &ldquo;not only to make payments to every mother but also to direct additional resources to lower and middle income families&rdquo;.  That seems to imply that the proposal as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget no longer stands.  All I am asking is that the Minister would say clearly that that is the case.  I accept what he has to say in regard to discussions for the future.  Of course, everything is up for discussion in the budget each year. The point I am making is that there was a specific Government proposal announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget and I want to hear from the Minister that it has been withdrawn. Thereafter it is a matter for discussion. None of us can see into the future, but the mothers of this country are entitled to know whether or not that proposal has been withdrawn.  I believe strongly that it should be withdrawn because there has been a lot of confusion about it.  The role of child benefit is to redistribute income from childless individuals and families to families with children.  Its main role is horizontal equity and that is particularly relevant in the absence of tax allowances for children.  It is not a policy instrument for vertical redistribution across income groups.  There are other policy instruments available for that purpose and I am all in favour of their use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of child benefit cannot be <Col N="680" /> considered in isolation but must be looked at in conjunction with tax allowances, tax credits, social welfare and child dependency allowances and so on.  There should be a review of all the support available for children and out of that a view can then be formed as to what is to be done in future.  What is needed now is a clear and unequivocal yes or no from the Minister that the proposal as enunciated by his collegue, the Minister for Finance, is off the table.  If so we can start from scratch and discuss all the aspects of child support.  The mothers of this country are entitled to know that it is off the table.  We have been through all the winks, nods and signals.  I would like the Minister to say specifically that that proposal is now off the table and that we will start from scratch.</P>

      <P>What might be a more interesting debate is why the proposals regarding children's allowances was withdrawn, in so far as it was withdrawn at all, and what pressures were put on the Government to back-pedal on that particular statement in the budget.  I have my own views on that.  Nevertheless, I welcome the fact the the Government have withdrawn somewhat from the very clear indication that they intend to restrict payment of children's allowances to certain unspecified categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to admit that my internal alarm bells ring when I hear the term &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; used, specifically when it is used with regard to withdrawing some benefit or other in order to redirect the money spent on some other category.  That is a favourite ploy of the Prime Minister of our sister country across the Irish sea.  It is, by and large, an attempt to use one section of people to subsidise another. Generally one will find that the people who are affected by retargeting of social welfare in this way, the people who suffer, are people on middle incomes. They end up subsidising those who are less well off than themselves rather than those who can well afford to assist the less well off.  That can only be achieved equitably through the tax system, not by withdrawing social welfare benefit of one <Col N="681" /> kind or other from those who are already in receipt of it.</P>
    <P>That is a trend which I find disquieting with regard to what this Minister is doing, for instance, in relation to so-called abuse or fraud in the social welfare system and I propose to deal with that matter in a later section of the Bill.  It seems that money is being taken from one category of people who are not that well off and is being given to the least well off.  Targeting, based on withdrawing a benefit and giving it to someone else, generally means that there is some other hidden agenda involved.</P>
    <P>Various people have indicated that any such attempt to confine children's allowances to people below a gross income of £30,000 a year would provide very little money at the end of the day for those who, it is claimed, would benefit from this withdrawal.  I am sure the Minister could provide us with the figures of what it would cost first to pinpoint the people who earn incomes of £30,000 or more. Some form of administrative system would have to be applied to pinpoint those people and then it could be decided who would get what.  A whole range of other administrative functions would have to be instituted to create this new system of child benefit.</P>
    <P>An example of what I have in mind&mdash; the Minister touched on it when he talked about how to pinpoint the self-employed and so on&mdash;is the higher education grants system which is applied on the basis of income.  Constituents of mine have complained to me that they cannot qualify for a higher education grant because they are PAYE workers and earn over a certain limit, while the self-employed and farmers in certain categories qualify although their standard of living and their income is far higher than that of the PAYE workers.  That is a system whereby grants are targeted at particular categories based on income and it is clear it does not work fairly or equitably.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion, which might produce more fair results, would be to look at the whole question of tax reliefs and how they are applied.  Sufficient <Col N="682" /> money could be saved by leaving the children's allowance, or child benefit as it is now known, as it is.  Tax relief on mortgages, for instance, is granted on the basis of the tax bracket that you are in. If you pay tax at the rate of 56p in the pound the relief on your mortgage will be granted at the rate of 56p in the pound whereas if you pay tax at the rate of 32p in the pound your relief will be only 32p in the pound.  Clearly the people on lower incomes benefit less from this tax relief. The same is true in relation to tax relief on health insurance and I am sure there are other areas also where tax relief works in this unfair way.  That area could reasonably be looked at to ensure that tax and reliefs on housing and health insurance are equitably spread.</P>
    <P>The tax relief granted under section 23 on so-called holiday homes is another area where there is a boom because people with income of a particular level can benefit from it.  There are a whole range of areas, which the Progressive Democrats and people like them could target, which could be considered to bring about equity other than attacking the child benefit which the vast majority of women in this country enjoy.  Those who do not require or need it because of their own personal incomes or that of their spouses could choose, as I think the wife of the Minister for Finance did, not to collect it.  I am sure there are quite a number of people who choose not to collect it but I do not think we should penalise women who have no other income of their own by using this spurious approach of targeting and withdrawing benefit from those who already receive it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as he said, through the tax system, but when it comes to <Col N="683" /> welfare matters obviously mothers, regardless of their ability to pay or what their circumstances are, should receive welfare.  He seems to think that the middle income group are being asked to subsidise the poor but the wealthy are being let away with it but when it comes to child benefit he does not seem to have any qualms about paying the exact same rate per child to everybody, regardless of their circumstances.  There is no justification whatever, no matter from which side of the political spectrum you view Irish society and no matter how you wish to order events in this country, for paying the same amount to every family; in other words that people will get the same amount for the first four children whether they are earning an income of £3,000 or £53,000.  It was interesting also to hear Deputy de Rossa say that we would not save very much because there are not many people on incomes above £30,000 a year.

      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy, and if so I am sorry.  The <Col N="684" /> Minister's comments on this matter will add to the confusion.  As I said last week on Second Stage, in a very carefully worded statement which I have before me the Minister said that every mother would continue to receive child benefit. That was in the context of clawing back through the taxation system.  That was picked up to some extent by members in the House; it was not really picked up by the media.  Subsequently they were briefed by somebody on the Minister's behalf&mdash;because they might have missed it &mdash; and told that the child benefit was to stay, that the Government had rowed back or whatever, which was the view they put on it.  Even the political correspondent from RTE&mdash;on all of the bulletins I heard the next morning &mdash; made much of the fact that the Government had now withdrawn their proposal. Then the Minister came on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  He did not say the Government had withdrawn their proposal.  He did not make the position clear at all.  When he was pressed on whether they had he simply spoke in terms of this year.  The Minister has added confusion to the position by refusing to say this evening whether this proposal is still on the table. In so far as he endeavoured to clarify the matter he said: of course, in the context of targeting child benefit, it is open for discussion in the context of next year's budget.  Certainly that seems to me to indicate that the matter is very much up for discussion.  If that is the case, we should say so and at least be honest about it rather than trying to further confuse people.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the fact that even if one has £30,000 per annum after tax and PRSI probably one would nett approximately £18,000 only.  I would agree with him.  But that is not a justification for child benefit.  That is a justification for changing the tax and PRSI systems.  It is not a justification for making everybody in the country a social welfare recipient, for ensuring that to some extent everybody is dependent on receiving some kind of remuneration from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Jim <Col N="685" /> O'Keeffe that child benefit is there &mdash; as I think he said &mdash; as a means of horizontal distribution of income, that childless people are to help families with children. I do not accept that as its <i>raison d'être</i>.  I do not think most people in the country accept that either.  The general argument advanced is that it is there to help women. Obviously it helps mothers only because one has to have children to receive it and the children must be under a certain age. That scheme grew up at a time when there was an effort being made to help the rearing of children.  There are now better ways of having income maintenance policies than having a child benefit that is paid across the board to everybody on the same basis.  If there is any justification for helping families and children, there is a justification for paying different amounts to families in different circumstances and not simply paying the same right across the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the difficulties of verifying income for the purpose of clawing back some of this money, or for the purpose of targeting it at people below certain incomes.  That is an argument for doing nothing on any front. There are difficulties in verifying income, particularly the income of self-employed persons.  But that is no justification for not pursuing certain principles, for not making every effort to ensure we have a welfare policy that is fair, just and helps those most in need.  That is required particularly at a time when our resources are not as great as we might wish.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the fact that 1.2 million children benefit under the child benefit system.  Obviously that is the case.  In many cases mothers require this money to buy essential clothing, footwear and so on for their children, or to supplement their weekly expenditure in running their households.  Other people are in a position in which they literally save that money, or regard it as some kind of luxury which is spent on luxury items.  Different people use this money for different purposes.  Even though the Minister for Finance's wife might be one of the very few &mdash; and I should love the <Col N="686" /> Minister to tell me how many there are &mdash; who do not claim this benefit I know from experience that if somebody is entitled to claim something, they certainly do claim it.  It is very naive of Deputy De Rossa to say simply: if you do not need it do not claim it.  That is like saying: if you are not paying your just tax, please pay it.  I should love to think we lived in that kind of society but, let us be realistic, we do not; if somebody is entitled to something, they will claim it. Probably the Minister for Finance's wife is one of half a dozen people in the whole country who do not claim it.  I should like the Minister for Social welfare to say how many people do not claim this benefit because I have no doubt it is very few indeed.  Nobody will ever voluntarily give back something they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The State should be involved only where necessary to target whatever resources are available &mdash; whether we be in a good or bad position; &mdash; only to those who need them.  Other means &mdash; through family law, the taxation system, through the direct payment of the tax-free allowance for a dependent spouse &mdash; should be found of remunerating mothers, or wives who are solely dependent on their husbands.</P>
    <P>There is a category of women who are not dependent on their husbands and who also receive child benefit.  So the argument advanced that it should be given to people who have no other income is not valid either.  There are women who have very good incomes in their own right and they, too, receive it.  Therefore, whatever justification there is for giving it to the bank manager's wife who does not receive any money from the bank manager &mdash; as I heard argued recently on radio programmes &mdash; what is the justification for paying it to the woman who has a large income in her own right as well?</P>
    <P>The reality is that this State has limited resources.  There are people living in dire poverty.  In those circumstances we all have a duty to try and use those scarce resources in the most effective manner, helping those most in need of them.  In that context there is no justification for <Col N="687" /> paying the same child benefit to two families, one on perhaps £5,000 per annum or below with perhaps four children and another on perhaps £55,000 per annum or more.  There is no justification for that.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the savings involved the principle is important.  We must start moving along the road of selectivity when it comes to social welfare in general; that applies across the board to all welfare payments.  The structure of our population is such that, in the future, we will not be able to afford these across-the-board payments to everybody regardless of their financial circumstances.  I would encourage the Minister and the Government to bite the bullet in this respect because, as the Minister and I said earlier, it has been around for a very long time.  The reason the Government appear to have backed off, is because of the initial backlash.  No matter what one tries to do in this country there will always be a backlash.  But that does not mean that one should bow down and accept it.  It means that the onus is on one all the more to be selective, all the more to be fair, to ensure that these limited resources and the £214 million or whatever currently spent on child benefit go to the people who need it most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about this issue and asked for a definitive statement.  He wanted to know what is the position with regard to the proposal. He wanted to make a definitive statement about the statement of another Minister. I think the best I can do is quote from the Taoiseach's remarks in this House on 1 February 1989, column 899 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the drawbacks at present is that because of the complete lack of selectivity Governments are inclined to give increase to better targeted schemes and give those schemes priority over child benefit.  If the child benefit scheme is to be improved on a regular basis for those who really need it, there should be some element of selectivity.  One way would be to give <Col N="688" /> any new increases up to a certain level of income only.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has put forward a proposal for examination and discussion, the Government having decided in principle that all aspects of the suggestion should be examined, and in particular what administrative costs and difficulties would be involved.  The income limits contemplated were never intended to affect low or middle income families, and the Government were thinking in terms of not less than £30,000 per annum.  It was also the intention that any savings at the upper levels would be used to improve the benefit for those on lower incomes.  I wish to state categorically that there was no specific decision taken to include this change in the next budget.  This could only be done after all aspects had been fully examined and in particular the administrative difficulties and costs carefully assessed.</P>
    <P>Since the question had been raised I was endeavouring to explain the parameters of this whole question.  As Deputy Harney pointed out, for many years there have been repeated suggestions and proposals of ways in which this scheme should be treated.  One would have to ask oneself the question: why is it that those suggestions and proposals were never adopted?  Perhaps it is because the practical difficulties are so great or because of a whole range of other factors.  Deputy Harney spoke about political correspondents' assessment of the position. Political correspondents must assess the position as they see it at any given time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also mentioned the £18,000 nett which turns out to be £18,110, so I was not far off.  The child benefit for eight children in a year would amount to £1,766 at present and the reduction in income in that case would amount to almost 9 per cent.  Such factors must be taken into consideration in arriving at any decision.  Successive governments over the years may have considered the impact of these proposals <Col N="689" /> but they decided not to take that particular line.  I have pointed out that every other country in the European Communities pays child benefit directly to the mother in the same way as we do.  In fact, as I mentioned earlier, in Germany extras are paid for educational purposes, but are only paid to families below a certain income level.  This is something to be considered in the future.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with reality.  The Government decided to increase the benefit for the fifth child under the child benefit scheme.  Quite naturally, the consideration of the best options is ongoing. This is inevitable whatever Government is in office.  The Taoiseach has made the Government's position clear.  Beyond that I cannot say much more.  Deputy De Rossa asked about the amount of money involved, and the sum of £5 million would be available to be redirected in the scheme, but it would depend on where that money goes.  The difficulty at present is to know where you would be directing it because 30 per cent of the child benefit is unmatched.  Deputy Harney made the point that this does not cause any problem because the self-employed can be treated the same as everybody else, however it is not as simple as that.  The income of the self-employed would be based on their returns for a couple of years back while the figures are right up-to-date for those paying PRSI.  Let the Deputy not try to suggest that there are no administrative difficulties, because there are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>How do you calculate the PRSI payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is calculated on the basis of the previous year's income. However we have to pay child benefit on a regular basis and we cannot say that when we work it out we will tell you what is payable.  At present the books have been sent out for the next year and they are all out in the post offices.  Therefore, if we are to work from the beginning of January, what year's income will the payment to the self-employed be based on?  It would not be the last year's income <Col N="690" /> but the year previous to that that would be assessed for the self-employed.  Thus you would be going back another year. The changes that will have occurred in their income during this period is another matter to be taken into consideration. There are administrative difficulties involved and the Taoiseach mentioned them in his statement.  Needless to say I am very familiar with them because we are dealing with the difficulties.  It would not be quite as difficult administratively to operate a system when paying increases, but this is a different point and I will not go into it.  However, this is a complicated situation.</P>
      <P>Because of the difficulties with selectivity, the Government decided &mdash; but I cannot say what any future government will decide &mdash; that they could get a substantial sum of money to those at work on low incomes through the child-related tax exemption.  The payment for the fifth child was increased across the board because clearly this helps the larger families. That is what has been decided this year and it is now before the House and the tax element will come up later.  We have to consider the other things we are doing at the same time and the other mechanism we can use for targeting those we wish to help.  Obviously we can use the family income supplement to target families and we also have the child-related tax exemption scheme.  Another mechanism, which we are using in part, is that by and large larger families tend to be in the middle or lower income brackets.  That is a reality, so by directing more money to that area we are ensuring that a good deal of it goes to the middle and lower incomes.  Having said that, I trust the Deputies will be happy to support this measure.</P>

      <P>I am interested, or more intrigued than anything else, by Deputy Harney's statement that a principle is involved.  She did not enunciate the principle, as far as I know, but perhaps she did so when I was not in the House.  What precisely is the principle? <Col N="691" /> It seems to me that if we go down the road of withdrawing child benefit because of the income in a particular household, we are starting to question why benefit of any kind should be paid to a family over a certain income limit?  Why should unemployment benefit be paid to a young person or indeed to an older person who is living with their family, when the family's income is over £30,000 per year? Why should we pay disability benefit, a pension of any kind or a whole range of benefits which are paid to people regardless of the household income?  This is quite right for a variety of reasons basically to do with equity and the fact that a certain number of contributions have been paid and this is the way to ensure that people do not end up in a poverty trap.  My greatest fear about withdrawing child benefit from certain categories and using artificial cut-off points is that you end up with more people in traps.  It gives the government of the day, no matter which government, a licence to move that threshold up and down as it suits the political and economic climate at any given time.  My point is that the saving that would be made by withdrawing child benefit from those with incomes in excess of £30,000 &mdash; I do not have the figures available to me of how many there might be earning more than £30,000 at this point in time &mdash; would be eaten away to a large extent by the administrative costs involved in introducing that selectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, are we serious about equity and treating families and individuals fairly as between the tax and social welfare systems, because my understanding is that the PD's and indeed other parties, but not The Workers' Party, supported the budget which gives across the board tax reductions to those on very high incomes and those on very low incomes. The tax reduction in the 58 per cent rate, for instance, for people on £50,000 a year or more is worth something like twice what a family with four or five children would be getting for the year in child benefit.  There we have a give-away to families on very high incomes through the tax system and here we have people <Col N="692" /> arguing that we should start fiddling around with the child benefit in a way which would create more problems than it would solve and would result in a lot of families and women in particular, suffering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Where, under the provisions of section 50 (1), 51 (2), 81 (3), 86 (3), 91 (3), 95 (2) or 103 (2) of the Principal Act an increased rate of payment in respect of a prescribed relative is payable, such payment shall be made directly to such relative.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been able to escape the knife of the Ceann Comhairle.  It relates to the position of the prescribed relative.  We are talking here about what at the moment is an additional payment made to an incapacitated recipient of a social welfare pension.  This payment is made where a pensioner has a relative living with him, looking after him.  One of the greatest anomalies in our social welfare system is that there is not a direct payment to the carer.  A person, very often a woman, has to give up a full-time job to care for an elderly relative and because of that ends up with absolutely no income.  I accept that there is an additional sum added on to the pension and paid to the pensioner but that is not satisfactory.  I have never understood why, when the prescribed relative allowance was introduced about 21 years ago, it was not paid to the carer.  There seems to be no justification for not so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that in future the money is paid to the person looking after the elderly relative rather than added on to the pension. This is an outrageous anomaly whereby the pensioner gets the extra sum.  Recently in my constituency I came <Col N="693" /> across a problem in relation to this allowance which added insult to injury.  An elderly constituent in receipt of a contributory pension and a prescribed relative allowance &mdash; the prescribed relative getting nothing &mdash; received a tax demand which related to the prescribed relative allowance.  I really thought this was going too far altogether and I made the strongest protest to the inspector of taxes concerned. In fact, I had a question down to the Minister for Finance today on the issue.  Possibly the inspector of taxes concerned made a mistake but certainly that elderly person aged about 80 and living in the remote Beara penninsula should not have received a tax demand for £300 or £400 related to this allowance.  In fact the elderly pensioner should not have been getting the prescribed allowance at all.  It should have been paid to the person caring for him.  I want this House to accept that from now on the allowance should be paid directly to the relative caring for the pensioner.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Department of Finance will prick up their ears when I say that this should be a start to a complete change in relation to the prescribed relative allowance.  Down the road there may be cost implications to be taken into account in such changes but, overall, if the prescribed allowance system were used properly there could be a net saving to the Exchequer.  At the moment conditions for getting a prescribed relative allowance are very restrictive.</P>
    <P>Today with cutbacks on the health side elderly people in need of care in many instances cannot get into hospitals or geriatric homes.  In any event, my basic social philosophy is that elderly people are better looked after at home if that is possible.  Many elderly people in full health need care and the best care is provided by their own relatives.  All State support systems should be designed to ensure that care is available at home.  In the foreseeable future there will be more and more difficulty in having elderly people cared for in institutions.  I do not want to stray down that road.  If there is need for institutional care it should be there but in preference care should be <Col N="694" /> given at home.  The policy of the State should be directed towards ensuring that as far as possible every encouragement is given to the provision of care at home. That is why I am moving this amendment. It is a first stage in what ultimately should be a broadening of the whole question of the prescribed relative allowance.</P>
    <P>The amount of money is not at issue in my amendment at the moment.  If it were the amendment would have been ruled out of order.  But, it is no harm that we should have a reasonable discussion as to where we are going in this whole area. The amount at the moment, even as increased by 3 per cent, comes to the magnificent sum of £28 a week and that is not even going to the carer.  That is about the most miserable payment available under the social welfare system.  I was speaking earlier about focusing payments on the poorest of the poor and about those who fall below the supplementary welfare net.  At a very minimum, the amount available to the prescribed relative should be equivalent to the supplementary welfare payment. This issue was looked at some years ago by the Commission on Social Welfare and in fact the recommendation of the commission was slightly different from the approach now adopted by me.  The commission recommended that prescribed relatives should be entitled to claim social assistance in their own right and, in that context, that the prescribed relative's allowance be abolished.</P>
    <P>The end result, if what I have in mind is ultimately achieved, would be the same because the person who is providing full time care for relatives would, under my proposal as in this amendment, have entitlement in their own right to an assistance payment in lieu of what I would call the prescribed relatives allowance payable directly to them and the commission were talking about an assistance payment in lieu of the prescribed relatives allowance, I am sure, the carer in question would not be concerned in the least about what it is called.  The basic consideration is that that person would receive a direct payment.  This would be the foundation <Col N="695" /> on which ultimately those moneys could be improved so that this allowance would be equivalent to the supplementary welfare level of payment.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Special Report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>The special report was formally laid before the House in June of last year and I regret that it has taken so long to get time in the House to debate this important report.  Nonetheless, I appreciate this opportunity to debate the report and hope that it will be the final step in legislation to up date the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Dáil's watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
      <P>It is wholly unacceptable, and totally anachronistic that the Public Accounts Committee should operate under terms of reference more applicable to the level of expenditure at the foundation of the State, and that the Comptroller and Auditor General should derive his powers largely from legislation made in 1866, supplemented by minor legislation in 1921 and 1923.</P>
      <P>There is little point in the 1937 Constitution giving the Comptroller and Auditor General independence akin to that of a High Court Judge if we then do not give him the powers and authority to carry out a modern audit function on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Parliament on the British model has a Public Accounts Committee.  By long tradition it was chaired by a Member of the main Opposition party, again to <Col N="696" /> ensure independence of functions.  Similarly, there is little point in giving the committee independence without giving it the tools with which to do its jobs in keeping with the needs of a modern 20th century state.</P>
    <P>In his 1982 report the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the embargo on recruitment and the effect it had on staffing levels in his office and on his capacity to carry out his constitutional and statutory functions.  The Public Accounts Committee made a special report in January 1985 to Dáil Éireann entitled &ldquo;The resources and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo; in which it expressed concern that the audit of public expenditure and revenue should be restricted by such a lack of resources.  It also recommended that an in-depth examination should take place into the statutory role of the Comptroller and Auditor General with emphasis &ldquo;on value for money&rdquo; auditing.</P>
    <P>In May 1986 during the debate on the Estimate for the Comptroller and Auditor General Office's, the Minister for Finance announced that he would undertake a review of the legislation in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he invited the comments of the Public Accounts Committee.  This invitation was repeated in April 1987 in the official response by the Minister for Finance to the January 1985 report of the committee. Also in April 1987 the Taoiseach told the Dáil that &ldquo;there has been a suggestion worthy of consideration that the Public Expenditure Committee and the Public Accounts Committee might merge into one powerful Dáil Committee&rdquo;, the Public Expenditure Committee was therefore not being reappointed.</P>
    <P>In January 1988 the Public Accounts Committee set up the &ldquo;Advisory Group on Public Financial Accountability&rdquo; to review the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee and to see how the system of public accountability might be improved and to present its report to the Public Accounts Committee.  This report was endorsed by the all party committee <Col N="697" /> and laid before the House.  This is the report now being debated.</P>
    <P>The advisory group was chaired by myself, and at this stage I would like to place on the record of the House my appreciation and that of the Public Accounts Committee for the dedicated work of the advisory group, speedily and efficiently carried out.  The other members were Mr. John Gallagher, Director General of the Institute of Public Administration, Mr. William Donnelly, Chief Executive of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland, Mr. Cecil Donovan, member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland and also partner in Touche Ross and Company, and the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. P.L. McDonnell.  The secretariat to the advisory group were Mr. John Purcell of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. Paddy Judge of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should also like to express my appreciation and that of the committee to the Clerk of the Committee, Padraic Donlon, and the other staff involved in preparing the report.  I should like to thank the other Members of the Public Accounts Committee for the confidence they placed in me in bringing forward this report.</P>
    <P>The State's accounting procedures are largely based, in a legislative sense, on the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  This Act sets down the manner in which the financial transactions of the State should be accounted for and the role to be played by the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General in this respect.  The Exchequer and Audit Department's Act, 1921, refined and updated the original provisions without interfering with the basic principles underlining the 1866 Act. In 1922, the Irish Free State written Constitution incorporated a provision for a Comptroller and Auditor General which mirrored the British concept of parliamentary control of public finances.  The enabling legislation covering the appointment and functions of a Comptroller and Auditor General and a provision for a <Col N="698" /> Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General was enacted in early 1923.  The 1923 Act merely adopted the British practice with minimal alteration. That corpus of legislation has remained unchanged to this date.  The 1937 Constitution reiterated the provision for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and defined his functions in broad terms.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has a key role to play in the system of public accountability.  He is not a servant of the Executive, but is rather a servant of the State who reports directly to Parliament which in turn sends his report for examination by the PAC.  His function is one of giving an independent assurance to Dáil Éireann that public moneys have been spent in accordance with its wishes and in accordance with statutory and other provisions.  Constitutionally, this is a matter for the Dáil and the Seanad does not have a role.  Under legislation, the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out a financial and regularity audit but also refers to instances of loss, waste and uneconomic expenditure which have not got expressed statutory provision, and in doing this has the blessing of the Dáil, the Public Accounts Committee and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>However, the legislation affecting the Comptroller and Auditor General is outdated and difficult to relate to modern Government accounting for public spending.  It is 120 years now since the main legislation concerning the Comptroller and Auditor General was enacted.  In this period there has been a radical change in the level and nature of public expenditure.  Time is long since right to look at our public accountability arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that this function is primarily a parliamentary and not an executive function.  However, in the Executive there have been recent manifestations of the need to update public accountability in Government White Papers &ldquo;<i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Serving the Country Better &mdash; A White Paper on the Public Service</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Recent developments in other countries, particularly those with a similar system of parliamentary democracy to Ireland, have seen a widening of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to include value for money audits, for example, in Great Britain &mdash; National Audit Act, 1983; Australia &mdash; Audit Amendment Act, 1979; New Zealand &mdash; Public Finance Act, 1977; Canada &mdash; Audit General Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>There are three elements of value for money, VFM, audit-economy which is concerned with minimising the cost of resources acquired or used, in short, spending less; efficiency, that is the relationship between output and resources used in that output, in short, spending well; and effectiveness, how successful do outputs achieve policy objectives, in short, spending wisely.</P>
    <P>Because the Public Accounts Committee has been established for so long its terms of reference do not specifically include authority to hire outside consultants, a power which has been given to the other functional committees of the House.  Nonetheless, the liaison committee of chairmen assigned a small portion of the already small budget for consultants to the Public Accounts Committee. When the committee sought to use this recently an objection was raised by the Department of Finance where an official of that Department wrote to an official of the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 December 1988 stating that:</P>
    <P>Pending any change which the Oireachtas may decide to make to the roles of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, the position is that the Committee's present terms of reference do not provide for the engaging of Consultants. Furthermore the specific responsibility for the promotion of administrative efficiency has for many years been the accepted responsibility of each Department under the general supervision of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to say that it would <Col N="700" /> be inappropriate to convey the sanction requested.  Similarly the Department of Finance raised objections when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were considering recently extending the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts to give them the normal power written into the terms of the other functional committees.  Indeed, committees already carry out a variety of exercises that are not specifically written into their terms of reference.  For instance, where does it say in the terms of reference of any committee that that committee can travel to take evidence or make examinations? It seems that within the Department of Finance there is an attempt to frustrate and deny the legitimate role of Parliament in these matters and this is a situation which simply cannot be allowed to continue given the prevailing state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>If Government Departments over the years have had, to quote the letter, &ldquo;specific responsibility for the promotion of administrative efficiency&rdquo; why have the following examples, which were certainly not value for money, arisen (1) 60 three-bedroom houses in Portlaois built for prison officers costing £78,000 each, exclusive of site costs; (2) two patrol vessels for the naval service expected to cost a total of £24 million but one only eventually received for this sum; (3) a building for a radio station at Valentia Island contracted to cost £90,000 but ending up costing ten times that amount without even going to tender; (4) a new administration building for the IIRS which was contracted at a cost of £2,875 million and ended up costing £7 million approximately; and (5) the development at Howth Harbour which was contracted for £3.7 million but had a final cost of £11.5 million approximately?  These are only some examples of the items which have been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts under existing powers. If the Comptroller and Auditor General had value for money powers and the committee had the right to consult outside consultants, could we find out if that vessel was worth £24 million or if it was <Col N="701" /> only worth a portion of the amount?  As things stand all we can state is that the project over-ran.  The position is that irrespective of which political party or parties happen to form the Government of the day these practices have continued. The gamekeeper is the Dáil and it is our position to police the regulations, to commend where good work has been done and to prosecute where poachers have been found.  It is an outrage for any civil servant to suggest that Dáil Éireann does not have a function in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General works for the Dáil and is not a servant of the Government.  He is an important part of the parliamentary system of control. He should be and must be wholly indepentent of the Executive of the day. Existing legislation suggests that the Department of Finance have powers of direction over the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is inconsistent with the independence concept.  For instance, section 1 (2) of the 1921 Act which gives statutory backing to the Comptroller and Auditor General test checks reads &ldquo;... provided that if the Treasury desire the vouchers or any of them to be examined in greater detail, the Comptroller and Auditor shall take action accordingly&rdquo;. A similar provision is provided in section 1 (3).  These subsections were amended in Britain by the National Audit Act 1983. Section 3 (3) of the 1921 Act reads: &ldquo;if in the course of any such examination any question arises between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accountant, it shall be referred to the Treasury, whose decision thereon will be final.&rdquo; Again this provision was repealed in Britain by the National Audit Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>A serious gap exists at present in the accountability process.  The Committee of Public Accounts examine voted expenditure, in a limited way, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies examine the commercial sponsored bodies.  Non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are not subject to parliamentary committee review but the Committee of Public Accounts touch on these in their examination of various accounting officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> There is a fundamental difference between commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Commercial State-sponsored bodies derive the greater part of their current revenue from the sale of goods and services; non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are similar to executive branches of Government Departments with almost all revenue provided by way of voted moneys. It is the view of the Committee of Public Accounts that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be relieved of his present powers and duties to audit certain commercial State-sponsored bodies but that he should have the right of inspection of all these bodies and to report to the Committee of Public Accounts who should have the right to look at the financial regularity of spending by these bodies.  It was, for instance, the public accounts committee in the UK who followed the De Lorean expenditure, not any other committee.  That kind of inquiry should also be a function of the Committee of Public Accounts here. Similarly, in the case of non-commercial bodies the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a role in ensuring that they are treated no differently from the way he would treat expenditure by Government Departments and they should be reported on and examined by this House through the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>As with State-sponsored bodies, a serious gap exists in the process of accountability of local authorities.  The committee are aware of potential conflict between the needs of local democracy and the Dáil's legitimate interest in local authority expenditure of centrally voted moneys.  Therefore, the committee choose to distinguish between &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; local authorities and other local authorities such as health boards, VECs etc.  The latter have 90 per cent or more financing as against much lower subvention in the case of mainline local authorities. There has been a serious problem in recent years with arrears of local government audit.  The departmental group on the reform of the local government service have made some progress <Col N="703" /> and produced an interim report dealing mainly with the temporary solution of the arrears problem, but what about reform of the system generally?  When are they going to report on this?  The main inefficiencies associated with the present system are: (1) in certain cases 100 per cent transaction checks are required; (2) there is no scope for countrywide comparative studies of similar programmes of expenditure by local authorities and (3) there is a lack of impetus for corrective action on matters raised by auditors.</P>
    <P>In the case of other bodies in receipt of moneys there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have inspection rights of bodies who are in receipt of substantial amounts of State funds either directly or indirectly.  The main reason for giving him such rights is to ensure, on behalf of the State, that the money has been used for the purpose for which it was granted.  Such bodies include voluntary hospitals which are 85 per cent State funded, charity organisations which receive substantial amounts of State funds, educational institutions and commercial firms which receive substantial amounts of State money.</P>
    <P>In Britain, following the National Audit Act, 1983, the Comptroller and Auditor General's estimate is no longer presented to the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The Committee of Public Accounts here believe they should have a role in preparing the estimate.  There may be a constitutional problem in the Committee of Public Accounts presentating the estimate to the House and we, therefore, suggest in the report that we should present the estimate to the Minister for presentation to the House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should have the power to engage outside consultants to assist him in his work.  This should not be restricted to accounts and he should have the right to hire quantity surveyors, engineers, economists and such people as he requires.</P>
    <P>A large number of recommendations are made in this report.  The committee do not have the same terms of reference <Col N="704" /> to hire consultants as other committees, although it is one of the senior committees of the House.  There is an element of <i>post factum</i> examination of expenditure which is unsatisfactory since the committee examine the expenditure too long after it has been made.  The procedure for laying reports before the House is outmoded and no time has been given in the Dáil to debate the reports of the committee.  There seems to be a lack of urgency with regard to the needs of the committee and the question of privilege for witnesses needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts have made a number of recommendations which I have barely touched on during the short time available to me tonight.  However, just because I have not touched on all those recommendations does not mean that any of them is less important than others.  All of those recommendations are recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts in so far as they effect the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee.  What we are saying is that no matter who is in Government &mdash; and it seems to the Committee of Public Accounts that it does not matter who is in Government at any given time &mdash; the statutory accounting officers who are permanent public servants need to be told &ldquo;You are no longer going to be allowed to account to Dáil Éireann under legislation passed in 1866; you are going to have to account under legislation passed in 1989 and account in modern terms of public financial accountability in keeping with the 20th century&rdquo;.  It is of vital importance to the whole question of proper financial accountability that those authorised to spend money on behalf of the State, to spend hard pressed tax-payer's punts, have a modern system of accountability through which they can answer to Dáil Éireann, and one which is in keeping with good 20th century practice. We are now a little over 11 years from the 21st century and it is not good enough that the legislation governing this essential and important area of the public sector should date from 1866.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, and the House for <Col N="705" /> giving me the opportunity to place my comments on the record.  I hope we shall soon see a response, by way of legislation, from the Department of Finance and that the Department will realise that all those very high-standing people who gave their services free of charge to the committee did so in the best interests of the public and the all-party committee on behalf of this House have endorsed that report.  I trust the Department of Finance and the Minister will give the report the consideration due to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is the oldest and the leading committee of the Dáil.  Its importance can be gauged from the fact that, apart from the procedural committees, it is the only committee specifically established under Standing Orders of the Dáil.  There has been a Committee of Public Accounts in every Dáil since the foundation of the State in 1922.  The committee is charged, to quote the Standing Order, with:</P>
      <P>... examining and reporting to the Dáil on the appropriation of the sums granted to meet the public expenditure and to suggest alterations and improvements in the form of the estimates submitted to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>To have some idea of the environment in which the Committee of Public Accounts operate, it is essential to know how the State's financial practices have developed.  The State's accounting procedures are largely based, in a legislative sense, on the British Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866.  The Act sets down the manner in which the financial transactions of the State should be accounted for and the role to be played by the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1921 defined and updated the original provisions without interfering with the basic principles underlying the 1866 Act.  In 1922, the Irish Free State's written Constitution incorporated a provision for a Comptroller and Auditor General which mirrored the British <Col N="706" /> concept of parliamentary control of public finances.</P>
    <P>The enabling legislation covering the appointment and functions of a Comptroller and Auditor General was enacted in early 1923.  The 1923 Act merely adopted the British practice with minimal alteration.  That corpus of legislation has remained unchanged to this day and while it has served us well, as I will mention later, it is now in need of updating.  The 1937 Constitution reiterated the provision for the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General and defined his functions in broad terms.  The setting up of a Committee of Public Accounts in 1923 with its form, size, remit and conventions similar to that of the House of Commons' Committee meant that a British-type system of parliamentary control was now in place in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In any democracy, Parliament is directly accountable to the people for its actions.  Responsible control in the management of the public finances is an essential part of a properly functioning democracy.  Public accountability puts the onus on public bodies to show that they use their resources having due regard for economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  In recent times there has been a universal move towards increased public accountability and value for money and effectiveness aspects of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the need for effective control of the public finances has always been a live issue but, in recent years, because of the financial constraint and the huge increase in public expenditure, the need for better management of the State's finances and the necessity of obtaining value for money has become greater than ever.</P>
    <P>The debate on the ways of achieving better public accountability has been aired now for a number of years.  This has been most prominently reflected in the issue of two Government White Papers since 1982 &mdash;<i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances and Serving the Country Better &mdash; a White Paper on the Public Service</i>&mdash; and in the expressed <Col N="707" /> views of parliamentary committees and individual Deputies.  In <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i> it was stated that &ldquo;it has taken a virtual crisis in our public finances to focus attention on the fundamental question of the procedures existing for the consideration of the aims and objectives of public expenditure...&rdquo;. In <i>Serving the Country Better</i>, the need for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the public service was emphasised.  All this debate represents a response to the modern phenomenon of ever-increasing public expenditure and has one aim &mdash; to improve the process of public accountability.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts have a significant role to play in this process and in the parliamentary control of public expenditure.  The committee work closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General plays a key role in our system of public accountability by giving an independent assurance to Dáil Éireann that public moneys have been expended in accordance with its wishes and in accordance with statutory and other regulations. Under the terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1923, he carries out his audit on behalf of Dáil Éireann but, in practice, the consideration of his report on the Appropriation Accounts &mdash; the accounts showing the expenditure by Government Departments &mdash; is undertaken by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The report and accounts have greatly facilitated the committee in carrying out their mandate in the past.  The legislation affecting the Comptroller and Auditor General requires him to audit the accounts of Departments from a financial and regularity viewpoint, but over the years the audit has developed into one of also identifying and reporting on instances of loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure in the implementation of policy.  In doing so, the Comptroller and Auditor General goes somewhat beyond his strict, narrowly defined legal role, but he has done so with the blessing and encouragement of various committees. <Col N="708" /> Indeed, a special report which the committee laid before the Dáil in 1985 recommended that there should be a statutory basis for carrying out such an audit.</P>
    <P>In the present climate of financial constraint, it is important that the State and indeed the taxpayer, get value for money and for this reason it is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General has the powers to complete as effective an audit of departmental spending as possible to ensure that value for money is being obtained and that the most effective use is being made of the resources available.</P>
    <P>In January 1985, the Public Accounts Committee made a special report in which the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined the extent of the audit workload of his office and how the imposition of the Government embargoes on recruitment had affected the staffing levels, and, consequently, his capacity to carry out his constitutional and statutory functions.  He explained that, after lengthy negotiations with the Department of the Public Service, a staffing complement for his office had been agreed in 1980 but had been almost immediately affected by the embargoes.  Since there was no scope, as envisaged by the embargoes, for a reduction or curtailment in the level of services provided by his office other than to cease to carry out certain audits, the outcome was that some departmental audit programmes had not been fully implemented and the audits of the accounts of some State-sponsored bodies were being delayed.</P>
    <P>In evidence before the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General stressed that he fully understood and appreciated the Government's concern to reduce staff costs and numbers throughout the public service and he was not himself demanding additional staff. His purpose was to draw to the committee's attention the effects which a reduction in staff was having on the capacity of his office to undertake the audits which they have to carry out.  It was evident that as all the audits for which he was responsible had to be carried out <Col N="709" /> every year there could not be any question of counteracting these effects by treating some audits as having a lower degree of priority than others.  He assured the committee at that time that he was making, and would continue to make, all possible efforts to carry out his functions to the fullest extent possible with whatever resources were made available to him, but he was obliged under section 1 (4) of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1921, to report to Dáil Éireann any important change in the extent or character of any examination of Appropriation Accounts made by him. He, therefore, saw it as his duty to inform the committee if he was unable to give what he considered adequate audit coverage to any of the accounts with which the committee were concerned.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General stated at that time he felt it was for the committee to say whether they were satisfied that in the then economic circumstances it would have to be accepted that the audit of public expenditure and revenue must be restricted.  If they were so satisfied, his position would be clear and he could continue to express his reservations in any case in which he felt that the extent of the audit which he had been able to undertake was inadequate.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Committee of Public Accounts have learned, through the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the committee's examination thereon of accounting officers, of the details of increased expenditure on capital projects.  In referring to the matters in their various reports, the committee expressed concern at the way in which the projects were planned and executed.  Because of this, the committee were of the view that the procedures followed in the management and control of the capital projects should be the subject of a special review.  To assist with that review, which they felt would be of a technical nature, the committee agreed to engage the services of consultants from ESB International, a body with wide experience in all aspects of planning, management and control of expenditure on large capital projects.  That report was submitted in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The investigations of the committee are made from a financial &mdash; not a political &mdash; point of view.  They do not make any inquiries into matters of policy which are regarded as the prerogative of the Dáil.  They conduct all their business on non-party lines so their composition generally reflects the balance of the parties in the Dáil.  The continuous choice of a member of the Opposition as chairman bears out this fact.  They are not influenced by the policies of the Government of the day and their bipartisan approach has been one of the main features contributing to their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The reports of the committee are based on the solid foundations of audit and help to draw parliamentary attention to particular areas of public expenditure. The recommendations in the report are sometimes for specific measures and occasionally for general review.  They are more frequently in regard to improvements in Departmental control.  The response to the report takes the form of a minute from the Minister for Finance and it is true that his response seldom complains about the recommendations or comments of the committee.  Indeed, many recommendations are taken on board and if the committee are not happy with the response from the Minister for Finance on particular topics they can continue to press the issue until it has been solved to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts are guardians of the public purse and have an important role to play in the public accounts process.  The scrutiny by the committee of Departmental accounts imposes a valuable financial discipline on Departments and acts as a continuous reminder to them that their management of public funds has been explained and justified in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on his impartiality. I should also like to acknowledge the assistance of Mr. Pádraic Donlon, the clerk of the committee, and also &mdash; but not least &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McDonnell, a dedicated official, who has gone out of his way to <Col N="711" /> assist the various members of the committee over many years.</P>

      <P>This is the most important debate the House has had this year and possibly in the life of this Dáil because it goes to the root of what this House is about and the question of accountability.  I took some time off in the course of my contributions to the budget debate to underline my personal, deep conviction that this House has let itself down over so many decades in respect of its right to be accounted to by the Executive and in respect of expenditure control by this House and that, in so doing, we have diminished ourselves.</P>
      <P>I want to give unqualified and unreserved congratulations to Deputy Gay Mitchell and the members of the group he chaired, who have prepared this report and which the committee have seen fit to put before this House.  Each of the members of the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McDonnell, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Cecil Donovan and Mr. John Gallagher are deserving of the sincere and deep gratitude of this House for the breadth, acuity and conciseness of the judgments they have made and the recommendations they put before this House.  On behalf of my party &mdash; and on behalf of everyone in the House &mdash; I should like to thank the joint secretaries of the committee, Mr. Purcell and Mr. Judge, for the effort they obviously put into compiling such a readable, lucid and intelligent report in relation to the expansion of the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a student of law at Kings Inns &mdash; as other Members also were &mdash; one of the things that struck me most about the Constitution was that there was this little isolated lagoon, Article 33, referring to a person of whom I had never read about in a newspaper, the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I noticed that in the Free State Constitution, Articles 62 and 63 also established this position. It seemed, on the face of it, unusual that somebody who could be so obscure from the point of view of the average person, <Col N="712" /> somebody whom the average person could never name if they were stopped in the street, would not know what he did and probably because of the archaic spelling of the title of the position, could not spell the name of the office in question, could be given such a central role in the Constitution and such immunity from removal.  It struck me at the time that if he was to be given such huge immunity from removal it must follow he had immense powers, a person who is quasijudicial and cannot be removed at the whim of a transient majority of this House but only on very special grounds set out in the Constitution.  It implied that this position was one of central importance to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary student and young layman at the time my feelings were that if this position was so important how was it I had never heard of it?  That probably is the fault of this House because, since the foundation of the State, we have made of the Comptroller and Auditor General a rather obscure, limited, political and economic accounting personage with a very low profile in the public eye.  That has been a fundamental mistake and it has been due to the fact in general terms that the Executive has dominated this House to an unwarranted and uncalled for extent and certainly to an extent which is in conflict with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It always struck me that if this man deserved such immunity and powers he must have a status which was commensurate to it.  Yet, looking at the position of the Ombudsman &mdash; which is an important one and appointed by a vote of this House &mdash; in relation to that of a High Court or Supreme Court Judge, there seems to be a sense in which the Comptroller and Auditor General is relegated to a very inferior role.  That is wrong and it should be put right.  This report in particular marks the first step towards putting that injustice right.</P>
    <P>The last contributor referred to the White Paper &mdash;<i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i>&mdash; produced by Deputy John Bruton which I unreservedly salute.  There were questions <Col N="713" /> raised in that White Paper about the possible expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Looking at the document placed before us today, I believe that the course of action recommended by this group, of which Deputy Gay Mitchell was chairman, is the correct course of action for the House to adopt and that the call in this report for legislation is one to which this House must respond if it takes itself seriously. If the Members of this House call themselves legislators or parliamentarians and if they see themselves as anything more than the lobby fodder of an Executive from time to time this report must be implemented and its recommendations put into law.</P>
    <P>The committees of this House, as the report points out, have grossly inadequate powers.  The Committee of Public Accounts is established by a permanent reference in the Standing Orders of the House but they have no more substantial powers than derive from those Standing Orders.  The ill-fated Committee on Public Expenditure and other committees which we set up from time to time to monitor the activities of commercial State-sponsored bodies are left in a position of great legal and parliamentary deprivation.  Their powers are grossly inadequate as we witnessed over the last fortnight.  People coming before those committees do not even have a guarantee of immunity from suit either under the Official Secrets Act or under the law of defamation for remarks they make to committees of this House.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Act which was established to give immunity to committees was so badly drafted when it was presented and passed by this House that it only conferred immunity on the members of committees and not on those who give evidence to them.  This report properly draws our attention to that defect in our laws.  Much more than that, the parliamentary process and the theory of our system of government depend on accountability by the Executive to this House.  As I said in my contribution to the budget debate, I drew attention to the gross inadequacy of the manner and <Col N="714" /> extent to which this House pays service, lip service or any service, to its constitutional obligations.</P>
    <P>The Constitution requires this House to examine the Estimates presented by the Government and puts an implicit obligation on the Government to produce those Estimates as soon as possible after the beginning of the financial year.  The Constitution gives no solace to those who suggest that a nod and a wink or a general passage of Estimates should be conducted in the dreary days of June when everyone wants to get out of this House and go to better things.  The Constitution puts a much more solemn and I believe serious obligation on this House to exact complete accountability from the executive in respect of the manner in which moneys voted by this House are, in fact, expended.</P>
    <P>I could invoke several examples to show how little attention we pay to the duties we were elected to carry out by the people at the last general election. For instance, the suggestion that £60 million in 1987 or £40 million in 1988 or 1989 as the case may be can be voted and approved of in the most incomplete and general terms on foot of the national lottery legislation, is simply wrong.  The generalised objectives for which those moneys can be expended without any further financial sanction and the manner in which the Executive is permitted to commit funds in those areas without prior authority from this House, totally undermine the notion of accountability.  That is only one example.</P>
    <P>No matter how those moneys or any moneys are voted or authorised either in prospect or in retrospect, which unfortunately is so frequently the case because of the laziness of our procedures, we are still left with a responsibility for their application.  For the first time, this report puts before this House fair and square, and in a manner which does not allow us any opportunity to evade the issue, the fundamental departure from the existing principles which apply to the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that is, the prospect that there should be in this House not simply a process <Col N="715" /> whereby we do or do not discover what civil servant may or may not have appropriated £30 into his back pocket while handling the petty cash of a Department but that we exact, in relation to the greatest projects, an audit which reflects value for money.  The VFM, value for money, audit proposals contained in this report are the greatest breath of fresh air this House has seen because it would put into this House at long last an outline of a plan whereby this House could bring back to itself the right to examine the puposes for which money is spent, the effectiveness of expenditure and can hold people responsible for irresponsible, erroneous and wasteful expenditure rather than simply finding them guilty of some defalcations, which seems to be the position at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly this report and its recommendations.  There are a few points with which perhaps I could quibble, but in general terms I believe this report deserves the full support of the Members of this House.  One of the features with which I would cavil is the suggestion implicit in the report that the Committee of Public Accounts should be told first about the Government's nomination for the position of Comptroller and Auditor General.  I will not bore the House with a detailed reference to that passage of the report but what I objected to was the implication that it was the Executive's right to do so.  I know that was not intended but the report implies that the Government's nomination should first be referred to the PAC.  I think that is wrong because this House has unfettered and absolute discretion as to whom it appoints.  The duty laid down by the Constitution on the Comptroller and Auditor General is to report directly to this House and to no one else.  In that respect this House has a duty to make it very clear that it does not accept that the process of nomination is the exclusive monopoly of the Executive from time to time.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the report that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given some considerable degree of <Col N="716" /> independence in relation to the amount of resources he considers appropriate and necessary for the proper discharge of his functions and vindicated by this House, is a very commendable one.  It strikes me as a cruel irony that a person to whom we give the function of auditing every aspect of public expenditure is curtailed and trammelled in the exercise and discharge of his duties by the fact that we do not vote him sufficient resources to carry out that function properly.  Is it not spoiling the ship for a hap'orth of tar to say that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be subject to public service embargoes, cutbacks and policies in relation to the number of people he may or may not employ at any given time to discharge his duties, when every single hour spent by his officers in auditing, if there is a value for money audit, as suggested by this report, would result in huge savings to this House?  Every penny spent, within reason, on the Comptroller and Auditor General's office is money well spent.  I believe this House makes a huge and fundamental mistake by allowing the Department of Finance to throttle that office or to curtail its effectiveness by imposing narrow minded and sometimes &mdash; I do not want to put too much of a conspiratorial aspect to this &mdash; selfserving controls on this office in the discharge of its functions.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that there should be a close working relationship between the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I accept that, but it should be one where the independence of that office is absolutely vindicated.  The way in which this House can do that is to put in place a system, such as that recommended by Deputy Mitchell and other members of this working party in their report, which would ensure that the amount of resources necessary to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General carry out his functions as expanded in accordance with the recommendations contained in this report are given to him as a matter of parliamentary convention. I know the Executive has the exclusive <Col N="717" /> power of putting before this House Estimates of public expenditure and, therefore, in the last analysis its up to the Government to decide to introduce an Estimate sufficient to cover the purposes and requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</P>
    <P>It is an irony that the Central Bank, which controls a huge flow of money, does not have to come to this House for authority of any kind in relation to the staff it takes on, how much it pays them or how it deploys them, but the Comptroller and Auditor General must go with a begging bowl to the Department of Finance to achieve the same results.  Is it not totally wrong that the Central Bank is given those powers, because by statute it is an independent organ of State, whereas by Constitution, an independent officer of the State must go on his knees to the Department of Finance to beg for the human and financial resources necessary to vindicate the rights of this House to have accountability?  I believe this is wrong and, subject to the constitutional constraint of which I spoke earlier, that it is the Government's monopoly on bringing in Estimates, that the proposals laid out in this report as to how we can get around this are absolutely right, and I welcome them unequivocally.  This House must not simply allow this to be the day on which this matter was discussed. This is not a bauble or a bone thrown to the Opposition parties, but rather a question which affects every Deputy, Government or Opposition, one which concerns the nature of this House, our respect for our constitutional position and our self-respect as legislators and parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>One thing I want to say in relation to recent events is that accountability in this House is of huge importance.  Accountability of the Executive to this House is of great importance.  I will not cavil with the Chair and I chose deliberately not to do so today.  We have seen the limitations of the Dáil questioning procedure as laid down in the Standing Orders of the Dáil. We have seen the inadequacies of the Dáil committee procedure for investigating any matter.  I say very solemnly <Col N="718" /> and seriously that we are, as a sovereign Legislature, entitled in this House to our privilege and our immunity and we are not to be bullied out of that by any editorial. We are not to be told how we are to exercise that privilege and immunity by those who perhaps are weakest in terms of their failure to carry out any decent investigative journalism.  I do not want to be lectured by others about how we carry out our functions in this House. We are accountable to ourselves in this House.  We are accountable to our own set of rules in relation to order and what is proper for Members of this House to do.  As far as I am concerned that is a matter exclusively for us.</P>

      <P>Recent events have caused the Progressive Democrats in particular and many other Members of this House some degree of disquiet.  We are unsatisfied and dissatisfied with replies we have got to questions such as the extent to which the monopolies and mergers legislation was complied with in relation to Master Meats and Classic Meats.  We are unsatisfied and dissatisfied with the inability of Members of this House to penetrate the immunity of the Executive in terms of financial accountability to this House and accountability for the discharge of their duties.  There is disquiet among my party's members in relation to things such as the export credit insurance system operated by the Department of Industry and Commerce and whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has proper auditing functions in relation to that.  We believe that all these issues which have arisen in one form or another in controversies deserve to be and will be further investigated.</P>

    <P>Regardless of the size of any party in this House, members of that party have, as all other Members have, an absolute right to use the privileges of this House and its procedures to investigate the truth and expose what we believe are many malpractices which, as I said on the last occasion are becoming more and more a <Col N="719" /> matter of grave disquiet to Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell, chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and all the members of the piloting group who did Trojan work in compiling this report. They went into great detail and have arrived at many conclusions which I believe are correct and need to be taken on board.</P>
      <P>During the early years of my membership of the PAC, sessions were held in private.  It was only when the Public Expenditure Committee started to grab the headlines that the PAC went public. That was to the betterment not only of the committee but of the whole of society.  Many of the issues with regard to the questionable expenditure of public funds were brought to light and made known in the public press.  Sometimes they were exaggerated but in general the reporting was quite fair and right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question to be answered today is whether, in the late eighties moving swiftly into the 21st century, the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General which he derives from the 1937 Constitution and from an Act of 1866 amended in 1921 and also in 1923 is sufficient. Are his powers sufficient in an economy light years away from the mid-1800s? Are they those that are needed for today and tomorrow?  I believe they are not, that they are too restricted.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for accounting for taxes and other revenues, the expenditure of funds related to the limits and purposes authorised by the Legislature and the systems of control to safeguard public money and property from loss, waste and misappropriation.  Those responsibilities are as important today as in the past. I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office are utilising up-to-date auditing techniques comparable <Col N="720" /> with those in commercial sectors but because of the size of the job and the huge number of transactions in a fiscal year it is impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit all financial transactions.  Therefore, his office use sampling techniques to assess the effectiveness of financial control.  These techniques can greatly increase the value for money received from auditing, but the Comptroller and Auditor General should also be in a position to carry out in-depth audits of different Departments.  The problem he has is a shortage of staff so he is not in a position to carry out these necessary audits.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister for Finance to ensure, as a matter of urgency that the Comptroller and Auditor General is given the staff necessary to carry out this essential function.  He should be empowered to make interim reports to the Committee on Public Accounts in respect of any serious irregularities he may find during the course of his audit, rather than having to wait until he has completed the audit of all the Departments and the Appropriation Accounts have been referred to Dáil Éireann.  To make accountability really effective it has to be timely and the problem that has arisen over the years is that his report has not been placed before the Dáil for a considerable period after the events have occurred, and the effectiveness of the audit has been lost.</P>
    <P>One could say the &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrase today is value for money auditing.  Value for money is very important and one would get the impression that it has not applied here at all, but over the years the Department and Governments have realised the vital importance of the concept of value-for-money auditing.  In a non-statutory manner they have allowed the Comptroller and Auditor General to make reports and carry out audits on a value for money basis.  This function should be structured because it is vital that taxpayers' money is utilised in an economic, efficient and effective manner.  We should legislate to give the Comptroller and Auditor General the necessary strength to enforce the concept of value for money auditing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The problem that affects the Comptroller and Auditor General is that he is dependent on the Department of Finance for funding.  This should not be so in a system of public accountability in a parliamentary democracy, which is founded on the principle that there should be scrutiny of the Executive by the Legislature.  The work of the Comptroller and Auditor General is essential and crucial to this concept.  Those of us here working on the ground have neither time nor resources to look in detail at the Departments and what is going on within them.  It is through the information provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General that we are able to see the problems and raise the questions.  He is handcuffed by the fact that the resources available to him are under the control of the Department of Finance, which is a branch of the Executive.  If they curtail those resources he is not in a position to get the staff and the equipment he requires.  I would earnestly request the Minister for Finance and the Government to look seriously at the position in which the Comptroller finds himself because of this restriction.  It is difficult to see how the Comptroller can be independent when he is controlled as to resources by the Department of Finance, a Department on which he has to report.</P>
    <P>Government policies today are aimed at ensuring that taxpayers' money is used in an economic, efficient and effective manner.  It is urgently necessary to extend and widen the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to help the Government in their aim.  I look forward to legislation in this area in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to join with my colleagues from the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts in endorsing and welcoming this special report.  Of all the committees on which a Deputy can serve in Dáil Éireann, the Committee of Public Accounts is the premier and it has an exceptional responsibility.  Having served on the committee for the past two years I want to put on record the regard which I think is universally shared by <Col N="722" /> members of the committee of the exceptional dedication and outstanding competence of our chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  Whereas at times he may have been hard on many an accounting officer, nevertheless the work of the committee, with very slender resources, has progressed very well.  We are not on top of our work.  A succession of general elections in the early eighties had caused the work of the committee to fall far behind.</P>
      <P>We respect the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who also has very slender resources.  If there is one aspect of the report which I would thoroughly endorse, it is the recommendation that the exceptionally small staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the very small staff of the committee should be expanded.  There is a great need for an increment of staff working for the committee.  I commend the report prepared by the advisory group in public financial accountability.  It is a very good report and the opportunity for this House to discuss the general work of the Dáil committee is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A single responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the Committee of Public Accounts relates to the examination of various Votes.  One Vote which the Committee did examine and which may well in future require quite exceptional examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by the committee is the Vote in relation to market intervention funds. We have just completed our examination and reached agreement on the 1988 report.  In the 1987 report, which indicates the massive amount of work which has to be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General, he has a long series of paragraphs covering some five or six pages dealing with export refunds.  Substantial criticisms were made by him in relation to the deficiencies &mdash; I use the word deliberately &mdash; to which he drew the attention of the committee on a joint review of export refund controls at meat plants carried out by officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Customs authorities in 1985.  There are multiple deficiencies disclosed by the <Col N="723" /> Comptroller and Auditor General and his comments are there for all to read in paragraphs 53, 54 and 55, together with his recommendations.  I do not propose to go into them since the report has been circulated to Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>In the discharge of my functions as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I have recently raised these very questions in relation to the operation of the particular scheme.  I have been very concerned, and the House should be gravely concerned, that in relation to the comments I made, particularly last week, I have been virulently attacked in my capacity as a member of the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts in raising such matters.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 March I am accused of having intimidated a particular company, Goodman International, by my &ldquo;abuse of public office&rdquo;. The report continues:</P>
    <P>The irresponsible abuse of privilege of the Dáil is an opportunistic pursuit of cheap publicity and is indefensible. The utterly false charges made are of the most serious nature and the prestige of the Dáil has been used to give a semblance of credibility to seriously demaging statements.</P>
    <P>Finally it is alleged in this newspaper, in quoting a statement from a particular company, that Deputies have allowed themselves to be used to further an intensive campaign of malicious rumour against the company in question, which is Goodman International, originating in an anonymous poison pen letter dated December 1987.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil and members of the Committee of Public Accounts must have the privilege to discharge their obligations and their duties without being assailed in such a manner.  I know of no anonymous poison pen letter.  I have received no such letter.  I am in no way indulging in maliciousness or irresponsibility in raising matters of fundamental public importance in relation to the discharge of my duties as a member of the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts, which have a direct bearing on <Col N="724" /> that special report, the elaboration of the work of the committee and the work of individual members.  I did make certain allegations in relation to that matter in this House and as the House is to go into recess tomorrow I wish briefly to elaborate in the framework of this debate.  I am entitled to do so because this is a special report and we are entitled to make recommendations to the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>I did indicate that a Garda Fraud Squad investigation was taking place into certain major documentation which was forwarded to the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Revenue Commissioners. I want to stand over and reiterate that statement.  I must ask the Minister for Justice to confirm that an investigation was at the time I made that statement taking place and that an investigation may well be ongoing.  It may by now have concluded but I know that the matter was the subject of various meetings, and may have been brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of the Dáil, in the interest of the integrity of Members and in the interest of the company concerned that the Minister for Justice should make a statement confirming the outcome of the investigation and clarify the matter. One way or another, it may be necessary to bring the accounting officer before the Committee of Public Accounts.  These matters occurred in 1986 and 1987 and they were subject to investigation by the Customs and Excise authority in 1988.  It may be necessary to bring the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food or the Secretary of the Department of Justice before us to clarify the outcome of those investigations.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that in relation to that allegation which involved a particular company, a company directly associated with the Goodman International group &mdash; the name of the company has to be put on record, Anglo-Irish Beef Processors International Limited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So that the matter can be dealt with briefly I wish to state that there were certain investigations carried out in 1986 and 1987 by the customs authorities on the matter I referred to.  It is true that they related to the operations of the group in question in late 1986 and early 1987.  It is true, apparently &mdash; this is the conclusion of the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; that suspected misdeclarations were made in relation to export refund documentation, particularly in relation to two plants of this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said in my earlier statements in the House that certain trimmings were included in various cartons of beef declared as containing plate cuts only. There has been confirmation of that by the Department.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food must state whether he is aware that there was an over-statement of the weights which were actually achieved, that incorrect declarations were made by the group both in respect of export refund claims and in regard to claims for aid under what is known as the APS, the private storage aid scheme.  I am aware of that as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts; we have dealt with the matter.  I challenge the Minister for Agriculture and Food to inform the House before we go into recess whether such claims were made by the group I have referred to, and its major subsidiary company, or &mdash; to come to Deputy Higgins's comment &mdash; by other groups.  I am not in any way attacking one particular company.  This is not an <Col N="727" /> attack; it is a matter of public record and it relates to public moneys.</P>

      <P>I should like to make the point that it is true that, having regard to the extent and gravity of the breach incurred, the Department of Agriculture and Food did declare forfeited in its entirety the various contract securities for the contracts concerned.  I am aware, to conclude this matter, that a very substantial fine, in excess of £1 million, was imposed in the earlier part of this year &mdash; a matter of eight or ten weeks ago &mdash; on the company in question in relation to the various occurrences I have referred to.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is quite improper of the company to allege that I was indulging in a particularly malicious and unfortunate escapade of publicity in that regard.  I find it even more reprehensible that some people, such as Gay Byrne on RTE, should climb on that bandwagon.  I hope that now he will recall the statements he made and will at least accept that I made those statements in good faith, as I am entitled to do in this House using the responsible privilege of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the comments made by Deputy Higgins.  I am aware that in relation to another group who have substantial storage of production from a county Cork plant, at Charleville, in a cold store in Waterford there is a further major investigation going on concerning serious irregularities affecting the company.  I should like to put on record, although it should not be necessary to do so, the statements made by responsible trade unions in regard to this because the customs staff must be protected in this exercise.  Mr. McKevitt, of the Public Service Executive Union in the course of a letter published in <i>The</i><Col N="728" /><i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday &mdash; something many people seem to have forgotten or omitted to read &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>In 1987, representatives from the European Court of Auditors on a visit to Waterford (and various other ports) were informed by Customs staff of the fraud which they had discovered and which they had already reported to the Revenue Commissioners who in turn notified the Department of Agriculture. Export refunds to the traders involved are at present held up by the Department of Agriculture because of the Customs and Excise action in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Furthermore Mr. Martin McDonald the General Secretary of the Irish Customs and Excise Union said:</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Court of Auditors was initially alerted to certain CAP irregularities by Customs Officers which has led to ongoing investigations.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that the Minister for Finance confirms that a major investigation has taken place and that this matter is being dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners; the Minister for Justice must confirm that the Garda Síochána were called in and must disclose the outcome, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food must confirm that his Department are, understandably, involved and also explain why there was apparently a major delay in the latter half of 1988 up to the first weeks of January in dealing with this matter.  I want to know why.  I am saying it here so that I do not have to deal with the matter in the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has gone on record in this House on 9 March saying that there is no question but that a serious fraud has occurred.  It was when the Minister for Finance made that statement that I certainly had confirmation that the <Col N="729" /> information I had from impeccable sources was worthy of being raised in this House.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking the House for the opportunity of raising the matter and I do want to say to Mr. Goodman and to his spokespersons, that as far as I am concerned I only want the truth to be told; all I am interested in is protecting his company and all other subsidiary companies and their employment.  If any irregularities have occurred, even involving sub-contractors or any subsidiary company, the details must be disclosed. It is public money for which the Dáil has a responsibility, whether it is guarantee moneys which are withheld, refunds paid or not, fines imposed or not.  The facts should be stated in public.  I am not acting in a malicious or vindictive way.  It is exactly the way everyone on the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts must discharge his duties in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly on this as I know there are other speakers wishing to get in.  I would like to join the House in congratulating the members of the advisory group on financial accountability, principally the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McDonnell, and particularly the clerk, Mr. Donlan.  The fact that we have a work programme now is attributable to Deputy Mitchell and his staff.  I would like to thank the PAC and the Comptroller for facilitating the work we have done, allowing us to visit the various places and have discussions with one auditor of the European Parliament, the farming organisations on disease eradication and, quite recently, a discussion on the report by Coopers and Lybrand on the administration of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to agree with some of the recommendations in the report that was produced, particularly the one recommending that the committee should have a central role in determining <Col N="730" /> the estimate for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and that the audit of his office should be undertaken by an external auditor appointed by the committee.  They are two very important recommendations in the committee's report.  Hopefully, we will look separately at the possibility of a local government audit commission headed by the Comptroller and Auditor General when the examination of the report of the interdepartmental committee takes place.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts should be commended for the fact that many of the members visited other Parliaments and have seen the situation <i>visá-vis</i> a similar committee in those countries. I was a member of a delegation that went to the British Parliament and we had a very worthwhile discussion there with the Public Accounts Committee in the House of Commons.  For more than a century in Britain the statutory framework for public audit was broadly unchanged.  The content of the audit itself advanced in a number of significant ways. The most important development was the growing attention paid to value for money for examinations into questions of economy, effectiveness, and efficiency. Again, we have referred to this in our report.  The origins of this natural but non-statutory extension of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General can be traced back a very long way and with the encouragement and support of Parliament it has been a major part of his responsibilities for at least the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade in Britain there has been a growing demand for greater public and parliamentary accountability for all bodies receiving public funds.  This has been reflected in a succession of parliamentary reviews into the scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's responsibilities and the nature of his work.  These reviews culminated in an inquiry in 1980 by the Committee of Public Accounts which recommended important developments in the status and <Col N="731" /> functions of the Comptroller and his staff.  A number of these recommendations were enacted in the National Audit Act, 1983.  This new Act reinforced the financial and operational independence of the Comptroller from the Executive and brought him into closer relationship with the Parliament.  It created the National Audit Office, which is referred to in our report.  With the Comptroller and Auditor General at its head, it established a clearer framework for his access to Departments and many other bodies that received public funds and provided statutory authority for his work in those three areas of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The value for money audit which we have mentioned is a very important area. We have probably done it unofficially but there was a need for legislation to put it on a statutory basis.  The main objectives of the value for money audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General are to provide independent information, advice and assurance to Parliament about the three areas, economy, efficiency and effectiveness and the use of resources in the Departments and other organisations examined.  This audit is carried out in Britain over a planned cycle and is directed towards establishing: (1) that there are proper arrangements there for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness; (2) that particular attention is paid to areas where the largest resources are involved and the risks are greatest; and (3) main control and management information systems and that such systems are operating satisfactorily in practice.</P>
    <P>This involves a selective examination of important projects and programmes. It is not always possible or indeed desirable to distinguish between the different elements of the value for money audit, but I mentioned the broad classifications: economy concerning minimising the cost of resources used for activity having regard to the appropriate quality; <Col N="732" /> efficiency concerning the relationship between the output in terms of goods, services and other resources used to produce them, and how far the activity achieves the maximum output for a given input; and effectiveness concerning the relationship between the intended impact and the actual impact of activity.  We have to ask how far do the outputs in terms of goods, services or other results achieve the effects that were intended.  We were informed by the House of Commons Committee that there were four major areas that were subject to the value for money audit; the road construction programme, the national health service, the North Sea oil project and the multi-role combat aircraft, that is the major defence projects which were the subject of reports to Parliament by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In Britain the committee has up to 15 members and is chaired by a senior member of the Opposition.  In the recommendations there is a reference to the fact that there should be a Deputy Chairman. I certainly would agree with that and, like other committees of the House, the Deputy would agree with that and, like other committees of the House, the Deputy Chairman should come from the Government side since the Chairman is from the Opposition party.  I welcome the recommendation that the functions of the former Committee on Public Expenditure be assigned to the Committee of Public Accounts and also the recommendation that the committee be empowered to extend privilege to witnesses appearing before it.  I understand from legal advice that this can be done.</P>
    <P>Close co-operation between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts is very important and I am very glad that such co-operation exists.  The question of co-operation was summed up very well by a former chairman of the committee in Great Britain who said in his report that the Comptroller and Auditor General's <Col N="733" /> effectiveness largely depends on the fact that his reports are considered and followed through by the committee, and that the committee's effectiveness depends largely on the fact that it has his reports as a starting point.  I welcome the fact that we have a chance to debate this report.  I congratulate everyone associated with it and I hope legislation will be passed to deal with the many aspects that are mentioned in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the committee on the report.  There is a number of aspects of it which I find&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla, you can take five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>You are taking me at my word.  I was making a generous gesture but I did not think I would have to stick by it.  However, I will do the best I can as five minutes is not much time. <Col N="734" /> As I have said, I commend the report.  I am glad it states that the committee will be taking an interest in commercial State-sponsored bodies even though they are audited by private sector auditors.  The report outlines why the Comptroller and Auditor General should have inspection rights in relation to all commercial State-sponsored bodies and that his reports thereon should be subject to PAC examination.</P>
      <P>The report goes into detail on what the committee should do and it makes four major points in that regard but I am concerned that it does not refer to what happened in the case of Irish Shipping. How do you find that out and what procedures are laid down to make sure that that sort of thing never happens again? I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not examine the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited but that they were examined by private sector auditors and that he is to examine the activities of subsidiaries and identify the use of tax avoidance schemes.  That is excellent but I would suggest to the committee that there should be some procedure to ensure that what happened with Irish Shipping does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the decision of the committee that bodies in receipt of substantial State funding should be subject to examination.  The principle that any body who accept public funds must be subject to scrutiny by Parliament as to the way those funds are spent is eminently sound.  This is something I have recommended for some time.  Only last week I made the point that private sector companies &mdash; I am not including every company who get a grant from the State &mdash; who receive substantial State funding should be subject to examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am very glad to see that that is recommended in the report and I hope that whatever procedures are necessary to ensure that it is implemented will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from bodies who receive substantial State funding, there are also <Col N="735" /> bodies for which the State takes responsibility, for instance, ICI and PMPA. Those bodies were not in receipt of substantial State funding but the State had to take responsibility for them.  When the State has responsibility for insurance companies, the Committee of Public Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General should also have responsibility for examining them.  The PMPA are now being sold off without any reference to the Dáil, the taxpayer, the members of the PMPA or the workforce and the Minister has said he will agree to that.  That is dreadful because we are left with responsibility for the debts.  The company are to be sold off, without any debts, to another insurance company and if that company go bust we will again be responsible.  The State will have to rescue them and go through the same operation all over again.</P>
    <P>There should be some special audit of insurance companies because we have to take the rap for them.  There is no mention in the report in that regard but I recommend to the committee that they look at areas where the State has responsibility either through giving public funding whereby it would have responsibility to ensure it is used in the proper way or in cases where the State will have to rescue the company in any case.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General should have responsibility in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that my time is so short on this very important report.  I welcome the laying of the report before the House and I join with previous speakers in complimenting the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McDonnell, and his staff and indeed Mr. Judge, and Mr. Donlon, of the secretariat of the committee.  I thank them for their help and work in preparing this <Col N="736" /> report and having it laid before the House.</P>
      <P>This is a very important report which deals with the future powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. Everyone agrees that those powers should be extended.  Having served on that committee for the last seven years I am satisfied that that is of vital importance. This committee have done excellent work.  All of us who have served on the committee can recall the many cases that have come before us of excessive expenditure in one area or other.  One of the major functions of the committee is to examine public expenditure.</P>
      <P>One matter that should be introduced is a value-for-money audit because it is in the interest of every taxpayer that we get value for money.  In the past very often money was spent without proper control or accountability.  The time has come, in this financial day and age, when we cannot continue without extending the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to a value-for-money audit. This is of vital importance.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Government to extend the powers of the committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor General to cover this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report which is very detailed should be examined by every Member of the House.  It spells out clearly what the future role of the Committee of Public Accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be.  Adequate finance should be provided so that the Comptroller and Auditor General can go about his work properly.  One matter which has been referred to in the past is the lack of adequate finance for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is absolutely ridiculous to have this office if it is not properly funded and staffed.  I would again appeal to the Minister for Finance to extend the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts and to ensure <Col N="737" /> that the Comptroller and Auditor General has adequate finance to fulfil his statutory role.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the possibility of extending the powers of the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General to health boards and county councils.  Very often in the past we did not get the best value for money in particular areas.  Since, by and large, the Dáil provides the vast majority of the money for county councils and health boards, it should carry out the audit and those bodies should be directly responsible and answerable to the Dáil.  This is something the Minister should examine.  I appeal to him to extend these powers to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Within four or five minutes it is impossible to deal with all of the points raised in this report.  I am also aware that Deputy McGahon is anxious to contribute.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine the recommendations of the report.  I would recommend particularly that he extend the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor General with particular reference to health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

I take grave exception to the contemptible and irresponsible attack made on Mr. Larry Goodman in this House last week by two Deputies about one of whom, Deputy Barry Desmond, words fail me.  I have to describe him as a contemptible gentleman who has not got the guts of a louse, who has not taken <Col N="738" /> up the invitation of the Goodman organisation to repeat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I want to say that Mr. Goodman has made an enormous contribution to our economy over a period of 28 years, to such an extent that he is now Europe's largest meat processor. He is responsible for five per cent of the GNP of this country.  It is indeed regrettable that his credibility internationally could be so damaged by the irresponsible words of people of the left wing persuasion who have a definite bias against the private sector and success. People of that left wing persuasion in this country adopt dog-in-the-manger type attitudes to such people and their successes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Financial Times</i> of 10 March 1989 Mr. Goodman's name appears many times in an article entitled &ldquo;Irish meat company in `in fraud probe&rdquo;'.  Again in an article in the <i>Sun Herald</i> of Sydney of 12 March, 1989 entitled &ldquo;EC fraud `tip of the iceberg&rdquo;' the Goodman International is named.  In newspapers in Iran, Iraq and Pakistan the name of Goodman International appears on their front pages.  Internationally tremendous damage has been done not only to the Goodman organisation but to this country and its future as a meat exporting nation.  I reiterate Mr. Goodman's call, challenging Deputy Mac Giolla, and particularly Deputy Barry Desmond, to repeat their allegations outside this House.  Equally I want to tell them that the Goodman International Group is not and was not the subject of a fraud inquiry, <Col N="739" /> that the £20 million in export refunds being withheld from an Irish company is not Goodman International as was alleged by Deputy Desmond.  Goodman International is not involved in litigation with any State Department regarding documentation nor are any court proceedings pending, again as was alleged by Deputy Desmond.</P>

If these attacks continue it is not inconceivable <Col N="740" /> that Mr. Goodman would pull out of this country altogether.  Who would replace him?  Would it be people from the public sector, the favoured sector of Deputies Mac Giolla and Desmond?</P>
      <P>I again challenge them to make these allegations outside this House.  I thank the Minister for having given me an opportunity to defend a man who I think was hard done by last week.</P>
      <P>In passing I might pay tribute to the Committee of Public Accounts, and to the Comptroller and Auditor General on their work and commitment.  My greatest praise this evening goes to Deputy Gay Mitchell for his unending work in upgrading that committee over the past two years, which will stand as a monument to him.</P>

      <P>I thought, having listened to some of the other contributors, we were having a different type of debate here this evening. When Members come into this House and ask legitimate questions about public expenditure &mdash; as they are entitled to do &mdash; they should also bear in mind the irreparable damage they can do to anyone's business internationally.  I will say no more than that.  I will leave it to my colleague &mdash; who has all the details in relation to it &mdash; to deal with that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts before us and join other Members in complimenting their chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell. The report contains 42 recommendations, with some of which I agree. There are many good proposals.  I should say that I am carrying out an in-depth study of all of their recommendations and will be preparing proposals for submission to Government as soon as possible. Everybody will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to say yea or nay in relation to any specific recommendation at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question has been around for a long time.  In 1969 we had the Devlin Report.  In May 1986 the then Minister <Col N="741" /> for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, announced in the House that he intended to review the legislation relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General to ascertain if proposals could be submitted for the enhancement of his powers.  At that time he invited the Committee of Public Accounts to submit their views, which they have done very thoroughly, and which are encompassed in the report before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>I know that discussion of the issues will not cease at the close of this debate. Therefore it might be useful if I set out the background, as I perceive it at present, rather than dwell on the specific details of this report, its 42 recommendations and many useful proposals.</P>
    <P>With the growth in the size and complexity of public expenditure in recent times there has been increased interest in the way in which expenditure has been managed and accounted for.  This has been reflected in developments in relation to audit arrangements both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The present role of the Comptroller and Auditor General was initiated in 1866 under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, the Committee of Public Accounts having been established five years previously.  Article 33.1. of the Constitution states that:</P>
    <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller function, which relates to issues from the Exchequer, is largely formal nowadays and does not give rise to any concern.</P>
    <P>The main function of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; the Auditor General function &mdash; is governed by the Constitution and by the 1866 Act with amending legislation in 1921 and 1923. The type of audit carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in <Col N="742" /> accordance with statute is usually termed financial and regularity audit.  It is absolutely essential in the interests of the taxpayer and the Dáil that this work should continue to receive the highest priority because it provides the necessary assurance that financial affairs are being conducted in a proper manner and that the wishes of the Dáil in voting the Estimates are complied with.</P>
    <P>In addition to the statutory audit, there has also evolved over the years a non-statutory examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of instances where he finds from his statutory audit work that there may have been loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure.  My Department have always held that this was an important function of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Public Accounts Committee have also supported this informal extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's role.</P>
    <P>I think I should at this stage set out the position in relation to economy, efficiency and effectivenes &mdash; the three Es &mdash; which are often used in discussions about the newer forms of auditing.  I prefer to use these terms rather than the term &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; which is widely used here tonight and nowadays and at times I tend to use it myself.  The term &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; of course seems easy to grasp but it is often left undefined so that one is not clear whether at any given time the user is referring to economy or efficiency or effectiveness or to any combination of them.</P>
    <P>Economy is usually taken to mean the acquisition at the lowest cost and at the appropriate time of financial, human and physical resources in appropriate quantity and quality.  Economy relates to inputs and normally refers to obtaining the inputs more cheaply or reducing the amount of wastage.  In order to measure success or good performance in this area, the relative success with which activities are carried out can be compared with plans or with previous performance or with the performance of other bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Efficiency, on the other hand, relates to the ratio of an output of an activity to the resources used to produce that output.  An efficient operation either produces the maximum quantity of output for any given resource inputs, or uses minimum inputs for any given quantity and quality of output.  The efficiency of a public service scheme or operation depends upon how well resources of all kinds &mdash; human, material, equipment, buildings and so on are used to produce the required level and quality of goods and services.  An improvement in efficiency may result in lower costs or increased output or better quality output or a combination of these.  For example, the increase in recent years in the number of recipients of social welfare benefits has not involved a proportionate increase in administrative resources.  At this time of severe constraint in the public finances, it is essential that such improvements be a constant feature of the work of all public service managers so as to reduce taxation and borrowing whilst maintaining and, if possible, enhancing delivery of services to the public.  I referred in my budget speech in January to the fact that the public service must, like all other sectors of the economy, &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo; by continuously raising its standard of performance.  In that context I indicated measures I intend to take to develop greater efficiency and cost consciousness on the part of Departments and managers. This is one area that I feel sure the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and ourselves share a common interest.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is already examining economy and efficiency in Departments and in many public service organisations and it is a question now of building on that work.</P>
    <P>Effectiveness can be defined as the extent to which an operation, activity or programme achieves its objectives.  I will <Col N="744" /> outline at some length later the difficulties involved in assessing effectiveness. It is important to keep in mind that a programme that is effective, that is, one that succeeds in achieving its objectives, need not necessarily be either economic or efficient.  The inputs may have been acquired at excessive cost, or too many inputs may have been used. Similarly, a programme may be economic but may be inefficient or ineffective.  In this case the inputs may have been acquired at low cost and may have been used sparingly, but there may have been little output and objectives may not have been achieved.  These distinctions in definition are important and this is why use of the term &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; glosses over and loses them.</P>
    <P>National auditors nowadays examine economy and efficiency either on a formal statutory basis, as in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, or on an informal non-statutory basis, as is the case here at present.  Auditors in some countries are also empowered by law to examine effectiveness.  These developments have been emerging internationally in the past two decades.  It might be worthwhile at this point if I outline briefly some developments in the newer forms of auditing which have emerged abroad in the past two decades. From the early seventies, the question of national auditors carrying out management or performance audits, that is audits of the economic, efficient or effective use of resources, has been the subject of considerable debate, which has culminated in a broadening of the scope and responsibility of the role of the national auditor in many countries.</P>
    <P>Australia introduced legislation in 1979 which enabled the Auditor General to conduct efficiency audits of departments and other government agencies and to report on them to Parliament.  The number of such audits being carried out runs to about 14 or 15 a year at this stage but the development of these audits does not seem to have been an easy one.  It <Col N="745" /> appears that some of the earlier efficiency audits were too broad in scope, reflected a tendency to focus on policy issues and took far too long.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom and New Zealand legislative approaches are broadly the same in that the Comptroller and Auditors General in both countries examine programme effectiveness as well as economy and efficiency.  The New Zealand legislation was enacted in 1977 and the Comptroller and Auditor General there has not found it easy to get the newer form of auditing off the ground, mainly it seems because of a lack of staff with the appropriate skills and an inadequate development by government departments and agencies of performance measures and standards against which achievements can be judged objectively. The New Zealand Comptroller and Auditor General's audit mandate extends to virtually all the State bodies and to the local authorities.  The number of reports made annually does not yet exceed a half a dozen.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom legislation was enacted in 1983 and the Comptroller and Auditor General in examining economy, efficiency and effectiveness is specifically excluded from questioning &ldquo;the merits of the policy objectives of any department, authority or body&rdquo;.  The United Kingdom legislation excluded the nationalised industries and the local authorities from the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit.  The legislation also provided that the Comptroller and Auditor General would become an officer of the House of Commons.  At this stage the British Comptroller and Auditor General publishes about 40 reports a year.  Up to now the main emphasis of these reports has been on economy and efficiency but it has been reported recently that the Comptroller and Auditor General intends that there will be a big drive in the next few years into effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Canadians are also regarded as being leaders in this field.  Their 1977 legislation provides that the Auditor <Col N="746" /> General should bring to the attention of Parliament cases in which he has observed that money has been spent without due regard to economy and efficiency, and that satisfactory procedures have not been established to measure and report the effectiveness of programmes where such procedures could appropriately and reasonably be implemented.  The latter proviso is the Canadian attempt to confine the Comptroller and Auditor General to the management side of policy or programme effectiveness, and away from the policy side of it, that is to say, it tries to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General looks at management systems for evaluating the effectiveness of programmes rather than have him directly evaluate effectiveness himself.</P>
    <P>The crucial issue when we come to effectiveness is whether, and if so to what extent, a national auditor should become involved in assessing the effectiveness of programmes.  The primary responsibility for doing this rests, of course, with those Departments and bodies responsible for programmes and they should, as part of their management function, have in place the required mechanisms to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of their programmes. There are, however, two areas that can cause concern.  The first is the question of the measurement of effectiveness and the second is the relationship between effectiveness and policy.</P>
    <P>Measuring effectiveness means measuring the degree to which changes in an area or sector affected by a programme are the results of that programme.  If a programme were to consist of a single objective with readily quantifiable results that one could attribute to that programme then measurement would be easy.  In real life in the public sector this is rarely the case.  Objectives may be general; the same programme may have multiple objectives; it may have specific immediate objectives and broader ultimate objectives; results may often be intangible and difficult to pin down; and <Col N="747" /> the programme itself may be only one factor affecting the outcome.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to emphasise is that the measurement of effectiveness is a very difficult problem in the public sector &mdash; particularly in the social areas.  To carry out effectiveness auditing over a wide range of public expenditure would require highly specialised technical knowledge &mdash; knowledge whose truth or reliability might at times be a matter for debate.  It would be foolish to ignore the difficulties involved when considering whether the Comptroller and Auditor General should be formally empowered in future to examine effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The second area of difficulty concerns the link between judgments on effectiveness and judgments on policy.  Policy is a term we can all recognise when we see it but it defies satisfactory definition. The formulation of policy is the responsibility of Government and Ministers are answerable to the Dáil for policy matters in their Departments.  National auditors in most countries would accept that it is not their business to examine policy and that they have no role in this regard.  The problem arises, therefore, not from any wish on the auditor's part to trespass as it were in the policy domain, but rather from the fact that when examining effectiveness in practice it can happen easily enough that questions arise, say, on the merits of the objectives of the programme being examined as well as on the basis, or validity or suitability of that programme.  It can be but a short step from a question of administration to one of policy.  In other words, an auditor when examining whether a programme is achieving its objectives could find himself drawn into considering whether these objectives were reasonable in the first place.  This is getting very close to querying the policy on which the objectives are based.  I need hardly say that if the Comptroller and Auditor General were to become involved in policy this would bring him into partisan political debate <Col N="748" /> and could have the unfortunate effect in the end of adversely affecting his financial-regularity audit.  Nobody wants this to happen and indeed I am glad to note that the PAC have recognised this in their report.</P>
    <P>These are the main areas of difficulty when considering how best to prepare suitable legislation to expand the nature of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  It will be essential to ensure that the general aim of whatever legislation is eventually enacted should be such as to exclude the auditor from policy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of the range of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  At present he audits the accounts of Government Departments and associated offices and agencies, many of the non-commercial state bodies and a small number of the commercial state bodies.  He also audits the accounts of a number of other bodies such as some of the third-level educational institutions. He has access to the books and accounts of bodies receiving grants-in-aid.  He does not audit the accounts of the local authorities, health boards, VECs or other local bodies of that kind.  These fall within the bailiwick of the Local Government Audit Service whose auditors operate under separate legislation governing the establishment and operation of these bodies.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the Comptroller and Auditor General already carries out the annual audit of most of the non-commercial State bodies.  These bodies are mainly funded by the Exchequer but they are not directly accountable at present to the Dáil.  The Government will consider what changes might be desirable in this area.</P>
    <P>When we come to the commercial State bodies, I should point out that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies is already reviewing these bodies and a satisfactory measure of accountability to <Col N="749" /> the Dáil and Seanad is provided under that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The question of audit of local or regional bodies raises a different kind of issue.  There is, as I have mentioned already, a separate public audit service, the Local Government Audit Service, which is responsible, under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, for the audit of such bodies, These bodies include directly-elected local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees, harbour authorities, regional tourism organisations and a number of others.  A distinction can be made between the &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; local authorities, that is, those which are directly elected by the public, and others such as health boards.  This is an issue which the Government will address when formulating their proposals.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of private bodies which receive substantial amounts of money by way of Exchequer grants or grants-in-aid.  The Government will consider the issues involved but we should perhaps be wary of taking on too much too quickly in this area when we look at the experience of other administrations who started the change ten years earlier than us.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the PAC will need to be reconsidered by the Government but clearly this must be done in the context of whatever precise changes are agreed in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of setting out the position as I see it and of listening to the views of members of the House on national audit.  Points made will be taken into full consideration before the Government's proposals are finalised.  It only remains for me to again thank the Committee of Public Accounts, their advisory group and in particular the chairman of the committee, Deputy Gay Mitchell for the hard work they have so obviously put into their report.  I assure the committee, as I did at the outset, that this report and all the issues involved <Col N="750" /> are being seriously considered by me and by my Department and that we will submit our proposals to Government for their consideration as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With my colleagues, I thank the Chair for allowing us to raise this important matter on the Adjournment tonight.  The closure of the Midland Butter and Bacon Company will have a devastating effect on the workers in the factory and on their wives and families. The repercussions of this closure will be felt for many years to come.  The majority of the workers have mortgages, many have cars on hire purchase and many are trying to educate their children in third level education and so on.  They cannot meet their commitments if they lose the weekly wage packet.  The impact of this closure on the town of Tullamore will be great.  At present 2,000 people are signing on each week at the employment exchange there.  This closure will aggravate an already bad situation.  There was a wage bill at this factory of £1.6 million each year.  The loss of this money will be a serious loss to the Tullamore and to the county.  The people cannot accept a loss of this magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The closure of this factory smells.  The workers were told on Friday evening last that the factory was closing.  They were not given any notice.  Cheques were given to workers and today I heard that the cheques had bounced and had been dishonoured.  That is absolutely scandalous. Tonight on television I heard a young man, Mr. Vincent Conlon, outline to the nation how vans returning with money from the sale of produce were intercepted and the moneys taken from the drivers.  In exchange the van drivers were given worthless cheques for their week's work.  The vans were hijacked and the money taken by the firm.  There was an absolute rip off.  I utterly condemn the way the workers and the van drivers have been treated.  The Minister and the Government should ensure that every possible sanction is taken against this company and its directors so that this type of rip off does not recur.</P>
    <P>A close examination of the figures for the Tullamore employment exchange show's the seriousness of the situation.  It has been disclosed that the number of people under 25 years of age out of work in Tullamore has declined while the number over 25 years has increased.  That illustrates the level of emigration from the town.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced 460 new jobs across the country.  Everybody is happy to see new jobs being created but not one of those new jobs will come to Offaly or to the midlands.  A recent report on the midlands published in December last shows that this area has fared worse than any other region with the exception of the Gaeltacht areas in relation to job creation.  Only 750 jobs were created in the midlands while about 5,000 were created in the east and 1,500 in the south east.  We in Offaly have experienced a serious decline in employment.  With the elimination of jobs in Bord na Móna there has been a drop of over 1,000 workers in Offaly in the last few years in <Col N="752" /> that respect alone.  The loss of all these jobs in the firm in question is a major disaster for the county.  When both the Tuam and the Thurles sugar factories were closing major plans were made by the IDA and the Government to provide alternative employment and plans were already in train.  There have been no plans and no provision to provide these jobs in County Offaly.  I call on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the IDA and SFADCo to take immediate action to provide alternative employment in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>Every practical step must be taken to keep this factory open as a going concern. It is important for the workers, their wives and families, for the town of Tullamore and for many farmers throughout the county to provide the raw materials for the products this firm sells.  It is vitally necessary that every effort be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep this factory as a going concern. This should be a priority and I urge the Minister to take action.  Some efforts have been made by Offaly County Council, who set up a task force that submitted a report.</P>
    <P>Offaly deserves to be treated as a priority, and I am afraid the IDA have failed to provide jobs there.  Tullamore is spoken of as a priority town.  If Tullamore is a priority area, why were we not considered when all these jobs were announced?  No provision was made for any new jobs in County Offaly.  Offaly has been left behind.  It is important that the IDA, SFADCo and the Minister for Industry and Commerce immediately take action to provide jobs in County Offaly.  The situation is getting worse and employment is falling day after day.  The only people who have the power to remedy that are the IDA, SFADCo, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government.  It is their duty to provide these jobs.</P>
    <P>I am a representative of the county and it is my job to highlight this issue and to urge the Government to provide these <Col N="753" /> jobs.  As a matter of extreme urgency I call on the Government to ensure that these jobs are provided and that efforts are made to keep that factory in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to thank you for allowing us to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  In relation to this matter, the receiver has been appointed, the employment of the workforce has been terminated with effect from Saturday last and 180 jobs have been lost.  It appears that liabilities exceed assets by an estimated £700,000.  The operations of running the business of Midland Butter and Bacon Company Limited have come to an end.</P>
      <P>I decry the manner in which it seems management failed on Friday last to make itself available to the workforce to inform them of what was about to unfold. I fully agree with the sentiments of the workers who say they have been left high and dry by reason of the fact that cheques seem not to have been honoured.  The allegation that there was a breach of good faith in relation to the failure, as promised, to honour cheques by paying from the cash coming in on the vans on Friday evening is one which would cause particular resentment among any workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, workers who have given long and loyal service deserve to be treated better.  Workers who, on Friday last, faced the prospect of the appointment of a receiver the following day could have reasonably expected that the serious position of the company would have been explained and clarified by outgoing management, despite the difficult circumstances that would entail.  Bearing in mind all of that, including the suddenness and the shock which has been the consequence of the appointment of Mr. John Donnelly as receiver, what has to be grasped now is the commercial reality that faces this private company and the need to salvage as much as possible out of the desperate situation in which the <Col N="754" /> workforce, their families and the local community now find themselves.</P>
    <P>Our first priority is to ensure that the full entitlements due to the workers in this insolvency situation will be speedily dealt with by both the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare.  The corollary of this would be that the receiver would then be in a position to negotiate as quickly as possible with all and any prospective buyers who hopefully will have an interest in starting up operations at the site, be it in the bacon industry or in some related industry, which will give a realistic prospect of long-term employment for as many people as possible.  It is clear that the operational problems the company were experiencing stem from a need to invest substantial sums in the existing plant and machinery and in the infrastructure of the premises itself so that the plant will meet all necessary standards under the relevant legislation which governs food related industries.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that given the interests of large food concerns in the milk quota of Westmeath Co-op, of which the area of Tullamore forms a part, these concerns or others might display an interest in acquiring the premises with a view to setting up an operation which would give employment in the food related sector.  Time is of the essence in all of this.  The receiver has a good track record in selling off enterprises which get into financial difficulty as going concerns when and where that is possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to remarks about the 460 jobs which did not come to Offaly, I understand that what was involved was an increase of jobs in existing industries in those locations.  However, I take the point, and it is one that has been widely held within the county, that the Industrial Development Authority need to focus far greater attention to get the result we need given the fact that we are a county which depends, inordinately highly, on the semi-State sector &mdash; Bord na Móna and the ESB &mdash; which is under rationalisation <Col N="755" /> at present, and we have a small manufacturing industry base compared to other midland counties in the region. There is also the case that many of our major indigenous industries are in traditional sectors which are particularly vulnerable and where competition is very high at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that as a result of discussions with the IDA today certain changes and commitments have been given in that respect.  It is clear that the IDA regard the whole region, and the part of Offaly over which they have control, as being a national priority.  I have received an assurance that a specific team will be set up within the IDA consisting of Mr. Tom Rochford, head of the regional development division, a member of the overseas division, the regional manager and another member within the IDA who deals with native Irish manufacturing industry.  They will have at their disposal the whole network of IDA resources for the purpose of seeking to encourage and entice industry into the area.  I further received a commitment that that team, to be known as the IDA North Offaly team, will liaise with the Offaly enterprise board on a monthly basis to report progress, or a lack of it, to ensure that we see some effort being made to get the type of industry we require.  I received further assurances under the private participation programme, which is envisaged in relation to the building of factories, that whatever problems are arising in relation to a 25,000 square foot factory in Tullamore will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I would like to record my gratitude to you for allowing this very important, albeit short debate, to take place tonight.  The shock announcement of the closure of the Midland Butter and <Col N="756" /> Bacon Company has devastated the town of Tullamore and its surrounding areas. Tullamore is the largest centre of population in the counties of Laois and Offaly and one which has, in recent times, been ravaged by unemployment and emigration. One had only to see the droves of returned emigrants in the town at Christmas to witness the extent of the problem.  Now, with the appointment of a receiver to the Midland Butter and Bacon Company the future is looking particularly bleak for the workforce and their families.  Many of these are young married men with mortgages who are facing a future of extreme hardship and suffering.</P>
      <P>I understand that this company has suffered trading losses with the result that from Friday last the doors were shut without a scintilla of prior notice to the workforce involved.  The debts, I understand, amount to something in the region of £1.5 million and with assets of over £1 million the net loss appears to be less than £750,000.  I am very concerned at the future of this plant and I would hope that every effort is made to secure the premises as a going concern if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 180 workers involved, inclusive of those in part-time employment, but it does not stop there.  Farmers and suppliers are left in severe difficulty and I understand that a number of individual hardpressed farmers have been badly stung, and I would hope that every effort is made to ensure that their losses are kept to an absolute minimum.  I urge the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Labour to use every resource available to them to ensure that the receiver can preserve this company for sale on the open market as a going concern.  If this plant is not to be preserved, then the insolvency fund should be opened without delay to ensure that cheques which were not honoured last week are met and that payment in lieu of notice and holiday payments, as well as the statutory redundancy, are paid without delay.  Otherwise <Col N="757" /> many families in the town of Tullamore will suffer severe hardship.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government designated County Offaly, in line with other western counties to receive increased grant aid for industrial purposes.  Unfortunately, this move has produced very little in terms of dividends.  There is a clear onus on all parties concerned, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, to realise that Offaly is a disaster area ravaged by unemployment.  The loss of 180 jobs in Tullamore is bad enough but if that is added to the 1,200 people who have availed of the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme in Bord na Móna, coupled with increased uncertainty in the ESB regarding the renewal of the peat power contract, we are facing an appalling economic spectacle.</P>
    <P>County Offaly needs to receive special and urgent attention in order to stem the growing crisis.  Male unemployment in Tullamore now runs at over 25 per cent and a recent taskforce highlighted the fact that 1,000 jobs lost in County Offaly equals 20,000 jobs lost in County Dublin. A scenario such as that will not be accepted by people or society and neither will this job crisis in Tullamore.  I urge that every avenue be explored to ensure the continued operation of this plant which is needed for the future survival of Tullamore and north County Offaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to this question on the closure of the Midland Butter and Bacon Factory put down by Deputies Enright, Flanagan and Cowen.  I should like to put the position at Midland in the context of developments in the pigmeat industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1987, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, announced a major programme for the development of this very important industry.  This programme involves a total capital investment by <Col N="758" /> 1992 of some £140 million, including substantial State and EC aid in the slaughtering and processing sectors of the industry. The purpose of the programme is to rationalise and modernise these sectors so as to create an up-to-date and efficient industry comparable to the best in Europe and capable of matching its competitors both at home and abroad.  It also has an ambitious job creation target of some 1,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The development strategy involves the creation of eight central slaughtering and processing plants, up to the highest EC and US veterinary standards, with a minimum slaughtering capacity of 6,000 pigs per week.  The strategy also provides for the establishment of a number of specialised export-orientated processing plants, which it is envisaged, would source their raw material from the central slaughtering units.  The programme is well under way with a number of plants already onstream and some others in the process of construction or at an advanced planning stage.  In fact, since June 1987 my Department have approved of investment projects in pig slaughtering and processing facilities involving a total capital input of about £80 million.  Of this, the IDA have committed £15 million to these investments while EC grant aid of some £40 million has been sought, of which about £15 million has been approved.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint a receiver at the Midland Butter and Bacon Factory is one over which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no control.  As the Deputies said in their contributions, the liabilities exceed the assets and there is no denying there have been difficulties in this plant for some time.  However, having said that, one's sympathy certainly must go to the estimated 180 people who have lost their jobs.  Obviously this was a very valuable industry to the town of Tullamore.  It goes without saying that the loss of an industry in any town is pretty traumatic but we have to realise we are living in difficult financial times where companies who have trading <Col N="759" /> difficulties find it hard to survive.  We must look at the industry as a whole and the need for necessary rationalisation to get it on to a competitive footing.</P>
    <P>We are a very small State in the context of the European Community.  The process of change in the pig industry, whether at primary production level, slaughtering level or processing level, has been slow but there is no doubt that the change which has taken place at primary production level is an example to other sectors in the industry of the sort of change and greater efficiency which can be achieved.  The investment programme which I outlined in my opening remarks, and the generous grants which are available both from the State and Community coffers, will provide the incentive to potential investors and people who have a commitment to the future of the pig industry to make the capital investment which is required.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt this industry demands a lot of capital and the requirements in this regard are very substantial indeed.  Obviously it is an investment which has to be undertaken on a planned <Col N="760" /> basis, having regard to the availability of raw materials and cost competitiveness but I believe there are sufficient people in the industry who will plan, invest and do the right thing to ensure the future of the pig industry in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt also that the hygiene standards which are required to secure export licences to the EC are high.  These demand additional capital investment in the provision of facilities to ensure that the quality of the product being exported from this country is of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of the contributions of the Deputies from the LaoisOffaly constituency here tonight but one must see the difficulties in this case in the context of the rapid changes which are taking place in the pig industry.  One can only hope that the investment plans of those in the industry will be such as to benefit the pig industry generally in the midlands in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 March 1989.</P>

      <P>The Government are aware that there have been several other incidents relating to fishing vessels in which it has been alleged that submarines were involved but these have remained unsubstantiated or involved non-Irish registered vessels outside our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>We understand that in at least one of the cases brought to the attention of the IMO the owners of a damaged fishing vessel have sought compensation and that compensation has been paid.  Claims for compensation in such cases are essentially a civil matter.  A particular problem clearly arises in incidents involving unidentified vessels.  The Government will take whatever action is open to them to assist in the identification of such vessels thus facilitating any action for damages that might be taken.</P>

      <P>It has been a feature of the career break scheme since its inception that, while staff applications for such breaks would be met as far as possible, some applications would have to be refused where the needs of the work so required.  The refusal of the career break in the case referred to in the question was made on this basis and was not related in any way to further restrictions affecting the scheme which were introduced by way of the more recent circular referred to in the question.  The career break was refused having regard to the demands on the services provided by the Land Registry and to severe staff shortages there.  The officer concerned was informed by her authorities when she submitted her application that, in the circumstances, it could not be recommended.  The decision to refuse the application was taken with the sanction of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>(i) The passenger throughput at Dublin Airport in 1988 was 4,418,000.</P>
      <P>(ii) It is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty what passenger throughput at Dublin Airport is likely to be in the year 2000.  However, on the basis of tentative traffic forecasts for the future, passenger throughput at Dublin Airport by the year 2000 could be as high as 10 million passengers per annum.</P>
      <P>(iii) The present annual passenger throughput capacity of Dublin Airport is about 5.5 million.  The passenger capacity of the airport is determined mainly by terminal and related facilities rather than the airside facilities including runways. Even at present traffic levels the existing terminal and related facilities are operating at close to maximum capacity especially at peak traffic periods.  Proposals are being prepared by Aer Rianta to extend terminal facilities at Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the number of farmers who are entitled to have 60 per cent of their original milk gallonage restored to them according to the Council of Agriculture Ministers' interpretation of the Mulder judgment in January 1989; the efforts he is making to have the full quota, less deductions already made on a community basis since 1 April 1984, restored, without restriction to all dairy farmers who opted for the conversion or non-marketing schemes without deducting from existing quota holders; and whether this approach is in the national interest.</P>

      <P>The number of Irish farmers whose non-marketing period expired after the &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; date of 1 October 1983 is about 2,400.  Some of these may <Col N="559" /> however be excluded under the other criteria laid down by the Council of Ministers.  I sought throughout the negotiations leading up to the decision of the Council of Ministers to have quotas for these farmers fixed at as high a percentage as possible of their previous deliveries.  It was because of pressure from me and from one or two colleagues that the figure of 60 per cent was agreed and that the cut-off date was brought back from 1 January 1984 to 1 October 1983.  I do not see any prospect of having either of those decisions changed in the council.  It is, of course, in the national interest to have the milk quotas available to Irish producers increased so long as the corresponding increase throughout the Community is not so high as to put market stability in jeopardy.</P>

There is no particular delay in payment of her 1988 calf premium schemes grant as payments under this scheme commenced on 16 January 1989 and will continue for about another month.  Delay in payment of her 1988 EC suckler cow premium and beef cow schemes grants arose because she failed to present any animals at the first two attempts at inspection under these schemes made by my Department on 26 July 1988 and 4 August 1988 and because some of her cattle identity cards were missing at the third attempt at inspection on 29 November 1988.

Payments on beef cows in mixed enterprise herds which I introduced for the first time under our disadvantaged areas schemes in 1988 seem to have had a positive result and judging by the increases in both the national cow herd and in beef cow numbers between December 1987 and December 1988, I see no need at present to change a successful formula.</P>

Under the Council decision allocations of quota can only take place when all the applications have been examined and processed.  As <Col N="562" /> applicants have up to a date within three months of the publication of the regulation to submit their requests, the provisional quota allocations to eligible producers will not take place for some time yet.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the way in which he can justify the decision not to pay disability benefit to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry who is a diabetic and must inject himself twice daily and is therefore not employable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of invalidity pension since 16 April 1981.  Invalidity pension is payable to persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are regarded as permanently incapable of work.  He was examined by a medical referee on 19 January 1989 who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  As a result a deciding officer decided that the person concerned was not entitled to be paid invalidity pension and notified him of this decision on 27 January 1989 and of his right of appeal.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has appealed this decision and arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 3 April 1989.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of this examination.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 2 February 1989. However, as he was found capable of work by the medical referee who examined him on 19 February 1989, he was not eligible for disability benefit.</P>

She appealed the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 8 December 1988 who also <Col N="569" /> considered her capable of work.

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 17 May 1988 following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed this decision and was examined by a different medical referee on 26 July 1988 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>His case was referred to an appeals officer who held an oral hearing at which the claimant was present.  The appeals officer upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 17 May 1988.  The claimant was informed of this decision which is final and may only be altered in the light of new facts of fresh medical evidence.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was hospitalised from 23 to 30 January 1989 and from 11 to 21 February 1989 and was entitled to disability benefit for these periods. However, as he was paid supplementary welfare allowance by the health board, the disability benefit due was issued to the health board.  In view of the fact that he has been hospitalised for these two periods his case is being referred again to a medical referee.</P>

      <P>The local certificate entry <Col N="570" /> facility provides that certain medical certificates for disability benefit and occupational injury benefit can be entered at local offices on computer connected to the Department's computer systems and cheques can issue to the client from Dublin on the same day.  This development was designed to reduce the interval between submission of certificates and the issue of payments.  Prior to the introduction of this facility all medical certificates had to be posted to Dublin before payment was issued and inevitably some delays arose.</P>
      <P>I launched this project on a pilot basis at the Employment Exchange, Union Quay, Cork in September 1987.  It has been operating successfully there since. In line, generally, with my policy of extending localisation of social welfare services I have since introduced the facility to a number of areas.</P>
      <P>While I am not in a position to extend the facility to Wexford in the immediate future I intend doing so as soon as possible and when additional accommodation is acquired and other preliminaries completed.</P>

      <P>The target date for the first of my Department's staff to transfer to Sligo is the beginning of July 1989 when staff from the Pensions area will take up duty in the new offices.  The remaining functions which will be transferred on a phased basis to Sligo will be drawn from Social Assistance Allowance, Widows' <Col N="571" /> and Orphans' Pension and &ldquo;Free&rdquo; scheme areas.</P>
      <P>Some 150 staff will be involved in the first phase and some 300 staff will be required overall ranging from messenger to principal.  Staff were sought on a voluntary basis from within the Department and volunteers were also sought from other Government Departments.  A chart showing the ultimate numbers required in each grade together with the numbers who volunteered and the shortfall is set out below.</P>
      <P>Under the aegis of the decentralisation scheme the Department of Finance recently announced that promotion competitions will be held to make up the shortfall in promotional grades and my Department is at present making arrangements to hold competitions for this purpose.  The question of making up the shortfall in the case of non-promotion grades, i.e. clerical assistants and messengers, is at present under consideration.</P>

    <P>Claims for tax relief under the sections as extended by section 27 arise for the first time in respect of 1988-89 and statistics are not yet available for that year. However, it is tentatively estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of the reintroduction of these reliefs in terms of tax foregone may eventually reach £9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Note: The figure shown in the table for cost to the Exchequer in each year is confined to the cost of the tax relief which <Col N="574" /> was actually given in the year.  In most cases the full tax relief in respect of total qualifying expenditure is absorbed by way of instalments spread over a number of years.  As regards the number of claims, the total number of claims shown for each year in the second column of the table includes some claims already recorded for the preceding year or years. For example, the figure of 598 for the year 1986-87 includes some claims already recorded for each of the years 1982-83 to 1985-86.</P>

This Programme provides assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) over the period from 1 April 1986 to 25 February 1991.  The list of tourism projects was agreed last year subject to settlement of the details of roads projects for inclusion in the Programme. Following the agreement, it was necessary to obtain details of expenditure to date on the projects by the implementing agencies, so as to prepare claims for payment of ERDF assistance.  This information is being compiled at present and payment claims will be submitted very shortly.  When the ERDF assistance is received, it will be paid to the implementing agencies, including Drogheda Corporation, to enable them to do further work on the listed projects.</P>

The information sought by the Deputy relates to the day to day responsibility of the authority and is not, therefore, a matter in which I have a direct function.  The economic policies now being pursued by the Government will, of course, facilitate the IDA in their continuing promotion of the area for suitable industrial development.</P>

      <P>The school transport service in question provided for a national school which closed in 1975 due to lack of numbers. Accordingly, transport services to the nearest open national school were provided in accordance with the normal terms of the Department's school transport scheme.  The maintenance of this service, as with services throughout the country, is subject to a requirement as to reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there are now only four eligible children using the service, and since the cost of maintaining the service would be excessive, it is not open to me to allow its continuance.  Preliminary notice of terminination was given on 7 December last to the school authorities.  Service will not be given beyond the end of the Easter school term, 1989.
