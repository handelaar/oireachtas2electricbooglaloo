      <P>During the last few days I have sought to raise the issue of proposed legislation in the area of social welfare following from the Hyland judgment in the Supreme Court.  The Taoiseach replied on a number of occasions that no such legislation was promised.  However, may I quote a statement from a representative of the Department of Social Welfare as follows&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I seek your guidance?  Where there is a provision in an Act which obliges the Government to report to the Dáil, and that Act has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, in what manner can we the elected parliamentarians have the Government do what they are obliged to do by law?  I will quote from section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987:</P>
      <P>The Government shall, as soon as may be after the 1st day of January in each year beginning with the year 1989, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>That section was put in as a result of a Fine Gael amendment, which was accepted by the Taoiseach of the day. Since the announcement of Fr. Patrick Ryan's candidacy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Building Societies Bill, 1988: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a general section and states that a building society may have as its objects the undertaking of any of the activities permitted by or under this Bill and shall have as one of its objects the raising of funds for making housing loans. When we come to Part II of the Bill we will take a look at the various new powers which it is proposed to confer on building societies.  There are some matters of concern which the Minister may wish to respond to at this stage.  Can the Minister explain the need to say expressly in section 9 (1) that a building society should have as one of its objectives the raising of funds for making housing loans?  Does this mean that the raising of funds for making housing loans would have a special position in the future given that the newly constituted building societies are going to be something of a legal hybrid?  They are neither going to be mutual nor have the normal shareholding component which a company would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that in broadening the powers and objectives of building societies, which as I have said in the past my party broadly supports, that building societies providing loan finance in other areas and engaged in a variety of other activities, such as building developments, may considerably reduce their involvement in the housing finance area and that housing finance could become a good deal more expensive in that building societies may regard it as <Col N="300" /> more profitable to make moneys available for industrial and other types of loans at a higher interest rate when a higher return can be obtained.  Can the Minister tell us what steps he envisages being taken to ensure that adequate finance will be made available for housing loans following the coming into operation of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, this section refers to the objectives which a building society may have.  Like a company, a building society under this Bill would have to have objectives which determine the extent of its powers.  A society may have as its objective the undertaking of any of the activities referred to by Deputy Shatter but one of its objectives would have to be the raising of funds for making housing loans. That is the important element.  Therefore, a society would be restricted in its objectives to those expressly contemplated in Part III of the Bill but these are of course very wide-ranging.  They are to be contrasted with the comparatively narrow purpose of a building society in the 1976 Act, namely, the raising of funds by subscription from the members and the acceptance of deposits and loans for making loans to members secured by the mortgage of the freehold or leasehold, estate or interest.  This was broadened somewhat in the 1986 Act to admit the making of unsecured loans for bridging and house improvements in accordance with ministerial regulations.</P>
      <P>The continuation of housing loans as a mandatory objective of every society is to ensure that societies continue to fulfil a major role in the provision of mortgage finance for house purchase and to maintain a distinct identity as a financial institution. The short answer to the Deputy's question is yes.  The raising of funds for making housing loans will have to have a special position.  It is the only mandatory objective; all of the other powers are optional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What proportion of the moneys available does the Minister envisage being reserved for housing finance <Col N="301" /> and will there be any flexibility in this area to ensure that the building societies do not overreach themselves, given that they would have other powers under the legislation which would enable them to hold and develop land and get involved in other activities such as conveyancing, auctioneering and so on?  Is the Minister satisfied that the controls included in this legislation will not jeopardise the general availability of housing finance at reasonable interest rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is that no rigid percentage has been included in the Bill but, of course this would be controlled in any event by the Central Bank.  I am satisfied that there is no need to apply a rigid percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying where a building society see greater profitability in the commercial lending sector, rather than in the housing market sector, following the enactment of this Bill it will be possible for that building society, or building societies, to opt out of the house purchase area altogether or to say that only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of its lending will be in that area with the remainder in the industrial and commercial sector?  I want to tease out this matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is no.  There is a mandatory obligation on them to provide mortgage finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>At what percentage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not stated.  There is no rigidity in the legislation as to the level; that would be controlled by the Central Bank.  It works both ways.  They may find that because of the amount of money available in the marketplace they would have surplus funds available and it would give them an opportunity to use them to the best advantage of their members by going elsewhere.  However, should the case arise that there is a shortage for any reason the Central Bank would say that they had to have so much money available for that.  It is a mandatory objective <Col N="302" /> and that is why it is written into the legislation.  If it had not been there would have been no obligation to provide any mortgage finance.  It is the only mandatory objective they have, everything else is optional and can be utilised as they see fit with permission from the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>It is worth mentioning one aspect with regard to the provisions that this section will bring into play, that it must be taken in conjunction with the Second Schedule laying down the content of the memorandum and articles of association to be registered and laying down the rules for the conduct of the society.  One aspect which has recently been drawn to our attention yet again is that under the rules it is provided for the right of a member to demand a poll, the manner in which it will be taken or the right of a member to appoint a proxy. These are important aspects of the conduct of a building society because it is certainly clear to me that the current rules exercised by the building societies for the election and appointment of directors give the strong impression that they are designed, run and utilised to ensure and preserve <i>status quo</i> members on the boards.  We have seen the almost gargantuan task undertaken by a woman, a member of a building society, who tried to break through the whole network of conservatism.  It is clear that major issues have been raised in regard to the method by which notices are issued and votes collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate whether, in the passing of this section, he intends activating the rules laid down in the Second Schedule?  Will he advise, direct or consult the Central Bank about the fairness of these two rules?  Will they be implemented?  Has the Minister given any regard to what seems to be almost the impossible position of a person outside the existing order of directors to break into the board and to muster the number of votes necessary?  At present there seems to be huge obstacles in the way of an ordinary member of the public breaking in and I wonder if the Minister <Col N="303" /> has given any thought to this problem in view of the fact that it is a matter of public concern.</P>

      <P>I am trying to be relevant to a Bill with 120 sections and I should like to see this legislation enacted because it is already a year late.  Many people have been second and third guessing it and I do not intend to try to reinvent the wheel, with all due respects to the experts inside and outside the House, some on the gallery.  This is a fundamental section because it is transferring in a very formal way the role and the powers currently enjoyed by the Department of the Environment in relation to the regulations of building societies to the Central Bank and, consequently, to the Minister for Finance.  What residual role, if any, does the Minister see for the Department of the Environment as a consequence of section 9?  In other words, can the Minister indicate in relation to the objects and general powers of a building society and their regulations now to be governed under this section what manner of intervention or policy formation does he see the Department of the Environment <Col N="304" /> having consequent on this section being enacted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (4), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;of the date of receipt of such other information as it may require&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;within two months of the date of receipt of such other information as it may require&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very small amendment of a technical nature.  This section deals with the formation, registration and incorporation of societies.  Subsection (4) says that when the Central Bank decides to refuse to register a memorandum and rules, it shall, within six months of the date of delivery of the rules and memorandum or of the date of receipt of such further information as it may require, notify the signatories of the memorandum and the rules of its decision and of its reasons for it.  Under this subsection it seems that the Central Bank are obliged, within six months of the date of delivery, to make a decision.  It appears that in the fifth month the Central Bank could raise a query, get further information and, following the date of the receipt of further information, a further six months would apply before they need notify a decision. I suggest that is not necessary and my amendment is merely to the effect that when a decision has to be made when the Central Bank seek additional information, they must make a decision within six months of receipt of the memorandum and rules but that if they seek additional information, for example, in the fifth or sixth month, following receipt of the further information their decision should be communicated within two months.  In other words, it should not take a year for the whole process to evolve.  It is purely a technical measure to facilitate the working of the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider the amendment in the context of Report Stage, if he does not wish to accept it today.  I am anxious to ensure the efficient workings of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the amendment and found great difficulty with it.  If the amendment was accepted it would <Col N="306" /> result in the Central Bank's discretion to deal with applications for registration of new societies being seriously constrained. It would, for example, mean that the Central Bank would have to make a decision within three months of receiving an application if they asked for additional information within a few weeks of receiving the original application.  The amendment would demand that of them.  It would require the Central Bank to give a decision within two months of receiving the additional information.  If one month after an application was received additional information was sought by the Central Bank they would have to give a final decision within two months.  I do not think it is the Deputy's intention to put the Central Bank into the position of having to make a hasty decision about what I would regard as an important matter of whether to register a building society.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (4) strikes a reasonable balance between the needs of the Central Bank as regulator and the rights of a group of people trying to establish a society. It obliges the bank to make a decision within six months of the receipt of the application or, where further information is required, within six months of the date of the receipt of the information.  I am saying that if they seek further information after one month they will have to give a decision within six months and that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Central Bank must be satisfied in respect of a large number of matters before they can register a society and, therefore, one does not want to tie down the Central Bank completely with short time limits which might lead to them having to refuse to register a society which they might be able to register if they have adequate time to deal with the application.  I do not want to put such an imposition on them. The Central Bank is a highly respected institution and can be relied on to give good service and to act in good faith in the matter at all times.  I cannot accept the amendment and I should like to ask the Deputy to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister has misread the amendment.  His reply is clearly based on a misunderstanding. The amendment seeks to delete the words, &ldquo;of the date of receipt of such other information as it may require&rdquo; and to substitute the words, &ldquo;within two months of the date of receipt of such other information as it may require&rdquo;.  The effect of the acceptance of that amendment would be that the section would read: &ldquo;Whenever the Central Bank decides to refuse to register a memorandum and rules it shall, within six months of the date of delivery of the rules and memorandum or within two months of the date of receipt of such other information as it may require, whichever is the later, notify the signatories ...&rdquo; In the course of his response the Minister seems to have lost sight of the fact that the section states that whichever is the later is the time to apply.  The Minister is suggesting that the Central Bank would have to make a decision within two months of receipt of additional information but that is not correct.  The amendment, as drafted, ensures that whichever is the longer time is made available to the Central Bank.  In effect, the six months rule would apply or, if the information was sought in month five or month six, another couple of months would be added on from the date of the receipt of the information.  It is unfortunate the Minister, in his reply, ignored the fact that the words &ldquo;whichever is the later&rdquo; are left in the subsection. Clearly, the Minister responded from the advice he had been given.  I do not wish to delay the House on this issue because of the number of sections we have to deal with but I must point out to the Minister that his response to me was not accurate in the context of my amendment.  I should like to ask him to consider the amendment between now and Report Stage.  I will not press the amendment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>Putting a limit of two months on the Central Bank in any circumstances is unreasonable because it may work against a society seeking registration. Consequently, we might be doing a disfavour to such a society.  The Central Bank from our experience act expeditiously in such matters.  The registering of a new society is a very serious business and the Central Bank will have to investigate many matters before they are satisfied that a society should be permitted to operate in the public market place.  I would not like to place a restriction on them or rush them if they have good reason not to rush the registration of any society.  There is a principle involved and the Central Bank in good faith will do a good job expeditiously for us.</P>

      <P>I should like clarification of one or two matters concerning the section which raises the question of who are to be shareholders.  Apparently, a building society can restrict the issue of shares in its memorandum and rules but surely the position should be that a building society must allow any of its borrowers to become shareholders.  To do so would entail an amendment of subsection (2) and a changing of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I deliberately did not table an amendment to this subsection but I was anxious to draw the Minister's attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> Another question arises in relation to the provision concerning jointly held moneys.  In relation to subsection (6) will the Minister clarify what procedure will apply following the death of a person who has money on joint deposit?  What procedures will apply if the person with the initial name dies?  What notification will be given under subsection (6)?  What will happen, if, for example, one person becomes mentally ill and unable to manage his or her affairs?

In the case of joint holders of shares, it makes provision in respect of which of the joint holders may exercise the rights attaching to the shares or to which of them notices must be sent.  The basic premise of the section is that the rights attached to membership under the Bill, such as the right to vote, etc., are exercisable only by one of the joint holders in order to avoid confusion in the case of a dispute.  This provision has stood since 1976 and has not caused any difficulty. Did the Deputy raise a question on subsection (2)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this amendment as unnecessary for the following reason. The Central Bank already have sufficient powers under the Bill, for example, under section 17 (4), to regulate the branching policies of the societies.  The Deputy will be aware, of course, that the Central Bank in their role as supervisor of the banking system, exercise control over the branching of banks also.  This is done as part and parcel of the licensing system.  In much the same way the Central Bank will have the same power to impose similar requirements on the building societies under section 17 (4), if they see fit to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister, in the context of section 17 (4), that the rationale in having this provision in the Bill is to provide an express duty on building societies to give the Central Bank a formal notification.  I suggest that this provision would run in tandem with what is in the Bill and with the intent of the Bill and would simply ensure that all relevant information is made available to the Central Bank so that they can properly exercise their supervisory function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in putting down this amendment is that some people believe that the expenses incurred by building societies are unnecessarily large and that there has been an element of empire building in the massive growth of offices. It seems to be the case in every corner of the city of Dublin or Cork that if one building society opens every other building society, like lemmings, feel the need to rush in and either rent or acquire premises adjacent to their competitors.  There is a very real argument to suggest that the members and shareholders of building societies have had no real control over the management of building societies over the years with regard to the massive growth of unnecessary sub-offices.  It seems to me that building societies could be a good deal more efficient in the area of administrative and office expenditures <Col N="312" /> if they took a more realistic view of their needs.  Indeed, this requirement has been forced on banks.  Banks were of a similar mentality 20 years ago but a rationalisation has been imposed on the banking community.</P>
    <P>To ensure the continued financial security and viability of our building societies this subsection would have a particular relevancy in focusing their minds on the true necessity of opening as many offices as are being opened and to make the supervisory role of the Central Bank a little bit easier.  I assume we are all anxious to ensure that the Central Bank can truly play that role.  It is no harm if Members use this debate to express some reservations as to the need for all these sub-offices which appear to be opening all over the country at a great rate.  Certainly there is a need for building societies to expand, but one would query at this stage the effectiveness, efficiency and the costs being incurred in opening these offices and in the general running of building societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what the Deputy says may have a certain element of truth in it.  A major expansion programme was undertaken by some societies over the years, but the Deputy will have noticed that in recent times this programme has not escalated.  Perhaps these building societies have reached the climax of their expansion programme so far as the opening up of branches and appointing agencies are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made the case, as I have been saying, that there is need for a strengthening of the supervisory power. That power is now in the hands of the Central Bank and, of course, it also includes the supervision of the branching attitude of societies.  I sympathise with what the Deputy has said but I do not think it is quite as relevant in the context of what has been happening in recent times.  At least the same system will now apply with regard to the supervision of building societies as it does to banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of points on this section which the Minister might <Col N="313" /> be able to clarify for me.  First, there is no clear definition in the interpretation section of what constitutes a premises.  I raise this point for the following reasons. An ATM &mdash; an automatic telling machine &mdash; could for the purposes of the business of a building society constitute a premises. Since building societies are clearly going to get into that business &mdash; indeed they have commissioned a very expensive study in relation to a pooled ATM system &mdash; perhaps it would be useful if a definition of premises was included on Report Stage in the interpretation section.  I suggest this to avoid ambiguity at some future date.  I will come back to the question of ATMs later.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to take me through sections 20 (3) and (4).  Without anticipating section 21, I want to draw to the Minister's attention something which seems to be contradictory.  Section 20 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (b) does not require a society to sell any premises if the society may hold it under section 21 and elects to do so by a resolution of the board of directors.</P>
      <P>In what way does subsection (4) contradict subsection (3) of section 21 which states:</P>
      <P>A society shall dispose of land held under this section ...?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers to land rather than premises but premises may constitute land as well. I am trying to tighten up that interpretation. This provision should be looked at from the point of view of clarification because without a clear legal definition in the Bill of what constitutes &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, at some date in the future the banks could say to building societies that they had far too wide a range of physical holdings and far too large a number of properties.  This is not a substantial point.  I am simply drawing the Minister's attention to something which has raised much comment in the past, that is the large number of premises owned by building societies and the way in which they are open to interpretation under section 20(3)(b).  Therefore, on <Col N="314" /> Report Stage, it might be no harm to have a definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; incorporated in the definitions section.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question, again by way of clarification?  This section begins:</P>
      <P>1.  Subject to section 36, a building society may acquire, hold, dispose of, and develop or participate in developing land where the land is to be used ....</P>
      <P>As we have just heard &ldquo;land&rdquo; also includes &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, or &ldquo;premises&rdquo; includes &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  I believe that the building societies should concentrate on the provision of residential housing rather than compete with the banking institutions here.  I would be anxious to ensure that the interpretation of the word &ldquo;participate&rdquo; be a comprehensive one that would enable them to take and retain a long-term interest, either by way of shared equity in residential property with individual property owners, groups, cooperatives, or whoever, right across the whole range of the different types of housing ownership.  I want the record to show that the word &ldquo;participate&rdquo;, in its fullest sense, will enable building societies to do this.  They have argued in the past that previous legislation precluded them from so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, if that helps the record, to show what is the interpretation of &ldquo;participate&rdquo;.  As the <Col N="316" /> Deputy quite rightly said, at present building societies cannot do that.  The provisions of this Bill are intended to allow them do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of teasing out this section would I be correct in saying that, under the provisions of this section, building societies can involve themselves, as societies, in any type of commercial or residential development, that it will be open to building societies to develop large housing estates if they so wish and that it will also be open to them to build major commercial properties?</P>
      <P>Again, for the record of the House, could the Minister set out what procedures will apply in the following context. Let us assume that a building society &mdash; as the provisions of section 36 of the Bill allow them &mdash; engage in a major commercial development and then acquires a major site in the city of Dublin and decides they are going to develop that site themselves.  The building society may then get into the business directly, using their estate agency powers, of selling off parts of the building or indeed renting them out.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify for me: if a building society intends to make a very large financial investment of that nature, what sanctions, if any, will be required?  Is it sufficient that the objects of the building society's memorandum and articles of association merely set out that this is part of the functions in which they can engage?  What clearances, if any, will be required from the Central Bank or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might revert to Deputy Quinn's question about the land.  It is defined in the Interpretation Act, 1937, and includes, to quote paragraph 14 of the Schedule:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes messuages, tenements, and hereditaments, houses and buildings, if any tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; does include any buildings and all works situated on it. <Col N="317" /> That might satisfy the Deputy's point raised on the previous section.</P>
    <P>In reply to the point the Deputy raised about section 21(1), I should say the short answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, under certain conditions, of course, because that subsection confers the general power on building societies to acquire, hold, dispose of, and develop land for residential and commercial purposes.  Of course it would all be under the strict control of the supervisory authority of the Central Bank.  In all the circumstances they would have to maintain prudential ratios that would have been laid down by the Central Bank, but the Deputy's interpretation is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of unhappy experiences in other countries is the Minister quite satisfied that, when financial institutions have been given powers that have allowed them to involve themselves in areas of activity in respect of which they may have believed they had an expertise which it subsequentally transpired they had not, the controls in place will ensure that a building society will not engage in a major commercial or industrial building venture that could undermine the financial stability of that society?  Is he satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will ensure that the Central Bank's supervisory role will guarantee that it will get all advance information of such activities to ensure that it is satisfied that they will not pose any threat to the financial viability of the society?  Or is the supervisory role merely one which will allow building societies an autonomy to get on with whatever their objectives allow them and leave the Central Bank in a position of trying to pick up the pieces if a disaster occurs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers referred to are subject to the provisions of section 36, which requires a building society to formally adopt the power by special resolution. Section 36 is a most important section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Yes, but it is necessary to ensure the kind of control and safeguards to which Deputy Shatter refers.  It might be cumbersome but it maintains the stability and solvency of building societies. Of course, the provisions of section 36 require a building society to formally adopt the power, by special resolution, and to secure the approval of the Central Bank, a very important element as well, and to exercise those powers in accordance with the requirements and conditions imposed by the Central Bank. That is the critical provision the House wishes to see implanted in this Bill.  There will be that very tight control ensuring that anything done will be done to benefit the building society's members, shareholders and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will eventually come to section 36, which has 14 subsections. It constitutes the gear box of this provision in relation to how the powers will be exercised under section 21.  Therefore I will withhold my questions in relation to the manner in which the provisions of section 36 will be exercised until we reach that section.  However, I want the House to note that it is inter-connected with section 21 because the opening clause of section 21(1) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to section 36, a building society may acquire, hold, dispose of, and develop or participate in developing land where the land is to be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and so on.  But if section 36 is so construed and interpreted, it may very well seriously curtail the flexibility or recklessness with which a building society may function.  I want to give the Minister notice, when we reach section 36, that I will be raising questions relative to section 21 because they are inter-connected. As I read it in plain English &mdash; and I am not a professional lawyer &mdash; subsection (3) of section 21 seems to contradict subsection (4) of section 20. Subsection (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A society shall dispose of land held <Col N="319" /> under this section if the Central Bank so directs.</P>
    <P>We have now passed section 20 (4) which states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (b) does not require a society to sell any premises if the society may hold it under section 21 and elects to do so by a resolution of the board of directors.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to whether that is a contradiction in terms or is a catch-22 situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Subsection (3) to which the Deputy refers allows the Central Bank to direct a society to dispose of land it has acquired and is holding under that particular section.  We regard it as prudential power to ensure that the society does not over extend itself, particularly in a high risk area, or does not proceed with an overly risky development just because it has acquired the land.  The Central Bank would then have the prudential regulatory authority to seek the disposal of that land.  It is a prudential power that should be left there in case something happens in a risky situation that they would wish to attend to.  Does that satisfy the Deputy?</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 24, lines 19 to 22, to delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>Section 22 deals generally with housing loans available to members.  I find subsection (4) quite extraordinary.  I am not sure why subsection (4) is contained in sections 22.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A society shall not make a loan under this section on the security of any <Col N="320" /> freehold or leasehold estate or interest which is subject to a prior mortgage unless the prior mortgage is in favour of the society.</P>
    <P>To take the point that it is expected that this Bill is designed to allow societies to compete, generally speaking, in the financial markets in a position of equality with banks I find it very difficult to understand why this subsection is in the legislation. I could understand why it was included in previous building society Acts when we were dealing with a different philosophy and a different era.  If, say, one has a loan from another financial institution for a house valued at, say, £50,000, the loan amounts to £10,000 and the building society wish to make available a further loan of £10,000, I do not see any particular reason why the building society should not be able to advance a second loan, or why they should not be able to provide a subsequent mortgage to a prior one.  It makes even less sense when one looks at section 23.</P>
    <P>Under section 23, generally speaking, a building society can provide unsecured loans simpliciter.  Presumably the building society will check the financial reliability of the person seeking the loan but, generally speaking, section 23 contains a number of subsections, particularly subsection (1) (e) and (f) which allow the building societies to provide a series of unsecured loans.  If we take the man whose house is worth £50,000 and the £10,000 mortgage to the Bank of Ireland, for argument sake, and if he comes along to the building society and says he wants an unsecured loan of £10,000, for a variety of reasons &mdash; he can even run up an overdraft facility with the building society &mdash; the building society can provide that loan.  There is no security, they are relying on the promise to repay and on the financial reliability of the individual concerned.  It totally escapes me why the building society should not be allowed to provide a second mortgage to ensure the security of that loan.  It seems to me it is contrary to the interests of the members of the society if the society is not allowed to do so.  It <Col N="321" /> seems to put building societies in a different position from banks in this area where a bank will be allowed to get such security.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that subsection (4) of section 22 is merely in the Bill because a similar provision was in earlier legislation which dealt with a concept of a building society different from the new concept that will come into play following the enactment of this legislation.  I would ask the Minister to agree to the proposed amendment.  It seems to me that subsection (4) should be deleted.  I do not think it is of assistance to borrowers, to the building society or to members of the society.  It does not seem to fulfil any particular function that is of advantage in allowing building societies to compete for a position of equality and to provide loans with necessary security where such security should be obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 contains the power for building societies to continue their traditional lending activity, that is, making loans for house purchase fully secured by the first mortgage.  This activity must remain an object of every society and is differentiated from other forms of lending which are provided for in section 23.  That section contains the power in subsection (1) (a) for societies to make loans secure on second mortgages. Subsection (4) of section 22, which the amendment seeks to delete, does not prevent the society from making loans on second or subsequent mortgages regardless of whether the society holds the first mortgage.  I was hoping that that would enable the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.  Section 23 releases the building societies to make second mortgages. I think that is what the Deputy would require us to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In one section we are saying that the building societies cannot make loans on second mortgages and in the following section we are saying they can.  It seems to me that the whole thing is completely contradictory and makes no sense because, with due respects, section 23 (1) (a) simply refers to loans fully <Col N="322" /> secured by the mortgage of freehold or leasehold estate or interest and paragraph (b) refers to loans to members, before the mortgage has been created.  It would seem to me that the only reasonable interpretation of sections 22 and 23, when taken together, is that subsection (4) will rule in the sense that a building society will have a legal difficulty in making loans subject to second mortgages. If the intention is to allow building societies to make loans subject to second mortgages it would seem that the only sensible approach is simply to delete subsection (4).  I fail to understand the rationale behind including subsection (4).  If your intent is to allow building societies to make loans subject to second mortgages it would seem that it is a totally contradictory subsection.  It is included on the basis that a similar subsection was in a similar provision in an earlier building societies Act which sought to allow building societies make funding available only for the acquisition of homes.  The building societies were not seen as financial institutions that should be providing funds for other purposes.  Consequently, the kind of provision contained in subsection (4) made complete sense in previous legislation.  It makes no sense in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying reason for all this is that housing loans have a special status as distinct from other loans.  The reason a distinction has been drawn between housing and other loans relates essentially to the fact that they are different in nature, are subject to different requirements and will probably be treated differently by the Central Bank for their prudential purposes.  What we are talking about here is the status of a housing loan as distinct from the status of loans for other purposes.  That is the reason we do not see any difficulty with the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate where, in legislation relating to banks, there is a similar provision?  With due respect, may I suggest that the response the Minister is giving on this subsection <Col N="323" /> is the classical example of how, when on occasions Opposition Deputies come up with something that should not in any way be contentious and is designed to improve legislation, a Minister has to dig deep into his brain to try to discover some vaguely understandable reason for a particular amendment not being accepted. It would seem to me that there is no reason this amendment should not be accepted.  At the very minimum the Minister should consider tabling a similar amendment in his name for Report Stage, that is, if he feels that it casts any aspersions on him to accept an amendment in my name.</P>
      <P>It is my contention that this subsection adds absolutely nothing to the role that building societies will play in the house market.  It is utter nonsense to say that it does.  Section 22 is only a discretionary section anyway, which says that building societies &ldquo;may&rdquo; make money available for housing finance.  It does not say that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I do not see how subsection (4) adds one whit to the capacity of building societies, or anything to guarantee to the person who wants to raise the loan that money will be made available.  It is a simple banking matter, whether the members of the society are entitled to have their society seek security on a loan raised by way of a second mortgage.  With all due respect, unless membership of this House for so many years has so dulled my brain that I can no longer understand ordinary English, the Minister has not said anything to me that is understandable as to why he cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) states that a loan under this section must be secured by a first mortgage.  It may not be made on the security of an estate which has already provided security for another mortgage unless the mortgage is in favour of the society.  This is essentially a prudential requirement to ensure that there is no change in the standard of security <Col N="324" /> for housing loans.  Societies may, under section 23, make loans on the security of a second mortgage but such loans would be treated differently by the Central Bank in their prudential supervision of societies.  The first mortgage is a different category of security.  This refers only to loans made under this section.  I do not see why it causes the Deputy that difficulty.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 11 is to increase the size of the loan which a society can make for the payment of a deposit for the purchase of a property which is intended to be mortgaged by the society.  Under section 23 (1) (d), the size of such loan is limited to 10 per cent of the purchase price.  This amendment will allow the loan to be made up to 15 per cent.  It will permit the Central Bank to vary it by regulation if they see fit at any time in the future.  Whilst the vast majority of private treaty and public auction sales are now transacted on the basis of a 10 per cent deposit, I am informed that higher deposits may be required in some instances.  In order not to create unnecessary difficulties, it makes sense to increase the limit provided for in this subsection to 15 per cent and to give the bank the flexibility to change the practice if experience demands it in the future.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Central Bank may <Col N="326" /> determine from time to time the interest rate applicable to loans made under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in so far as such rate may exceed the interest rate applicable to housing loans made by a building society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is, on occasion, a difficulty in effecting completion of purchases of properties and when someone raises an issue of finance as is provided for in this section, it is important to ensure that the interest rates that can be applied as referred to in section 23 may from time to time be determined by the Central Bank in so far as those rates exceed the interest rates applicable to housing loans. This amendment deals with loans made under paragraph (b) of subsection (1). These are loans to members before the mortgage has been created, not exceeding the amount that the society have agreed to lend by way of a housing loan.</P>
    <P>In a sense this is allowing building societies to provide what is commonly known as bridging finance.  In the old days bridging finance was a different operation altogether; it was something you might have got from your bank until your building society had ensured that all the title documents were in order, then you got your building society loan through, you paid off your money to the bank and your building society loan then operated.  The interest rate you were paying on your building society loan would normally be less than the interest you would be paying to a bank on bridging.</P>
    <P>In years gone by complaints were made on occasions that building societies had unduly delayed making loan finance available.  On occasions the building society administratively may not have been all that efficient.  On occasions lawyers acting for building societies have not been all that efficient and unnecessary delays have occurred in processing the legal paperwork.  Indeed, the delays may very often have been through no fault of the proposed borrower or his lawyer.  The building society lawyer may have had a whole series of legal titles of property to look at in checking the position.  There <Col N="327" /> are certain changes now in the procedures dealing with title and in bringing to a finality the legal process.  So nowadays matters should be somewhat speeded up. Nevertheless delays occur and some of them can be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>If building societies are in a sense to be allowed to provide two types of finance, bridging finance and ultimately the housing loan, and if the rate of interest payable on bridging finance is higher than the rate of interest payable on a housing loan, on occasions house purchasers may be stuck on paying higher interest rates by way of bridging to the building society from whom they are getting the ultimate loan.  Indeed, that could be in the interest of the building society.  They could in effect benefit from their own inefficiencies either at administrative level or legal level.  There is a need to ensure that the rate of interest building societies can charge on bridging loans should be clearly supervised and the Central Bank should play a role in this.  Hence I have tabled an amendment to insert a new subsection (4) in section 23 to provide that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Central Bank may determine from time to time the interest rate applicable to loans made under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in so far as such rate may exceed the interest rate applicable to housing loans made by a building society.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would give the Central Bank the power to determine the rate of interest payable on bridging loans from building societies where the rate of such loans from the societies exceeded the general building society mortgage rate.  That is what the Deputy wants.  I do not really believe he has given this amendment full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks have been the main, almost the only, providers of bridging finance over the years and I am not aware of the Deputy or anybody else suggesting that bridging loan interest rates be controlled, yet the prospect of building societies getting into this in future prompts him to <Col N="328" /> seek controls over the rates.  I do not understand that type of discriminatory thinking.  Interest rates in general are determined by market forces in our economy and different rates are charged for different purposes depending on such matters as the cost of money, the risk involved and so forth.  Why should one segment of lending be controlled as suggested? Surely building societies in the context of the competitive environment in which they operate should be allowed to make their own commercial decisions and the State should not make those decisions for them.  It should also be noted that bridging loans are by definition unsecured, and it is somewhat naïve to say, as this amendment implies, that the rate should be the same as that for fully secured mortgage lending.</P>
    <P>The final point is that the result of the type of control on rates suggested here would be that societies would not accept the bridging facilities at all.  We cannot discriminate against the building societies in this area.  It comes down to this that if I were even to consider accepting Deputy Shatter's amendment, and that is not the case, there would be no building society bridging finance at all.  It would not exist. There is no similar amendment in so far as banks are concerned.  If there had been or if it was intended by the Deputy's party to bring in this new restriction, why had they or their spokesman not an amendment down on the Central Bank Bill to do the very same thing as far as the banks are concerned?  I cannot accept this amendment.  I do not think its promoters are pushing it.</P>

      <P>My understanding of this complex Bill is that it purports and proposes to remove the restriction whereby under the present arrangements building societies are prohibited from advancing mortgages until the efficient, or otherwise inefficient, legal process has been completed and the need for bridging finance and bridging loans which was characteristic four or five years ago will no longer apply.  My interpretation, for example, of section 23 (1) (b) is that the building society can grant the full amount <Col N="329" /> of money to enable somebody to purchase a house, enter into it and occupy it pending the completion of any documentation that might be needed and that there might be, for reasons stated by the Minister, some variation in the rate of interest for the first two to three months which would then transfer the loan into a mortgage.

      <P>I know, but this settles it finally one way or another.  The thrust of Deputy Shatter's amendment is that he wants the rates controlled for unsecured lending.  That would be certainly at variance with the situation that exists in the banking world.  It would simply discriminate against the building societies. Therefore, I have to ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;work within a certain time because they are a bit overstretched, they will give me the money now but they will charge me an interest rate 1, 2, or 3 per cent higher than the rate on the house loan.  You are dealing with a consumer, a borrower who is depending on the society and who believes they are going to treat him fairly and efficiently.  The lawyer representing him might also be the lawyer acting for the building society, and one of the problems with this Bill is an interlinkage here which is going to create difficulties that are not necessarily apparent when you are dealing with just an individual section.  Let us assume, using the <Col N="330" /> powers of this Bill, that a borrower has employed the building society's lawyer to do his conveyancing work, that the building society's lawyer has not been able to get round to sorting out the legal end of these things and so they make available finance, called &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; for want of a better word, as we know it today though it is a different idea of bridging from what we had in the past.  In the past bridging was normally provided by a financial institution different from the one providing the loan.  When that happens, normally the people providing the loan have a vested interest in processing their end of it quickly because they will gain no interest and no moneys will be coming in to them until the work has been completed and the loan made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a completely different animal.  Here the building society who are providing the loan are also providing the same amount of finance but calling it &ldquo;bridging&rdquo; and charging a higher rate. The borrower is being represented by a solicitor who is acting for the building society and who is up to his neck in work and does not regard it as priority that this borrower has his house purchase processed. Maybe there is a minor defect in the legal title.  This guy is employed by the building society; he is the building society's solicitor and there is no great incentive for him to spend half an afternoon working on a technical problem on a legal title when maybe he could process three or four other simpler conveyances through his office.  Therefore, the borrower is left four, five, six or seven months on bridging, paying a higher interest rate, until the building society's solicitor gets around to completing the work.  Then the borrower is told, &ldquo;you can now pay us a lower interest rate&rdquo;. He has no different sum of money.  The money he has borrowed remains the same from day one.  The delay has not occurred due to his fault.  It might occur because the building society's solicitor is inefficient or overworked or because the administrative machinery within the building society is cranked along slowly in processing it from bridging operation to full loan.  In those circumstances this <Col N="331" /> Bill provides no protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister was arguing a few moments ago the need for the special provision in section 22 (4) and I was arguing that this put building societies in a different position from other financial institutions.  The Minister did not accept the amendment.  He is now saying, however, that if this is put in place it will put building societies in a different position from other financial institutions. That is not the case.  We have a different type of operation from the norm, an operation whereby the society who will provide the loan will provide the bridging. There is need for some protection for the borrower, who will be powerless in dealing with a society and may not even have his own independent lawyer to ensure that his rights are fully protected.</P>
    <P>Possibly the amendment I have tabled is not the most appropriate for dealing with this problem, but the problem needs to be confronted before the Bill goes through Report Stage.  There should be some provision, a time limit or some curtailment on the level of interest that can be charged.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that this borrower has been on bridging for six months while the legal processes have been going on.  He has been living in the house and he has the advantage of the sum of money.  The legal process continues, the mortgage document is complete and the building society have their full security.  If they wanted to be efficient, perhaps the building society could have had their full security within a week of receiving all the legal documentation.  In those circumstances there is an argument that no higher interest rate should be recoverable to the building society for the period during which they provided bridging and that if higher charges were levied on the borrower during that period he should be credited for the difference between the ordinary home loan rate and the bridging rate.  The building society ultimately have their security.  It involves the same sum of money, the same borrower living in <Col N="332" /> the same house.  There is no valid reason for not giving a credit for the sum of interest paid over and above the normal house loan rate.  At the very least, there is no valid reason for not setting a time limit imposing a duty on the building society to have the legal work complete within two or three months of the documentation being furnished and to make the loan available.  Alternatively they should furnish a document to the borrower setting out clearly the reasons for any delay and what the problems are.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to tease out this problem.  It derives from the fact that we are allowing societies not simply to provide bridging and the ultimate house finance loan but also to do something which we are not allowing banks to do, namely to use their own lawyers to carry out conveyancing on behalf of the borrower to whom they are lending money.</P>

We in the Labour Party regard this legislation as having been delayed for over a year.  It contains enormously important and fundamental safeguards and guarantees for consumers and depositors and will protect the operations of building societies from external predators who are hovering around this market.  If a general election is called within the next two weeks this legislation will lapse and it will be a year or longer before it is brought forward again.

We had a two-hour Committee Stage debate the last day. Perhaps it was three hours in total.  The fact that the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats have not had the wit to table a single amendment will not curtail me as a legislator, acting on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, in teasing out the implications of this Bill for the consumer, the members of building societies and the financial institutions and their workings.</P>

That is not my view or my function in this House.  There are a variety of further issues to be discussed which are of importance.  We have already discussed a number of earlier issues of importance and it is noteworthy that in respect of one important issue the entire Labour Party absented themselves for a vote.  We take this job seriously and Deputies with the experience of Deputy Quinn should accept that we have a role to play in the context of processing this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 13. Deputy Shatter is not taking any notice of the competition that exists among financial institutions in providing finance for mortgages.  A whole range of options are available to those seeking mortgages. He is not taking any cognisance of subsection (3) which provides that the society will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the mortgage is created as soon as may be after the making of the loan under the said mortgage.  That subsection imposes a duty on the society to expedite the procedure when the borrower is on bridging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to reduce further the period during which any borrower would be paying at the higher rate. The building societies will say that it is in the best interests to have the loan secured as quickly as possible.  I want to get bridging loan finance available through the building societies on the same terms and without restrictions.  I am asking the Deputy to withdraw his amendment or put it to the vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered if the Minister would refer to subsection (3) as a basis for justifying the position.  It is a legislative declaration on the problem which does and possibly will exist.  We seek to include in a section a pious legislative declaration that building societies shall move as quickly as possible in this area.  All kinds of problems can arise on title in settling a conveyancing transaction. In regard to Deputy Shatter's suggestion, who polices the subsection in question and who will be able to decide <Col N="335" /> when all reasonable steps are not being taken, there is merit in what he is trying to do by way of his amendment No. 13 because when similar legislation was provided in Great Britain it became apparent that there was potential for abuse.  People who have not been involved with a building society have no alternative available to them but to play the market.  I would be concerned that a person would be disadvantaged by being left unduly long on a premortgage loan from the building society.</P>
      <P>I support what Deputy Shatter said. Perhaps this is something the Minister should look at again and if, as has been indicated, simply giving the Central Bank control in certain instances is not the most satisfactory way of dealing with it, then perhaps the Minister should look at this matter before Report Stage to see if we can come up with an alternative suggestion. Subsection (3) will not help the situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (1) (b), lines 28 to 33, to delete from and including &ldquo;, unless a tiered rate&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;Central Bank&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of the Bill makes provision for the charging of tiered interest rates by building societies.  I am not raising any objection to the charging of tiered interest rates other than in the context of housing loans.</P>
      <P>There seems to be no rational basis for introducing this provision.  It also seems that because of the other roles building societies are given there is no basis for providing for tiered interest rates &mdash; and I want to emphasise that building societies are not just placed in a position of equality with banks but in some areas are put in a special position and allowed to play roles that the banks are not playing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, some building societies tried to retrospectively apply tiered interest rates to home loans and they tried to apply them to borrowers who had never been informed that there was any possibility that tiered interest rates would so apply.  The 1986 Building Societies' Act prohibited building societies charging tiered interest rates to previous borrowers and prohibited the creation of new tiered interest rate loans.  In section 24 the Minister is conferring power on a building society to again charge tiered <Col N="338" /> interest rates.  In his original press release dealing with this issue when the Bill was published the Minister suggested that if tiered interest rates were charged it would mean that borrowers of large sums of money, £60,000 to £70,000, would be charged higher interest rates than people borrowing between £20,000 and £35,000. The Minister moved away from that argument on Second Stage and briefly touched on the provisions of the Bill regarding tiered interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister sees the central role of building societies as providing house loan finance, and all the other powers are adjacent and additional.  I believe the charging of tiered interest rates poses a threat to mortgage finance and could result in borrowers having to pay unnecessarily high interest rates on housing loans, and could require the smaller borrower to pay a higher interest rate than the borrower of a larger sum.  The first time house buyer who wants to borrow £25,000 or £30,000 from a building society may have no track record in the payment of mortgages or repaying loan finance.  Because of that he may be seen by a building society as a higher risk than someone who has already established a track record and possibly borrowed £20,000 or £30,000 for his first home and is now into the £50,000 or £60,000 borrowing stakes.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this legislation to ensure that only those who borrow very large sums from building societies for the purpose of house purchase will be charged higher interest rates under a tiered interest rate system.  There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that what the Minister suggested in his original press release will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>There are no protections in the Bill for the house purchaser borrowing between £20,000 and £35,000 against tiered interest rates, and in the city of Dublin one buys a relatively modest house with borrowings of £20,000 to £25,000.  There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that it will not be the borrower in that bracket who will pay the higher interest rate rather than the borrower in the higher bracket.</P>
    <P>We all know the way banks work.  If <Col N="339" /> one has a triple A credit rating one may get a concessionary interest rate as opposed to someone who for example, has not, been involved in business for many years and who never got such a rating from the banks.</P>
    <P>So, there is an inherent danger in all this.  First, I see no public demand for the provision of tiered interest rates.  I have never in all my years in public life had a single member of the general public coming to me and asking that powers be provided for building societies to charge tiered interest rates on housing finance.  I see no merit in providing for it.  The only demand for it is from some building societies, and we have a job to ensure that housing loan finance is made available at reasonable interest rates and that those interest rates are kept as low as possible within the type of market economy in which we operate.</P>
    <P>I am mystified as to why the Minister feels there is a need to provide for tiered interest rates and how the Minister thinks the provisions contained in this Bill will ensure that it is only those who borrow large sums who will pay interest at the higher rate.  I invite the Minister to point to a specific section or subsection in the Bill which so provides.</P>
    <P>I am worried about this for other reasons, and this is where we head into the new powers that building societies have.  Building societies are going to be allowed to build housing estates, to act as estate agents and as lawyers.  Let us take the simple question of building societies building housing estates.  If a building society build a major housing estate of hundreds of houses in a suburb in Dublin they would want to sell those houses and provide loans on a tiered interest rate system.  With that system, if you buy a building society house you pay a lower interest rate than if you buy a house built by a different developer.  Is there any protection in the Bill to ensure that will not happen?  I would ask the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    <P>In the context of commercial loans might it not be the case that the building society would provide housing loans at a <Col N="340" /> lower rate to those to whom they have provided a large commercial loan?  The tiered interest rate system may work in such a way that you get a concessionary housing loan if you have done business with the society in a commercial area but a higher interest rate is payable on housing loans to everyone else.  I do not see the demand for the provision of a tiered interest rate system for building societies.  The previous Government banned the creation of tiered interest rates on housing loans by building societies. Deputy John Boland, the Fine Gael Minister at the time who dealt with this matter, prevented building societies from providing for tiered interest rates for exising or future housing loans.  I see no reason the house purchaser should be required to pay a higher rate than is desirable and I see no means of ensuring that if you provide tiered interest rates it would only be the large borrower who would be, in a sense, penalised and required to pay a higher sum.</P>
    <P>I formally propose amendment No. 17 which states: &ldquo;In page 25, subsection (1) (b), lines 28 to 33, to delete from and including &ldquo;, unless a tiered rate&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;Central Bank&rdquo;.&rdquo; I formally propose amendment No. 18 which states:</P>
    <P>In page 26, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  If a member of a society to whom a housing loan has been made is charged by the society a tiered interest rate in contravention of this section the following provisions shall apply, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the member shall not be in breach of the terms of his mortgage if he does not pay to the society the amount by which any payment due on foot of the tiered interest rate exceeds any amount due on foot of the lowest rate of interest applicable at that time to loans made by the society to members generally and the society shall not, by reason only of such failure to pay, be entitled to exercise any remedy against the <Col N="341" /> mortgagor which is otherwise conferred on it by the law, and (b) the member shall be entitled to recover from the society any such excess paid by him as a single contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>These amendments tabled by Fine Gael would effectively prohibit the creation of new tiered interest rates.</P>
    <P>This provision is seen as another assault by the Government on the borrower and the house purchaser.  The Government have already reduced the tax allowance on mortgage interest rates from 90 per cent to 80 per cent.  The Minister is now presiding over a situation where mortgage interest rates are being increased by 1 per cent and are likely to increase even more.  At the same time he is allowing building societies to create a tiered interest rate system which may directly impinge not simply on the large borrower but on the first time house buyer.  I would warn the Minister to tread very carefully in this area.  Recent statements made by him in this House on the housing area generally indicate that the Government have in mind to further reduce in the next budget the mortgage interest rate allowance made available to house purchasers.  I would invite the Minister to tell the House that, if this Government are still in office next February, they will not further reduce the interest rate allowance available to home owners on mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly signalled in this House implicitly in comments he made some weeks ago that the Government are now intent on a further attack on the mortgage interest rate allowance. It is my prediction that, if they are still in office at the next budget, they will reduce the mortgage interest rate allowance from 80 per cent to in the region of 60 per cent.  With inflation now rising, interest rates increasing and with the Minister trying, by legislation, to create tiered interest rates, the approach by the Government is a direct attack on home ownership and on those who have arranged their financial affairs in such a way that they rely on the fact that they <Col N="342" /> have certain legislative protections and tax allowances to allow them meet their mortgage repayments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be seen to be confrontational in responding to the last few remarks of Deputy Shatter.  We are not here to discuss what might or might not be elements of a future budget statement by a Minister for Finance.  If the Deputy thinks his amendment, as it is framed to deal with tiered interest rates, will deal with the question of mortgage interest relief or with what mortgage rates might be in 12 months time, it really is a joke.  The amendments that are down provide effectively for the re-enactment of sections 4 and 5 of the 1986 Act under which the charging of tiered rates by building societies is banned.  I can appreciate that Deputies might have a genuine concern in this matter and hold strong views on the whole question of tiered rates but circumstances have changed so much since the 1986 Act that I could not justify the continuation of the absolute ban in respect of future loans for reasons on which I went into detail in my Second Stage speech.  The whole mortgage market has changed dramatically since 1986 and that at least was recognised by everybody on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a wide choice of housing finance sources offering mortgages on very competitive terms.  Any prospective house purchaser can now shop around and they do so.  There are institutions which suggest how people can shop around for the best mortgage to suit their own particular needs and circumstances. It is a whole new ball game in so far as house mortgage finance, its availability and the options available to mortgage seekers are concerned.  I do not think it is appropriate, in an economy where interest rates are determined by market forces, to interfere with the setting of interest rates in one sector of the economy and by one type of institution.  It is also discriminatory in that it does not apply to the banks.  There has been much talk about making the same provisions for building societies as for banks and then <Col N="343" /> changing them to accommodate other situations that do not affect the banks. Deputy Shatter's suggestion does not apply to the banks or other lending institutions that are now competing very strongly in the mortgage business.  Nor has the ban done anything to help the small borrower.  The section as it is drafted is reasonable and provides that tiered rates cannot be introduced for existing loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the important element in this.  They cannot be introduced even to top up loans under existing mortgages.  The measure provides protection for future borrowers by requiring that a society must secure the written acceptance of the borrower to the charging of a tiered rate.  Deputy Shatter talked about the track record of people looking for loans or of first time borrowers.  I put it to him that building societies and banks are not benevolent societies.  They take on board the question of whether a mortgage seeker has the capacity to repay the loan.  They have to be prudent in the making of all their loans.  Even with the cut-throat competition that exists at present, they still have to ensure that the people they are giving the loans to will be in a position to make the repayments. That applies to first-time mortgage seekers and to people seeking their second or third mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different circumstances exist now than existed when tiered rates were banned by the last Coalition.  Certain circumstances at that time made the Coalition Government go down that road.  We do not know if they would have gone down that road had those circumstances not existed.  It has not worked and it has not helped the small borrower in any significant way.  In creating the level playing field that will enable the building societies, the banks and other institutions to play on the same pitch with the same restrictions, the same prudential supervisory cover by the Central Bank and to operate in the competitive climate that now exists, this is <Col N="344" /> not in any way disadvantaging anybody who already has a loan and anybody getting a loan in the future will have full knowledge of what is involved.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael wanted this to be applied across the board to all the lending institutions, why was not a similar amendment put down to the Central Bank legislation before the House?  I am trying to bring about a situation in which the building societies will have the same opportunities and difficulties as all the other institutions.  We have received no objections from members of the public or from representative consumer groups, to the removal of the ban on tiered rates.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Association of Ireland made a detailed submission to us on this Bill and did not refer at all to the removal of the ban.  Let nobody trot out something in support of the consumers as a reason for this change not being made, because the consumers and their association have no problem with this.  It is better that tiered rates be left to competition in the marketplace than to have some kind of artificial statutory intervention as suggested by the Deputy.  There is plenty of competition.  It is not disadvantaging those who will be seeking loans, and protection is specifically written into the Bill for existing borrowers.  New borrowers will know exactly what they are doing if they want to get involved in this new form of mortgage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When building societies unilaterally sought to impose tiered interest rates in 1986, colleagues of the Minister were opposed to tiered interest rates.  It now appears that they favour tiered interest rates.  The Minister said that the ban does nothing to protect the consumer and referred to the Central Bank Bill.  The ban on tiered interest rates has meant that in a competitive market both the banks and building societies have acted cautiously in this area.  The fact that tiered interest rates were banned in the context of building societies has meant that banks have had to compete in that context.</P>
      <P>The Minister put forward an argument in a press release and then dropped the argument, so I invite him to explain how this provision to reintroduce tiered interest rates will work so as to ensure that first time house purchasers who borrow modest sums of money &mdash; in the region of £20,000 to £30,000 &mdash; will not find that they are paying a higher interest rate than people who borrow larger finance. The Minister has dropped that argument because he knows it does not apply.</P>
      <P>Neither has the Minister addressed the problem I raised of a preferential interest rate applying simply to the sale of houses built by the building society.  I invite him to respond to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also note that the Minister has not denied that it is a developing Government policy in continuous budgets to reduce the mortgage interest allowances and that in the next budget this Government, if still in office, will further reduce the mortgage interest allowance.  At a time when the Minister is planning to pass legislation to provide tiered interest rates which may well result in increased interest being payable on home loans, he has a duty to the general public to indicate his Government's thinking on mortgage interest allowance.  If this provision is <Col N="346" /> enacted the Minister has a duty to those home purchasers who may borrow under this tiered interest rate system, and pay interest rates at a higher level, with the resultant changes in the Finance Bill having the effect that they will get less mortgage interest allowance and the whole thing will be a great deal more costly than it is today.  The Minister has a duty to clarify the Government's thinking on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no notion of giving an indication to Deputy Shatter of what might or might not happen, either by Government action or by outside forces in the future.  It is extraordinary that the Deputy should be pursuing that here, unless it is for some other less honourable political reason to which I will not subscribe.  Why the Deputy pursues this issue on this amendment is beyond me.  I am not going to get into competition as to the differences between the Deputy's amendments and his colleague Deputy Boland's amendments. The Deputy does not want me to go down that road, does he?  What was going on on that side of the House in the tabling of these amendments was very obvious to this side of the House.  I deliberately refrained from making any references to it.</P>

      <P>That is not the way it seems in the amendments put down by Deputy John Boland who is not here to push them because if he was Deputy Shatter would have to disown him, would he not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not made this a confrontational piece at this stage because I subscribe to what the other two parties as represented by their spokesman here subscribe to. This is serious legislation and there is a lot to be done.  If we continue at this pace it will not be out of this House before the end of this session.  It will drag on with <Col N="347" /> considerable difficulties and disadvantages to those who wish to benefit from it.  The Deputy is not being browbeaten and he should not feel threatened when I say he is making a meal of every single line of this Bill and that it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>If building societies begin favouring their own members with special arrangements, that can be dealt with, as the Deputy knows, under the restrictive practices legislation.  That is not at issue here.  What is at issue is that there is plenty of competition in the marketplace and that circumstances have changed since that ban was implemented in 1986. The Deputy knows what facilities are available to those seeking mortgages at this time.  They are being very well catered for and they have the advantage not only of readily available mortgages but of receiving preferential treatment from those who seek a greater share of the mortgage market.  As the Deputy well knows, there are new players in the mortgage market every week.  We are returning the situation to the level of competitiveness that exists in other financial institutions.  I think it is reasonable to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the issue of tiered interest rates is being passed over too glibly by the Minister.  I believe the drafting of the Bill highlights in some respects the fact that tiered interest rates were not popular and that the system was sometimes &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; abused.  The Minister by his own provision has tried to address two of the problems: first, to ensure that the borrower has clear notice in advance of agreeing to the mortgage that a tiered interest rate will be charged; second, the borrower has to sign an acknowledgement form to be agreed by the Central Bank.  These provisions are not there for nothing.  Many people found themselves unexpectedly paying punitive interest rates because they were not fully advised.  There was abuse of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we agree to reintroduce tiered interest rates we should be satisfied that <Col N="348" /> the building societies will not devise some other means to get around the two simple provisos the Minister has introduced.  I accept that there is an element of equity in tiered interest rates especially from the viewpoint of small borrowers, but on balance tiered interest rates were not popular and the previous Government's action in banning them was welcomed. The Workers' Party view is that we would be as well off without tiered interest rates because they are punitive.  The building societies are in business for profit.  We should recognise the vast assets of the building societies and the enormous profits they make, there is more competition now than in 1986, there is a captive market.  Given the cost of housing, especially in Dublin, if the old system of tiered interest rates were to be reintroduced, I would say that approximately 80 per cent of mortgages, will carry punitive tiered interest rates.</P>
    <P>We would prefer the ban to continue and for that reason we support the amendment that Deputy Shatter has advanced.  I do not think things have changed that much, and perhaps the Minister would be agreeable to defer this provision to see how the market settles down after the legislation has been enacted.  At a later date he could listen to the case the building societies make for tiered interest rates.  I do not think we should bring in this measure now as the Minister is doing in this innovative and fundamentally changing legislation. We should reserve this for another day and another debate.  I am opposed to the reintroduction of tiered interest rates and I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to consider putting a provision that discriminated against building societies there is no doubt that it could lead to building societies being pushed to contemplate their change of status to get away from the discrimination. They might not wish to do so in the conversion to plc. if we were to continue discriminating against them in as far as tiered rating is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our system, interest rates will always <Col N="349" /> be determined by market forces and artificial interventions of the type the Deputy suggests ultimately act to the detriment of a good mortgage market that serves to meet the needs of the various types of borrowers.  To prove the point, competition over the past year or more &mdash; Deputy McCartan accepts that competition has created a new set of circumstances &mdash; has enabled many borrowers who were legally liable for tiered interest rates predating the 1986 Act to renegotiate their mortgages at a lower rate of interest.  That situation has existed because of changing circumstances and increased competition.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify something referred to in the course of Deputy Shatter's comments on amendment No. 17.  I want confirmation that the interpretation is correct.  Is it correct to say that this section would not prohibit a building society which was financing a particular development &mdash; and as part of its participation in a building development was offering mortgage facilities to prospective purchasers &mdash; from providing a tiered interest rate, the lowest tier of which would be below the same type of interest rate being applied by the society to members generally?  In other words, in case I have not made myself clear, could a building society in the execution of its powers generally under this Bill and with specific reference to this section, offer a tiered mortgage to prospective purchasers where the lowest tier was below the general market rate of interest?</P>

      <P>The Minister earlier referred to the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  In a submission which the Minister and I received &mdash; I presume other Deputies also received it &mdash; the association made the point that building societies may change their approaches. They said that a borrower must be notified in writing that a tiered interest rate is operating.  However, when you make a deposit with a building society &mdash; it is not necessarily the case at the moment as there are so many competing &mdash; you may not necessarily get a loan.  Societies can change their rules from time to time. The Minister indicated what information societies will have to make available.  At a time when depositors place money with a society, possibly having in mind that they may seek a home loan in six months or a year, what information will have to be supplied at that stage as to whether tiered interest rates are in place?  The consumers' association made the point that they found it very difficult to get information from some building societies regarding the manner in which they operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> In page 27, before section 26, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>26.&mdash;(1)  Where any estate or interest in land mortgaged to a building society is sold by the society in exercise of a power of sale, the society shall ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that the property is sold at the best price reasonably obtainable.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a society decides to retain any estate or interest in land mortgaged to the society in exercise of a power under the mortgage, the value of the property shall be determined by an independent and competent person appointed by the society and agreed to by the mortgagor and any other mortgagee and the value so determined shall be treated as if it were money received by a mortgagee arising from a sale.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the society is unable to obtain the agreement of the mortgagor or other mortgagee to the appointment of a person under subsection (2), the society may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an independent and competent person to determine the value of the property and the costs incurred in such application shall be defrayed equally by the applicant and the persons who do not agree to the person proposed for appointment by the society under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(4)  To the extent that any agreement relieves (or may have the effect of relieving) a society or any person from the obligation imposed by subsection (1) or (2) the agreement shall be void.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where property to which this section relates is sold or its value determined in accordance with subsection (2), the society shall send a notice by registered post to the mortgagor and any other mortgagee at his last known address within 21 days after the completion of the sale or the date on which the report on the value of the property is received by the society, as the case <Col N="355" /> may be, containing particulars of the sale or the value of the property, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(6)  Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of any rule of law relating to the duty of a mortgagee to account to a mortgagor.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section, &lsquo;mortgagor&rsquo; means a person to whom a loan is made by a society, and includes the successor in title of that person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section has been redrafted mainly because subsection (1), although it follows a similar provision in section 82 of the 1976 Act, could have the unintended consequence of interfering with the rights of a second mortgagee who would in fact be entitled to be repaid moneys due to him before the mortgagor is paid anything. I am also taking the opportunity, in the situation where a society opts to retain rather than sell property coming into its possession under the terms of a mortgage, to provide that in the event of failure to agree on a suitable person to value the property, a valuer may be appointed by the courts.  That is an additional precaution.</P>
    <P>The amendment clarifies the position of all parties involved when a building society sells or retains a property in the event of the borrower not being able to keep up the payments.  The requirement that the society achieve the best price reasonably obtainable is, of course, being maintained but the apparent requirement that the mortgagor then be paid without reference to other mortgagees is being amended to reflect the actual position as it obtains in practice, that is, section 21 (3) of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, will apply as a matter of course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 (2) (a) as drafted would, as a general rule, prevent a building society from setting up a subsidiary and taking a shareholding in a banking company in Ireland, but it would have permitted a society to set up a subsidiary or invest in a banking company abroad.  The purpose of the restriction was to prevent a building society transferring its main business to a subsidiary and possibly circumventing some provisions of the Bill. However, I am now satisfied that the provision would create some problems in an EC context and would not sit well with the banking directives.  It could well prove to be ineffectual as a society could establish a banking subsidiary in another member state and this subsidiary, when <Col N="357" /> licensed in that state, would then have the right to establish branches or provide services back into this country.  There is also the fear that it could make it very difficult for a society to operate abroad by means of a subsidiary since it is a generally accepted principle of EC law that one's right to operate abroad should correspond to one's home operations.</P>
    <P>In view of these considerations I am proposing by these amendments to drop the provision at subsection 2 (a) and replace it with a new subsection which is designed to give the Central Bank power to limit or restrict the business of a banking subsidiary in order to ensure that a building society does not make use of a banking subsidiary to get round any of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 29 outlines a variety of services which a building society may provide Subsection (2) (n) extends to building societies the possibility of carrying out executorships, including the drawing and preparing of wills.  It seems to me that there is no particular reason for extending such powers to building societies.  I think I am right in saying that the only reason the provision is in the Bill is that the section is a direct copy of the 1986 Act introduced in Great Britain which listed a number of additional powers.  I do not think there is any great public demand to get building societies to prepare wills.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister has tabled an amendment similar to mine and I should like to ask him to clarify the reason he wants to leave building societies in a position to exercise executorships.

    <P>&ldquo;(6)  Section 30 of the Succession Act, 1965 (which relates to the power <Col N="360" /> to grant representation to a trust corporation), is amended by the insertion in subsection (4) (b) of that section of the following additional subparagraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(v)  a building society authorised under the Building Societies Act, 1989; or&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessary to put building societies on the same footing as associated banks in relation to the provision of executorship services.  Under section 29 (2) (n) of the Bill, a society which adopts the power to provide financial services will be able, subject to Central Bank approval, to provide executorship services, that is, to carry out the duties of an executor.  However, section 30 of the Succession Act, 1965, limits the circumstances in which the High Court may grant probate to bodies corporate to cases where the executors appointed are &ldquo;trust corporations&rdquo; as defined in that section.  As things stand, a society would not be a trust corporation within that section and this amendment is designed to overcome that by including building societies in the list of corporations to which the High Court may grant probate.</P>
    <P>A corporation aggregate, such as a building society or a company, which does not qualify as a trust corporation, cannot take a grant of representation in its own name but could do so by means of a nominee taking the grant for the use and benefit of the corporation.  A trust corporation, which is defined in section 30 of the Succession Act, to include the Associated Banks, public and private companies with paid up capital in excess of £100,000 and certain other types of corporations, does not have to proceed in this fashion, that is, it can take a grant of representation in its own name.  This amendment will allow building societies to do the same.</P>

      <P>In the section we are moving to allow building societies to engage in a wide range of activities.  They will be using their position in the marketplace by virtue of the trust that depositors have placed in them for years.  I should like to give the Minister, and his advisers, notice that I intend to question the scrutiny which will be exercised by the Central Bank in respect of the operation of section 29.</P>
      <P>My concern essentially is that with the vast resources and deposits building societies have they are going to be tempted to get into a market which is very specialised and currently very substantially serviced.  With the spectre of the ICI in the background, which at one stage caused the financial institutions and indeed this House to tremble because of the financial implications for all of us, I would like the Minister to be on notice that when we come to section 36 he might indicate the way in which the Central Bank will review applications for the operation of either this section or the other sections which will have to be given prior approval by the Central Bank before the building societies get involved. As I said before, section 36 is the gear box under which all these sections will be operated.  We are now enabling building societies, which up until very recently used to take in deposits and give out mortgages, to get into a very specialised range of services.  Without providing safeguards to ensure that there is the necessary expertise to carry on this business in building societies we could put at risk large amounts of depositors' savings. That is my concern.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 31, lines 6 to 48 and in page 32, lines 1 to 5, to delete subsections (2) and (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section applies to any bond or any contract of suretyship or guarantee which is given, or is entered into, as surety or guarantor by a society in the course of its business or which is in the course of his banking business given or entered into, as surety or guarantor, by a person resident outside the State to satisfy, and only for the purposes of, a requirement which is both&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a requirement of a society, and</P>
      <P>(b)  made solely for the purpose of securing financial facilities to be made available by that society.</P>
      <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;banking business&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Act of 1971.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Insurance Acts&rdquo; means the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1989, and regulations relating to insurance business made under the European Communities Act, 1972.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring section 30 into line with section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1978, as amended by section 27 of the Insurance Act, 1989, which was recently passed by the House. Section 30 is based on the Insurance Act, 1978, the purpose of which is to allow banks to issue bonds, sureties and guarantees in the course of their banking business.  Under the Insurance Act, 1936, persons other than insurance companies cannot effect, among other things, guarantee insurance business.  This prohibition was regarded as raising doubts about the capacity of banks to issue bonds, sureties and guarantees, such as performance bonds, export guarantee <Col N="363" /> bonds and payment guarantees.  Accordingly, the Insurance Act, 1978, was brought in to make it clear that banks could issue bonds and similar instruments in certain circumstances.  I understand that the main purpose of the amendment to the Insurance Act, 1978, contained in the Insurance Act, 1989, is to remove limitations on the circumstances in which banks can issue such instruments.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsection (2) will put societies on the same footing as banks both in regard to the giving of bonds, sureties and guarantees by them and the giving of bonds by foreign banks where the bond is required by a society and is for the purpose of securing financial facilities to be made available by a society.  Societies providing financial services under section 29 will thus be able, for example, to issue bonds for travel or for tour operators, performance bonds in relation to the completion of contracts and payment guarantees, without running foul of the Insurance Acts.  The proposed new subsection (3) defines banking business as it is defined in the Central Bank Acts, and it also defines Insurance Acts.</P>

I want to clarify that point.  I am advised that &ldquo;assurances&rdquo; is a recognised legal term for a conveyance of assignment of property and is the appropriate word here.

    <P>&ldquo;(14)  The draft of the regulations the Minister proposes making pursuant <Col N="365" /> to this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 relate to the new powers which section 31 confers on building societies to provide conveyancing services and amendments Nos. 31 and 32 deal with the new powers societies may exercise in providing auctioneering services.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 33, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(15)  This section shall not come into operation until three months after the regulations provided for in subsection (14) have been made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regard amendments Nos. 29 and 30 as being of particular importance and of similar importance to amendments No. 32 and 33 which would have the same effect as regards auctioneering services.</P>
    <P>Section 31 confers for the first time on building societies a power to provide conveyancing services.  This will result in a fundamental change in our legal procedures and law as up to now conveyancing services had in effect to be undertaken by solicitors under the Solicitors Act, 1954.  There are a great number of worries in this area.  It has been suggested that building societies in taking on the role of conveyancing may provide a more efficient service to a house purchaser and that in some way the undertaking of conveyancing services by building societies may reduce the cost incurred by way of legal expenditure by a house purchaser.  I want to say, without any ambiguity from this side of the House, that we would favour any measures which could be put into place to reduce the cost to the home buyer of purchasing a home.  The difficulty with this section is that it is not clear to what extent, if any, these provisions will reduce costs.  Perhaps when we deal with the substance of the section at a later stage we will cover that aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> The section does recognise one thing of considerable importance: it recognises that a serious incidence of conflict of interest may arise as between a building society and a house purchaser.  While allowing building society solicitors to act in the purchase of a home for the borrower of mortgage finance from the building society and also acting for the building society, it seeks to put in place a number of protections to try to get over the problem of conflict of interest.  The possible conflicts of interest which can arise can be very easily listed.  I do not want to detain the House by going through all of them but some are worth referring to.</P>
    <P>For example, someone seeking to buy a house who is getting independent legal advice may get the type of advice the Minister was talking about earlier with regard to shopping around for mortgages. When a person goes to his solicitor, the solicitor should have the expertise to provide him with the necessary backup information as to the different types of mortgages available from different types of societies and banks.  The solicitor is performing a role in carrying out a conveyance and also in encouraging a person to shop around in order to get the best deal possible.  Knowing the legal background to a person's situation a solicitor may be able to advise him as to whether he should take out an endowment policy or a straight mortgage loan.  A solicitor will do that in the context of having no particular axe to grind on one side of the argument or the other.  A building society might have a vested interest in selling to you an endowment policy because of the pay back of commission the building society will get from an insurance company. In fairness to the Minister, I think he recently sounded a warning to house purchasers in this area.</P>

      <P>The Government have accepted and are implementing the recommendation in the report of the International Study Group on Technological Education regarding the conferring of university status on the National Institutes for Higher Education in Dublin and Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the study group made more than 20 recommendations, not just in relation to the NIHEs but also in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges, the RTCs, the National College <Col N="369" /> of Art and Design and many other matters, and that the Government have now had their report sufficiently long to be in a position to indicate their thinking in these areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The technological study group did make various other recommendations.  Their first was with regard to the status of the two NIHEs. As I have explained, it is hoped that legislation will be published this week or very early next week in relation to that matter.  The other matters which are of equal importance &mdash; relating to the role and status of the colleges within the Dublin Institute of Technology, all of the RTCs and the various other third level colleges are at present being considered. I might add that I am at present preparing a Bill &mdash; which I hope will be entitled the Colleges Bill &mdash; which will contain various provisions with regard to the status and co-ordination of the various colleges within the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Its provisions will also give greater operational autonomy to the regional colleges, and greater autonomy in general matters.  I might add that it is our intention to have a partnership arrangement between the various VECs, the Department and the colleges.  That will be the overall thrust of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Specifically in relation to the RTCs, would the Minister accept that there is a considerable degree of urgency?  Is she aware that the RTCs believe that their capacity to raise funds for themselves, through research and consultancy services, is severely curtailed by their present legislative status?  In those circumstances, would she do what she can to expedite matters?  In addition, would the Minister accept, as a general framework, the concept of autonomy for the RTCs but within the VEC family? Would she regard that as a suitable definition?</P>

They find themselves somewhat fettered in developing other ways of research and development and in getting private funding.  It would be my aim to loosen them up in that regard to a very great extent.  As well as giving them greater operational autonomy and freedom in their day-to-day operations, it would also be my aim to keep them, in a partnership sense, within the relevant VEC family.</P>

      <P>The anomalies referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of a review of the provision for teaching resources in schools serving disadvantaged areas which is being carried out at present by the Primary Education Revenue Body. In addition, a working group comprising representatives of my Department, the INTO and the primary school management authorities have been set up and are at present examining criteria for the identification of schools as disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall her contribution to the INTO conference in Bundoran when she indicated that she was fully seized of this issue and was addressing it as a matter or urgency? How does the Minister tolerate the position &mdash; as has been pointed out in the House on a previous occasion &mdash; in which some schools sharing the same campus find that one school is regarded as disadvantaged for staffing purposes, the girls' school, and not the boys' school? <Col N="371" /> What is the reason for the delay in addressing anomalies as glaring as those?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may reply, with no sense of malice, the anomalies in question were introduced by my predecessor when she initiated the scheme in 1984. The anomalies do exist and I publicly identified them in this House.  I now intend to review their operation.  As I have said, it is a matter to which I have given my attention and am still doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the difficulty arises from the fact that the Minister's predecessor introduced a system whereby a number of teachers were allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas, that this Government have stopped that scheme in its tracks resulting in the scheme never having been brought to encompass all schools that are disadvantaged for capitation grant purposes?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is all wrong.  As I see the position, my predecessor did not see it as an anomaly and never addressed it as such.  I found it rather odd that, for instance, there should be two schools in the one campus, a boys school and a girls' school, with brothers and sisters from the one household attending one school to which my predecessor had awarded special capitation grants and said: &ldquo;yes, you are disadvantaged and you will receive grants,&rdquo; whereas to the sister school she had said: &ldquo;yes, you will get a teacher.&rdquo;  That was set up in 1984 and it is that anomaly I am addressing.</P>

I am also aware that <Col N="375" /> there is a growing trend in Europe towards that development.  The needs of people with particular disabilities can best be addressed within the normal school context.  I am also aware that there still would be groups and children who unfortunately, for one reason or another, could not be so integrated and for whom there remains the need for special schools and special classes.  It is obviously a question of balance and of being able to fulfil the very natural expectations of parents to have their children integrated.  I have also had views expressed to me by parents whose children wish to remain in special schools and in special classes.  It would be entirely unfair to everybody concerned in education to issue a blanket approval. The circumstances and the abilities of the children, the levels at which they have been assessed by the psychological and medical experts all fall to be taken into account in such decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have arranged to meet the NUI on 25 May.  To answer directly the first part of the Deputy's question as to what proposals they have put to me this is the earliest date on which the meeting could be arranged.  I would like to put on the record some facts regarding that issue and the matriculation examination.</P>
      <P>To date, I have had no formal communication of what the National University of Ireland has in mind concerning its matriculation examination.  I am aware only of what has been in the public press, following which my Department sought from the NUI, a copy of their press release but they did not communicate formally to me the result of their meeting.</P>
      <P>Our only indication of what the NUI has in mind in this matter has been from what we have read in the newspapers.  I am confident that these reports are correct but I am surprised not to have heard directly from the NUI in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record the interpretation the NUI have put on my soundings and my role in the affair.  This is that <Col N="377" /> I have engaged in megaphone diplomacy. I have no mandate to order or to demand of the NUI that they withdraw their matriculation examination.  That is a matter for themselves but I did make public my belief that the examination should be abolished.  Something which was never brought forward by the NUI is that the secretary of my Department conveyed to Dr. Whitaker, Chancellor of the NUI, on 25 January 1989 my support for the abolition of the matriculation examination.  I say this because it appears from what we read in the newspapers that their impression was that all they knew about it was what I said on television.</P>
    <P>The sEcretary of my Department also told Dr. Whitaker that I would be happy at any time to meet the NUI to discuss any subsequent arrangements that might have to be put in place.  The secretary of the Department also met Dr. Whitaker, at my request, and others in February 1988 and discussed the position of the NUI matriculation.</P>
    <P>The departmental task force who reviewed admission procedures to third level education recommended that the NUI be requested to discontinue the matriculation examination except in subjects which are not on the leaving certificate programme.  The NUI did not consult with my Department before issuing their press release.  The Deputy will be aware that requirements for matriculation in the NUI are a matter for the university.</P>
    <P>Following that and all the bruhaha and innuendos and, indeed, various statements by spokespersons who say, that I blew it, etc. the Deputy can see that I went about my business correctly and within the parameters in which I can engage.  It is a matter now of expectation as to what will be the reforms which the NUI stated they have in mind for the working of the matriculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response to my question.  I also appreciate the efforts she has made on this issue and the candour with which she has approached it.  May I ask her if she would accept that there is now no educational <Col N="378" /> argument to support the retention of the matriculation by the NUI colleges?  Trinity College abandoned the matriculation years ago without any adverse effects on the standards of the college.  The eminently successful NIHE colleges have never thought it necessary to use a matriculation examination.  That being so, it would appear that there are now no educational arguments to support the retention of that examination.  If there are arguments, they ought to be made by the Senate of the NUI, and made now.</P>
      <P>Finally, I do not think that young people ought to be used as cannon fodder in any argument which is not an education one.</P>

I shall be expressing to them when I meet them as I have done personally once, through my Secretary twice, and personally as Minister for Education, that the matriculation examination should be abolished.

      <P>The question is becoming partisan.  I accept that County Cork is the biggest county in Ireland. There is nothing I can do about that.  It is a fact.  I do not accept that the work of the two very fine adult education advisers in that county is nor very worthwhile and indeed, very fruitful and having great effect.  I think they would wish me to put on the record my appreciation of the work they are doing.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that her Department regard adult education as being something of a Cinderella, that less than one-sixth of 1 per cent of the Education budget is allocated to adult education?  Given that her Department are not involved in any significant way as a provider of adult education, would she accept that it exists only where there are people to facilitate her?  If we had not adult education organisers, nothing would happen.  In those circumstances, will she not make a case to her constituency colleague to regard these as very special vacancies that should be filled?</P>

Our reason for obtaining particular sanction in the cases of County Louth and County Meath is that if those vacancies had remained unfilled those two counties would have been left without any adult education organisers.  That remains the position.  Of course, we will always keep the matter under review. Again, I reject the assertion that anybody in my Department is a Cinderella.</P>

There seems to be no argument whatever at this stage for the retention of the two-four honours requirement for grants since that standard has been far exceeded by every entrant to third level colleges.

If two people obtain places through merit, if what they got in <Col N="384" /> the leaving certificate entitles them to places in a particular course and one can pay and one cannot, of course it is a deterrent that should be overcome.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that at the January meeting of the CDVEC the students' representative presented a document dealing with the <Col N="385" /> need for a crêche and other medical facilities in Dublin colleges, and I understand this document has not yet been dealt with by the committee.  The student representative was invited to discuss the matter with the principal officer in the CDVEC but has not yet done so.  In the meantime in February last there were some protests at the CDVEC in general with regard to medical services for students. It is now understood that the Union of Students in Ireland propose to prepare a more comprehensive report on the matter concerned with the facts they found in their survey.  They will be presenting that to the CDVEC and I in turn will ask them for a copy of it.</P>

It is entirely up to themselves to make recommendations to me based on what they see as necessary in their colleges, and if they so do we shall consider them.  I take the Deputy's point.  That is the mechanical level, so to speak, of the submission.  I will request from the Union of Students in Ireland the detailed submission they will be making to the various VECs and I will study it myself, then I hope to be able to raise the matter with the parent body of the VECs, who are the IVEA.</P>

The 15 mile rule is considered reasonable and no alteration to it is proposed.  I do not, therefore, propose to introduce a review procedure for this issue.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is a fact that CIE have told us that they would have major difficulty with the provision of the service within the allocation provided.  They have told us that on many occasions in the past. It is the subject of ongoing discussions.</P>

This is not the first time we have been told this by CIE.  It is our wish that redundancies would not take place as a result of the Government's indication to CIE that a school transport service must be provided.</P>

      <P>Provision for in-service teacher training in modern continental languages takes the form of seminars and summer courses in Ireland and scholarships abroad.  The total cost of the in-service training in modern languages planned for 1989 is of the order of £40,000.</P>
      <P>Technical assistance on the organisation of school exchanges is provided by the Youth Exchanges Bureau, the body set up by my Department to improve the quality of exchanges for young people generally.</P>
      <P>The Council of European Education Ministers will meet on Monday next in Brussels to discuss with a view to adoption of a Commission proposal on the Lingua Programme.  This proposal provides for <i>inter alia</i> the in-service training of existing teachers abroad.</P>
      <P>The in-service provision for second level courses this year has been increased from £300,000 to £700,000 approximately. The wish of the teachers unions, the ASTI and the TUI, who have met me on the matter is that the main direction of in-service training should be directed towards the new syllabi.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate what the cost is likely to be of fulfilling the proposals in the Lingua Programme whereby teachers will go abroad <Col N="393" /> to France or Germany?  The Minister mentioned the Youth Exchange Bureau. Has she any proposals to assist students to go to foreign countries where they can acquire proficiency in the language they are studying?  Unfortunately it is the case that parents who have the means can effectively buy honours in language proficiency by sending their children away for three months of the year.  The vast majority of children cannot avail of that facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking whether I have finance to assist children to go abroad to increase their language proficiency, the answer is that I do not have a direct national fund for that purpose. I am hoping to get through the Lingua Programme next Monday, but the UK is raising objections which my Department officials are trying to offset in Brussels.  One of the components of the Lingua Programme relates to student exchanges between various countries.</P>
      <P>The Lingua report mentions specifically that countries on the periphery of Europe should be given special attention in regard to both teacher exchanges and student exchanges.  The amount available for teachers should be known on Monday next when we finally agree the Lingua Programme.  I understand from media reports that the UK objection is based on what they see as unwarranted interference in the national curriculum of their country.  I hope that all the other countries in Europe will come together to see that the Lingua Programme is passed successfully because a very integral part of that is teacher and student exchanges.  If one does not get to hear the language one is at a disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have exempted adult students who have not previously sat the leaving certificate examination or who have sat it in only one or two subjects or who are medical card holders, from the course fee and the increased examination fee payable by repeat leaving certificate pupils.</P>
      <P>Also, from September next, it will be possible for the long-term unemployed to avail of increased educational opportunities provided by the VECs under an extended educational opportunity scheme without payment of fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the second part of the answer in regard to the VECs.  It is not formally announced as yet.  There are two pilot schemes at present and they have acted very satisfactorily in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare and myself. Unemployed persons who wish to go back to school in a formal way can do so without losing benefit.  Under the revised <Col N="395" /> programme for Social and Structural Funds we are hoping to extend that from January 1990.  Because many of the participants will want to enter upon a formal academic school year we are hoping to get in as many as possible in September under the extended educational opportunities scheme.  When we have all the nuts and bolts in place I will be making a formal announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply.  Am I right in taking the Minister to mean that adult students, in terms of payment of fees for the leaving certificate, will not be regarded as in the same category as ordinary repeat students? In other words where some of these students have taken two or three subjects in one year and more subjects in the following year the scale of fees, payments and charges will not apply to them in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has quite rightly identified these two matters. There are actually two separate questions. Adult students who have not previously sat the leaving certificate examination or who have sat it in only one or two subjects or who are medical card holders are exempted from the course fee and from the increased examinations fees payable by repeat leaving certificate students, but they would pay the normal required fee for any student sitting a leaving certificate.  From September next it will be possible for the long-term unemployed to avail themselves of increased educational opportunities provided by VECs under an extended educational opportunity scheme without payment of any examination fees, but they are the particular groups of people under that heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of adult students who wish to build up an examination by perhaps taking two subjects one year and another two the following year will they have to pay the fee in respect of the second and subsequent years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite an attractive option for people nowadays. The present situation is that if people have sat the leaving certificate in one or two subjects and have not previously sat the full leaving certificate examination, or if they are medical card holders, they are exempt from the repeat course fee and from the increased repeat examination fee.  They pay the normal fee as any student in school would do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

I understand that the Physical Education Society of Teachers in Ireland have made a formal written submission to the Primary Curriculum Review Body and I am sure their concerns have been noted and will perhaps be expressed in the findings of the review committee.</P>

The colleges of education have experienced principals and experienced staff to carry out their objectives.  Were I to issue diktats of that kind Deputy Carey would be the <Col N="401" /> first to say that I was interfering.  The primary review which I have set up is a channel through which people whose needs are not being met in relation to curriculum matters, can make submissions. In an indirect way, when the review body issue their findings to me, I will have a chance to do something about what they say.</P>

      <P>As I said, because this year's national lottery allocation will be disbursed over a shorter period, 12 months, as opposed to 20 months in respect of last year's allocation, inevitably there will be less money to be allocated. The Government are committed to providing national facilities, such as the national indoor centre, six regional centres and local facilities.

      <P>My Department are precluded under the terms of Government policy on public service staffing from sanctioning any increase in the existing personnel resources of VECs' second level schemes.  It is a matter, therefore, for VECs to redeploy the personnel resources available to them in their schemes in the best manner possible to meet the needs of their schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it makes very poor economic sense to leave public buildings, such as schools, constructed with taxpayers' money, without the services of a caretaker?  This leaves them open to vandalism resulting in extra costs for the taxpayer.  The standard of cleanliness and maintenance is let go down with the result that proper environment for the training and nurturing of young people is not provided. If the Minister thinks in this case the rule does not serve the best interests of young people she ought to look at it again and make an exception.</P>

Every day we are asked for more teachers, more caretakers, more buildings, more resources, more examinations and more subjects but we have to bear in mind that £1.2 billion is spent on education.  It is amazing what we have been able to achieve in providing a very high standard of education.

    <P>In page 33, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(14)  The draft of the regulations the Minister proposes making pursuant to this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to lunch I referred to the fact that section 31 of this Bill would remove the monopoly which has been exercised by the solicitor's profession for many years in the area of conveyancing.  This section would extend to building societies the power to carry out conveyancing, and in so doing amend the Solicitors Act, 1954.  I also referred to the fact that a serious conflict of interest could arise when a solicitor acts for a building society while also acting for the purchaser of a property who is a borrower of loan finance from the building society. This section recognises that a serious conflict of interest could arise.  Subsection (4) states that regulations made under this section may include provisions for: the protection of persons for whom conveyancing services are provided by societies from conflicts of interest that might otherwise arise in connection with the provision of the services; securing that adequate compensation is available to such persons in respect of negligence, fraud or other dishonesty on the part of officers or employees of societies in connection with the provision of the services; the extent to which and the manner in which such services would require the involvement of persons qualified to practice as solicitors and the qualifications and experience of personnel generally engaged in the provision of the services.  In other <Col N="434" /> words, it is envisaged that the building societies may use people other than qualified solicitors employed by the societies to carry out conveyancing works.</P>
      <P>Regulations made under this section may also include provisions for the class or classes of persons to whom the services by the society in the area of conveyancing may be provided.  I am not exactly sure what is meant by the &ldquo;class or classes of persons.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister might clarify this for us.  Regulations may also include provisions for the restriction of the power to provide conveyancing services to property of a prescribed description. I do not know what property of a prescribed description the Minister has in mind or what restrictions he proposes to impose.</P>
      <P>The subsection refers also to regulations as to the maximum rates or scales of fees, costs or expenses which may be charged by societies for the provision of services.  In other words, the problem is that this section envisages extending to building societies a power to carry out conveyancing.  It ends the monopoly exercised by the legal profession, a monopoly given to it for only one reason, that to carry out conveyancing you need a degree of legal expertise and solicitors were trained to carry out conveyancing. When the monopoly of the legal profession is attacked it is an attack on solicitors for exercising the degree of expertise they are trained to provide in the area of conveyancing.  It is a bit like attacking doctors for having a monopoly on surgery in hospital theatres.  I do not think anyone would suggest that someone other than a surgeon should be brought in to do the job.  If you get it wrong as a surgeon it may have a more dramatic impact on the patient than the solicitor who gets it wrong in dealing with the conveyancing would have on the client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about ending a monopoly of expertise and providing for building societies who do not necessarily have the expertise to provide conveyancing services.  They will be empowered to employ persons other than <Col N="435" /> lawyers to carry out conveyancing in circumstances where it is recognised that there may be a serious conflict of interest between the society and the purchaser. The conflict of interest of which I was giving an example when we went to lunch was that it may suit a building society to try to encourage borrowers to take out an endowment policy for the purposes of mortgage finance rather than a straight loan because a building society will get a substantial commission from the insurance company.  It may be £400 or £500 &mdash; may be larger &mdash; depending on the extent of the loan.  A building society may get a substantial commission for endowment policies which are not available to the building societies in the context of straight loan.  The difficulty is that there is a conflict of interests.  If the solicitor dealing with the conveyance is seeking additional legal documentation to give the building society extra security, who will advise the borrower, who has the same solicitor acting for him, that maybe the extra legal assurances that the building society's solicitor is seeking are not required?  There can be a whole series of possible conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, he recognised that there can be conflicts of interest but he says that all this will be dealt with by way of regulation.  Section 31 contains a skeletal provision which basically says that building societies can undertake conveyancing and the Minister will set out, by way of regulations, protections for the house purchaser and the consumer.  There is no indication as to what the Minister will do about the scale of fees or anything else.  Let us not forget that this provision has been advocated on the basis that it will result in a reduction in conveyancing costs.  There is nothing in this to indicate that it will result in any reduction in conveyancing costs.  It seems to be designed to redirect conveyancing fees from the legal profession &mdash; which may or may not be a good idea &mdash; to the building societies.  That may not be a good idea either but I have not heard any rational argument as to why building societies should get conveyancing fees <Col N="436" /> when they can provide untrained personnel to process conveyancing as opposed to members of the legal profession who can provide an objective and independent service.</P>
    <P>This is far too serious a matter simply to be left to a regulatory power in the way the Minister envisages.  The Minister proposes that he will subsequently publish regulations although he is not required to do so.  In the context of conveyancing provisions it is the Minister for Justice as opposed to the Minister for the Environment who seems to be providing some regulations &mdash; the Minister for the Environment is involved in other areas. Perhaps this could be clarified.  The Minister for Justice, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, may make regulations authorising building societies to provide conveyancing services. It goes on to say that regulations under this section may include provision for the matter I referred to.  This legislation was brought in by the Minister for the Environment to give the Minister for Justice enabling powers to confer authority on building societies to carry out conveyancing with safeguards that are envisaged by the Minister for the Environment but which are not expressly contained in the Bill.  They are to be circulated and published by the Minister for Justice who may not, as far as we know, have directed his mind to the issue and may merely see it through the narrow confines of the Solicitors' Acts.  All this can come into force without the House having to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>My amendment is designed to ensure that before this section, which will have far reaching implications, becomes law, the draft of the regulations which the Minister for Justice proposes making pursuant to this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister and that the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft of the regulation has been passed. On this side of the House we want to see the substance of the protections it is proposed will be put in place to protect the consumer and the borrower of mortgage finance when building societies are <Col N="437" /> carrying out conveyancing.  We want to ensure that this section will not come into operation until after the regulations are made because it is quite clear that this section could be brought into operation by the Minister for Justice under subsection (1) without having to make any regulations under section 4 which is only a discretionary provision.  It says that the Minister may make regulations, it does not say that he shall make regulations.</P>
    <P>In the context of this section coming into operation we believe that this House should have a right to see the substance of the protections proposed.  There should be provision in the Bill to ensure that the section does not become operative until the regulations have been put in place and there is no certainty at present that that will be the position.  We have a degree of scepticism as to whether this provision will advance the position of the house purchaser one way or another.  I recall some six or eight months ago when we had the much heralded Courts Bill before the House being told that abolishing juries in compensation claims would result in a reduction of awards made by the courts and a considerable reduction in insurance premiums paid by motorists.  The Government have finally come clean and acknowledged that awards made by judges have not been reduced and insurance costs have not lessened.  They now have another high-falutin, equally irrelevant, scheme to suggest another method of bringing down the cost of motor insurance.  I know this has nothing to do with motor insurance, all I am saying is that it is popular to suggest that giving someone else powers to carry out conveyancing &mdash; in this instance building societies &mdash; will result in an automatic saving of money to the house purchaser. There is nothing in the section to indicate that that is the case.  If the Minister intends under subsection (4) (g) to provide for maximum rates or scales of fees to ensure that the claims made for this section have some veracity it is only reasonable that the regulations are brought before this House for approval before the section becomes operative.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 29, I do not consider it realistic to propose to clog up the Dáil procedure with discussions and votes on regulations.  The regulations under this section, which will have to be made before any society can provide the services, will have to conform to the framework of the section itself and, of course, can only be made after the specified consultations have been concluded. In this instance, that means that the Minister for Justice will have to consult both the Minister for the Environment and the Central Bank. Furthermore, I would expect that the views of representative bodies of those with an interest in such regulations would also be obtained.  We are amending the Solicitors Act, 1954, and we are talking about decisions that will be made by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned it is right and proper to deal with these matters in this Bill.  I do not think that for the regulation to be made under this section would require a positive resolution.  However, if it should transpire that a Dáil debate is warranted, then it will be open to any Deputy to raise the issue at the appropriate time and to put down a motion to annul the regulations when they are laid before the House, should that happen, but I do not think it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 30, tabled by Deputy Shatter, I should like to state that having regard to the fact that a society will not be able to provide conveyancing services until regulations have been made by the Minister for Justice under section 31 and until the power to provide conveyancing services has been adopted by the society and its exercise approved by the Central Bank; and that the Minister for Justice, in making the regulations, and after the usual consultations with the various interested parties, can, if he considers it necessary, provide that the regulations will only come into force after a certain interval.  I do not think that an amendment such as this is necessary.  If an interval such as <Col N="439" /> that envisaged in the amendment is considered necessary, and personally, at this stage I do not think it is necessary, then the most appropriate place to provide for it is in the regulations themselves.</P>
    <P>If, in the course of drafting the regulations, it becomes clear that a three month or even longer interval of the type suggested is warranted for whatever reason, it will be open to the Minister for Justice to provide for it in the regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No.32, tabled by Deputy Shatter, I should like to state, as I have previously indicated, that I do not consider this approach to be the correct one to adopt.  I should point out at this juncture that this provision differs from that in section 31 in that whereas conveyancing services cannot be provided until the appropriate regulations have been made, estate agency and other services relating to land can be provided without regulations, and indeed regulations would only be made if future circumstances so demanded.  I would hope that it would be possible to deal with the issues in question by means of agreed voluntary codes of practice.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of the day, regulations under this section have to be made they will not be able to go beyond the limits set in the provision itself and, of course, could only be made after the extensive consultations provided for in the section. Furthermore, I would expect that the views of those interested parties would be sought.  I do not feel that any regulations that may be made under this section should require a positive resolution. However, in the event that any Deputy wishes to raise an issue at the relevant time and put down a motion to annul the regulations, then of course that is open to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 33, in the name of Deputy Shatter, I should like to state that arguments similar to some of those I advanced in relation to amendment No. 30 apply here.  That is, a society will not be able to exercise the powers available under section 32 until it has adopted the powers and secured Central Bank approval to exercise them and if <Col N="440" /> regulations under section 32 should prove necessary, then the regulations themselves can provide for an interval before they come into force if that is then considered to be appropriate.  In addition, however, and more importantly, the amendment if accepted would have the effect of actually requiring regulations to be made under section 32 whereas in fact the section as drafted does not require regulations to be made before the powers available under the section can be exercised.</P>
    <P>The power of the Ministers for Justice and the Environment to make regulations under section 32 has been included as a contingency provision in the event that problems arise in the provision of auctioneering services and other services relating to land in relation to, for example, conflicts of interest.  I believe, however, that adherence to the requirements of the Central Bank and the adoption of suitable codes of practice will be sufficient to prevent any problems arising. Nevertheless, I think it is reasonable to provide for the contingency regulation making power.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that building societies will not have people with some expertise and experience in these matters.  They will have to use people with expertise in conveyancing and that is catered for in the famous section 36 referred to by Deputy Quinn.  Without wishing to antagonise my colleagues on the Opposition benches, I should like to point out that some solicitors sell endowment mortgages and other services for which they are not too highly qualified.  That is not a good reason for not having expertise available to the building societies and I am satisfied that they will be able to provide that.  They will have to get permission from the Central Bank before they can offer those services and, under section 36, they can be obliged to show that they have bought in that experience and expertise.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Shatter will understand why it is not possible to accept his amendment. I should like to ask him to be reasonable in regard to this.  In my view, <Col N="441" /> this should work out well for all concerned. It is interesting to note that solicitors are not prevented from acting for both sides in conveyancing.  That may not be the recommended procedure and I have a feeling that the Incorporated Law Society would not recommend it, but it is not mandatory on them to do otherwise. In fact, solicitors do act for both sides in a conveyance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I should make it clear that I am not trying to defend the Law Society, the solicitors' profession or anybody else.  My interest is in protecting the consumer and trying to ensure that the legislation works.  I want to find out the protections the Minister envisages applying.  This section may well satisfy some elements of the legal profession but I do not carry any card for solicitors who act for building societies and at the same time try to act for the purchaser.  The Minister is aware that the Incorporated Law Society discourages that practice, not always successfully. The Minister has not added one scintilla of substance to the alleged protections these regulations will provide.  I do not <Col N="442" /> think any Member knows what protections will be put in place by virtue of section 4 (a) to (g).</P>
      <P>It will be possible for the Minister for Justice under section 31 (i) to make an order bringing that section into force and to do no more than that.  I want the Minister to spell out the substance of the protections that will be provided for in those regulations.  That is the kernel of the issue.  If one accepts that there is a conflict of interest, and the legislation by implication accepts that, one has to know how one can deal with that, but the regulations do not set out how one can deal with it.</P>
      <P>There is an irony in all of this in that in 1982 it was the building societies who talked of a conflict of interest.  It was they who made it clear that they did not like the suggestion put forward at that time that the solicitor employed by a purchaser should do the work of the building societies' solicitor.  The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry into the effects on competition of the restrictions on conveyancing and the restrictions on advertising by solicitors of 1982 stated:</P>
      <P>Where a purchase is financed by a lending institution, the work of the lender's solicitor largely overlaps that of the purchaser's solicitor, but the interests of the purchaser and lender can diverge and the lending institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>in this instance the building societies,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;maintain that it is necessary for them to employ their own solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1986, not only were building societies employing their own solicitor, but they were forcing the purchaser to pay the legal fees they were incurring for the solicitor they were employing.  That was banned under the 1986 Act and we now have the poacher trying to take over the job of the gamekeeper.  The building societies, having said that it is not acceptable that a purchaser's solicitor should do their work, say that they would happily do the purchaser's work because they know their interests would be protected. <Col N="443" /> That is good enough.  I do not wish to be contentious but, with respect to the Minister, this is a serious issue.  It is not about preserving the privileges of the legal profession or giving a new power to building societies: it is about ensuring that, first, the claims made for this section, which is that it will reduce the cost of conveyancing, have some substance to them and, second, it is about ensuring that protections are truly placed as regards conflict of interest.  If these are not truly in place it will give rise to a great deal of litigation and create many problems in the whole conveyancing area in the future.  I invited the Minister to indicate to the House &mdash; and I again invite him to do so &mdash; to state what these protections are to be.</P>
    <P>The second matter is in regard to the regulations.  It is not good enough to tell us that the Minister for Justice will consult with all the outside interests.  I presume what he will do is look at each of the vested interests, weigh them up, give a bit to one and a bit to the other, and at the end of the day their mutual committees will be given a political pat on the head and sent away satisfied.  It is the consumer, the house purchaser and the borrower, who is somewhere in the middle of that cosy arrangement who may find that the protections he requires are not in place.  I am not interested in whether the committee of the Society of Building Societies or the Law Society are pleased with what is on offer.  I want to ensure that there are proper protections in this Bill, and I do not think it is unreasonable for us to ask that the regulations in this very important area come before this House.  Very often people's main purchase in life is their family home and if the transaction goes wrong or the protections are wrong, the people concerned may be affected for the rest of their lives.  I do not see this as any less serious for the management of someone's family and their affairs than, for example, the provision in the Water Pollution Bill.  The Minister was quite happy to include a provision in section 2(b) of the Water Pollution Bill which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Where it is proposed to make regulations under this subsection, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>If it is appropriate to bring regulations under the Water Pollution Bill formally before this House for debate and approval before they become law.  I fail to understand why regulations of even more far reaching importance in the context, not of solicitors and building societies but in the context of the purchases of homes, which are designed to provide protections against recognised conflicts of interest should not require a formal debate and approval in this House.  The Minister well knows that the negative mechanism with regard to regulations does not work and I fail to understand why he cannot come along with us on this amendment.  I fail to understand why the Minister opposed an earlier amendment to the Bill which required affirmation of regulations on the grounds that it would clog up the House it always had to approve regulations.  If the Minister provides for this type of provision in the water pollution legislation why should the consumer, the house purchaser, the borrower, buying their family homes, not be entitled to the similar protections of this House and why should we in this House not be entitled to see what protections the Minister proposes putting in place, be it by him or his colleague, the Minister for Justice, before this section becomes operative?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the tenure of what Deputy Shatter is looking for in his amendment.  The nature of conveyancing, because of the magnitude of the purchase which somebody contracts to buy, is of serious concern.  It is obvious in a competitive mortgage market, to which the Minister referred earlier, that some mortgage houses, including building societies, will throw in as a loss leader free legal services.  Obviously that is going to be there.  I know the Minister <Col N="445" /> will say that they will not be allowed to do so but I believe they will.  There will be &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money and all sorts of other things involved.  This will be a consideration and some people will be looking at this Bill not in regard to what it requires them to do but of how they will get around it, as they do with every Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is asking us to confer this power on building societies.  The Labour Party and I fundamentally support this proposal.  However, the Minister is saying he will not tell us in detail until the regulations are published how this power will be exercised.  He is asking us to abide with him so as to allow him to publish the regulations and if we do not like them we can bring in a motion to annul them in the Oireachtas.  I do not think that is sufficient in this instance.  In response to what Deputy Shatter said, why is the Water Pollution Bill open, democratic and consultative but this Bill is different?  I am not putting any adjectives on it, it is simply different.  I suggest that this Bill was drafted by another section in the Custom House who have a different attitude to these matters.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons it is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment which requests the Minister to alter the provision whereby the regulations would have to be introduced into this House and approved, rather than be annulled &mdash; it is the positive rather than the negative approach &mdash; I suggest that the Minister would be well advised to take on board the proposal put forward by Deputy Shatter in this respect.  We will not necessarily be calling a division on Committee Stage on this point but if there is not some constructive and positive response on Report Stage we will have to review our position.  The Minister is changing very much the fundamental nature on which the conveyancing of residential property in the main could be effected in this country.  It is right and proper for the protection of the consumer and the citizen, to whom Deputy Shatter referred, that this House would have sight of the regulations.  It may very well be that if <Col N="446" /> the regulations are satisfactory there will be no need for a debate in this House and they can go through by agreement. However, if it is appropriate for the Minister for Justice to come in here and discuss the regulations in relation to the selling of liquor in restaurants, I think it is appropriate for him to do so in relation to conveyancing.  I urge the Minister to take on board the spirit of the amendment put forward by Deputy Shatter in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of points.  With regard to the principle of the changes that are proposed in the conveyancing arrangements, I have no problem.  The essence of the present procedure is that it is unduly expensive and is already a duplication of work.  There are some risks certainly but I think that on balance the public would welcome what is being given to them, which, as I understand it, is a choice.  This is a point which has not been made.  As I understand it, nobody is compelling anybody to use a specific solicitor proffered by a building society.  If the purchaser of a property so wishes he or she can get their own solicitor.  The main concern which is expressed to me is the high fees which are charged by legal interests in assisting people to purchase their homes.  I have no doubt that if people have a choice they will opt to use a building society's solicitor.  In the interests of keeping costs down, and accepting the reasonable integrity both of the building societies and most members of the legal profession, it is not courting disaster to suggest that this is a reasonable course of action for them to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the regulations which will follow are important in instituting safeguards but we should bear in mind that the initiative for the proposed arrangement, as I understand it, does not come from the building societies but may come as a result of an interdepartmental document entitled <i>Discussion Document on Legislative And Regulatory Arrangements In Relation To Building Societies</i><Col N="447" /> which was published in April 1986.  Paragraph 5.14 of that document specifically refers to this situation and states:</P>
    <P>The situation concerning conveyancing is unsatisfactory.  At present three solicitors i.e. for the vendor, the purchaser and the society are involved in the typical building society loan transaction, and typically, three scale fees are charged.  While the building societies feel that they need to have legal representation in the transfer of title to protect the interests of their depositors, the duplication of work as between the purchaser's solicitor and that of the society is very wasteful.</P>
    <P>The document goes on at some length to suggest that some modification of that unnecessary duplication is desirable.</P>
    <P>So far as I can ascertain what is being proffered here is greater choice, more efficient and speedier resolution of questions of title and cheaper house purchase. If someone does not want that, they can go the traditional way.  That is not unreasonable.  I have no doubt the reason that has emerged in this fashion is the cost of solicitors' fees over the years.</P>
    <P>The regulations are fairly essential in this case.  I do not believe it is necessary to go as far as having the Dáil vote on regulations.  If they are published and found to be unsatisfactory by any Member or any party here they should have no problem &mdash; particularly within the present political logistical arrangements &mdash; of bringing an appropriate measure before this House to give the issue centre stage.  In the meantime, it seems to me that the move essentiallly is progressive, affords people greater choice and makes for cheaper, and hopefully, more efficient purchase.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I thought the Deputy was saying that was now the position because the situation has changed since then.</P>
      <P>I contend there are grave dangers enshrined in the provisions of this Bill. Indeed, the Minister is on record as stating that he had some reservations about the way property values are going, particulary in the capital but throughout the country, in that house prices are rising at an alarmingly rapid rate.  The circumstances evolving mean that a boyfriend and girlfriend planning on marrying, trying to buy a house, irrespect of their savings, their incomes &mdash; let us assume they are in the middle income bracket &mdash; will experience grave difficulties in house purchase.  Even taking their combined salaries into account current house prices in Dublin will mean that, on their paying, say, £50,000 or £60,000 for a house in Dublin they would hardly be able to go out for a drink on a Saturday evening on account of the amount they will have to repay on their borrowings in order to purchase their home.  It is alarming and the Minister is as aware of it as I and others in this House.</P>
      <P>Indeed, these circumstances are evolving at a time when there is little or no house building being undertaken by local authorities nationwide.  I predict there will be a serious housing crisis in this city. I say to the Minister that, frankly, he is making a bad situation worse with this Bill.  I will explain why I put it in that manner to the Minister.  We have seen circumstances develop nationwide of large numbers of supermarkets taking complete control of the grocery trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the provisions of section 21 in conjunction with those of sections 31 and 32 I predict we are heading into a position in which there will be a complete monopoly of land and development, auctioneering and conveyancing services by building societies. Henceforth the danger will be that building societies will be in a position to purchase and develop land, build houses, auction houses and, on having auctioned houses, can carry out the conveyancing, <Col N="450" /> provide the necessary finance and insurance, etc.  Putting all those services into the one basket constitutes a grave danger as I see it.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the powers being given to building societies are much too extensive.  If this Bill is passed in its present form I predict we will live to regret it.  I predict that building societies will have total control of a major portion of lands and housing here, that is, owned totally and controlled by them.  I do not think that will be good.  Not alone will they have total control but I predict that independent advice will have gone out the window.  That is a very real danger. It is not good enough that a building society can buy land on which they build a house, sell that house, carry out the conveyancing, provide the finance and insurance as well, all of those transactions being carried out by the one entity, but building societies will have a vested interest in increasing their revenue and profits.  The inherent danger will be that Seán Citizen will be the poorer and, in the long-term, the sufferer.</P>
      <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to reconsider the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the conveyancing services.  For example, if he wanted to improve things somewhat there are a number of options open to him.  First, the Conveyancing Acts could be scrutinised.  Delays in the Land Registry cause people endless trouble with regard to bridging finance and obtaining loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider how the position could be improved, particularly in regard to the Land Registry and the delays occasioned there which are causing people many problems.</P>
      <P>It is my firm belief that the proposals contained in Deputy Shatter's amendment are wise and necessary &mdash; that the regulations he proposes be fully and properly scrutinised by this House.  It would be essential that this House would pass judgment on them.  I refer now to the services of solicitors and auctioneers. I am referring specifically to the regulations in regard to conveyancing because they cover such a wide area.  It is most important that they be examined.  As Deputy Shatter's amendment says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft of the regulations the Minister proposes making pursuant to <Col N="452" /> this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>It is essential that they be approved by each House.  Fundamental changes are being made here and the repercussions will be felt for a long period.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment would like to ensure that the legislation he is bringing in today would be properly looked at.  We would all be failing in our duty if those draft regulations were not passed by this House.  It is in the interest of the consumer that they be discussed and passed by the House.  If that is not done I envisage a serious situation developing in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to Deputy Enright that the Minister for Justice is answerable to the House for all matters related to his brief and to regulations made by the Minister as well.  I agree with Deputy Enright that this is fundamental and important legislation.  I would also like Deputy Enright to recognise that the Bill is full of controls.  I would refer him to section 35 where he will get a good idea &mdash; and it is specifically stated &mdash; why a building society cannot offer or make a housing loan to a person subject to a condition in regard to any other services that it is providing.  That is the kind of fundamental control that is there and the Deputy has not recognised that, regrettably, at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating is correct in saying that the purchasers do have a question of choice.  He is also right when he states that considerable unease was expressed by a number of people and by Members of the House over the years about fees and delays and all those matters to which he referred.  There has been some improvement in that regard.  Deputy Enright accepted that there was some improvement in that area.  To my knowledge there is evidence to suggest that solicitors are providing better and more reasonable services.  Much of that has come in advance of this legislation being <Col N="453" /> passed but may be contingent on it.  I am pleased with that.</P>
    <P>I have dealt very carefully with the question of the conflict of interest.  The legislation is framed in such a way as to ensure that these matters do not arise and particularly in subsection (4) to which Deputy Shatter referred.  Before I deal with that, let me refer to the specific matter referred to by Deputy Quinn in relation to loss leaders.  That is written specifically into subsection (12), which adequately covers the important matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) outlines some of the areas which the regulations to be made under subsection (1) might cover.  This list is certainly not exhaustive or compulsory but it serves as a guideline to explain the thrust of the section as a whole in that regard.  I would like to refer to a few of the eight guidelines that are considered individually in that area and to which Deputy Shatter was anxious that I refer.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (a) of subsection (4) in addition to subsection (3) the regulations may identify other possible conflicts of interest and provide accordingly, for example, where a society has an arrangement with another person for the introduction of clients to or by the society.  That would be covered under the regulations.  Under paragraph (b) people who currently employ solicitors to do their conveyancing enjoy the protection of the Incorporated Law Society's compensation fund.  In addition, most solicitors now have professional indemnity insurance.  In fact, it may be mandatory on them at this stage.  Certainly, it was heading in that direction a couple of years ago.  The regulations will certainly be making some provision in this area such as requiring a society to provide indemnity insurance or a bond, perhaps, guaranteed by an insurance company.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c) the regulations will also stipulate that a certain percentage of the staff engaged in providing the service be qualified solicitors and that qualified people would oversee the operation generally.  Deputy Shatter was concerned about that and it is reasonable to <Col N="454" /> state that to him as an undertaking, or an understanding, of what the regulations will deal with.  The regulations might otherwise lay down qualifications of personnel involved generally.  This provision is necessary to ensure that a high standard of conveyancing is maintained, and we all accept the need for that.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) it is possible that the regulations would preclude societies from providing conveyancing services to certain classes of persons, for example, owners of commercial property or corporate persons.  This is included as a contingency provision.  At this stage I would not see the initial regulations confining the service in any way.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (e) the regulations might also restrict the power to the provision of services of a prescribed description, for example, residential property. Again, this is a contingency provision which I do not envisage being involved in the initial regulations.  Under paragraph (f) it may be necessary to restrict conveyancing to societies of a certain size, for example, by reference to total assets.  Small societies may not be in a position to generate the volume of business required or have the financial resources to employ sufficient numbers of qualified staff.  The qualifying limit, if any, has not been decided yet but will have to be considered before the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (g) the regulations might give the Minister for Justice power to prescribe scales of fees, charges etc. for conveyancing services in the case of societies while recognising that solicitors fees are already governed by Statutory Instruments.  All in all those are some examples which Deputy Shatter was anxious to know about.  They are not exhaustive by any means and after consultation it may be necessary for the Minister for Justice to go further than that or even to be more restrictive.  They give an indication of what I would expect to be catered for in the regulations.  In relation to the question of bringing them in here I must conclude that Deputy Keating's point is made for me in that regard.  I do <Col N="455" /> not see it as necessary to have all these matters dealt with in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Quinn's support on this amendment.  In a nutshell he is right in saying that the Minister is making a mistake.  I asked the Minister to outline, in general terms, what sort of things he envisaged arising under section 4 because of the complexity of the different possibilities things that could arise and the different options that the Minister for Justice may have regarding whether he excludes different types of conveyancing or the extent to which the service may or may not be restricted. The Minister for Justice might have to lay down scales of fees.  It seems to me that what we are proposing is a fundamental change, the beneficial effects of which I am extremely sceptical of.  Nevertheless, if we take it on its face value and take it that it can contribute to the lowering of costs &mdash; in the long term I do not believe it will &mdash; it seems to me that where there is a recognised conflict of interest the regulations which would have to be made here are sufficiently serious to warrant consideration by this House prior to their being approved.  Regulations made, subject to a negative resolution, becomes law automatically 21 days from its being laid before this House.  Deputy Keating is of the view that because of the current political make-up of the House that is not necessarily important.  This Building Societies Act may be with us for decades and the current political make-up of this House may be an irrelevancy to the period during which it operates.  I think the Minister is making a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is proposed as a constructive amendment.  It is not proposed to get the Minister offside, there is no hidden political motive behind it; it is <Col N="456" /> merely there to ensure that this House can act as a legislator.  If the Minister, as a legislator, had additional subsections in this Bill spelling out the details of these protections it would not be necessary for regulations of this nature to be made and it would not be necessary for them to be approved by this House.  In the absence of the Minister being willing to either accept the amendment, or even say that he will give it consideration on this side of Report Stage, I personally do not care whether this is an amendment the Law Society was not seeking or whether it is an amendment that the building societies were not seeking.  Our job is to protect the people for whom this legislation is designed to provide protection and a better service.  Our job is not to protect the vested interests of building societies or solicitors or lawyers.  I am not satisfied with the Ministers response on this.  It is quite clear that the Minister has no clear idea yet as to the final detail that will be included in these regulations.  He has very fairly listed for us a number of possibilities and said that some may be included and some not.</P>
    <P>I do not know the thinking of the Minister for Justice and ultimately it is the present Minister's colleague in the Department of Justice who will make that decision.  The Minister for Justice is not present today to indicate his thinking on this.  The Minister for the Environment has suggested that reforms of the Solicitors Acts may impinge on this area also.  It is a very unsatisfactory way to deal with a fundamental change in our legal system which goes back centuries.</P>
    <P>I am all for reforming our system, but this House should know the nature of the legislation it is enacting.  I do not believe we know it in the context of our passing this provision.  In the circumstances, I have no choice buT to move amendment No. 29 unless the Minister wishes to indicate to us that he will give consideration to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter is discussed by this House at some future date, this amendment should be accepted.  It is reasonable and straightforward.  The <Col N="457" /> different types of safeguards that will be included can be set out in those regulations. As Deputy Shatter has rightly said, the structure of the whole process will be changed by this Bill.  We must have concern for all sides.  However, the main concern of this House must be for the ordinary individual, the ordinary husband and wife.  The family home is the most important possession of any family. Building societies are huge institutions and the ordinary person can feel intimidated by them.  They are told to sign here and sign there and on occasion, many have not a clue what they are signing.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has outlined, there will be a ratio of qualified solicitors in these building societies.  In the city of Dublin and right across the country, people have been used to going to the family solicitor to discuss these matters and the loss of this advice, coupled with having to deal with a large institution, brings a very real danger.  The change that we are looking for does not affect this Bill to any real extent.  It is a small enough change.  It proposes that the draft regulations should be brought before this House and passed by it and it is important that that should be done.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is the Minister himself, or his Department, or the Government, who is responsible for rejecting this amendment.  If the Minister turns down this amendment he will be proceeding into the unknown, where there is a very real danger.  He knows the situation with regard to problems relating to family homes.  The existing safeguards will be reduced.  We have seen the problems of farmers and private home owners who have run into difficulties, are unable to pay their debts and have had their family homes sold over their heads.  We have all read about such cases in the Sunday newspapers.  That bad situation can be further aggravated by not including some safeguards and not providing independent advice.  Whether it is a wife signing away her rights, or a husband, or both, there is a very real danger when they do not have an independent person advising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that I speak on <Col N="458" /> behalf of the solicitor's profession, but I am speaking here as a public representative and as somebody who has seen these problems first hand.  I have seen the hardships experienced, going back quite a number of years.  We must try to avoid making an already bad situation worse with people buying houses they will not be able to pay over the years.  A building society may make an error of judgement, but the house is there for that society to repossess.  There is nowhere for the private person to go. Solicitors and auctioneers may be friendly, meet people socially on a regular basis, and they can advise somebody against a certain purchase.  We are flashing a red light at the Minister here today and he should be wise enough to stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell Deputy Quinn that I want this procedure to happen. That encompasses much wisdom.  I am taking precautionary measures to make sure it does happen.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Justice has enough experience and expertise available so far as conveyancing procedures and matters of family law protection are concerned to make the right regulations in this regard. If the situation arose where an accumulation of these regulations required the Minister for Justice to be returning to the House with every single one of them, it would be just as simple to have new legislation in a new format.  It is not going to happen and consequently I cannot accept that it is necessary to do as Deputy Quinn wishes.  The details are for the Minister for Justice and I am satisfied that it will be properly done.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the contributions, one would imagine that somehow things can be slipped through to the disadvantage, or detriment, of either side in this matter.  I do not accept that.  When regulations are made, if somebody wishes to change them, and they are worth changing, the facility is available to them rather than the alternative method virtually of bringing in amending legislation every time this is attempted.  I cannot accept the amendment, I am sorry.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (12) of section 31 is designed to ensure that building societies do not use conveyancing as a loss leader.  If they did, instead of providing increased competition in this area, they would in a short time bring to an end the conveyancing services being offered by the legal profession and leave two or three large building societies in a monopoly position.</P>
      <P>The Minister might comment on how the accounting operation will work in practice as opposed to theory.  Building societies currently invest large sums of money on advertising their interest rates and their loan opportunities.  These advertisements do not always accurately portray the position to the ordinary person in the street who does not always understand the nuances of advertising on a two-year basis for gross sums of net sums, with or without the deduction of tax.  What will be the position of the building society who decide to take over a major chunk of the conveyancing market and, while advertising their lending services, ensure that a portion of the advertisement reveals the wonderfully efficient conveyancing services they will provide? In the context of building societies having far more money available by way of resources to advertise in this way, how will we work out what portion of this advertisement is a cost relating to conveyancing or a cost relating to new loans? The Minister might shed some light on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might also clarify a matter which has been of some puzzlement thoughout the debate today.  He has deployed one of two types of argument when particular issues have been raised. The argument he has deployed to oppose some amendments is that he wants to provide an even playing pitch, allowing building societies and banks to compete <Col N="462" /> from a position of equality.  He has used that argument to object to certain amendments. Speaking on other amendments he has said that building societies have a unique role to play in providing housing finance and this is why this Bill provides this or that provision.  Which of those two arguments does the Minister deploy in explaining why in this legislation he extends to building societies the power to carry out conveyancing when his colleague in Government, the Minister for Finance, has not extended a similar facility to banks? The Bank of Ireland will be all right because they have the ICS as their building society.  I could understand why that bank would raise no objections in this area.  It may be that AIB and other major banks do not see conveyancing as any great advantage to them and are hoping the building societies will trip themselves up by getting into this area.  On the basis of the even playing field argument, one would have expected that if the exception was to be made to the controls imposed by the Solicitors Act, 1954 by allowing building societies to carry out conveyancing, the banks would be given a similar power.  The Minister might explain why building societies should get preferential treatment in this area and why the banks should be treated differently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why this has been raised.  It is not relevant.  The section gives the Minister for Justice powers to make regulations enabling building societies to provide conveyancing services. As the societies have been heavily involved in the purchase and sale of houses throughout the years, it is only logical that any consideration of the extension of their powers should include giving societies the opportunity to provide legal services associated with those transactions.  Although I recognised that <Col N="463" /> there might be some risks in allowing societies to provide conveyancing services, the Government came to the view that those risks could be minimised and that on balance the societies should be allowed to compete in that area. However, the section contains very important safeguards because it was recognised that we would have to be careful since it was such a big change.</P>
      <P>The safeguards are aimed at ensuring that the public is protected from any conflicts of interest that might otherwise arise and that adequate compensation will be available against negligence, dishonesty or anything of that nature and that the standard of conveyancing does not suffer. That is inherent in the whole thrust of that legislation.  It does not directly confer on societies the power but it sets the framework within which the regulations to be drawn up by the Minister for Justice will operate.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Justice has all that expertise available to him to enable him to make regulations that will deal adequately with this.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister for Justice, the Central Bank and the Minister for the Environment will have consultative roles in the formulation of the regulations and the bank will have the ongoing supervisory function, as with all the power exercised generally by societies.</P>
      <P>In regard to the conflicts of interest, the society is absolutely prohibited from acting for both parties to a transaction while the regulations to be drawn up may provide further prohibitions in that regard as well.</P>
      <P>The question of loss leading and other unfair practices was referred to.  The section makes specific provisions for keeping separate accounts relating to the provision of conveyancing and the requirement that such services are not to be provided on a loss making basis, and that was a genuine fear.</P>

      <P>Because it is such a short piece of string, the controls are everywhere. The building in of controls took the longest time when framing this legislation. It was easy enough to write what one wanted to allow the societies to do. The difficulty arose in making sure to provide sufficient protection for the consumer and for the societies themselves. Protection for the societies is what exercised me initially because once they were protected against making mistakes and taking risks in areas where they do not have the experience or expertise, we were in fact ensuring the consumers' interest as well.  Taking all that into consideration, we have it right.</P>

That is the point I am making.  In the framework of enabling building societies to go from a one product operation to a multi-product operation, it is to be assumed that there will be benefits of efficiency and cost effectiveness that, in the natural run of things, will be offered to the customer on the open market.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave me a very brief reply when I asked why we are <Col N="465" /> giving this power to building societies but not to banks.  He said we are not dealing with a banking Bill.  Deputy Keating seemed to regard this as something of a revelation in the sense that he thought this was an obvious reason; but the Minister is part of the Government and the Government have made a policy decision to provide building societies with a level playing field <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks.  The Government have then gone on to give building societies what are perceived to be advantages that the banks do not have by extending to the building societies powers to carry out conveyancing.</P>
      <P>Is it part of Government policy to extend similar powers to the banks? If that is the case, why was it not in the Central Bank Act?  At an earlier stage the Minister tried to indicate that the need to provide a level playing field was the philosophy behind this Bill.  Indeed, it is a philosophy that we support.  I do not understand whether or not it is Government policy that financial institutions other than building societies will be extended the power to carry out conveyancing.</P>

At the bottom of page 34, section 32 (4) it says that no employee of a society, a subsidiary or other associated body of which provides services under this section, shall act as agent etc.  Am I to understand it that the current practice whereby some directors of building societies can also act as estate agents and auctioneers for building societies will now <Col N="467" /> be barred as a consequence of the coming into power of this provision?</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) provides that an employee of a society may not act as an agent for a subsidiary of a society that provides services under this section. This is a necessary safeguard to prevent the blurring of lines and confusion in the public mind in relation to the provision of the services.  For example, a society may be required to provide services under the section through a subsidiary as a means of minimising conflict of interest situations, so it is necessary to ensure that employees of societies do not dilute the effect of the requirement by actively working as agents for the subsidiary.  The subsection does not prevent the society from acting as agent for the subsidiary. There is no such prohibition on agency law.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to section 35 and to the prohibition on the linking of services on earlier occasions. Could he clarify how this section will be policed in the context of conveyancing? A building society may say that their making a loan available to a person does not depend on him availing of their conveyancing services, but that they will make the loan available a lot quicker if the person uses their solicitor rather than an independent solicitor.  In the way of <Col N="468" /> the world, when a building society is trying to establish a niche in the conveyancing market, there is a very real possibility that such a development could take place.  The offer is not conditional although someone may know implicitly that he will be on bridging finance for much longer if he does not use the building society's solicitor.  Will the Minister explain how this section will be policed to ensure that a fair service is provided on all sides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a grey area here as there is in everything.  One can only go so far in framing legislation giving protection.  If something that was not intended happens we must accept that it is not possible to cater for everything. This is a new provision seeking to prevent possible abuses of their position by societies in the housing mortgage market through practices like requiring persons obtaining loans to use the other services provided by the society, such as auctioneering, conveyancing or financial services. The section does not prohibit the societies from advertising the availability of a range of services.  It prohibits them from making it a condition of a loan that a borrower must use, for example, conveyancing services provided by the society.  The section does not prohibit the building society from making an offer of a loan, other than a housing loan, on condition that the borrower would use the services provided by the society or a subsidiary.  This provision is confined to housing loans because that is the sector of lending in which building societies would be in a position to abuse their power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this is an infirmity in this whole thing?  On section 31, I talked about the need to have protections in place.  If it is now accepted that a building society may use their monopoly position in the housing market to indicate that one will only get efficiently processed mortgages if one uses their services, the consumer may benefit in the short term, but there is a <Col N="469" /> very real danger that the building societies will create a monopoly in conveyancing and operate a far more restrictive practice with a good deal less competition than there is now with solicitors operating conveyancing on a monopoly basis.  At least, now one has a choice between 3,000 different solicitors. I want the Minister to consider my constructive suggestions for Report Stage.  In later sections of the Bill which I will not address now the Minister has introduced certain mechanisms which could be regarded as consumer protection provisions. The only way to ensure that building societies do not abuse the new powers they have been given so that within a few years they can operate a monopoly charging uncompetitive fees, is to appoint some form of building society ombudsman to whom an agreed person could complain.  This person would not play the role of the Central Bank or of the Minister.  A person who felt unduly pressurised by building societies to take up some of these other services on offer, but refused, the offer and subsequently discovered that things had gone unaccountably wrong, could register a complaint and the ombudsman would have a role which could be played by either a Government Minister or the Central Bank, in protecting the consumer. In the light of difficulties that people have had with building societies over the years it might be a breath of fresh air to appoint a building society ombudsman who could play a role in dealing with the type of problem to which I have referred, which the Minister fairly admits is a grey area, which the Bill does not provide for in its substantive provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to the view that no such institution as a building society ombudsman could operate efficiently unless the law is there.  An ombudsman would be helpless unless he could function within certain legal parameters, obtaining legal entitlements for individuals.  If there is a weakness in the law, it should be dealt with at that level and not by appointing an ombudsman <Col N="470" /> who would not be effective in pursuing rights which were not secured in law.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a need for protection if what the Minister has said is true.  Will the Minister say whether section 35 (2) deals with the problem raised by Deputy Shatter?  My understanding of subsection (2), which could be wrong, is that if a society offers services, they must do so without any qualifications other than the reference to price so that if a building society suggested &mdash; as Deputy Shatter said &mdash; that they would offer a more speedily available loan if a person used their solicitor, it would be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Where then is the grey area? From what I read in section 35 (2) the building societies are entitled to refer only to the cost of the service and any other qualification such as that referred to by Deputy Shatter would be illegal. Would subsection (2) not deal with the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.  I may have misled the Deputy in relation to a grey area: it was not, in so far as that section was concerned.  That problem is very adequately dealt with in subsection (2). A grey area could occur where there is a new provision.  Deputies know how, in new provisions, one tries to build in as many controls as one can.  There is always the possibility that someone will find a way around it.  That is why amending legislation comes before this House on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that subsection (2) has been referred to.  That subsection specifically would prohibit a society or a subsidiary body from lumping the fees for the services provided together.  They may be required to itemise the charges for each service provided.  This provision has been included to ensure the fees are made transparent and to inhibit societies from engaging in anti-competitive practices, such as concealing the real cost of the different services they provide to the public.  In response to Deputy Shatter, I do not see how the building societies <Col N="471" /> would be in a monopoly.  I do not see this happening.  In fact the Deputy conceded this point.  Solicitors have a long tradition in conveyancing and I do not see this changing very dramatically over the years.  I knew that a question would be asked on how complaints would be dealt with.  I can tell the House that this matter is very effectively dealt with in section 92.  I think it contains a good provision. This is a better approach than setting up any new agencies or establishing new procedures.  Section 92 would give the Central Bank and the complaints committee a role to play.  This is a good safeguard.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify a number of matters for me.  I indicated earlier that I would be raising these.  This is a substantial and very important section and I seek clarification either now or perhaps on Report Stage, whichever is covenient.  Many of the new powers to be conveyed on building societies would be subject to this section.  For example, they would have the legal authority to engage in the holding and developing of land and all of the new areas, such as financial services, conveyancing, auctioneering, investments in support of bodies corporate and so on. The Central Bank would have a role to play in monitoring and controlling these <Col N="472" /> activities.  Each society would have to make a special resolution if they decide to avail of either one or all of these powers.</P>
      <P>My first question is this: will the response of the Central Bank be a general or a specific one?  I said before that building societies should live up to their name and should not become banking societies which many of their current managements wish them to become.  If building societies get into the business of holding and developing land in a substantial way would they first have to obtain the general consent of the Central Bank or would they have to obtain the consent of the Central Bank on an item by item basis?  In other words, each time a building society wishes to participate in a property development, would they have to obtain the sanction of the Central Bank or would they be able to obtain general sanction?</P>
      <P>My second question is in connection with subsection (11) (g).  I would like the Minister to tell us what his intentions are in including this provision.  Do I take it that subsection 11 (i) has been included to avoid, to use shorthand the House would understand, some of the problems which emerged consequent to the PMPA or ICI debacles? What we are looking for is for the Central Bank, acting on behalf of the Legislature, to ensure that notwithstanding the best and benign intentions of a building society they do get out of their depth.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us how the drafters of this legislation envisage section 36 functioning.  I have my own impression as to how it would function but I would like the Minister to tell us how he would see it functioning.  As I said, it is the gearbox for the new engine of powers the building societies would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier Deputy Quinn was gracious enough to indicate that he would be raising these matters.  He wishes to know the way in which the Central Bank would discharge their functions under section 36.  Under this section they would have a dual role to play.  The first aspect of their role would involve the regulation <Col N="473" /> of societies in that the bank would be concerned to see that the procedures outlined in the special resolution and so on were adhered to correctly and that the consequent alterations to the memorandum were registered.  That is an important point.  The second aspect of their role would involve the prudential supervision of societies.  In this respect the Central Bank have been afforded quite a considerable degree of flexibility for the very reasons the Deputy mentioned.</P>
      <P>Subsections (10) and (11) provide that approval to exercise any power may be given subject to conditions.  A lengthy list of conditions is included in subsection (11) as the Deputy is aware.  These include the power to impose a condition that a society seek particular approval for particular investments.  This may be necessary in certain circumstances, particularly where the regulatory authority would say &ldquo;be careful&rdquo;.  Specific approval would be required before a specific job of work could be undertaken. This is wise.  On the other hand, subsection (5) would enable the bank to give blanket approval subject to general conditions. Both provisions would be in place and they could exercise either.  I think it is important that there be flexibility.  This is a good control and safeguard to apply in the initial stages.  Obviously, as time goes on it may not be applied as consistently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  What I am trying to find out is whether the Minister is satisfied that the Central Bank would have the necessary qualifications to exercise this function. They did not have them when we came to a bank which shall remain nameless. Perhaps we are that much wiser now and the bank in question which is highly regarded in financial circles will respond. I hope they take on extra staff.  It may well be that Part IV of the Bill, relating to the control and supervision of the building societies by the Central Bank, covers this but my real fear is for the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> Many people have deposits with building societies who now think that these institutions are to become the eighth economic wonder of the world.  While I hope that will be the case for some of them, the reality is that it will not be for most of them.  They will possibly speculate or take risks with depositors' money. Depositors put their money into building societies for a variety of reasons, one being that it is a very safe safety box. If, for example, the Central Bank get it wrong and allow a building society to embark on a path of investment or provision of service which turns out to be unprofitable and loss making, what redress will the depositor have?  If building society X embark with a great fanfare on a course of investment requiring capital injection and turns out disastrously unsuccessful and, to regain solvency, the society have to increase rates of interest, will the depositor be protected?  I may not be expressing myself very clearly and I may not have all the technical language correctly in place, but my fear is that if you allow building societies to speculate, to play a market or to take risks in a manner which they are not currently allowed to do and risk depositors' money, will the depositors be required, for example, through the mechanism of subsection (3) to participate in this?  I may be anticipating further sections.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of questions I have but I will not take up the time of the House.  I am sure the Minister understands my concern.  If the Central Bank make a mistake and the building societies, through no fault of their own, but just by misreading the situation, get it wrong, what redress will be available? Can a depositor know in advance what the redress will be if a building society embark on this course?  Can depositors safeguard themselves?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The quick answer is that the depositor will know because it will require a special resolution on every single item.  I agree that it gives the Central Bank considerable powers and they will certainly have to take on people with more expertise if they feel that their <Col N="475" /> present expertise is inadequate in certain matters.  They will have to deal with this urgently if they need extra advice. However, the Central Bank have years of experience in banking supervision, they are a supervisor of the highest standard and recognised as such.  They have an experienced corps of banking supervisors which will form a sound foundation for the supervision of the societies.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the recently published Central Bank Bill the bank had been reorganising and strengthening their structures in this area.  I am assured that further resources will be devoted to that area.  The bank have already been working in close co-operation with the Department in the drafting of the Bill so the Deputy can take it that they are fully aware of what is involved from the point of view of control and the supervision of societies.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that each of the specified new powers available to a society must be adopted by the society by special resolution before they can be exercised by the society or even an associated body attached to the society.  It is envisaged that societies will adopt, as they consider necessary, each of the power by a separate, special resolution which may also provide for limitation or restriction on the exercise of the power. It is required to record each adoption in the memorandum for the purpose of informing the general public and for the purposes of section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) is intended to ensure that the members of the society are fully informed of what the adoption of a power will mean for the society, by requiring the society to circulate with the notice of the special resolution a description of the service to be provided or activity to be undertaken by the society.  The statement circulated will also spell out the financial implications such as the likely costs and income arising from the activity and if it is likely to have any effect on mortgage lending.  The Central Bank may specify other information to be sent to the members in connection with the proposed activity.  It is a good wide provision <Col N="476" /> as far as protection for the members and their knowledge of everything contemplated on their behalf is concerned.</P>

      <P>That woman was involved in the most recent event and I do not wish to express preference for any person in particular.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he introduce an amendment on Report Stage requiring that there be a minimum of at least one woman as a director of each building society.  One could suggest that there should be an equality of men and women but no doubt if I did that I would be accused of interfering with the prerogative of the members to vote.  I am raising this matter because it seems to me that building societies remain one of the last bastions of male privilege in the way they are run.  It seems to me that they are very much a closed shop, a club, run by the directors of the society who seek to effect each others re-election whenever <Col N="479" /> their term of office comes to an end.  It is time that the cobwebs of the last century were blown out of the board rooms of our building societies and we recognised that women have a role to play.  I am not talking about bringing one woman in as a token public relations exercise by a building society.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is a need for some positive discrimination in regard to this and I invite to consider bringing forward an amendment to this section or, if appropriate, another section in the Bill, to ensure that each building society is at the very least required to have one woman as a director on the board of that society.  There are so many women of talent here that I do not believe it would be impossible for building societies to have women directors on their boards.  It is quite extraordinary that we have but one woman on the boards of our building societies and that she was invited to become a director.  She is the first woman to be appointed to the board of a building society in all the years we have had such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this is an unusual matter to raise and I have no doubt that the Minister will tell me we do not require the banks to appoint a woman to such a position and that he will ask me why building societies should be obliged to do so.  I appreciate that he may argue back to me that the closed nature of building societies will no longer apply in the new environment, that they will be more open, that the members will have more say and that there will be more controls as to voting patterns at annual general meetings.  He may say that if building societies go public the shareholders will have a role to play.  I understand all that but I do not believe that ten years down the road the pattern will necessarily change in the context of the board rooms of building societies being dominated by men.  Women should have a role to play and the club atmosphere and arrangements that have excluded women from playing a role on the boards of building societies should be broken up.  The House <Col N="480" /> should be seen to be expressing a view on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Going one way or another is fraught with danger when one starts mentioning females and their rights.  I understand that two females have been appointed to boards of building societies. In my view it should be left to the members to decide and this is not a matter for legislation.  At the risk of offending anybody I have to say that positive discrimination, even with the best intentions in the world, is still discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's call to the Minister to consider including such a provision on Report Stage.  I should like to give notice that I intend to table such a proposal for the Minister's consideration.  I am not trying to grab a headline but if one looks at the household formation of our society over the next 15 to 20 years one will see that the demand for houses will be from single people and, predominantly female.  They are not adequately or properly represented.  In fact, in many instances they receive outrageous treatment from some financial institutions.  Only the raw winds of commercial competition have put manners on some of the banking institutions and taken away some of the sexist cobwebs that exist.  The Minister should introduce a provision that will cater for the nontraditional sectors of the housing market who will be availing of mortgages in the future.  I have no doubt that the housing section of his Department will agree with what I have said about housing formation and demand for housing in the future. If the Minister communicated with the female members of his staff he would be made aware of how difficult it has been for females to get loans, guarantees and <Col N="481" /> so on for houses.  The position is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the position has improved, that there has been a conversion on the road to Damascus, but there is no doubt that it has occurred because the institutions have to meet competition.  I do not think we should depend on competition to change the position.  There are various ways we can deal with this problem and one would be to make a recommendation to the Central Bank.  However, the absence of females from senior management posts in building societies and from the boards of directors of these societies is a cause for concern.  It amounts to discrimination against people who will be major market takers in the future.</P>
      <P>In at least seven sections we have made explicit provisions on how directors are elected, their functions, how their operations should be monitored and their relationship to fees.  I accept that they are good provisions and I agree with the intent behind them.  I do not think it would take a lot more to include a provision that would cover the problem I have referred to.  Undoubtedly, this has been a cause of great concern to the ordinary punter.  Most of us were so lucky to get a mortgage, or felt so grateful to get one prior to the days of competition that we were prepared to turn a blind eye to what was the practice at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The bad old days will not return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not return.  I endorse the remarks of Deputy Shatter in regard to one woman who has tried to break through the old practice.  Having regard to the nature of the market that societies will be supplying &mdash; I hope they will continue to regard the provision of mortgage finance as their main activity &mdash; we should encourage a change in board structures.  There is no doubt that there will be many changes in the formation of households and in the way property <Col N="482" /> transfers from one partner to another after the break-up of a marriage.  In years to come more females will be seeking house mortgages and for that reason it is important that there should be female representation on the boards of building societies.  Deputy Shatter and I will endeavour to produce an acceptable formula between now and Report Stage to deal with this problem and I do not think there will be any disagreement about it. I appeal to the Minister to consider the formula that we will produce for incorporation into the provisions of the Bill between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will think about this issue but I am not contemplating including any provision in the Bill.  It may be that the pattern of those seeking mortgages will change but I must bring to the attention of the House that we have not had any complaints that females seeking accommodation by way of mortgage finance have been discriminated against.  I concede that in the past they had difficulties but competition has got rid of that.  There is no evidence of discrimination at this time.  When that take-up of female membership escalates, as Deputy Quinn suggests it will, this will be reflected in the voting strength of the members in the society.  If what Deputy Quinn said comes to pass it will be a self-adjuster and, with regard to providing for equal treatment right across the board in its finest sense, I would prefer it to happen that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer it to happen that way because it would epitomise everything so far as equality of the sexes is concerned as distinct from discriminating positively, as Deputy Shatter said, in their favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will happen without encouragement and we should look at the form of encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be out of sympathy with the principle of what my <Col N="483" /> colleagues are trying to achieve here.  If we are going to discuss, even briefly, the question of trying to ensure that there is what used to be called, and perhaps still is, &ldquo;positive discrimination&rdquo; in favour of women and trying to get a better balance, I am not clear whether we should discuss that in a broader context through a whole variety of legislation as opposed to targeting this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>My preference would be to accept that this is a problem right across the economic infrastructure and try to deal with it in a Bill specifically on anti-discrimination or positive discrimination which would deal with the issue rather than dealing with it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but a very well intended basis, in terms of this Bill.  There is a clear need to do this not just in relation to women but in relation to other categories of people who do not seem to have a proper weighting of their numbers represented at different levels of society.  I include in this, women in semi-State bodies and other agencies.</P>
      <P>The principle Deputy Shatter, Deputy Quinn and I are trying to establish is a good one, and I think the Minister accepts that.  With regard to whether we should collectively try to do something about it by bringing in a Bill specifically designed to deal with this issue, and which would cut right across every other piece of legislation, is an option I am inclined to prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this section and later sections which deal with the detailed systematic mechanics by which societies operate and select their boards, my party take the view that the more one gets into this kind of detailed refinement the less desirable it probably is.  These kinds of proposals should ideally be reflected in company law and they should be the law of the land across the board in running public companies, semi-State bodies and so on.  I do not see why &mdash; even though I know it is well intentioned &mdash; a Building Societies Bill has to lay down a law on how many directors there should be or why one director should do this, that or the other.  I believe the thrust of the Bill is to free building societies, to provide a <Col N="484" /> choice for the consumer and to provide efficiency, effectiveness and opportunities for people who operate in the financial market, and one should not regulate it unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Societies will operate, if they can, as freely as possible and maximise their efficiency, effectiveness and profitability. I do not know whether as a principle one should devote large sections of a Bill to the minute internal mechanics and ratios within a society.  I do not want to make a big deal about this; I am just saying that it is not the kind of thing I would be in favour of putting into a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Deputy said, a company law check list would apply across the board.  All this is paralleled in company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  If it is paralleled and already laid out in company law, I do not know why we have to put it in here.  I am simply making the point that companies which operate in the free marketplace should be governed by a company statute of some kind.  I do not think we should replicate that every time there is a Bill governing individual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a good idea because the whole psychology of it is to tie people within companies.  We may very well find that some tiny and fairly irrelevant subsection may ultimately act in a detrimental way to the operation of societies and, therefore, the borrowers, etc. later on.  Then it would require new legislation to change this, whereas if it was not included in the Bill in the first place, it would not be necessary. The point I am making is that we should operate only with regulations necessary <Col N="485" /> to safeguard the public interest rather than to over-regulate, which I think the State generally tends to do.  I suppose this is a basic party political point in my case, if the Minister does not mind me saying so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense this takes us back to an issue I raised previously as to whether we should have a form of building society ombudsman or what should be the structure.  This section provides a discretionary power and in subsection (1) provided that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, made after consultation with the Central Bank, require a building society to establish or join in establishing a scheme or schemes for the investigation of complaints against the society or any of its subsidiaries or <Col N="490" /> other associated bodies in relation to a prescribed matter of complaint.</P>
    <P>The subsection (2) continues that, &ldquo;the regulations may make provision in relation to any one or more of the following .....&rdquo; Then there are listed a number of things such as the establishment and administration of a scheme, the manner of appointment of an independent adjudicator to conduct investigations including the publication of the adjudicator's findings and so on.  I would ask the Minister to give us a further insight into his thinking as regards how he envisages the provisions of this section operating.  How soon would he envisage regulations being put in place?  Does he envisage the establishment of a building society complaints procedure for each individual building society or does he intend&mdash;as can happen under this section &mdash; that there be some sort of group of building societies providing a joint scheme to investigate complaints?</P>
    <P>In the context of the processing of claims would the Minister say what information would be made available to the general public?  Will we have an annual report published indicating the number of complaints that arose under the section 92 procedure and the decisions taken in relation to them?  Will we be given any insight into the generality of the problems that have emerged?  I am not suggesting one should necessarily publish the names of complainants but will we have an insight into the generality of the problems investigated and adjudicated upon in the context of the procedures provided for in this section?  What will happen if a complaint is investigated and there is a finding made?  Of course, the individual will be left to his or her legal rights to go to court, as is provided for under the provisions of section 91, but will it be part of the scheme that &mdash; where the Minister requires a building society, or a number of building societies to join together in a scheme &mdash; where a complaint is found to be valid, the building societies will be required, by regulation, to make some redress to the individual for any damage done to them, any loss suffered by them <Col N="491" /> or any distress caused them by virtue of the conduct which gave rise to the complaint?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister clarify how he envisages this working?  Again, I assume that the regulations that will provide therefor will be subject to a negative resolution of this House.  Perhaps the Minister could set out his thinking in this area, indicating what discussions, if any, he has had to date with building societies with regard to the type of scheme he envisages coming into being as a result of the provisions of this section coming into operation by way of regulation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of any such scheme have not been discussed but the principle has been discussed with the building societies.  I should like to think that a voluntary approach would be attempted first in this matter, that it would apply in a group fashion; that we would have a group approach first, hopefully, in a voluntary fashion.  If they can establish a complaints scheme voluntarily I think that would be the best way to do it.  Failing that, the Minister has the power, under the section, to require them to establish the scheme.  I envisage the building societies establishing a type of building societies ombudsman &mdash; that is the way I would envisage it &mdash; who would investigate and resolve consumer-type complaints.  I expect that the volume will increase with the number of new activities in which the building societies might become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of redress is catered for in subsection (2)(f) which says &ldquo;the circumstances in and the extent to which determinations are binding and so on.  I would see that as constituting an effective way of making it mandatory on whichever side has to do what is required if that should be deemed to be necessary in the circumstances.  It will be binding on both parties.  I would hope that that would progress fairly speedily.  The principle is agreed but the details have not yet been finalised with the building societies. It might take a little while but, hopefully, it can be attempted and <Col N="492" /> satisfactorily concluded on a voluntary basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would further clarify a number of things. First, does he envisage that there will be an individual put in place to do a job for which he will either be paid by the State or the building societies, who will, in effect, be a filter for complaints about building societies, all building societies; who will process complaints; who will have the co-operation of the building societies in having those complaints investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might consider this for a moment in the sense of how the parliamentary ombudsman would work at present.  It required an Act of the Oireachtas to give him a right of access to all sorts of departmental files and information in the context of Government Departments, or in the context of duties of local authorities, so as to ensure that the parliamentary ombudsman was not inhibited in his investigative role and was able to have access to documentation and freely report.  Is the Minister saying that the building societies have had no discussions at all with him about the detail of this? Or is he saying that, in principle, they have agreed to an individual acting in the position of a building society ombudsman; that, in principle, they have agreed <Col N="493" /> they would give this person general access to either talk to staff members of a building society, or access to files, so that that person is in a position to fully and properly adjudicate on complaints?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying he hopes that the building societies may agree to such a person coming into being or is he suggesting that each building society will have its own personal ombudsman nominated by it who might be an employee of the society and who would be given a role to respond to complaints that are made? I am anxious that we tease out this matter a little further.  More than likely the regulations will be made without this House debating them unless a negative resolution is tabled.  It is only fair that we should have some insight as to how the Minister would see it operating.  I know he says it would be his intention &mdash; I welcome this &mdash; that any decisions made would be binding.  When he said that he pointed to section 92 (2) (f) which merely says that the regulations and their provisions may state the circumstances in and the extent to which determinations are binding.  Determinations of necessity are not binding.  The regulations may say they are binding or they are not binding or that in particular instances they will be binding if particular procedures are accepted by either the complainant or the building societies.  Paragraph (f) allows the Minister to make provision, by way of regulation, for determinations to be binding.  It does not indicate that all determinations necessarily will be binding. If it is the Minister's intention that they be binding I welcome it.  It is right if you have an ombudsman type person &mdash; to use the Minister's reference &mdash; and if someone submits their complaint to him that the determinations will be binding where both parties agree to it.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) seems to suggest that where both parties agree that the determination will be binding, neither party will have resort to the courts.  I presume there is a possibility for something to be investigated with both parties &mdash; the building society and the complainant &mdash; agreeing that it be investigated, without necessarily accepting in advance that <Col N="494" /> whatever decision is made will be binding on them.  The idea is that they would accept the binding nature of it and that a procedure under section 92 would be used instead of invoking section 91 of, indeed, the general law to bring any general legal action.  Perhaps the Minister would further clarify some of the provisions in this regard.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into too much detail &mdash; as I stated, the question of the details has not been gone into to any great extent &mdash; except to say that the building societies have agreed in principle, so far as the investigation of complaints is concerned, that there should be such a proviso.</P>

      <P>No, the group approach is the one that I see as the proper one.  I would think that a responsible person would be appointed who would be paid for by the building societies.  It does not prevent people from going through the section 91 route if they so choose.  They can have their dispute determined under section 91 as provided for in the rules of the society.  If the complainant and the society agree to have a dispute decided by the scheme, established under this section, they can do so and the decision would be binding on both parties.  We are not closing off any alternative options the individual might have.  I would go for the group approach and the responsible person appointed by the society.</P>

      <P>Section 94 enables the Minister by regulation to apply to building societies provisions of the Central Bank legislation for the establishment of <Col N="495" /> a savings protection scheme.

      <P>As Deputies will be aware Part II and Chapter 5 of the Central Bank Bill, 1988, proposes to provide for the establishment and operation of a deposit protection account.  This account will be funded by the banks and will be used to provide a partial protection of deposits held by the banks for their depositors. That scheme is in line with the European Commission's recommendation of 22 December 1986 concerning the introduction of deposit guarantee schemes in the European Community.  The purpose of the section is to enable the Minister for the Environment to introduce regulations extending the proposed scheme to building societies.  This is quite appropriate as societies are also deposit taking institutions.  There is no reason to differentiate between depositors with banks and depositors with societies.  I would point out that depositors with banks and depositors with societies, in this context, will include shareholders.  This will give rise to certain modifications in the details of the scheme as it will operate in relation to societies and these will be dealt with by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) indicates what might be included in the regulations.  The list is not conclusive.  I would like it to be seen as a guide for explanatory purposes.  The regulations, among other things, provide for the transfer of a society's deposit under section 93 to the account maintained by the Central Bank for savings protection.  The level of the deposit would continue to be governed by section 93 <Col N="496" /> fluctuating in line with any changes in the level of a society's shareholding or its deposits.  The treatment of shareholdings as deposits for the purpose of the scheme will be necessary.  If only societies' deposits were covered there would be little point in extending it to societies as deposits for only 2½ per cent of the total funding.  The reality is that shareholdings in societies are savings by their very nature and as the scheme is designed to protect savers the exclusion of societies' shareholdings would be inappropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain difficulty in dealing with Part XI.  Perhaps I could ask the Minister a general question. It might assist us to complete the Bill speedily.  Section 100 is the definition section.  Part XI sets out the conversion to public limited company process, in other words, how a building society can convert itself into a plc.  There are various definitions in section 100.  The procedure to be applied is dealt with in the later sections of the Bill.  What I am now raising could, perhaps, be more appropriately raised under section 101 but perhaps you will forgive me because they are interconnected.  I would ask the Minister to set out something that in the conText of this Bill is not totally clear.  I am not being deliberately obtuse about this. If a building society wishes to convert to a plc does the procedure set out to provide for the holding of a meeting for notification and for voting to take place? If it converts itself to a plc who are the members of the building society who are making decisions in the context of voting on the question?  From earlier sections in the Bill it seems that a building society has a discretion to regard someone to whom it lends money as a member or it may not, that a depositor may be a member or he may not, that he may be an investment shareholder or he may simply be a depositor.  It seems that the building societies are given some degree of discretion as to whom they regard as members although there are procedures here for clarifying that.  This next question may be more appropriate to ask under section 101 or one of the later sections.  However, it might be helpful to clarify exactly who the members are.</P>

      <P>I do not ask the same question twice.  Who are the members? Who actually will benefit when a building <Col N="498" /> society is converted to a plc?  Who will hold the shares?  In what proportion?  If you are regarded as a member, will it be left to the management of the building society to make a general proposal to the membership? Will the Minister set out clearly, in layman's terms as opposed to the legalities of the Act, the actual methodology of operating to convert a building society into a plc?  I accept that to be a general question.  We could try taking it on an individual basis in each of the sections.  I am trying to be helpful.  Would the Minister clarify that position as we head into dealing with Part XI, so that we are clear as to how this will operate in practice?  I raised this matter on Second Stage.  There is some concern here that the manner in which a conversion may take place may result in major financial gains being made by those who control the building society directors, to the detriment of the members.  I know that there is a procedure of 100 members petitioning the High Court, but I want the Minister to set out in general the way this will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all set down in the legislation as to who have the right to vote, when they have the right to vote and what procedure and framework must be applied before a building society can convert.  It might be useful to say that there are basically two types of members of a society.  There is a member by virtue of holding shares &mdash; they will be commonly known as investing members &mdash; and a member by virtue of having a loan from the society under the repealed enactments secured by freehold and leasehold estates, or interest on a housing loan under the Bill.  They are known as the borrowing members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investing members will, under this Bill, be entitled to certain rights.  These are, the right of notice of a meeting, the right to vote and so forth if they meet certain minimum requirements such as holding £100 in shares for at least six months.  Borrowing members will not be entitled to these rights by virtue of having a loan from the society but they will have <Col N="499" /> the right to vote in the conversion resolution if they owe at least £500 to the society at the end of the last financial year preceding the date of the vote and continue to owe that amount under a mortgage at the voting date.  Both will be involved as long as they meet those minimum requirements as far as money is concerned &mdash; £100 and £500.  They are the people who would be involved in the conversion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take the Minister a stage further.  In a normal conversion operation of a business into a plc, there would be a share allocation at the time of the conversion taking place.  What happens here in practical terms? Who would hold the majority of the shares?  Who would hold the shares of the company, or who would benefit if there is a public flotation? Will some moneys be paid to the investor who has been able to vote? If you have £100 in a building society will you get a premium, or if you have £500 will you get an additional sum of money, or will you simply be entitled to take up shares in the society at a particular price? How will this operate with a particular credit? Building societies are a strange, hybrid legal animal in this area.  Would the Minister respond to those queries?</P>
      <P>Is it clearly a question of a building society management presenting a scheme? Could a scheme be presented which would secure for the directors of a building society a 51 per cent controlling interest in the shares and that because there is an extra amount of money floating through the investors, they will automatically vote yes to get that money? At the end of the day, will the management of the building society get a massive windfall gain by virtue of the fact that they will control the way the building society is being run? I am aware of the position about 100 members petitioning.  I am not clear on what presentation a building society need to make to their members in the conversion process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all pretty well set out on page 95 in so far as conversion is concerned.  All those details will have to be given; particularly, the details will have to be set out in the scheme for conversion.  It would have to be made quite clear as to who had the right to vote in the conversion process.  It is interesting to note that it will be members and borrowers, but the ratio is somewhere in the region of 6 : 1 in so far as members against borrowers are concerned.  Both will be involved in the conversion process if and when that should come to pass.  It will be set out in the scheme as announced by management.  This is stated very clearly in section 101, subsections (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>I am not at all taking a view as to whether a society should convert or not convert.  I do not think that I should be targeted in that way.  I do not propose to go into the arguments for or against conversion.  All I want to do in this Bill is to give societies the opportunity, if they so wish, to convert to plc status, if the members consider that to be the best way for the society to go forward and develop. Without wanting to put forward an opinon on the matter, I am not so sure that many will see it as a way forward in their own particular circumstances.  At least, the opportunity and the framework in legislation will be provided whereby it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature of the approach that we are adopting is to provide the framework within which a society can convert and to ensure that the members of a society are fully informed.  That is really what Deputy Shatter is getting at, that they would know what is afoot, what is <Col N="501" /> involved and what the effects or implications are if they should go down the particular road of converting.  That is the approach to which I am gearing this legislation, and also to ensure that the Central Bank have a central role in the whole process, by virtue of its supervisory responsibilities in relation to the country's financial system generally.  All those things will have to be in place and the scheme will have to set out precisely what is intended so that there will be no quick conversion just to satisfy the will of a few.  Both are involved, members and borrowers.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say with regard to the borrowing member that somebody who perhaps is slow in paying off his mortage and so maintains a higher debt over the £500 can make decisions with regard to conversion, whereas somebody who is a regular payer and gets his mortgage down below the £500 cannot?  That would mean that the person who was less thrifty or slow about paying would have an interest in what the building society would do, as against somebody who actually paid his bills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of your passing reference, Sir, let me direct the Minister to section 101 (3) (f).  This forms part of the nub of what I am trying to get at.  I accept that a scheme being presented by the management of a society would have to be accepted by the members if there is to be a conversion to plc, but that paragraph (f) is curious.  I quote:</P>
      <P>(f) specify, in the case of persons or classes of persons who are members of the society and who will be members of the proposed company, by reference to the shareholding of those persons or classes of persons in the society&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  their entitlement to shares in the proposed company, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  their rights (if any) to subscribe for shares in the proposed company, and in either case, the rights attaching to the shares,</P>
      <P>This comes back to what I am trying to clarify.  I do not think it is enough to say it would be for the society to present their proposals.  The only cohesive group within a building society are the management and the directors.  The individual members do not know each other. Confidentiality of names is preserved in the context of the Bill as it is.  It is unlikely, prior to a conversion meeting, that all the building society members will be able to get together and have a preconversion meeting to discuss the management's plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a possibility that the management of a building society can in a sense make individual depositors an offer they cannot refuse, in other words, offer <Col N="503" /> them some premium on their deposit or throw in a few shares in return for the vote for conversion to plc.  This may give the individual depositors some small financial gain while at the same time securing for the management of a building society a 51 per cent or higher shareholding, a controlling interest in the plc by virtue of the specifications required under this paragraph which could result in the controllers of the building society, the directors who control them, increasing substantially their wealth on the back of the members of the society.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that we are teasing this out sufficiently.  This is a very important issue.  I accept the Minister's statement that he is not trying either to encourage or discourage building societies converting to plcs, but he is providing the legal mechanism whereby such conversion can take place.  We must ensure that where such conversions take place there is adequate protection for the individual members of the building society and that people cannot by virtue of what is in this legislation abuse their managerial positions by abrogating to themselves large chunks of the shares of the company which is going to become a plc.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with an ordinary business or private limited company controlled by one person or two people who are going public where the position as regards the flotation is quite clear and they can make decisions.  We are dealing with a completely different type of legal animal, and I am not sure that this Bill provides protections against abuse of their position in the sense of persons in a directorship seeking to obtain large shareholdings worth substantial sums of money.  I can see the Minister's argument as to why some building societies should not go public; they may end up being swallowed up and taken over before they know what hit them, and that would be easier if they were public than if they were the sort of legal animal we have here.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to clarify the thinking here, particularly in the context of paragraph (f), the right, if any, of the <Col N="504" /> members to subscribe for shares in the proposed company.  Normally if we were dealing with a private limited company the shareholders would have a right to subscribe to shares and their right to subscribe may be related to the proportionate holding of their shares in the private company.  Here it is quite different. Here some people who are borrowing money are regarded as members, some people who have money on deposit are regarded as members, one depositor may have £100,000 in the building society and someone else may have £50 in the building society.  How does the Minister envisage this working?</P>

      <P>I want to clear that.  I accept that the section outlines how the conversion to plc takes place.  Are the arrangements for the internal convening and decision making <i>apropos</i> of that process explicit somewhere or will they be in the regulations?</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter raised a number of very valid points, his suggestion being that unless this is explicit and clear in the Bill or the regulations you may have a cabal of people within a society shifting the whole thing in favour of their interests.  Is that feasible?  I think that is the nub of the matter.</P>

      <P>Much of Part XI of the Bill was given to this item because it is so fundamentally important and that is why it was gone into at considerable length. The protections outlined there are quite considerable.  We have gone to great pains to protect members, but let us be clear on one thing: depositors are not members; the shareholders are the members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the overview that if members feel they are being discriminated against in any way they are not going to vote for the same thing.  Let us not forget that.  There is nothing to stop members getting together if they so wish.  Nothing can be rushed.  I refer the Deputy to section 101 (4) which provides that at least six months' prior notice must be given before the conversion resolution is taken on at all, bearing in mind that all the members must be notified of the conversion resolution and they must be provided with a statement in relation to the conversion, the contents of which must have been approved by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The bank must confirm a conversion scheme and aggrieved members, if they wish, can petition the High Court against the conversion.  I think there is no great fear that a management can orchestrate a conversion that is blatantly designed to enrich the directors of a society.  That is not a realistic proposition, and is not the thrust of this legislation.  I ask Deputy Shatter to accept that particularly, the certain elements of Part XI which go some distance towards making sure members are protected.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 102 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection provisions here are in effect designed to ensure that if a building society becomes a plc a predator company, to use the language of the Stock Exchange, will not gobble it up within five years.  I could envisage a position where a couple of building societies, having become public liability companies, would form the view after two or three years that it was in their interests for one to take over the other and form a larger financial institution.  There would normally be a takeover.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify how this legislation <Col N="507" /> would operate in the event of that type of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They can convert but then of course they could not be taken over for five years after that date.  This is to prevent what the Deputy has mentioned. It is also intended to prevent speculators attempting to bring about a conversion with a view to a takeover.  That is the idea behind these restrictions.  The purpose is achieved by prohibiting the company from allocating more than 15 per cent of its shares to any one person or to persons acting together or by requiring the company's articles to incorporate that prohibition for a period of five years. There has been a lot of pressure to make the period somewhat less but it is important that they can act independently for a period after conversion to plc before any change can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is to give the building societies some time to adapt to the market, but one could equally argue that if a building society was at such risk of takeover it had no business going into the market in the first place, being clearly vulnerable.  One could possibly envisage a couple of building societies going to the market and forming the view after two or three years' trading that it was in the interests of the stability of their members and their businesses that one should be taken over by the other.  I am not talking about a predator company coming in in the classic sense.  It might be in the interests of the continued viability of the two societies to effect a formal amalgamation or takeover of one by the other, having experienced the ill winds of the Stock Exchange for three years.  Is there a need for a provision in the Bill to deal with such a situation?  Let us assume a building society is converted to a plc, gets into financial trouble and that a major bank is willing to bail them out in the context of a takeover.  It is not unknown for a failing company on the stock market to be taken over by another company and to have their financial position turned around.  The provision here is designed <Col N="508" /> as a protection but it could work to the opposite effect.  There can be circumstances where it is in the interests of the members and shareholders of a company that it be taken over, due possibly to management failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with stamp duty chargeable on any instrument effecting the transfer of a share in a building society.  We have dealt at length with the need to keep down the purchase price of houses and to ensure that people do not incur unnecessary expense.  One of the largest areas of expense beyond purchasing one's house is the level of stamp duty imposed and the level of VAT on legal and conveyancing fees.  The Chair may call me out of order because this does not arise directly under this section, but I would urge the Minister to look very seriously at the application of VAT at the rate of 25 per cent on the purchase of domestic dwellings.  This should be looked at again in the context of the expense involved in home purchase.  The Minister should also look again at the question of stamp duties as they affect the house purchaser.  If we deem it desirable to exempt from stamp duty any instrument effecting the transfer of shares in a building society, one could suggest that a different approach to stamp duty on house purchase should commend itself to the Minister.</P>

I agree with the principle of the Bill and I think most people in the House would agree that it is a basic right of our citizens to conduct their business with public departments privately without being overheard or seen.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about the Bill, the main ones being as to the costs and the time span involved in the legislation.  It is suggested that this would take effect within one year.  I would have reservations about that in the context of particular Departments.  However, I feel that the legislation is basically sound and I am pleased that all sides of the House seem to be in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputy Dempsey for allowing me to share his time.  I, too, would like to applaud the Bill.  I am pleased that many speakers in this House have been very positive with regard to it.  We are all very much aware of the problems that have arisen with regard to employment exchanges, tax offices, health boards and FÁS offices.  There is nobody more aware of these problems than the Dáil Deputies who are in close contact with these agencies in the course of their work.  They are also in contact with their constituents who have problems with these agencies from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has broadened somewhat. That is to be welcomed because basic reforms are required.  Minister Leyden said he would bring many of the points raised by Deputies on all sides of the House to the attention of the various agencies, and I know the Minister for Social Welfare will do likewise.  The debate has focussed the attention of the <Col N="512" /> public and the officials on this whole question of privacy and confidentiality in our public offices.</P>
    <P>The crucial aspect is the dignity of the person.  The person who has to queue for unemployment benefit, for medical cards or whatever, does so as of right and should not feel under a compliment.  That is the thinking behind this Bill and that is why I welcome this debate.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that we get value for money.  I am one of the many Deputies who would welcome the establishment of more community advice centres and support structures locally. Many Deputies have come across expanding areas of Dublin where new council estates are built, thankfully not as large as they used to be, with roads, houses, open spaces and local infrastructural requirements in place; but what is missing, in many cases, is a local health centre or social welfare office.  I would like to see a greater availability of these services locally.</P>
    <P>To give an example: in my own constituency of Ballyboden in Rathfarnham, many single parents in particular have to walk a considerable distance to the village of Rathfarnham, in many cases bringing a baby in a pram, and queue up for various health care services or social welfare services, when these services could be provided locally.  In many cases the local community get involved, as happened in that area, to try to accommodate some of these basic services, for example, in the local school.  We could get greater value for money if we used the facilities that are already in place.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to payment by cheque.  This is something we should consider. I appreciate that there may be difficulties with that, but the Minister should think about it and try to improve the whole system.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that many positive things are happening in this area.  Many of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare have been put in place by the Government.  Only today the Minister for Social Welfare announced the setting up of social welfare service <Col N="513" /> viewpoint groups to give a formal opportunity for direct feedback to management in the Department of Social Welfare on the delivery of the social welfare service. I understand the viewpoint groups will be set up in the four main regions of the country and members of the public who receive social welfare payments will meet with the managers of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department's information service to discuss such topics as their experience of claiming and receiving social welfare and access to social welfare information.  That is a very positive development.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that 11 new employment exchanges have been built since 1985 and five new ones are planned over the next two years; seven employment exchanges have been renovated and there are restoration plans in relation to five more.  There is a new computerised self-service information service which provides general information on social welfare entitlements at everybody's fingertips which was launched recently.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is preparing proposals aimed at reforming the appeal system, in particular emphasising that the system will be perceived to be fair because that is a real problem, and Deputies in this House have pointed out again and again that there are many people out there who feel that the system is not fair.  The Minister has announced that these proposals will include the setting up of a separate social welfare appeals office and measures to improve information to applicants will be taken.</P>
    <P>All these developments are part of a plan to provide one stop shops which is the ideal structure we would all like to see, and this would allow the public access to the complete range of social welfare services at one location.  I am aware that nine local social welfare offices now have a computer link with headquarters which enables staff to key in information from sickness certificates at local level.  Tremendous moves have been made in decentralising so as to bring the services to the localities.  I am aware that the Bill refers to the type of measure that will bring the services to <Col N="514" /> the people in a more personalised and confidential way.</P>
    <P>It is important that information be made available in the most simple and direct form so that people will not have to queue up as often as they do now looking for advice and assistance.  The fact that the Minister has introduced a series of fact sheets on the improvements in social welfare in 1989 is a significant improvement, a major step forward. People can now have the facts in a more direct and simple form.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  It is a good example of how Private Members' time can be used positively and it is a good example of how the consensus in this Dáil can be used in a positive and constructive manner.  I commend Deputy Mitchell for introducing this Bill.  It has broadened the debate about the dignity of the individual who in the past has felt under a compliment, coming with a begging bowl looking for assistance.  We should put the emphasis on the right of the person to these services and on his right to be treated with respect.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Since I came into politics in 1974 I have been very conscious of the fact that generally people do not want to discuss personal matters in public.  Unfortunately they have had to do that.  I compliment Deputy Mitchell on this Bill and on the thought and time he has put into bringing this Bill before us.  I support the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government are prepared to accept these proposals and I would echo the sentiments of Deputy Kitt in that the consensus in the Dáil is working in a positive manner.  It would be a pity if that consensus were brought to an end when such good work is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill covers offices of the Revenue <Col N="515" /> Commissioners, including PAYE inspectors, and offices of the Collector General, Social Welfare offices including labour exchanges and Garda stations acting as labour exchanges, health centres and health board offices, local authority offices including rent offices, rent assessment and loans and grants repayment offices and offices dealing with complaints between neighbours and dealing with housing and housing transfer applications, ESB payments and any other public office designed by ministerial regulations. That covers a wide range of offices with which the general public deal every day.</P>
    <P>When I came into public life the first thing I noticed was that people were reluctant to communicate problems. People have a great pride and have great difficulty in saying that they are not aware of benefits to which they are entitled or that an application form is giving them difficulty.  How much more difficult is it then for these people to discuss these matters in a semi-public or public area? They do not want to queue up at a local authority office and discuss a rent repayments problem at a hatch.  I am confident that by and large officials are concerned people but they are in an awkward position because of accommodation.  Officials realise the sensitivity of the problems and sympathise with people having to look over their shoulders to see if anybody is listening.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of improvements but I am not talking about vast expenditure.  The banks are not slow to cue in to public perception and how people are thinking.  They brought in a relatively cheap means of controlling the public.  In any of the banks one can see a decorative rope barrier pointing people to where they should queue and it is obvious that people must stand a certain distance away from the counter so that they cannot overhear a transaction.  This system is not 100 per cent satisfactory because people are still visible when handling cash and when making statements but it is a vast improvement on <Col N="516" /> people crowding up to the counter overhearing and overseeing everything.</P>
    <P>The health boards are an even more sensitive area because here we are dealing with people who are concerned about medical cards, about family difficulties and so on, and who are looking for help or are complaining about the manner in which they were treated perhaps in the local hospital.  These are all sensitive matters. It would be quite simple to reorganise any of our offices.  Generally speaking, a small room could be made available so that people could do their business in private.  The fact that the person taking particulars will pass them on to somebody else does not arise.  What is important is giving privacy when a person is first communicating his problem to the authorities and breaking down the barriers.</P>
    <P>In many towns that I pass through I have noticed long queues outside social welfare offices and Garda barracks where people queue to receive their entitlements, sometimes in dreadful weather conditions without shelter.  These people have to wait there sometimes for an hour or two.  This is wrong.  It is unacceptable. People should not be degraded in that way.  After all, they are human beings; unfortunate people who have no work.  I have no doubt that 99 per cent of them are anxious to work and to have their dignity like most other people.  If these conditions are intended as a means of embarrassing people to try to drive them from the dole queues, that will not succeed. It will only create a sense of grievance and annoyance among the people and it will be hard to remedy that.  It might drive some people to commit acts which they would not normally commit. The majority are honest, decent, hardworking people who would work and provide for their families if they could get jobs.</P>
    <P>Now that there is a consensus that it is necessary to make improvements we should take a look at the position in Leinster House, in particular at the interview room at the main gate which is probably one of the busiest interview rooms in the country.  Literally hundreds of people <Col N="517" /> pass through this room each week.  In order to gain access to the House one has to call into this little office.  The most amazing thing is that a person comes in at the top of the queue.  The ushers ask them who it is they wish to see and then try to contact the person in the House.  If the Dáil Deputy or Minister who they wish to see is not available and their secretary is not aware of who they are, questions will be asked.  Perhaps these people are coming just to visit the House or to discuss a problem.  They do not want to air that problem in front of between 30 and 40 people at the front gate of Leinster House.  Making improvements there would be an indication that we are concerned and will do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Boland, when Minister, introduced a regulation that people in public offices would have to wear a name badge.  To my knowledge this regulation is not adhered to.  Even if no regulation had been introduced people in public offices should wear a name badge so that when a person arrives at a desk they know immediately with whom they are dealing and will be on first name terms with them.  If they have a complaint to make about that person's attitude then they would have the name of the person concerned.  I am not saying that this would be the case.  I have found people in the State and semi-State offices and courteous.  Occasionally we will come across one who is not and there come across one who is not and there may be misunderstandings.  Nevertheless it is only right and proper that these people be asked to wear name badges.</P>
    <P>It might be noted that the banks and various lending institutions have such a regulation.  They realise that if a person, on coming to a desk, sees the person they will be dealing with is wearing a name badge they are immediately put at ease. Obviously they see this as a means of coaxing people into the bank.  In many of our public offices the attitude may be that they do not want people coming in. Whether they like it or not, these people have to come in as they have business to conduct and they should be treated in the <Col N="518" /> same way as any other person seeking a service.  For this reason I again compliment Deputy Mitchell for bringing forward this Bill and compliment the Minister and the Government for accepting it.  However I hope that this will not be the end of it, unlike other Bills and regulations we have taken on board.  I believe that some improvements will have to be carried out within 12 months and the more difficult improvements within three years.  That is only reasonable. Some improvements may be made by making some minor alterations at little cost.  This would be a step in the right direction.  I understand that finances are tight at present but this is no excuse for doing nothing.  It does not always cost a great deal of money to bring about improvements.</P>
    <P>From time to time people express dissatisfaction with the condition of our roads and water and sewerage services and ask if money could not be spent on these services.  I agree with them but these people need a place in which to make their complaints and I am sure they would not like to do so in public.  They would be quite happy to say that they could go in to see the county secretary, the county manager or the engineer and speak to that man quietly and in private. If they have a complaint to make about pollution I am sure they would not wish to do so in public as if they had to do so generally it would get back out that so-and-so was in to make a complaint.  Privacy should be afforded to them so that they can give information and have complaints investigated.</P>
    <P>This leads me on to the position in our Garda stations.  The building in my home town of Cavan is totally inadequate. Forty men are based in what originally was a private dwellinghouse.  Literally, they are living on top of each other.  If we wish people to co-operate and help the Garda in carrying out their duties and provide information on road accidents or break-ins we should provide private rooms in which they can have a face-to-face chat with the garda on duty or with a sergeant or a superintendent.  I am sure that I am not being parochial and will not <Col N="519" /> be seen as moving away from the terms of the Bill in calling for a new Garda station for Cavan town.  One has been promised.  I hope that in the design for the new station provision will be made for a room in which members of the public may discuss a matter with a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>This may be of interest to the Minister for Social Welfare: at one stage the House agreed that 3 per cent of places would be reserved for physically handicapped people.  However this direction has not been adhered to.  State bodies and local authorities were requested to adhere to this direction but they have not done so.  I hope the present proposal will not be disregarded and that the various bodies concerned will adhere to the recommendation put to them and the necessary improvements will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I wish to support and commend the measure before the House.  It is a timely, fundamental and simple measure.  Its aim is to set a wrong right and one wonders why such a Bill has not been introduced before now.  What we are talking about is the provision of proper accommodation and the creation of the proper environment to enable John Citizen to discharge his business with the institutions of the State in a civilised and confidential way.</P>
      <P>One of the basic rights in the Constitution is the right to freedom of speech but one often feels that the atmosphere prevailing in public offices is so intimidating that people are denied freedom of speech.  It has rightly been pointed out on both sides of the House that because of the lack of privacy and confidentiality in some public offices one can take it for granted that many people walk away from their entitlements.  I do not believe that it is the intention that their business should be conducted in such an atmosphere. Nevertheless, I believe there are people who have been thwarted from seeking their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Anyone who has stood in a bank queue, irrespective of modern queueing arrangements, such as cord systems, and the efforts to have distance between the person at the end of the queue and the person transacting their business at the hatch, has felt self-conscious at some stage.  Irrespective of the state of one's bank account, people feel self-conscious and feel no matter what distance is involved the discussion is audible to the next person in the queue.  Therefore we can empathise and identify with the person who has to visit a labour exchange, a Garda barracks or a housing office to seek their entitlements.  What we want is for the weakest people in our society to know that when they go into a public office they can discuss their business in private.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by Deputy Mitchell.  This is a long overdue measure.  I also welcome the decision of the Government, after one or two hesitant speeches, to accept this measure and to examine whether it would be feasible to make the necessary improvements within the timescale laid down.  We share a common determination to provide the facilities in which the citizen can look for his rights.  We share a common determination on all sides of the House to put in place the type of institution where the citizen can look for his rights without a feeling of deprivation.</P>
    <P>I have visited a number of labour exchanges.  Some of them are models in relation to layout but, unfortunately, the vast majority are far from ideal.  This may be due to the antiquity of the building or crowd pressures.  Due to lack of finance, business is carried on in rented premises which is not the solution.  I pass through Lexlip on a fairly regular basis and I see a long, winding, snakelike queue of people waiting for their unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>
    <P>Dole day, no matter when it falls, witnesses some 240,000 people taking their place in long queues, winding their way to hatches and, by virtue of the regulations determining eligibility for unemployment benefit or assistance, having to divulge certain facts or answer questions from <Col N="521" /> the officer involved.  I do not seek to compromise the right of those officials to seek this information.  One recalls that according to the conditions governing the entitlement for unemployment benefit or assistance one must be available, ready, willing, fit and able to work.  Therefore, it is the right and duty of the person giving out the necessary claim form to find out whether the applicant fulfils the necessary conditions.  However, that very often leads to a sense of aggravation and frustration on the part of the applicant.</P>
    <P>In response to numerous questions there is very often a degree of adversarial exchanges between the questioner and the applicant.  In such conditions the least the client is entitled to is a degree of privacy in establishing that he fulfils the necessary conditions.  It is right and proper that the applicant should satisfy the conditions and ensure that the official is satisfied in relation to his eligibility.</P>
    <P>The interrogation, by its nature, must be probing and in-depth and one needs a private room in which to conduct it.  One can readily sympathise with the feelings of a first time applicant who has been self-employed or working for somebody else when he encounters the labour exchange system.  Often he feels intimidated and conscious of his reliance on the powers that be for his benefit.</P>
    <P>One must also be conscious of the fact that many elderly people are unused to the whole routine of form filling and the system that applies in a post office or labour exchange.  They feel justifiably intimidated by the atmosphere prevailing in them.  They are very conscious of the fact that other people are privy to the ensuing conversation.  This is not major legislation and would not be hard to implement.  Of course there will be physical difficulties but we welcome the fact that the Government will consider whether it can be achieved within the necessary timescale.</P>
    <P>I do not share the degree of apprehension on the other side of the House, particularly that expressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, that the cost would be prohibitive.  There is nothing <Col N="522" /> prohibitively costly in putting in place temporary shutters and ordinary glass partitions.  However, they will give the applicant the privacy which this measure seeks to achieve.  I welcome the measure and I honestly believe that when we look back at this Bill we will see that it was the instrument which stimulated all Members to ensure that we had the will, the way and the wherewithal to put in place long overdue measures which are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am standing in for the Minister for Finance because, although he would like to be here, he is engaged in the Seanad and cannot be with us.  Nevertheless, it is quite appropriate that I should be here because I am very much involved, through the Department of Social Welfare, in the whole question of the provision of privacy for our clients which was mentioned by the last two Deputies.  Sometimes when Deputies talk about these things they forget that we might have tried to do something they had in mind and that it might not be as simple as it appears at first glance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan spoke about the changing of cheques in the banks.  The banks will take pensioners' cheques, but they will not go to the banks with the cheques because most of them did not have that tradition and prefer to go to the post office.  We did surveys to find out what our clients were interested in, not what we thought they should be interested in. There was a substantial difference between the different groups of our clients.  In that survey only 6 per cent of pensioners wanted to go to banks, the bulk of them preferred the post office and the way in which the scheme operates at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also did a survey among the unemployed and found that fewer than 40 per cent wanted cheques.  They preferred cash in the hand from a local exchange. The youngest people were interested in the credit card system and would be agreeable to the transfer of cash to an account.  Of course, we would be very happy to facilitate that and all the <Col N="523" /> developments within the Department are geared to that kind of operation.  We can now produce cheques &mdash; even if people do not want to bring them to a bank and prefer an employment exchange &mdash; and we will have all the mechanisms ready to ensure that the facilities will be there to deliver a very efficient service.</P>
    <P>Just under 70,000 cheques per week are sent to people on disability benefit.  I can see the difficulty for the banks.  They will not take cheques from the unemployed because there are 230,000 people involved.  Actually, there are fewer involved because some of the people signing on do so for credits only.  We did some experiments in relation to taking cheques directly to the bank but only something in the order of 1,500 are going through the banks.  We are very interested in increasing that number but there is a certain reluctance on the part of our clients to go along those lines and there is also a reluctance on the part of the banks to take them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity tonight to address the House on this Bill. I have been following with great interest the various contributions from Members of the House and I must congratulate all the participants for the quality of the debate.  In particular, I would like to compliment Deputy Jim Mitchell for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House, for his hard work in preparing the Bill and for investing his valuable time in research into the background to this matter.</P>
    <P>One thing which has become very clear from this debate is that there is overwhelming support across the House for the principle of Deputy Mitchell's Bill.  I was interested to hear Deputy Jim Higgins ask what was missing.  He wanted to know if the will, the way or the where-withall were missing.  I should like to assure the Deputy that as far as I am concerned there is no lack of will and I am pleased to be able to report that that is true of all Members.  We know many ways of dealing with the problem and the biggest hurdle we have to face is the size of a problem that has grown over many <Col N="524" /> years.  The principle that, where necessary, all individuals should be able to conduct their business in private in public offices of Departments and State agencies is one to which the Government are fully committed.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the principle is invariably taken into account during the building of new premises and the improvement and renovation of existing offices.  There have been many improvements in the general level of service being provided to the public in Government Departments and State agencies over the last number of years including the provision of privacy facilities.  This is very apparent in my own Department of Social Welfare.  It is not enough to have a wide variety of schemes delivered to the client quickly, efficiently and with due regard to his or her dignity and rights.  Our services must be geared towards the needs of the client and not for the benefit of the administrators.  People should know that the service is there for their benefit.  This boils down to a greater emphasis on better delivery of services, better and more accessible information, better trained and caring staff and, of course, better accommodation with privacy facilities where necessary.  In general, I am talking about a more client orientated approach.  I should like to tell the House that we have give a great deal of attention to training our staff and we have established a modern training unit.  The results of that programme will be seen in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>At present many of the services which my Department administer are, in a physical sense, too remote and distant from the clients, especially those who live outside the main population centres. This barrier between the Department and their clients is often accentuated by administrative practice such as the centralisation of decision-making in headquarters in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am developing a strategy aimed at delegating more authority to the network of local offices which are already in place around the country.  A key element of that strategy is the facility which I have called the one stop shop.  The object is to provide a comprehensive service to social <Col N="525" /> welfare clients by bringing together the personnel and agencies involved to meet all the needs of the client quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner at the one location.  The client will have available to him or her current information on their claims, general information on the full range of services available and on the spot means assessments for social assistance schemes, as well as current information on job opportunities, placements and training courses which are available locally.  These facilities have already been successfully piloted and we have identified a number of towns around the country where they could be introduced on a progress basis as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the quality of the service which my Department provide &mdash; and I believe the same principle applies to all other Departments and State agencies having direct dealings with the public &mdash; will be judged on the success we achieve in bringing our services to those who need them in an efficient, caring and dignified way.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to a further measure announced earlier this week which is aimed at continuing the substantial progress made in improving the delivery of services in my Department.  In association with a forum on the delivery of social welfare services which I chaired on last Monday, and which was attended by representatives of the main voluntary organisations involved in the social welfare area, I launched a new pilot scheme in my Department which will involve setting up a series of social welfare viewpoint groups in each of the four main regions of the country.  For the first time members of the public who receive social welfare payments will have a formal opportunity to give direct feedback to management in the Department of Social Welfare on the delivery of the social welfare services. Participants in the project will be able to discuss such topics as their experience of claiming and receiving social welfare payments and the question of access to social welfare information.</P>
    <P>These viewpoint groups are part of our <Col N="526" /> strategy of ensuring that the social welfare services remain in touch with those who are using the service.  The information coming from them will be of great assistance to us.  Without wishing to anticipate the types of issues likely to arise, I have no doubt that the participants in the viewpoint groups will avail of the opportunity to highlight any deficiencies which they perceive in relation to the delivery of social welfare services generally with particular regard to the question of privacy.  In due course, the study will be evaluated to examine the potential for this kind of formal discussion with the public and the format most likely to produce useful feedback.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House of my determination to continue the programme of improvements currently underway at my Department's local offices until all those offices measure up the highest possible standards in the service of the public.  With particular regard to privacy, the necessary levels will be provided at all new offices by virtue of being incorporated at design stage and, as far as possible, in existing offices being extended or refurbished.</P>
    <P>Already 11 new employment exchanges have been built over the last four years and five new ones are planned over the next two years.  In addition, seven employment exchanges have been renovated and five more have restorations planned.  The levels of privacy required are being incorporated in all new offices and as far as physically possible in offices being extended or refurbished. We are spending £3.7 million this year on new employment exchanges and on improving others.  They will all have privacy facilities.  Notwithstanding the current financial difficulties we are investing in improvements of the type sought by Deputies.  The improvement of privacy facilities in all offices will be continued as quickly as possible.  This will involve considerable cost in that structural alterations are necessary and some of the offices will have to be replaced.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to respond to some points made by Deputy Hegarty in <Col N="527" /> the course of his contribution.  Deputy Hegarty claims that social welfare administration costs are far too high.  Let me put him straight on that point.  In 1988 the cost of administering the social welfare services amounted to approximately £125 million which represents 4.8 per cent of total social welfare expenditure in that year.  That proportion has not changed much over the years.  I am sure Deputies will agree that administration costs are not excessive having regard to the extent of the services provided and the fact that the number of people being provided for has increased greatly.  At the same time, I assure the Deputy that every effort is made as part of continuing policy in my Department to keep administration costs to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty also referred to the practice of queueing outside local offices, as did Deputy Boylan and Deputy Higgins. Deputy Higgins told us of long queues on dole days outside offices. There is rarely any need for queueing of that kind.  Each of the 50 employment exchanges around the country operate a timing system whereby applicants attend at a specified time on their signing day. The purpose of this is twofold; to ensure an even distribution of claimants during opening hours and to eliminate, as far as possible, the need for queueing.</P>
    <P>The experience of a number of local offices is that on pay-out days there is a tendency for applicants to form queues outside the premises before opening hours and to attend well in advance of their specified signing times.  This, of course, only serves to hinder the effective operation of the office which depends very much on the co-operation of its claimants.  Officials in the local offices do, however, continue to encourage attendance by applicants at their designated time so as to avoid unnecessary queueing. I appreciate that very often people who are unemployed have somewhere they want to go during the course of the day for one reason or another and, consequently, they will come along at a different or earlier time.  That is one of the factors which leads to this queueing.  Indeed the <Col N="528" /> Deputy mentioned that he sees people queueing in the morning when he is on his way to the Dáil, which fits in exactly with the pattern found by officials where there is a tendency by people to queue and to come before their specified time or even before opening time.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last my colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, recommended to Deputy Mitchell that he visit my Department's new employment exchange in the Nutgrove Shopping Centre and the exchange in Galway to see the type of customer facilities which are being incorporated into new social welfare offices.  I would extend that invitation to all Deputies in the House.  I would be very happy to make arangements for Deputies to come and see the changes and designs which are the current practice in a number of offices throughout the country at this stage.</P>
    <P>Another area where major improvements have taken place is in the public offices of the ESB.  On Tuesday, 2 May, my colleague, the Minister for Energy, officially opened the ESB's most up-to-date customer service centre at their Fleet Street office in Dublin.  This centre, a model for future developments in the company, reflects the ESB's concern for good customer relations.  Its features include tasteful decor and well signposted services, new queueing arrangements which result in a shorter waiting time and a more confidential service, on-line computer systems to respond quickly to customer queries and a special room for more private discussions.  I might say that in modern social welfare offices and exchanges special separate rooms are provided apart from special separate cubicles which allow for private discussions.</P>
    <P>Using the latest customer service technology, the ESB have pioneered a new concept in customer service which reduces the trauma of the personal visit. Customers are no longer faced with the fuss associated with paper intensive systems and masses of files which made the gathering of the information required to clear queries time consuming.  In fact, <Col N="529" /> you could say that all the apparatus of bureaucracy is being dismantled to provide for the customer a greater feeling of privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to set the record straight on a matter which arose during the debate last Wednesday. Deputy Michael Bell expressed concern that social welfare recipients who had difficulties in meeting ESB payments had to explain their position in front of other customers.  While this may have occurred in the past, let me assure the House that it is no longer the case.  The factual position is as stated by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance last Tuesday, that in the company's large offices, a private room is provided near the customer contact area where sensitive matters are dealt with in confidence.  In their smaller offices sensitive matters are attended to in the local supervisor's office.</P>
    <P>There is no need for the type of issue mentioned by Deputy Bell to be discussed at a public counter within earshot of other customers.  As a matter of policy, ESB customers who experience difficulties are treated with sensitivity by the company and all staff in public offices are aware of their responsibilities in providing help and assistance in confidential surroundings.</P>
    <P>All the improvements which have taken place to date in my Department, the ESB and elsewhere around the public service, have been introduced in the absence of any legislative framework. The improvements have taken place primarily because local management in the various Departments and offices have identified deficiencies and have sought as far as possible within available resources to remedy the defects.</P>
    <P>This is not to say, of course, that we should let the matter rest here.  As speakers on this side of the House have already acknowledged, the situation is far from perfect and much remains to be done. Let me assure the House once again that the Government are fully committed to the progressive improvement of facilities where there are real shortcomings within the limitations of available funding.  The social welfare viewpoint groups initiative <Col N="530" /> is but one example of this continuing commitment.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, and Deputy Bell rightly pointed out to the House, it is difficult to legislate for privacy in public offices.  Despite the best efforts of the proposer of the Bill, Deputy Jim Mitchell, to come up with a workable formula, the result has severe limitations and could be unworkable in practice.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies have expressed the view that the attendant costs associated with implementing legislation in this area would not be significant.</P>
    <P>As Minister of a Department with a nationwide network of public offices, I can assure the House that the costs associated with compliance with any such legislation are substantial.  The House should not forget that in addition to the costs of providing physical accommodation, there would also be other costs involved in making and enforcing regulations, deciding on exemptions and staffing an appeals mechanism.  Expenditure of this magnitude is not warranted at present.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on this issue is a reasonable one.  We fully subscribe to the motives which inspired the Bill and to the principle that members of the public should, where necessary, be able to conduct their personal business with Departments and State agencies in a private and confidential way.  Many improvements have already taken place in the office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance, the Health board, the Department of Labour, FAS offices, local authorities, the ESB and social welfare offices &mdash; all areas specifically designated by Deputy Mitchell in his Bill.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate successive Government speakers have applauded the principle underlying this Bill.  We have assured the House of the Government's commitment to improve facilities in public offices where necessary and where funds can be made available.  We recognise that there may be many offices which do not measure up to the high <Col N="531" /> standards of privacy to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the major inhibiting factor in today's circumstances is the availability of resources to enable all desirable improvements to be made. In deference to the views expressed on all sides of the House in the course of this debate and as an earnest of the Government's goodwill in this matter, the Minister for Finance proposes to quantify the full extent of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will shortly initiate a general examination of the needs of all public offices in order to establish the dimensions of the changes which would be required to bring all offices up to a fully acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>The Government are still of the view that Deputy Mitchell's Bill may prove to be unworkable in its present form. However, should the outcome of the study now about to commence suggest a need for legislation to copperfasten privacy standards, the Minister would not wish to rule out the option of Committee Stage amendments to Deputy Mitchell's Bill.  In this connection, I am glad to note the offer made by the Deputy in his introductory speech to consider any reasonable amendments.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Government will not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch de na Teachtaí a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies who participated in the debate on this important Bill.  I am also grateful to the Minister for Social Welfare for his participation and for his confirmation of Government acceptance of the principle of the Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset of this debate I said I would be prepared to accept reasonable amendments on Committee Stage.  That offer still stands.  I should say I have carefully noted the points made by successive speakers.  It would be ungenerous of me not to comment on the fact that <Col N="532" /> the Government sent in two Ministers of State and a member of the Government to participate in the debate which I take to be an indication of the seriousness of their approach to the subject matter.  I feel I should make known my appreciation of that fact.</P>
    <P>The Bill is principally one of exhortation. It gives the Minister for Finance wide powers to define, by regulation, the standard of privacy and confidentiality that should be provided in public offices. That was a deliberate provision in recognition of the fact that public offices, almost by definition, are very diverse, are of all shapes and sizes, sited in very different locations for many different purposes.  It would be unrealistic to set out in detail in a Bill of this nature very strict provisions which might turn out to be impractical.  Nonetheless, it is important that this House, the elected Assembly of the people, should provide by law a right of privacy and confidentiality for our citizens.  We should, by law, at least exhort all public Departments and agencies to make adequate provision for that purpose as far as is reasonably practicable.</P>
    <P>I want to express my gratitude for the interest taken in this Bill not alone by members of the Government but by so many Members of all parties including Independent Members.  Every single speaker welcomed the principle of the Bill.  Indeed everybody who participated in this debate, through their experience in public life, will have encountered several incidents of gross infringement of privacy at public offices when dealing with constituents. Every Member of this House, every member of a local authority, will have felt a bell ringing in their ears on reading the contents of this Bill because they will know instinctively, from their experience, that its provisions are correct. They will know also that it is a matter that should have been addressed long ago.  Many of the reservations expressed about the Bill had to do with the cost of meetings its requirements.  At the end of the day I do not honestly believe the cost would be huge; rather it might well be minimal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I think it right that we should have Committee Stage when the Minister for Finance has conducted the investigation the Minister for Social Welfare has just announced, that is the investigation of public offices and the extent of problems obtaining in them throughout the country.  I very much welcome the announcement of that investigation.  In the pre-Christmas session I hope we will be able to have Committee Stage and have before us a report from the Minister for Finance of the actual extent of the problem and the costs involved in putting it right nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare made the point that the ESB had already responded to the exhortation implicit in the provisions of the Bill which, remember, has been published for almost a year. The ESB have already taken steps in their main offices to provide private rooms suitable for the type of confidential, personal, private interviews described in the Bill.  They have taken that initiative before enactment of the Bill on which I warmly congratulate them.  However, it would be a mistake to think that those facilities are in place in every ESB office. But we must welcome the progress made and urge them to ensure that the same privacy facilities are made available in all of their offices.  If the ESB can do it so can the local authorities and so can the employment exchanges without incurring enormous costs.</P>
    <P>While the study promised by the Minister for Finance is being conducted over the summer months I would hope that the Government would appeal to all public Departments, all local authorities, all health boards and all other relevant public agencies to take all possible steps within their budgetary constraints to meet the principles laid down in the Bill which have enjoyed the unanimous support of all sides of the House.  That need not await the passage of this Bill nor indeed the study offered by the Minister for Finance which I applaud and welcome. That would be a very reasonable and appropriate response to my initiative in having introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>Almost every contribution to this <Col N="534" /> debate was worth while.  I was very interested to hear some although I could not be present for all of the debate.  Those for which I was not present I have read in the Official Report with a great deal of interest.  Many Members made the point that many of our public offices are of a design, age and condition which seem almost to be calculated to degrade and denigrate those who must use them frequently. Certainly that was true of the Dublin Corporation offices in Jervis Street, now thankfully closed.  They were seedy, filthy, degrading offices.  Whatever was one's opinion about the building of the new civic offices on the site of Wood Quay, whatever was one's opinion of the outward design of those buildings, anybody who had frequent cause to use the old offices in Jervis Street could only applaud the fact that some new offices were being provided.</P>
    <P>Those new offices are loud testimony to the fact that new offices, <i>per se</i>, will not solve the problem which this Bill seeks to redress.  In those public offices the waiting areas and the interview areas in general &mdash; there are one or two exceptions &mdash; seem to be designed to make sure that there is an audience for every private and confidential interview.  It is as if they were designing a new Gaiety Theatre.  It is a fact that if you go to the rent collection supervisors' section of Dublin Corporation &mdash; and you have a problem about rent arrears, as that is the only reason one would go there &mdash; you will sit at a hatch in front of a glass screen, which is there for security purposes, but the presence of which requires that you raise your voice so that you can be heard behind that screen.  But two feet away is the first row of seats where people can watch straight in to the interview; it is as if it was being televised publicly.  It is humiliating.  They are new offices.  The double embarrassment &mdash; as I said in my opening speech &mdash; is that before you got to that hatch you had gone through the same experience listening to other people explaining why they had rent arrears.</P>
    <P>Most Members of this House will know that where there are significant rent arrears there are usually complex social <Col N="535" /> problems to explain what is causing the arrears.  The citizen visiting the rent collection supervisor has to explain to him in front of an audience the complex social problem of his or her family and how they have got into this difficult problem.</P>
    <P>New offices will not of themselves solve this problem.  What we need is new thinking, people to be alert and to be sensitive to the rights of citizens, especially when they have problems.  In the case of the Dublin civic offices one would think &mdash; and I say this with great regret as a former Lord Mayor of the City &mdash; that the offices were designed with one purpose in mind, that of humiliating and embarrassing citizens with problems. New thinking is what is required and that does not cost money.  That is why I would ask the Minister for Finance who is also the Minister for the Public Service and through him other Ministers, particularly the Ministers for the Environment, Social Welfare and Health, who between them are responsible for local authority offices, health board offices, labour exchanges and social welfare offices, to take the initiative now to write to all Principal Officers of their Departments or agencies asking them to be sensitive and to see if, without any further ado, they can improve the arrangements for interviews of a private, personal or confidential nature. All it would cost would be the price of the stamp on the letter to be sent to those officials.  I have no doubt that by being so alerted and being so exhorted the improvement that could be brought aboutwould mean a great step forward and there would not be any significant cost worth talking about.</P>
    <P>As I said when introducing this Bill, most of this problem arises not out of callousness or indifference or contempt &mdash; even though some people have that impression &mdash; but out of thoughtlessness. What we need is to show all the public officials, in the relevant Departments, that this House unanimously urges them to think afresh, to think sensibly about the provision for interviews of this kind <Col N="536" /> and to take a leaf out of the book of the ESB who have not awaited legislation, or the passing of this legislation, but acted following the publication of this Bill some years ago.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution Deputy Roche who, as the House will know, has a certain expertise in social research, highlighted the fact &mdash; among other very valuable points &mdash; that if people are to be treated to low level, seedy, badly lit, badly decorated public offices, that in itself causes a reaction.  It immediately is taken to imply contempt, indifference, and it elicits from many such people not only depression but anger and reciprocated contempt.  Many industrial psychologists have recommended to employers who have had persistent industrial relations problems that frequently the source of these problems is the degree of brightness and freshness provided in the accommodation for their employees.  A similar case can be made for those who use public offices.  This requires thought rather than a lot of money.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the reaction of Deputy Bell.  He is a Socialist Member of this House.  He is a person for whom I have great respect, but in his opening remarks on this Bill he made the point that there was no need for legislation. He did not think that the time of the House should be wasted on legislation of such little importance.  He went on to speak very eloquently for about 20 minutes, describing his own experiences and he gave an account of the position in his own constituency and, in particular, in the town of Drogheda where he resides.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Bell changed his mind in the course of his contribution. Certainly, the opening paragraphsthe importance of this subject and saying that it was not a subject worthy of legislation are at odds with everything he said subsequently.  I do not know if the explanation for that is electoral jitters in the Labour Party.  That is one possible explanation.  I prefer to believe that Deputy Bell and his constituents want to put right all the ills which he so well expressed in the rest of <Col N="537" /> his contribution last week.  I would also bet that most of his constituents would agree that it would not be good enough just to leave it, in the hope that public officials and public Departments would, in their own good time, make such provisions without legislation but rather that legislation is required, even if the time scale for its implementation would be a little more extended than we would like.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of this debate that I did not consider that this Bill was of a party-political nature and that the problem which this Bill seeks to remedy would be commonly acknowledged by all sides of this House; so it has turned out to be. We would be doing a very good year's work if, by the end of this year, we could have this legislation in place.  I do not pretend that the legislation is perfectly drafted, or that as drafted it might not lead to some problems.  I am perfectly ready to accept that that may be the case. Indeed, when I was Minister I always approached legislation in that context. Our purpose in laying down five Stages of a Bill in this and the other House is to enable Parliament to improve the law. Too frequently, Bills are rushed through this House with inadequate consideration and too frequently Bills are brought before the House &mdash; by all Governments &mdash; where the Minister is not prepared to change one dot or comma because his Bill is right.  In recent years there has been a better approach.  I remember one very extensive Bill which I brought before the House and on which I accepted 30 amendments.  I was criticised for so doing.  It was taken as a sign that the Minister had come in ill-prepared and that the Bill was hastily cobbled together, criticism which was unworthy.  The very purpose of bringing Bills through five Stages of Parliament is to improve them, to spot the defect, to refine them.  It is in that spirit that I have brought this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge that Committee Stage of this Bill will not take place in this session but I do hope that we will be in a position to take Committee Stage in the very early weeks of the next session, by which time the Minister for Finance's <Col N="538" /> report, which he has undertaken to seek on the general condition of public offices, will be available.</P>
    <P>It would be a nice Christmas present for those on the unemployment queues, those old age pensioners who have to queue at social welfare offices, those who have rent arrears or tax problems, that in future years they will be guaranteed privacy and courtesy at public offices.  If we can do that before the end of this year, it will be a very nice present from all sides of the House to our citizens for the nineties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to thank the Deputies who took part in the debate for their contributions.  Certainly, some of the points made will be taken into account on Committee Stage.  I want to thank the Government for facilitating the passage of the Second Stage of this Private Members' Bill.  It is only the third Private Members' Bill in recent history to get past Second Stage, all of them in this session.  That in itself is testimony to the continuing efficacy of the Tallaght strategy.  Long may it continue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Television Distribution Systems.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle and also the Leas-Cheann Comhairle through his good offices for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  Many of us on this side of the House have been more than a little unhappy with the way in which the Minister has approached the whole issue of an alternative distribution system for television.  He took applications for MMDS licensing long before he specified regulations under which licences would be issued.  We are told that he has at this stage already processed those applications. It seems very strange to be setting the rules of the race when the race is effectively over, which is what is involved here.  He has also pushed ahead with this proposal for MMDS without any proper assessment.  He promised here in the Estimate debate last year &mdash; and I have <Col N="539" /> that debate in front of me &mdash; that he would provide a detailed assessment of the various points.  He said he would put together a properly documented case answering the different points.  The points raised at that time, sadly, were not answered in his subsequent PR book &mdash; which is really what it was &mdash; for the MMDS system.  He did not look at the alternatives, which was the basic request of people on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>He also took the powers to close down deflectors last December.  Luckily we succeeded on this side of the House in getting him to change his mind and not go ahead with that proposal.  It would effectively have meant that people in the west and south-west would have had no television options from channels other than the national RTE stations for the last six months and, prospectively, would not have them for the remaining six months.</P>
      <P>Next Tuesday, the Rubicon will have been crossed by the Minister in so far as the 21 days will have elapsed for these regulations to come into place.  There has not been any proper regard whatsoever for the rights of people living in rural areas to have choice in this respect.  The Minister seems intent on going ahead without the proper public analysis of the issues.  The system will be extraordinarily costly.  Current estimates put it at £300 per household and it will be aimed at the whole of the non-urban cabled areas. That will work out at a cumulative cost to the public of around £200 million.  If that were being undertaken by the State as a straightforward investment, we would have had reams of analyses of options.  Department of Finance Circular 1/83 applied to this major investment proposal, but we have not had that, and the critical questions have been fudged by the Minister in the regulations that have been published and the whole lead up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still do not know what the MMDS will cost, whether the MMDS will guarantee service in remoter parts of the licensed areas or why there is any need for MMDS to be given a monopoly by banning the existing systems that provide <Col N="540" /> service at a quarter of the cost in these areas.  We still do not know what analysis the Minister did of an alternative, cheaper way of distributing the third channel he has available.  The regulations gave absolutely no reassurance to the public on the critical questions of cost and availability.  The regulations leave it to the operator to decide what charges he will make.  Admittedly, the Minister takes unto himself the power at some later date to investigate those charges, but effectively the public are being asked to buy a pig in a poke in this area.  They do not know at this stage the likely outlook on charges.  The Minister is not taking unto himself the price control function he operates, for example, in relation to cable services.  Instead it is the operators who are to decide the charges.  There is considerable public controversy and debate about what level those charges will be at, but the Minister is not taking steps to reassure the public in this area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there is considerable concern about whether the licensees, the MMDS, will be able to serve the whole of their licensed territory.  The Minister again does not take powers to ensure that the service will be available in the entire territory to be licensed.  He has power to specify a percentage that should be covered, but he has not detailed any such percentage.  The rumour that has been put about by some people, admittedly opponents of the system, is that it will achieve only 70 per cent cover.  That would mean that very large tracts of territory and very large numbers of subscribers would be left without any alternative, even though they now have one.  The public have a right to specific answers in this area before we are locked into the system the Minister is putting forward.</P>
    <P>On the question of distributing a third channel, I am convinced that our allocation of international frequencies on the UHF network has ample capacity for the Minister to distribute the third channel on UHF.  I do not think the Minister has given sufficient consideration to the option of adapting RTE's transmission <Col N="541" /> system to distribute a third channel.  It seems certain that would be immensely cheaper than a system potentially costing £200 million, namely the MMDS system, although, of course, it brings more than simply the third channel, but the Minister himself took the RTE option for the distribution of Centuary, the radio network. As the Minister knows, RTE's network took 25 years to achieve national cover. It would be much more sensible for RTE to distribute this channel rather than to put in place a whole new system, one we hope will not take 25 years to achieve national cover, but there is considerable uncertainty about its ability to get the sort of cover people deserve if they are to lose any alternative.  The recent indication that the Government are considering UHF for Gaeltacht TV underlines the fact that there was an alternative for distributing the third channel which does not appear to have been properly explored.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out to me, these are enabling regulations.  The MMDS is not the only system that could be licensed by the Minister under this system.  There is a very strong argument for the Minister looking at the possibility of licensing, not just MMDS, but UHF transmission systems as well.  The Minister will recall that the cable system in use in the urban areas achieved its dominance under a system of competition and that was against opposition that was totally free in that people had off air service from their areas with no charge.  All I am suggesting in regard to a system of dual licensing is that the MMDS would be competing with a service that is charging already.  There seems to be ample justification for allowing a system of competition in this area. The Minister has advocated and has gone out of his way to promote competition in many other sections of the economy but he seems to have something of a blind spot here in that the MMDS, as is suggested, will now be established as a monopoly with no alternatives.  If MMDS has the superior quality and service it is suggested it has, it can well face the competition and emerge victorious in the way the cable networks have done against <Col N="542" /> competition.  The Minister should look again at this.  He will recall that it was he who insisted on the principle in cabled areas that no householder should have to pay for extra channels unless he had the option of opting out and not paying.  In the rural areas the Minister seems to have turned that on its head and is saying to people there that householders will have to pay for the extra channels and not be given the option of not wanting those channels.  It seems there is one rule for the urban dweller and a different one for the rural areas. The Minister would see the sense of this if the people concerned were in Swords and not in the west.  It would be brought home to the Minister, as it has been brought home to many TDs, what the implication is of taking out a cheap and efficient system and replacing it with a dear and unproven one.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to use these regulations to flexibly license alternative systems in competition.  I ask him also to provide the public with information about the efficient alternatives.  I do not feel that the booklet he produced, which is a PR effort, was the sort of economic analysis that would pass the Department of Finance's muster.  We are talking about large scale investment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to take the opportunity once again to assure the House and the general public that in relation to the systems at present in operation there will be no interference with the deflectors pending the MMDS network being in place.  I do not want any suggestion that this debate will in some way bring about any action in relation to the illegal operators whereby these deflectors will remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to start tonight by referring to a press release issued on 15 March 1987 by my predecessor, Deputy Jim Mitchell. In his statement Deputy Mitchell announced the adoption of MMDS in Ireland as the only feasible option to increase the range of television viewing in areas not served by cable, and went on to explain why UHF rebroadcasting <Col N="543" /> could not be allowed.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Mitchell on his foresight on this matter.</P>
    <P>Ever since coming into power, this Government have been concerned with increasing the range of legitimate viewing in rural areas.  After examining the issues this Government decided to adopt MMDS and I have moved with all speed to create the right legislative and regulatory environment for the establishment of the system.  I intend to issue licences very shortly.</P>
    <P>Now I am aware that the proposed introduction of this system has, in publicity terms at least, met with some degree of controversy.  Let me address some of the points that have been raised.</P>
    <P>First why go for MMDS as against the apparently cheaper illegal rebroadcasting systems which operate on UHF frequencies? There is a presumption in this question that we, as a country, have unfettered access to the complete UHF broadcasting spectrum.  This, of course, is a fallacy.  Use of the frequency is governed by international treaties and convention &mdash; all of which are necessary to ensure the co-existence of radio communications at international level.  The fact is that we are entitled to use only certain frequencies from that spectrum &mdash; and then only at certain powers and in certain locations &mdash; sufficient in a green field situation of providing something approximating to four national networks at about 70-80 per cent penetration.</P>
    <P>We are not, of course, in a green field situation.  RTE already uses portions of the UHF spectrum both for main transmitters and transposers and will have the short, medium term and long term requirements for the future.  Likewise, we are very much circumscribed with respect to UK television services, all of which operate on UHF frequencies.  If we want to receive UK signals in this country we cannot use the frequencies they operate on if we are to avoid interfering with them.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must always keep a quantum of UHF spectrum in reserve for future requirements.  This is, after all, the <Col N="544" /> only available spectrum for any future terrestrial television broadcasting needs in this country until at least well into the next century.  For instance, if we did not go for MMDS the proposed new TV channel would eat up a significant amount of UHF spectrum.  Let us suppose again that it is decided to have an Irish language television service.  It will have to operate on the limited UHF spectrum.  An immediate demand which will be made on this part of the spectrum is the provision of a studio to transmitter links for local radio stations.  I have recently decided to allow local radio stations to operate such links and that the best place for them is the UHF broadcast band.</P>
    <P>When all of these constraints are taken into account the amount of spectrum that is left to provide a nationwide &mdash; and I stress nationwide &mdash; retransmission system is not very significant and would not provide anything approaching the choice available on cable.  It is clear that to allow the rebroadcasting of UK television signals in the UHF as opposed to MMDS is to condemn those areas which cannot be served by cable to a very limited choice of viewing for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>An additional factor in this equation is that existing illegal rebroadcasting systems have been set up in an <i>ad hoc</i> unplanned fashion and do not constitute anything approaching a nationwide system.  Their configuration is such that even if we wanted to we could not legalise them.</P>
    <P>One other argument which has been put forward is that the increased use of satellite broadcasting will make a wide choice of viewing available to all at very little cost, thus making MMDS obsolete. This argument has no foundation in reality.</P>
    <P>Those are the negative aspects of the matter.  On the positive side, the Government have recognised that the demand represented by these illegal systems was legitimate.  The public wanted choice. Accordingly they set about finding a means to respond to that demand and MMDS is the result.  My philosophy in this matter is that the people in rural Ireland are entitled to the same number <Col N="545" /> and range of channels as somebody living in the centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it operates on proven technology. The fact is that the technology has been in use since the sixties even if for another purpose &mdash; that is instructional television &mdash; and now carries the normal range of stations in the United States.  It has, like all communications technologies, evolved and developed since then in terms of sophistication.  Secondly, it operates in a part of the radio frequency spectrum which causes no difficulties either domestically or internationally. Thirdly, there is a reasonable quantum of spectrum available, sufficient to provide up to 11 channels per transmitter on a nationwide basis.  And, as time goes by, it will be easier to augment this spectrum with additional channels.</P>
    <P>Yes, there is a cost factor associated with this.  The technology is more expensive than that in use in the illegal system, although this needs some qualification. First, if one is to judge by the equipment seized by the Department of Communications in their various raids, the kind of equipment in use on rebroadcasting systems would never be tolerated in a regulated environment.  When this is added to the fact that in a regulated environment licence fees would be payable, as would taxes such as VAT &mdash; and I am making no judgments about whether illegal rebroadcasters are paying VAT &mdash; perhaps the price differential between UHF rebroadcasting and MMDS might not be as great as is sometimes claimed.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the claimed differential between the cost of illegal systems and MMDS is somewhat of a myth.  The comparisons that are made relate usually to the lowest cost illegal systems known &mdash; the £25 per annum voluntary subscription situation.  First, my Department have accumulated data relating to the annual charges for illegal systems and I can assure you that many of those charges are considerably higher than £25 per annum. One must also ask how much have the subscribers paid in a capital charge for their conventional UHF aerial plus, where it applies, their decorder, and all <Col N="546" /> this for an unpredictable three, or if lucky, four channels.</P>
    <P>The other concern that is raised about MMDS is the extent of coverage it will give.  Line of sight between transmitter and receiver is important at the frequencies MMDS operates on.  One would think indeed that the same considerations did not apply at UHF frequencies.  The fact is that great care has been taken in the frequency planning for MMDS to make maximum use of terrain to achieve maximum coverage.  There will be shadow areas which the main transmitter in each cell will not cover, but in-fill transposers combined with the use of cable will take care of the majority of these.</P>
    <P>Let us put it in the RTE context.  It has taken RTE over 25 years to achieve 98 per cent coverage and they have been operating primarily in the VHF band which has better propagation characteristics than either UHF or MMDS.</P>
    <P>I am aware that over recent weeks some of those seeking MMDS operating licences have been carrying out tests on MMDS equipment.  Unfortunately due to pressure of work, I have not been able to attend any demonstrations or tests personally but the reports coming in are very encouraging indeed, with the transmission exceeding expectations in terms of quality of signal and reception at distances from the transmitter and, for the doubting Thomases among you, even when the reception antennae are located behind leafy trees and block walls.  I am sure if any Deputies wish to see any demonstrations, this can be arranged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The final negative element which has been raised about MMDS is the environmental/health concern. I would not for a moment contest the legitimacy of anyone to seek reassurance on an issue like this.  However, I am quite certain that some persons who have tried to make an issue of this matter have done so on a &ldquo;red herring&rdquo; basis.  I must say that to date I have not seen one such <Col N="547" /> allegation which has had any substantial backing.</P>
      <P>This is an area which has been carefully assessed by my Department.  When the public in general hear references to &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; they immediately become concerned and think in terms of nuclear type or ionizing radiation.  Radio frequency radiation is a form of non-ionising radiation. Other forms of non-ionising radiation include ordinary light and heat.  It is entirely different from, and does not have the same mode of action or biological effects as, ionizing radiation.</P>
      <P>There are international standards established with respect to safety limits of exposure to radio communication energy of all types.  With respect to the limits which exist for MMDS frequencies, the fact of the matter is that the electromagnetic energy from the MMDS transmitters proposed under our plan will be significantly below the recommended safety limits so as not to be a matter of any concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines to which MMDS operators will have to adhere are laid down by <Col N="548" /> the International Non-Ionising Radiation Committee of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) in co-operation with the World Health Organisation, which in turn is funded by the United Nations.  In establishing the guidelines the IRPA based their limits on scientific data and no consideration was given to economic impact or other nonscientific priorities.  The IRPA also took into account that the general public may be unwilling to take any risks, however slight, associated with exposure to radio frequency radiation.</P>
    <P>Finally, if there are still some sceptics about MMDS who are unwilling to accept that we have the competence here to reach a conclusion that MMDS will provide a reliable high quality retransmission service in this country, could I suggest that they obtain a copy of the consultancy study on MMDS, or MCDS as they call it, carried out by Touche Ross for the UK's Department of Trade and Industry and the Home Office.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 May 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 44 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering in some detail draft general schemes of Bills to amend the Vocational Education Acts, 1930-1970.  I have already indicated my general intentions in relation to enabling VEC colleges to expand and enhance the scope of their operations.  The Deputies will appreciate, however, that it would not be appropriate for me to indicate the specific provisions I propose to introduce in advance of bringing the legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>I am aiming to introduce the legislation as soon as possible &mdash; possibly later this year but this is, of course, contingent on the time span required to consider the proposals at present before me and on the parliamentary time table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clearly indicated to schools in the introductory circulars that the new junior cycle syllabuses were to be implemented within existing resources allocations.  The new syllabuses do not represent so radical a departure from the existing syllabuses as to necessitate the provision of a vast array of new equipment and materials.  The main thrust of the new syllabuses is in approach and methodology rather than on content. Hence, the provision by the Department of additional funds was directed towards the in-service training of teachers who would be called upon to implement the syllabuses.  The overall in-service training allocation for 1989 is £698,000 compared with £311,000 in 1988, an increase of 124 per cent.</P>
      <P>The inventory of materials submitted by the Athy school is quite unrealistic and would seem to imply that the existing syllabuses were being taught there without any equipment or materials.  It is a matter for the school management authorities to prioritise their budget spending in accordance with perceived needs.</P>

    <P>These are the figures published by the CSO.  The traditional distinction between feed and malting barley was based on contracts with maltsters.  In recent years, with the development of varieties which can be used for feed or malting purposes, the distinction is not as clear cut as previously.</P>
    <P>My Department's estimates for area under malting barley, including malting barley contracted for export, for years 1986-88 with projections for 1989 are as follows:</P>

      <P>The person named has, in fact, been overpaid by some £28 under the 1988 disadvantaged areas schemes and it is intended to recover this small overpayment from cattle or sheep grants due to him for 1989.  The overpayment arose because of his high stocking rate. His claim for livestock headage grants exceeded the allowable limits of £30.66 per acre of the forage area devoted to grazing beef cows and sheep and £18.21 per acre of the forage area devoted to grazing cattle other than beef cows.</P>

      <P>The person concerned informed the employment exchange that his wife was employed.  Following investigation of his changed circumstances he was assessed with means of £91.49 per week from 25 January 1989 derived from the benefit of his spouse's earnings.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the means assessed against him on 14 February 1989. An appeals officer, on 21 March 1989, reduced the means assessed against him to £90 per week from 25 January 1989. As his wife is working and earning over £50 per week he is not entitled to an adult dependant allowance in respect of her and is also only entitled to half the appropriate child dependant allowances.  The means assessed are halved and deducted from the maximum appropriate weekly rate of £50.90 payable.  This leaves him entitled to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £5.90.</P>
      <P>This case is not affected by section 12 (4) of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was the subject of the Supreme Court decision referred to.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 30 September 1986 to 18 February 1988.  Payment was disallowed from 19 February 1988 following examination by a medical referee who <Col N="420" /> expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>As she was dissatisfied with the decision she was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. The case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>The person concerned continued to submit medical evidence.  On 11 January 1989 a further medical examination to assess her entitlement to disability benefit found her capable of work.  As she is still submitting medical certificates of incapacity, arrangements are being made to have her examined again as soon as possible by a different medical referee.  In the event of her being dissatisfied with the results of this forthcoming examination, she will be notified of her right to submit a further appeal for submission to an appeals officer.</P>

Pension was awarded last month.  The pension book issued with pension orders from 3 March and the arrears due of £313.35 were paid on 2 May.</P>
      <P>The Department have recently been notified that the person concerned has now ceased employment, and wishes to have his means reassesed.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health, in view of the present crisis <Col N="426" /> level in the area of residential care of children which has worsened as a result of the increase in the adolescent population in residential care as a result of sexual abuse, physical violence, suicide attempts and drug abuse, if he will allocate additional funds to provide more resouces and staffing levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the particular needs of adolescents in terms of residential care. The adequacy of residential services for all children at risk is currently being reviewed by the health boards in consultation with my Department in the light of the Child Care Bill, 1988, which is before the Dáil.  The Bill will impose new responsibilities on health boards in respect of children up to 18 years of age, which will involve boards in the re-organisation and redefinition of services to meet the needs of adolescents in particular.</P>
      <P>In advance of the enactment of the Bill the Government last year made a special allocation of £4 million available from the national lottery surplus to the Minister of State for Youth Affairs at the Department of Education for major new developments for disadvantaged youth particularly at risk such as the young homeless, young travellers and substance abusers.  Almost £1 million of that allocation is being used to expand and develop residential services for adolescents provided, by voluntary agencies under the aegis of the health boards.</P>

      <P>The level and type of services, including medical and surgical services, at Roscommon Hospital is primarily a matter for the Western Health Board and I have no indication from the board that it intends to change the current level of service.  Accordingly, the transfer of the consultant surgeon or consultant physician does not arise.

My Department has indicated to the health board its agreement to an application being made by the board to Comhairle na nOspidéal for the replacement of this post in due course.</P>
